      "abstract": "<jats:p>In manufacturing company, quality of product could become their competitive advantage to compete in the market. To achieve good quality of products and activities, company need to have system or strategy to manage their supply chain activity and make it more effective and efficient flow of production and improve the quality of information sharing, production time, and products, so the company can improve their performance. This study conducted to find out the mediating effect of supply chain quality integration on supply chain management practices to achieve performance. Researcher was using PLS Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to analyze data. The sample of this research was consumer goods manufacturing in Indonesia and using primary data with questionnaire as data collection method. After analysis using PLS-SEM, researcher was found that supply chain management practices affect operational performance; and supply chain quality integration has mediating effect on the effect of supply chain management practices on operational performance of company.</jats:p>"

We analyze the supply chain risk management literature to find that both buffering and bridging strategies contribute to supply chain risk management. We also address the benefit of supply chain risk management. Results indicate that supply chain risk management provides a strong contribution to overall firm performance. Additionally, we identify cultural differences of these relationships. Although supply chain risk management strategies may be applied universally, their efficacy varies by culture.

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<p>Many housing policies aim to increase supply and reduce prices through rezoning, relying on the assumption that increasing allowable densities automatically accelerates the rate of housing supply. However, the existence of landbanking (land hoarding), where land able to be profitably developed for housing is withheld from the market in anticipation of future gains, undermines the logic of such policy changes.We expose major limits of the static housing supply model behind these policies by looking at the degree to which landbanking behaviour is consistent with model predictions. To do this, we assemble a new dataset of home sales and landbanks from the annual reports of Australia’s top eight publicly-listed residential developers from 2001 to 2018 and use complete state-level planning approvals and lot production data in Queensland, Australia.In contrast to the static model prediction that landbanks serve the function of inventories, and are hence minimised, we find that (1) over 200,000 housing lots, or 13 years of new supply, are held by the eight largest housing development companies, and eight years of these landbanks are held in housing subdivisions that are approved and already for sale, that (2) the amount of zoned supply in a region is unrelated to the rate of new housing supply, and that (3) housing developers routinely delay housing production to capitalise on market cycles. Dynamic incentives to maximise total returns, including capital gains in the option value of undeveloped land, could be related to observed behaviour.</p>"

The current literature is scattered and fragmented with studies reporting mixed empirical evidence for a variety of concepts related to “Early Supplier Involvement.” We conduct a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the existing literature to reconcile conflicted findings, revise and refine theoretical perspectives, and provide evidence‐based scholarly and practical implications. To achieve these aims, we unravel the general relationship by considering three factors. First, we delineate different types of performance outcomes, mainly related to NPD efficiency (e.g., speed) and NPD effectiveness (e.g., product quality). Second, we distinguish between the moment and the extent of supplier involvement, related to different theoretical perspectives on external knowledge integration. Third, we disentangle multiple levels of analysis that are seemingly obscured in the literature, specifically the project and organizational levels. We find that extensive supplier involvement has positive effects on NPD efficiency and effectiveness, whereas earlier supplier involvement only to some degree affects NPD efficiency and not effectiveness. In conclusion, our meta‐analysis based on 11,420 observations from 51 studies provides strong theoretical and practical insights on the important phenomenon of supplier involvement.</jats:p>",

In order to enhance the performance of the model in feature extraction and identification and improve prediction accuracy, a parallel LSTM tandem DNN deep neural network model (PLDNN) is proposed.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Neuronal densities vary enormously across sites within a brain. Does the density of the capillary bed accompany the presumably larger energy requirement of sites with more neurons, or with larger neurons, or is energy supply constrained by a mostly homogeneous capillary bed? Here we find evidence for the latter across various sites in the mouse brain and show that as a result, the ratio of capillary cells per neuron, and thus presumably blood and energy supply per neuron, decreases uniformly with increasing neuronal density and therefore smaller average neuronal size across sites. Additionally, we find that local capillary density is also not correlated with local synapse densities, although there is a small but significant correlation between lower neuronal density (and therefore larger neuronal size) and more synapses per neuron within the restricted range of 6,500-9,500 across cortical sites. Further, local variations in the glial/neuron ratio are also not correlated with local variations in number of synapses per neuron or local synaptic densities. These findings suggest that it is not that larger neurons, neurons with more synapses, or even sites with more synapses<jats:italic>demand</jats:italic>more energy, but simply that larger (and thus fewer) neurons have more energy available per cell, and to its synapses as a whole, than smaller (and thus more numerous) neurons due to competition for limited resources supplied by a capillary bed of fairly homogeneous density throughout the brain.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance Statement</jats:title><jats:p>The brain is an expensive organ and at rest already uses nearly as much energy as during sensory activation. To ultimately determine whether the high energy cost of the brain is driven by an unusually high energy demand by neurons or constrained by capillary density in the organ, we examine whether sites in the mouse brain with more neurons, larger neurons, or more synapses have more capillary supply, and find instead that capillary density is mostly homogeneous across brain structures. We propose that neurons are constrained to using what energy is available, with little evidence for adjustments according to local demand, which explains its high risk of ischemia and vulnerability to states of compromised metabolism, including normal aging.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

This paper analyzes the role of seaports in the greening of supply chains in two ways. First, the fields of action to pursue GSCM objectives in ports are identified and grouped. The proposed typology includes five groups of actions, i.e., green shipping; green port development and operations; green inland logistics; seaports and the circular economy; and, actions in the field of knowledge development and information sharing. In the empirical part of the paper, this typology is used to analyze green actions and initiatives developed by market players and port authorities in the Rhine–Scheldt Delta, the leading European port region in cargo throughput terms. This structured overview of green actions and initiatives shows that these ports are hotbeds for GSCM initiatives, but progress in some areas remains slows. The second part of the analysis focuses on the attitudes and perceptions of port-related actors towards the greening of port-related supply chains. A large-scale survey conducted in the Belgian and Dutch logistics and port industry reveals that greening has been put massively on the agenda by the firms between 2010 and now. The results give a clear view on the diverse drivers and impediments towards the greening of supply chains. In addition, one can still see a gap between words and actions. The survey further points to the role of governments as catalysts or soft enforcers for change, and calls for continuity and coherence in government policy. This paper is the first study providing a comprehensive analysis on initiatives, approaches, and perspectives of port-related actors in a specific multi-port region.</jats:p>"

In line with the main objective, this study addressed, (1) pinpointing problems of existing water supply versus demand deficit (2) evaluating the hydraulic performance of water distribution system using water GEMS and (3) recommended alternative methods for improving water demand scenarios. The University&amp;rsquo;s water supply distribution network layout was a looped system and the flow of water derived by both gravity and pressurized system. The gravity flow served for the academic and administrative staffs whereas the pressurized system of the network fed the students dormitories, cafeteria&amp;rsquo;s etc. The study revealed the existence of unmet minimum pressure requirement around the student dormitories which accounts 25.64% below the country&amp;rsquo;s building code standard during the peak hour consumption. The result of the water demand projection showed an increment of 2.5 liter per capita demand (LPCD) in every five years. Hence, first, the university&amp;rsquo;s water demand was projected and then hydraulic parameters such as; pressure, head loss and velocity were modeled for both the existing and the improved water supply distribution. The finding of the study was recommended to the university&amp;rsquo;s water supply project and institutional development offices for its future modification and rehabilitation works.</jats:p>"

Dalam pembuatan rangkaian power suplai DC, dibutuhkan komponen elektronika yang terdiri dari transformator, rectifier, filetering dan IC sebagai regulator tegangan. Agar menghasilkan tegangan yang konstan, digunakan IC dengan series 78XX, dan untuk menghasilkan tegangan variabel digunakan IC LM338. Mikrokontroller digunakan sebagai pengubah nilai analog keluaran power suplai DC menjadi digital yang dapat ditampilkan di LCD. Untuk pembacaan arus, tegangan dan daya dibutuhkan sensor yang berfungsi sebagai pendeteksi sinyal yang dapat ditampilkan di LCD, sensor yang digunakan pada power suplai DC yaitu sensor arus ACS712, dan sensor tegangan dengan metode pembagi tegangan. Dari hasil pengujian, power suplai DC dapat menghasilkan tegangan konstan tanpa beban sebesar 4,96 volt dan l2 volt dan tegangan variabel 1,25 - 22,88 volt pada saat kondisi beban nol, sedangkan pada saat semua keluaran berbeban, power suplai DC mengalami drop tegangan sebesar 9,54 volt untuk keluaran konstan 12 volt dan 17,32 volt untuk keluaran variabel.

This article systematically explores the barriers LSCM organizations experience in employing supply chain analytics that contribute to such reluctance and unachieved returns and measures to overcome these barriers. This article therefore aims to systemize the barriers and measures and allocate measures to barriers in order to provide organizations with directions on how to cope with their individual barriers. By using Grounded Theory through 12 in-depth interviews and Q-Methodology to synthesize the intended results, this article derives core categories for the barriers and measures, and their impacts and relationships are mapped based on empirical evidence from various actors along the supply chain. Resultingly, the article presents the core categories of barriers and measures, including their effect on different phases of the analytics solutions life cycle, the explanation of these effects, and accompanying examples. Finally, to address the intended aim of providing directions to organizations, the article provides recommendations for overcoming the identified barriers in organizations.</jats:p>"

The lean concept aims to reduce costs and to increase the effectiveness of the supply chain. While the green concept tries to ensure that the ongoing process keeps bringing good effect on the environment. In designing the performance measurement of the sustainable supply chain through the lean &amp; green supply chain management approach, this study includes a formulation for Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and grouping of the lean and green indicators which are integrated with the balanced scorecard (BSC) perspectives. It obtained 28 KPIs which consists of 15 lean supply chain KPIs and 13 green supply chain KPIs. Based on overall weighting, the highest priority KPI is the company’s total revenue and total operating costs, followed by the total cost of the supply chain (all of them are from a financial perspective). The weights of three KPIs are 0.103, 0.078 and 0.072 respectively.</jats:p>",

This article evaluates the link between corruption monitoring and the supply of politicians in nondemocracies. Using China as a case, I show that corruption monitoring pushes capable young elites away from seeking government positions. This effect may be driven by two possible mechanisms: economic returns and career prospects. Specifically, corruption investigations may reduce the expected economic returns for government officials, undermining capable young elite’ willingness and efforts to become government officials. In addition, corruption investigations may indicate that there are potential uncertainties and risks involved when taking on a political career, which reduce capable young elites’ desire to pursue a political career. The empirical analysis confirms these two mechanisms and provides unique evidence for the unintended negative impact of corruption monitoring institutions.</jats:p>",

The paper aims to find out the impact of rice import tariff policies on rice demand and supply in Indonesia. The research uses time series data in 1981-2018. Data obtained are analyzed using econometric model with simultaneous equation system. Estimation results show that rice supply was positively and significantly influenced by grain rice price in farmer level, amount of rice production, and rice supply of the previous year. Meantime, domestic rice demand was negatively and significantly influenced by domestic rice price and positively and significantly influenced by domestic rice demand of the previous year. The result of policy simulation indicates that scenario of policy combination through an increase in rice import tariff and government purchase price brings a sizeable impact on the increase in domestic rice production and rice demand and supply. Therefore, Indonesia needs to conduct protection to farmers in the form of rice import tariff imposition as well as government purchase price.</jats:p>"

This paper takes prefabricated concrete components as an example and develops the dynamic decision support framework based on a genetic algorithm and multiagent system (MAS) to optimize and simulate the production scheduling. First, a multiobjective genetic algorithm is integrated into the MAS for preliminary optimization and a series of near‐optimal solutions are obtained. Subsequently, considering the resource constraints and uncertainties, the MAS is used to simulate complex real‐world production environments. Considering the different types of uncertainty factors, the paper proposes the corresponding dynamic scheduling method and uses MAS to generate the optimal production schedule. Finally, a practical prefabricated construction case is used to validate the proposed model. The results show that the model can effectively address the occurrence of uncertain events and can provide dynamic decision support for production scheduling.</jats:p>",

There are several factors that have caused this lack of supply, such as, during harvest time, there’ll be abundant products, which results in price falls, and many products still unsold and left rotting. This problem, are mainly caused by bad trade system and limited technology. Moreover, our trade system is still controlled by a handful of operators known as wholesalers who controls the prices of products. East java is a provincial area in Indonesia that has a bigger potential in Agriculture and Horticulture than many other areas in Indonesia. This advantage allowed us to think that east java has a competitive advantages when it comes to agriculture, that is, to meet the demand of local market, inter-island market, and export market.</p>"

The reliance on this resource and its centrality to realize the human right to ‘safe’ drinking water has increased manifold, but this is yet to be fully acknowledged globally or by governments and political leaders at the national level. This paper analyses the interface of international human rights law, as corresponding to the obligations and responsibilities of different actors, regarding groundwater resources planning, management and protection. Drawing on the literature, we discuss the State’s duties to respect, protect and fulfil this right especially in relation to the freedom of end-users to self-supply from groundwater sources; the training and regulation of non-State service providers including drillers and private vendors; and health and safety concerns. Interpreting the State’s duty to ‘fulfil’ through direct water service provision ‘as a last resort’, this paper suggests that self-provision is the original norm for enjoying the right to water. This has significant implications for the State’s role in raising awareness concerning point source protection and aquifer recharge for water resources management and in decisions concerning water allocation. By ignoring self-provision, which is primarily from groundwater, the State is not only missing a tremendous opportunity but is jeopardizing the water security of future generations.</jats:p>"

We know that power supply companies are state-owned enterprises. Thus, party building work is particularly important, and daily management is also very important. Power supply companies must innovate and transform based on the methods set by the party building team in order to continuously increase the vitality for the development of enterprises. With the guidance of the party building team, power supply companies can make bigger and more meaningful achievements in the construction of talent teams, retaining high-quality talents in the enterprise, and optimization of the staff organization in the enterprise.

In order to achieve this goal, we carried out a review of international and Hungarian literature sources and secondary data. It can be stated that SFSCs can be a viable alternative to conventional supply chains pursuing a global distribution strategy. Establishing a restricted geographic range of supply provides several benefits to local producers, consumers and society. However, there are serious concerns about logistical costs and associated emissions. To overcome this, there is a need for compromises. The practical example we present shows that the use of conventional „less short” sales channels in the distribution mix is reasonable even in the case of local foods.</jats:p>"

The discussion centers on how greater economic uncertainty restricts credit supply and increases the number of non-performing loans. Quarterly data for the Eurozone countries are studied for the period 2005 to 2016. To test the aforementioned hypothesis, an index of economic uncertainty for the Eurozone countries is calculated. Panel data analysis is performed using fixed effects estimation. This approach allows for individual heterogeneity, with different intercepts across countries and quarterly time dummies to control for time-specific effects that are common to all countries in the sample. The primary conclusions of the analysis are as follows: (1) When economic uncertainty increases, total gross loans decrease, and the number of non-performing loans increases. (2) When uncertainty increases, loans to deposit-takers, other domestic sectors, and general government decrease, while loans to financial corporations increase as a means of supporting the financial sector. (3) The most vulnerable Eurozone economies play a prominent role in these overall effects. In these economies, the effects of the recent global financial crisis are most pronounced, with uncertainty increasing significantly over the study period.</jats:p>"

The HRES was modelled for a remote island (Deokjeok-do Island, South Korea) using real electricity consumption data for one complete year. A daily mean load of 24,720 kWh was entered at Deokjeok-do Island with a peak load of 2291.54 kW. Average annual values of wind speed and daily solar radiations were estimated to be 3.6 m/s (10 m height) and 4.13 kWh/m2, respectively. A total of 8760 simulations were performed to achieve the hourly load demand of the mentioned island. In order to deal with the surplus and electricity deficit, two different types of energy storage systems (ESS) were modelled i.e., battery and pumped hydro storage (PHS). Four different HRESs were also evaluated as the most suitable based on levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and net present cost (NPC). A detailed economic break-down of each component and the impact of different sensitivity variables on decision making have also been discussed in detail.</jats:p>"

Using 2016 confidentia firm-trade linked data, we document the implied incidence and scope of new import tariffs. Firms that eventually faced tariff increases on their imports accounted for 84% of all exports and they represent 65% of manufacturing employment. For all affected firms, the implied cost is $900 per worker in new duties. To estimate the effect on U.S. export growth, we construct product-level measures of import tariff exposure of U.S. exports from the underlying firm micro data. More exposed products experienced 2 percentage point lower growth relative to products with no exposure. The decline in exports is equivalent to an ad valorem tariff on U.S. exports of almost 2% for the typical product and almost 4% for products with higher than average exposure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tuna production potential of Palabuhanratu, Sukabumi District, is very high but the fishery is not supported by a good supply chain. In this location, there are two existing chains namely fresh and derivative-product chains; both are influenced significantly by seasonal variables. This research aims to analyze integrated supply chain management for tuna fishery in Palabuhanratu. Data for this research comprises both primary and secondary data. Primary data were collected through interviews with 20 respondents representing fishermen, 10 representing wholesalers, 10 representing retailers, 10 representing consumers, all of which were drawn from following the snowball sampling technique. Meanwhile, secondary data were time series tuna production statistics made available from the printed report of the Sukabumi District Fishery Office. This research employed the factor analysis and fisheries supply chain management model as the main methodological tools. The result showed that among others, the most influential factors for tuna demand in the research location are price of fish, tuna product diversity, and distribution of tuna catch. On the other hand, in the supply side the most influential factors are fishing season and tuna species. It was identified from the research that with regard to the existing chains, this research identified that there are variants of both the fresh fish and derivative product chains, each of which have some particular drawbacks related to influential factors observed in the other part of this research. It is worth noting here that variants of the fresh tuna chain are: (i) fishers, auction place, wholesalers, retailers, consumers, (ii) fishers, auction place, consumers, (iii) fishers, consumers. Variants of the derivative-product chain are: (i) fishers, auction place, wholesalers, processors, processed fish wholesalers, processed fish retailers, consumers, (ii) fishers, auction place, processors, processed fish wholesalers, processed fish retailers, consumers, (iii) fishers, auction place, processors, processed fish retailers, consumers. In general, this research suggests that improvement should be made through the introduction of an integrative approach aiming to incorporate tools necessary to mitigate negative influential factors and to take advantage the positive ones.</jats:p>",

The intention of this analysis is to explore the Granger causality relationship between electricity supply and economic growth (EG) by using a multivariate context with time series statistics covering 1990 to 2015 in Pakistan. Augmented dickey-fuller (ADF) and Philips-Perron (PP) unit root tests indicate that variables are non-stationary and integrated in a similar order (1). Our findings also reveal that variables economic growths (GDP), electricity supply (ELS), investment (INV), and export (EX) are co-integrated. The study also finds the Granger causality runs from EG to ELS deprived of any feedback effect. Therefore, the policy implications from our findings indicate that electricity preservation strategies may be implemented without any economic adverse impacts.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>District heating enables an economical use of energy sources that would otherwise be wasted to cover the heating demands of buildings in urban areas. For efficient utilization of local waste heat and renewable heat sources, low distribution temperatures are of crucial importance. This study evaluates a local heating network being planned for a new building area in Trondheim, Norway, with waste heat available from a nearby ice skating rink. Two alternative supply temperature levels have been evaluated with dynamic simulations: low temperature (40 °C), with direct utilization of waste heat and decentralized domestic hot water (DHW) production using heat pumps; and medium temperature (70 °C), applying a centralized heat pump to lift the temperature of the waste heat. The local network will be connected to the primary district heating network to cover the remaining heat demand. The simulation results show that with a medium temperature supply, the peak power demand is up to three times higher than with a low temperature supply. This results from the fact that the centralized heat pump lifts the temperature for the entire network, including space and DHW heating demands. With a low temperature supply, heat pumps are applied only for DHW production, which enables a low and even electricity demand. On the other hand, with a low temperature supply, the district heating demand is high in the wintertime, in particular if the waste heat temperature is low. The choice of a suitable supply temperature level for a local heating network is hence strongly dependent on the temperature of the available waste heat, but also on the costs and emissions related to the production of district heating and electricity in the different seasons.</jats:p>"

To promote green production in the long term associated with the consideration of financial intervention of governments, we establish a three-population model of suppliers, manufacturers and governments based on evolutionary game theory, and analyze the evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) of their unilateral and joint behaviors. Further, system dynamics (SD) is applied to empirical analysis for exploring the dynamic interaction of the populations’ strategy, and the key factors affecting ESS are also discussed in detail. The results show that: (1) the proportion of green suppliers and manufacturers in their groups determines whether the government implements regulation; (2) any party of the supplier and manufacturer that adopts green strategy could promote green behavior of the other; (3) the government is advised to supervise and implement reward and punishment mechanism under the low proportion of green supply chain; (4) government regulation could promote the corporations to adopt green behavior and should preferentially implements the mechanism on manufacturers.

Monitoring and predicting green supply chain performance can result in improved decision-making capability for managers and decision-makers to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. This paper identifies and analyzes various green supply chain performance measures and indicators. A probabilistic model is proposed based on a Bayesian belief network (BBN) for predicting green supply chain performance. Eleven green supply chain performance indicators and two green supply chain performance measures are identified through an extensive literature review. Using a real-world case study of a manufacturing industry, the methodology of this model is illustrated. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to examine the relative sensitivity of green supply chain performance to each of the performance indicators. The outcome of this research is expected to help managers and practitioners of GSCM improve their decision-making capability, which ultimately results in improved overall organizational performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, from the standpoint of anthropocentrism, social history, the history of everyday life, the problem of energy supply to residents of Ukrainian cities during the years of Nazi occupation is analyzed. Energy in an industrial society is one of the most important sectors of the economy, ensuring the functioning of industry, transport, water supply and sanitation, lighting and heating of homes. It plays a particularly important role in the life of cities, because the city’s infrastructure is the center of population, industry and transport, high-rise buildings, and its normal operation without electricity is impossible. The study reveals the features of the restoration and operation of power plants, street lighting in cities, the cost of electricity, its availability for different groups of the urban population. Aspects of the functioning of urban electric vehicles are also discussed in the article. It is proven that the lack of electricity was felt throughout the entire period of occupation. Its absence restrained the restoration of communal services. Electricity was used primarily by German military units, Volksdeutsche, enterprises and official institutions. The methods of lighting and heating homes that were used by citizens during the years of occupation are considered. In the most difficult period in the winter of 1942, the local population was completely deprived of the right to use electricity at home. Violent measures (up to the execution) were threatened for violation of the order. The reverse situation was observed among the Wehrmacht soldiers who did not save electricity. In general, energy supply could not meet the needs of either the civilian population or industry, especially in the cold periods of the year. The reasons for this situation were the Soviet scorched earth tactics, the evacuation of all resources to the east of the USSR, the Reich’s policy of looting and removal of electrical equipment, the lack of fuel and the general energy crisis in Germany as a result of the failure of the blitzkrieg. In their turn, the Nazis themselves, when retreating, also resorted to scorched earth tactics, which, along with heavy fighting and moving of the front line, completely deprived the population of electricity at the final stage of occupation and the Soviet-German war.</jats:p>"

The device consists of an asymmetric planetary differential connected to an eddy-current slip clutch. The method provides for maintaining the maximum efficiency and economic operation of the pump in the entire regulating range. The design of the pressure regulator in the network can be estimated by comparing the calculated efficiency value that is at least 94 for the minimum flow rates whereby the regulation is very difficult. At the optimal flow rates in the system there are no tangible losses. The synchronous electric motor is most resistant to overloads while at the minimum flow rates it provides for the required pressure consuming the minimum amount of electricity and at the same time maintaining the rated rpm. The mechanism was implemented in models and proved the claimed parameters. The presented control scheme neither has been approbated at existing facilities, nor its technical and economic parameters have been investigated, so far.

Upon implementing the above-mentioned principles, a number of both general scientific and specific historical research methods were applied (historical-situational, historical-comparative, historical-systemic, and statistical methods). The scientific novelty of this work is its attempt to reflect on the course of the socio-political development of the USSR under the influence of changing internal and external factors caused by the consumer crisis.The authors note that under difficult conditions, the authorities of the USSR and the CPSU Central Committee were forced to meet the social needs of the population in order to maintain a certain level of food provisions, as well as to support welfare. Evidence supports that increased social payments and higher wages in the early 1970s temporarily reduced the population's discontent with the Soviet political regime. The authors conclude that the concentration of the population&amp;rsquo;s attention on the low level of meeting their urgent needs was the basis of social inversion and the revision of the Soviet government approval index.</jats:p>"

Detecting of such an event and interrupting the power supply may be beyond the capability of a conventional electro-mechanical circuit breaker. A lot of research papers have been published related to arc fault of wiring and its detection method. Furthermore, arc fault circuit interrupters have been put into practical use. The objective of the present paper is to understand fault of damaged power supply cord under two selected situations observed in practical use or considered suitable to understand fire ignition. Using two kinds of samples similar to but different from samples prescribed in UL1699 standard, the ignition mechanism of combustibles is discussed based on the results of laboratory experiments. The findings herein underscore the important role of the arc in the ignition of combustibles that are placed on the damaged part of a power supply cord, which is normally followed by a short circuit of broken element conductors or breakage of intact element conductors. Moreover, a possible arc detection feature in the two situations is discussed based on a distorted voltage waveform.</jats:p>"

In total, 23 series of experiments were performed under different initial free chlorine concentrations and different hydraulic conditions. The applicability of different chlorine decay mathematical models has been investigated. A new model was proposed, combining zero order bulk reactions and first order wall reactions, describing the laboratory results with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients over 0.99. The obtained values for the wall reaction coefficient vary in the range 0.008–0.030 m/h, decreasing exponentially with increasing initial chlorine concentration.</jats:p>",

The second objective was to quantify the interaction between temperature and precipitation for the assessment of CV. To do so, six scenarios were defined to evaluate either the impact of HA, CV or both. Four major results were achieved: (1) the interaction between temperature and precipitation was more prominent in basin upstream areas, which reduced the streamflow by 9% in the entire simulation period; (2) when separating the effects of climatic and human factors, SBHM results in comparison with those of the climate elasticity analysis showed no significant differences; (3) HA were the main force driving the streamflow reduction in the study basin; (4) a 5 °C increase in air temperature in the future would lead to an increase of 1.6% in average annual streamflow, and 41% in peak runoff.</jats:p>",

As regenerative braking energy in railway systems has huge potential for optimized utilization, a lot of research has been focusing on how to use the energy efficiently and gain sustainable benefits. The energy storage system is an alternative because it not only deals with regenerative braking energy but also smooths drastic fluctuation of load power profile and optimizes energy management. In this work, we propose a co-phase traction power supply system with super capacitor (CSS_SC) for the purpose of realizing the function of energy management and power quality management in electrified railways. Besides, the coordinated control strategy is presented to match four working modes, including traction, regenerative braking, peak shaving and valley filling. A corresponding simulation model is built in MATLAB/Simulink to verify the feasibility of the proposed system under dynamic working conditions. The results demonstrate that CSS_SC is flexible to deal with four different working conditions and can realize energy saving within the allowable voltage unbalance of 0.008% in simulation in contrast to 1.3% of the standard limit. With such a control strategy, the performance of super capacitor is controlled to comply with efficiency and safety constraints. Finally, a case study demonstrates the improvement in power fluctuation with the valley-to-peak ratio reduced by 20.3% and the daily load factor increased by 17.9%.</jats:p>",

In this work, the precision of three maximum scour depth equations was tested from previous studies for contraction scour cases. Two new analytical equations were proposed to calculate time-dependent scour depth and maximum scour at equilibrium conditions, respectively, from the study. The proposed equations were validated using measurements from the present study as well as from previous literature, and the equations show a reasonable agreement between measured and computed values of scour depth under clear-water conditions in short contraction.

In this case corporate customers who send orders to the manufacturer are sure that their orders will be accepted and carried out. The practical implication of the proposed method is for manufacturing enterprises who have a lot of orders and sometimes reject some of the orders due to the lack of free manufacturing capacity.</jats:p>"

In this respect, there can be barriers to applying sustainable improvements due to regulations, practices and customer culture. This study is focused on finding the waste produced by the service of one of the biggest payment service provider (PSP) companies in Iran and how to meet the essential needs of the sustainable supply chain. It has been observed that using thermal papers as a biohazardous material causes environmental problems and even it is hazardous to mix them with normal paper waste in the recycling process. Moreover, preventive maintenance of the thermal printers itself causes a huge number of unnecessary shuttles between the customers and service suppliers, which represents a source of CO2 emission, traffic—especially in the capital—and high maintenance costs for the company. Three main alternatives to the thermal paper receipt were analyzed and ranked by means of a TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) model, which employed the sustainability pillars and the technical point of view as evaluation criteria. The priorities against the set of criteria were obtained by means of surveys, which targeted a sample of customers and a pool of experts. The results highlighted that customers’ habits and legislation are the most important barriers to the transition to a more sustainable service.</jats:p>"

We discuss major issues relevant to the choice of an implementation regime, using a parsimonious framework and drawing from the experience in the United States since the 2007-09 financial crisis. We find that the optimal level of reserve supply likely lies somewhere between scarce and abundant reserves, thus highlighting the benefits of implementation with what could be called &amp;amp;quot;ample&amp;amp;quot; reserves. The Federal Reserve&amp;amp;#x27;s announcement in October 2019 that it would maintain a level of reserve supply greater than the one that prevailed in early September is consistent with the implications of our framework.</jats:p>"

North Sumatera is one of the provinces producing shallot. Even it produces quite a large amount of production, there is still a large gap between the shallot production and consumption amount in North Sumatera due to its high consumption. Thus, the shallot supply chain in North Sumatera must always be maintained, so that the shallot can be well distributed to maintain price stability and meet consumer demand. In order to be managed properly, it is necessary to know the North Sumatera shallot supply chain. This study described the supply chain of North Sumatera shallot. The study was conducted by tracing the North Sumatera shallot supply chain starting from the production centre to the final destination regions, and then the supply chain was drawn in the Causal Loop Diagram. The results showed that the shallot production centres in North Sumatera Province consisted of six districts, namely Simalungun, Samosir, North Tapanuli, Dairi, Karo, and Toba Samosir. There were six final destination regions for shallot from those six districts, namely Medan, Padang Sidempuan, and Sibolga in North Sumatera, Kuta Cane in Aceh, West Sumatera, and Riau.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article discusses the problem of increasing the fuel efficiency of diesel engines at low load and idle modes by turning off the cylinders. The method is one of the effective ways to increase fuel economy in these modes. But its inherent disadvantages do not allow to fully obtain fuel economy. The method of skipping fuel supply is presented, which consists in the fact that when the diesel engine switches to low load and idle modes, the fuel supply stops not in the same cylinder, but in all cylinders alternately. To implement this method of regulation, the diesel fuel system must allow the skipping of individual cycle feeds. This is only possible with electronic fuel control. Many currently operating diesel engines are equipped with electronically controlled fuel supply systems, however, due to design features, it is not always advisable to reconfigure the system to work with a fuel supply skipping. In this regard, the most interesting are electronically controlled devices (valves), which can be implemented in a standard fuel supply system. The practical interest have the ring-type valves, where the split ring itself performs the function of the power and locking element, and the cylindrical surface serves as a socket for the ring. A fuel flow skipping device based on an electromagnetic-controlled valve of the annular type is proposed. Theoretical studies have made it possible to optimize the shape and size of the valve, in particular, to improve performance with a small section of the ring, to reduce the opposing forces and to obtain a large power of the electromagnet. Bench tests showed the efficiency of the proposed device with different numbers of skipped fuel supplies.</jats:p>"

In this study, fertigation-induced corrosion was evaluated in specimens of galvanized steel (similar to that used in center pivot systems), simulating 10 years of operation comprising 5 fertigations per year with a duration of 7 hours each. Immersion tests were performed in solutions containing 0, 5 and 10 g/L fertilizer concentrations to obtain the mass loss per unit area of the metallic material, which increased in response to increases in both the exposure time in the corrosive environment and the fertilizer concentration. The results showed that fertigation increases corrosion in galvanized steel and the higher fertilizer concentration leads to a higher corrosion, since, for the same exposure time, the mass loss for the 10 g/L solution was 43% greater than the 5 g/L.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, data related to this aspect are non-existent in Algeria. Precipitation and throughfall volumes and their contributions in NPK elements were evaluated between 2012 and 2013, in a green oak coppice at Marconna in Aurès (eastern Algeria). Precipitation volumes were evaluated by the placement of 10 containers in a bare soil. To quantify the throughfall, four containers were installed under the canopy of each tree among 25 selected trees. Water samples taken from previously rinsed plastic bottles with distilled water were kept away from light and transported to the laboratory for volume estimation and chemical analysis, as quickly as possible. After rapid filtration, samples became ready for NPK analysis. Various devices and chemicals were used for the measurements of NPK elements in the laboratory. Kjeldahl's method, colorimetry and flame photometry were used for quantifying total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium respectively. The results showed that annual rainfall amounts varied between 223,9 and 289,6 mm, whereas the annual throughfall was 127,1 mm for 2012 and 189,8 mm for 2013.Besides, the annual quantities of N, P and K returned to the soil by the rainfall ranged from 5,05 to 7,62 kg/ ha/year. However, the throughfall results showed that the coppice accumulated amounts of N, P and K elements varying between 4,08 and 5,47 kg / ha / year. On average, nitrogen was the most provided element.

Five experimental models in two different discharges were used. The model without the spur dike is the control model, and spur dikes in the other models were placed upstream and in the direction of the intake; upstream and in front of the intake; downstream and in front of intake; and also upstream and in front of intake as a form of spur dike series. The results showed that the spur dikes downstream and in front of the intake had the highest input discharge to the intake in both discharge states. A lower rate of erosion and sedimentation was achieved when the spur dike was located upstream of the channel.</jats:p>",

Following the reform-induced expansion in the availability of derivatives, fuel hedging by airlines nearing financial distress (those that benefited most from the reform) significantly increased in comparison with financially sound airlines. We find that the hedging propensity similarly increased in a general sample of nonfinancial firms. In line with theory, we also find that operating performance increased for the affected firms.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The accurate prediction of crop water requirement is of great significance for the development of regional agriculture. Based on the wavelet transform, a combined prediction approach for crop water requirement is proposed. Firstly, the Mallat wavelet transform algorithm is used to decompose and reconstruct the crop water requirement series. The approximate and detail components of the original series can be obtained. The characteristics of approximate components and detail components are analyzed by Hurst index. Then, according to the different characteristics of the components, the particle swarm optimization algorithm optimized support vector machine is used to predict the approximate component, and the autoregressive moving average model is used to predict the detail components. Three-fold cross-validation is used to improve the generalization ability of the forecasting model. Finally, combined with the prediction value of each prediction model, the final prediction value of crop water requirement is obtained. The crop water requirement data from 1983 to 2018 in Liaoning Province of China are collected as the research object. The simulation results indicate that the proposed combined prediction approach has high prediction accuracy for crop water requirement. The comparison of performance indicators shows that the root mean square error of the proposed prediction approach reduced by 45.40% to 57.16%, mean absolute error reduced by 32.96% to 52.07%, mean absolute percentile error reduced by 33.02% to 52.37%, relative root mean square error reduced by 45.26% to 57.38%, square sum error reduced by 70.18% to 80.42%, and the Theil inequality coefficient reduced by 59.02% to 80.77%. R square increased by 16.46% to 54.77%, and the index of agreement increased by 3.82% to 23.37%. The results of Pearson's test and the DM test show that the association strength between the actual value and the prediction value of the crop water requirement is stronger. Moreover, the proposed prediction approach in this paper has higher reliability under the same confidence level. The effectiveness of the proposed prediction approach for crop water requirement is verified. The proposed prediction approach has great significance for the rational use of water resources, planning and management, promoting social and economic sustainable development.</jats:p>",

The current study aims to develop a model for allocating water resources more efficiently and equitably. In this regard, a multi-objective programming approach was developed with the first objective of equality of water resource allocation to be maximized, and the second objective of risk to be minimized. The risk considered in this study was the economic efficiency loss risk. For the annual water allocation model, the fluctuation in available water within the river basin is the main source of uncertainty and can result in the corresponding risk of economic efficiency loss. Thus, it is essential to manage the economic efficiency loss risk resulting from uncertainty. To solve the model, the compromise programming (CP) method was used. A sustainability index was also employed to determine the objective function weights. The developed model was applied to the Givi River basin in Iran. From the results, it was found that using the sustainability index is a suitable strategy in the CP method for determining the objective function weights. The results showed that the proposed model can be helpful in water management to allocate water resources.</jats:p>",

However, a stable, long-term woody biomass supply from plantation forests is necessary for the construction and operation of such power stations. The logs that are used to produce fuel chips are harvested from roundwood. Thus, the main objective of this study was to estimate the potential supply of woody biomass resources under the condition of maximum sustainable harvesting from privately-owned plantation forests. Another aim was to examine the stability of sustainable harvest volumes from periodical changes. The study focused on privately-owned forests in the Sampoku district of Murakami City in the northernmost part of Niigata Prefecture, Japan. Trees in the studied region are commonly bent during periods of high snowfall, and the current bucking strategy – influenced by the construction of a biomass-powered generation facility – was integrated into the model. The revenues and costs of plantation management and timber production were calculated based on stands’ geographical attributes using a geographic information system. A mixed integer programming model was used to predict the maximum sustainable harvest levels that would provide stable profits. The simulation showed that even though the trees had a unimodal age class distribution, sustainable harvest volumes ensured a sustainable supply of woody biomass over various rotation ages. Extending the range of rotation ages by 20 years dramatically increased the potential supply of woody biomass resources. Fluctuations in each woody biomass resources were mostly less than 20% over the planning horizon. The presented research could be useful to regional forest resource managers and stakeholders involved in biomass-powered energy generation or the purchasing of woody biomass.</jats:p>"

Based on data from one palm oil mill in the province of North Sumatra, the percentage of FFB stays in the field overnight, which is 41% of the total FFB though, on the one hand FFB that has been harvested must be processed immediately because it can affect the quality of oil to be produced. Besides that, the factors of production and storage processes are also very influential on the quality of CPO. The imbalance in production planning shows that production planning is not yet optimal in the CPO supply chain so that a production optimization design is needed in the CPO supply chain. The genetic algorithm was chosen in the completion of the optimization model because of the complex characteristics of the CPO supply chain. The purpose of this research is to optimize the palm oil supply chain system to minimize production costs. This method shows that the optimum production yield for the third quarter of 2017 is 12,202,285 kg.

The problem in the application of genetic algorithms in this study is the distribution of three levels. This study uses 3 producers, 3 agents, 5 distributors and 7 retails.

However, the difference of complementary degree between products leads to the diversity of pricing. In parallel, with the development of green supply chains, the extra cost of manufacturers to conduct ecological product design makes the pricing of complementary products further complicated. Thus, it is important to clarify the pricing strategy for complementary products in a green supply chain. Based on the Stackelberg games between two manufacturers and a retailer, this paper constructs three pricing models to simultaneously analyze the changes in the optimal profits of supply chain members and the optimal green manufacturing degree of complementary products. The results demonstrate that: (i) In most cases, two manufacturers prefer the pure bundling pricing strategy, but the strategy preference of the retailer is complex. (ii) The green manufacturing is mutually beneficial for complementary manufacturers and worth advocating. (iii) The increasing sensitivity of consumers to the green manufacturing level of one product will also be detrimental to the improvement of the optimal green manufacturing level of its complementary products.</jats:p>"

The automobile supply chain is complex, as this includes raw material suppliers, component manufacturers, sub assemblers, final assemblers, different distribution channels, networks and end consumers. This demands a robust supply chain that can integrate all these links for cost efficiency and profitability. The objectives of this article are to find segmental differences in the supply chain performance of the Indian automobile industry and to quantify the impact of supply chain performance on the overall profitability of the firms across the segments. </jats:p><jats:p> This article measures the performance of the supply chain of Indian automobile industry segments integrating supply chain financial metrics and supply chain operations reference key performance indicators (SCOR KPIs) through a 10-year timeline. The results are compared across segments to identify unique performance features, if any, using ANOVA. A panel data fixed effect model (least square dummy variable [LSDV]) is constructed to establish the relationship between supply chain performance and profitability and to understand whether the identified supply chain performance variables have any significant impact on profitability across the segments. </jats:p><jats:p> This article has evidenced that though the supply chain of two/three-wheelers segment is performing better in fixed asset and inventory turnover it is more impacted by distribution inefficiency. The supply chain of the commercial-vehicles segment is impacted more by excess fixed assets, distribution inefficiency and poor inventory turnover. Although inventory turnover of passenger-vehicles segment is better than that of the commercial vehicles, the supply chain fixed assets remain a concern for this segment. Across the industry segments, the profitability of the segment is more impacted by poor distribution efficiency compared to fixed assets and inventory turnover. </jats:p><jats:p> This article contributes towards finding key segmental supply chain performance features of the Indian automobile industry and building a panel data fixed effect model by integrating supply chain performance indicators with the profitability of the firms across the segments.

The government decided on the policy (tax or subsidy) to maximize the social welfare, while the firm decided on the greenness level of the product, which affects the consumers’ choice behavior and hence his own demand. Assuming else being equal, the government should adopt the tax policy if consumers are very sensitive to the greenness, the cost of greening is high, or the negative impact due to carbon emission is large, and subsidize the firm otherwise.

A sodium hypochlorite generator is considered to prevent the brine water discharging. The brine water portion of the desalination outlet was the input to this generator. The cycling power is consumed by the desalination system and sodium hypochlorite generator. After modeling, the advanced exergy analyses are studied. By exergy analysis, it is observed that in this model the condenser has the highest exergy destruction rate, equal to 952 kW. Additionally, the unavoidable part of the exergy destruction of carbon dioxide turbine constitutes 88% of its exergy destruction that is equal to 301 kW. So this component is the best option to improve exergy destruction.</jats:p>",

The sorption mechanism of biomass can consist of several steps including chemisorption, complexation, adsorption on surface, diffusion through pores, and ion exchange. Heavy metals were removed in different rates depending on the adsorbent and metal itself. For instance, coconut waste showed adsorption capacities of 263 and 285 mg/g in removing lead and cadmium ions, respectively. Also, black oak bark has adsorbed mercury in an adsorption capacity of 400 mg/g, while wheat brans adsorption capacity for chromium was 310 mg/g. The adsorption capacity is commonly calculated by Lagergren's first-order equation, the Redlich Peterson model, and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model. However, Langmuir and Freundlich models were intensively used to calculate the adsorbed amount by a unit weight of solid sorbents. This review article aims to present the recently available information on utilizing the biomass materials for heavy metals removal. Here, we highlight the increasing use of these materials due to their low cost, regeneration ability, high adsorption efficiency, and small chemical or biological sludge with a possibility of metal recovery.</jats:p>",

Sabah SMEs has low production levels and had to slow down the development of products and services. It will continue affecting the overall operation of Sabah SMEs. As Sabah SMEs have the biggest contribution to Sabahâ€™s development and provide many job opportunities, thus, it is needed for this study to identify determinant factors that influence the adoption of supply chain technology within Sabah SMEs such as perceived usefulness, complexity, compatibility and top management support. This study use diffusion of innovation (DoI) theory as underpinning theory to explain the adoption of supply chain technology according to the aspects of innovation attributes and organizational factor. This study employs a quantitative approach through a survey questionnaire distributed purposefully to Sabah SMEs in all sectors (manufacturing, services, and agriculture). The respondentsâ€™ data obtained will be analysed through Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for descriptive analysis while statistical data will be analysed through Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) via Partial Least Squares (PLS). The outcome is to examine the relationship between the variables and the extent to which the relationship between the variables was related to each other.

The objective of this research is to compare groundwater level prediction of several data-driven models for different prediction periods. Five different data-driven methods are compared to evaluate their performances to predict groundwater levels with 1-, 2- and 3-month lead times. The four quantitative standard statistical performance evaluation measures showed that while all models could provide acceptable predictions of groundwater level, the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) model was the most accurate. We developed a set of input combinations based on different levels of groundwater, total precipitation, average temperature and total evapotranspiration at monthly intervals. For each model, the antecedent inputs that included Ht-1, Ht-2, Ht-3, Tt, ETt, Pt, Pt-1 produced the best-fit model for 1-month lead time. The coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were calculated as 0.99%, 1.05 meters for the train data set, and 95%, 2.3 meters for the test data set, respectively. It was also demonstrated that many combinations the above-mentioned approaches could model groundwater levels for 1 and 2 months ahead appropriately, but for 3 months ahead the performance of the models was not satisfactory.</jats:p>",

It plays an important role in Thai meals and becomes more popular in convenience stores and hypermarkets. The objectives of this study are to explore the current supply chain of a small-sized Thai chili paste enterprise, to analyze the business processes and identify the problem and provide the recommendation for improvement. First, we observe and perform an in-depth interview of the owner and staff for realizing the business process. Then, the result is analyzed by using the Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0) to show the existing stakeholders and current key activities in Thai chili paste. The major problems are lack of data collection, low forecast accuracy, lack of inventory management, and low productivity. The proper controls are proposed. Finally, our guidelines could enhance the productivity of other small-sized enterprises which can increase the potential capability for domestic and international markets.</jats:p>",

As Brazil is one of the largest soybean-producing and exporting countries in the world, a considerable decrease in soybean production due to SBR would have a significant impact on the global soybean market. SBR-resistant cultivars have been developed to prevent a decrease in soybean production. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of SBR-resistant cultivars on soybean production and the soybean market in Brazil using a supply and demand model. This model consists of functions of yield, cultivated area, exports, and stock changes of soybean and soybean products, demand for soybean products, and price linkages. Five scenarios were simulated to evaluate the economic impact of adopting SBR-resistant cultivars as follows: One without SBR infection, two with serious production losses due to SBR in the south and southeast regions and all the states of Brazil, and two with the adoption of SBR-resistant cultivars in the south and south-east regions and all the states of Brazil. Our simulations suggest that adopting SBR-resistant cultivars reduces the cost of controlling SBR by approximately half and is essential for sustainable soybean production and a stable global soybean market.</jats:p>"

The traditional way of security provision has been based on conventional investments such as the upgrade of the capacity of electricity transmission or distribution lines. However, energy storage can also provide security of supply. In this context, the current paper presents a methodology for the quantification of the security contribution of energy storage, based on the use of mathematical optimization for the calculation of the F-factor metric, which reflects the optimal amount of peak demand reduction that can be achieved as compared to the power capability of the corresponding energy storage asset. In this context, case studies underline that the F-factors decrease with greater storage power capability and increase with greater storage efficiency and energy capacity as well as peakiness of the load profile. Furthermore, it is shown that increased investment in energy storage per system bus does not increase the overall contribution to security of supply.</jats:p>"

In addition to the aforementioned competitive advantages, a company needs to introduce new products and out-phase the old ones at the right time. In this research, the design of a supply chain network considering new product development is investigated. Here, the notion of customer relationship management is incorporated into the proposed mathematical model. Moreover, product demand that is inherently uncertain in the real situations is embedded in the proposed robust model. Objectives of new products development, and customer satisfaction along with maximization of the profit is considered in the model. Moreover, an improved multi-choice goal programming method is implemented to solve the model. Finally, the model performance is evaluated for a real-world case.</jats:p>",

The greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) in the current consumption pattern (CFP 2547 kcal) and the USDA recommended food consumption pattern (RFP 2000 kcal) were 8.80 and 9.61 tons CO2-eq per household per year, respectively. Unlike adopting a vegetarian diet (i.e., RFP 2000 kcal veg or RFP 2600 kcal veg), adoption of a RFP 2000 kcal diet has a probability of increasing GHGEs and other environmental impacts under iso-caloric analysis. The bigger environmental impacts of non-vegetarian RFP scenarios were largely attributable to supply chain activities and food losses at retail and consumer levels. However, the RFP 2000 vegetarian diet showed a significant reduction in the environmental impacts (e.g., GHGEs were 22% lower than CFP 2547). Uncertainty analysis confirmed that the RFP 2600 scenario (mean of 11.2; range 10.3–12.4 tons CO2-eq per household per year) is higher than CFP 2547 (mean of 8.81; range 7.89–9.95 tons CO2-eq per household per year) with 95% confidence.

The width of the Kerf and surface roughness are the most factors which needs for focusing during cutting process for various plate cutting operation by CNC machine. Such machines require oxygen and propane or acetylene gases with proper pressure controls. For the gas cutting machine, the volume of oxygen gas used is more than that of propane gas. The oxygen gas is used for heating and cutting the plates. It is necessary to supply the proper amount and quality of gas to the machine to obtain a good cutting quality surfces. However; the pressure of oxygen gas depends upon the thickness of cutting plates. Stainless steel is the most important metals in the industrial and manufacturing process, so the cutting conditions are very important. Its concluded from our result, that the characteristics of the main selecting factors which effects the laser machine performance such as, the focal lens nozzle height (0.6 to 1.0mm) and the ability and speed of cutting should be fixed and not changing.</jats:p>"

At Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Works (MJWTWs), samples were collected from the raw water inlet and treated water outlet points. In the distribution system, samples were collected from selected sites and grouped into four zones (1, 2, 3 and 4). The algal taxonomic groups that were found in both raw and treated water comprised of Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Euglenophyceae and Dinophyceae. It was found out that Microcystis aeruginosa followed by Anabaena were the most abundant species in both raw water and in the distribution system. All measured water quality parameters were within the Standards Association of Zimbabwe and WHO guideline values except for chlorine which had an average residual chlorine concentration that was lower than the WHO recommended lower value of 0.2 mg/L in parts of Zone 2. Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Works does not completely remove algae, and there is a carry-over of algae into the distribution system. Boosting of chlorine is recommended for Zone 2 that had residual chlorine less than the WHO minimum threshold of 0.2 mg/L.</jats:p>",

This study conducts on craft SMEs in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses primary data which is obtained through questionnaires. The unit of analysis in this study is organizations and individuals. The sampling technique is purposing sampling, with the criteria of SMEs that conduct environmentally friendly production processes and consumers who have ever bought green products. Data analysis uses structural equation modeling. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited by relatively small sample size. The sample is only environmentally oriented SMEs. Large companies that are also environmentally friendly have not been included as samples in this study, so the results of this study only generalized to SMEs. Future research should accommodate these two types of companies, namely SMEs and companies, so that it can be easier to generalize the findings and allow different tests of GSCM to be applied to SMEs and large companies. This study only analyzed GSCM from two dimensions, namely GP and GCC. Other variables that can be used to explain GSCM are internal environmental, green information systems, eco-design and packaging. Practical implications: GSCM can be started with conducts the right GP and always coordinating with consumers which related to green products. GP (green purchasing) and GCC (green consumer cooperation) as GSCM elements have a strong association in predicting the success of a green marketing strategy. It is expected that SMEs should pay attention to the raw material purchase so that the problem of environmentally friendly raw materials can be truly obtained to enter the production process and produce environmentally friendly products. Originality/value: This study analyzes the relationship between GSCM practices and organizational performance in the green marketing and business strategies context, where there is still a scarcity of studies in this context. Besides that, there is an increase in awareness of green operations and green marketing in Asia, but the relevant studies in Asian countries have not been conducted much, especially in Southeast Asia. The result of this study proves that the GSCM model can increase value along the supply chain by emphasizing green supply chain management and green marketing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability in supply chain management (SSCM) has become established in both academia and increasingly in practice. As stakeholders continue to require focal companies (FCs) to take more responsibility for their entire supply chains (SCs), this has led to the development of multi-tier SSCM (MT-SSCM). Much extant research has focused on simple supply chains from certain industries. Recently, a comprehensive traceability for sustainability (TfS) framework has been proposed, which outlines how companies could achieve MT-SSCM through traceability. Our research builds on this and responds to calls for cases from the automotive industry by abductively analysing a multi-tier supply chain (MT-SC) transparency case study. This research analyses a raw material SC that is particularly renowned for sustainability problems—the cobalt supply chain for electric vehicles—and finds that the extant literature has oversimplified the operationalisation of transparency in MT-SSCM. We compare the supply chain maps of the MT-SC before and after an auditing and mapping project to demonstrate the transparency achieved. Our findings identify challenges to the operationalisation of SC transparency and we outline how FCs might set to increase MT-SC transparency for sustainability.</jats:p>"

Experimental and hydraulic models were carried out to investigate two types of scour reduction methods around a single cylindrical pier, namely the pier's slots and collars. The efficiency of various types of pier slots and circular collars around the pier's base in reducing scour were studied. A new shape of a conical collar was developed by the authors and examined along with other shapes. The results revealed that collars, in general, have more influence in reducing scour depth than slots made in the front and rear of bridge piers. The sigma-slot acts better than other tested slots, with a reduction in the scour depths of 59.3% and 52.8% at the upstream and downstream of the pier, respectively. On the other hand, the conical collar appeared to be the most effective collar shape in reducing the scour around the bridge pier, with a 61.1% reduction in the scour depth downstream of the pier. A three-dimensional laser scanner was used to capture the bed topography at the end of each experiment and contour maps of the deformed bed were produced. A one-dimensional Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System model was developed with a single bridge pier to predict the scour depth around the pier in an attempt to introduce new values for the pier nose shape factor, , which describes the tested piers.</jats:p>",

Government policies often pay more attention to reducing prices to prevent inflation, so that the consumers’ welfare finally increases, while producers’ welfare is still less accommodated by the policies. North Sumatera is one of the major shallot producing provinces in Indonesia, and it includes in the recommended areas for expanding shallot cultivation areas. This study analysed the factors affecting the supply of North Sumatera shallot and estimated its elasticity to the price in order to help formulating agricultural policies relating to the stabilization of the North Sumatera shallot supply. To estimate it, the Nerlove partial adjustment model, the autoregressive model, was analysed by multiple linear regression with the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation technique. The results showed that the North Sumatera shallot supply was positively affected by the shallot harvest area, the shallot cultivation area, the garlic producer price, and the TSP fertilizer price. In addition, it was also negatively affected by the shallot producer price and the North Sumatera shallot supply in the previous period. In both the short and long-run, North Sumatera shallot supply is inelastic to the price.</jats:p>",

The output voltage of the photovoltaic cell is low under weak light. A new type of energy harvesting circuit is designed for the low output voltage of the photovoltaic cell, which can efficiently harvest the light energy in the transmission line. However, the vibration frequency of the transmission line is low, the structure of piezoelectric vibration energy harvester is designed by finite element method, the natural frequency is close to the vibration frequency of the excitation source, and the energy utilization ratio is the largest. The two energy collectors are impedance matched respectively in order to increase the energy output power of the whole system. The system is controlled with supercapacitor by energy management mode, which provides stable electric energy for load and realizes the sustainable self-power supply of wireless temperature sensor.</jats:p>",

Beef and chicken are the most consumed meat in Indonesia with an average meat consumption of 2.72 kg per capita per year and there is an increasing trend. Currently, the domestic production of beef is only about 45% percent of the demand, the rest of the demand will be fulfilled by importing live cattle and frozen meat, mainly from Australia. The beef supply chain is quite complex and long. The available infrastructures still need to be improved in order to deliver the beef quickly and handled under appropriate cold chain. Our objectives are to identify the business process of the abattoir in the chilled beef product cold chain, to analyze the problem, and to propose some recommendations for their strategic improvement. The observation and in-depth interviews are conducted. Then, the result is analyzed by using Integration Definition for Function Modelling (IDEF0) to figure out the current situation and the activities in the abattoir. Based on the result, it is found that inventory management and temperature controlling are the major issues in the chilled beef cold chain that need to be monitored and controlled.

The parallel skimming walls are installed on the main channel, in front of the intake span, creating a rotational flow and diverting sediments from the intake span, and as a result a reduction in the amount of sediment entry into the intake can be realized. The present paper aims at experimentally studying the impact of length (L) and height (H) of parallel skimming walls, as well as the effect of discharge shifts associated with the main channel on controlling the inlet sediment into the intake. First, the impact of parallel skimming walls incorporating three lengths (L = 60 cm, 75 cm, 90 cm) in front of the intake is investigated, then the impact of skimming walls incorporating three heights (H = 2 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm) is scrutinized. After each test, the sediment volume entry (V) into the intake was measured. By performing dimensional analysis, dimensionless ratios were obtained and the relation between the variables was determined. The results demonstrated that in the case of parallel skimming walls, the increase in L and H leads to mitigation in the amount of inlet sediment into the intake. Moreover, there is a proper agreement between the procedure of this study and the previous ones.</jats:p>",

However, the market design and the behaviour of participants are key factors that determine the success of such markets. To this end, this research presents a CEM model and conducts agent-based simulations to study the benefits of the CEM to consumers and prosumers. The proposed market structure is an hour-ahead periodic double auction. In particular, market rules are proposed that incentivise the provision of energy supply to the community and the investment in energy storage. Furthermore, a trading strategy is introduced that leverages energy flexibility created by the storage devices. Finally, as well as the hour-ahead market, we include a minute-by-minute balancing as part of the CEM’s energy exchange mechanism. The balancing approach is introduced to account for a community budget deficit caused by the time difference between supply and demand. The proposed market results in cost savings for consumers and profit for prosumers similar to existing approaches, while increasing the energy suppliers’ percentage of financial benefits from 50% to a range between 60–96% depending on the community configuration. Moreover, the market model accounts for uncertainties in supply and demand and suggests a methodology to overcome the community budget deficit.</jats:p>"

It holds credibility amongst healthcare professionals and patients, across the Middle East and North African (MENA) markets. Their quality assurance is fostered by high levels of reliability and order fulfillment, which differentiates them from their competitors. Recently, they have been facing technology fatigue meant as an organization suffering from overwhelming options and choices in technology, this contributes to turbulent and confused states of mind when considering technology adaptation. This case evolves specifically from a procurement perspective, the pressure of high expectation and severe compliance clauses from key suppliers, particularly large corporations with monopolies in supplies who have the tendency to dominate and dictate terms to the small and medium enterprises (SMEs). For example, forcing SME’s to adopt specific technological frameworks to be trade partners. Another conflict is that while the SME’s do value the contribution of the procurement function, the shift from tactical to strategic mindset is not robust enough. Is this a dilemma? Ms Mary buyer at Al-Rumman Pharma, which is SME in operation, is facing challenges from key suppliers because of her tactical buying approach and adoption of multiple technological frameworks from various key suppliers, which are neither integrated nor compatible with each other. Her transition from traditional buying to a more strategic sourcing approach is what the need of the hour is. Prior information technology role was more as support at Al-Rumman Pharma and Chief Executive Officer Dr Mubeen Ahmad Khan did technology adopted decisions in isolation but today the company needs an integrative approach with forward thinking and also kept the legacy intact.

The decision rule between two channels is Nash game in Case 1, while it is Stackelberg game in Case 2. From manufacturer Stackelberg (MS), retailer Stackelberg (RS), and Nash game (VN) theoretic perspectives, nine game models are developed to examine the effect of product substitutability and relative channel status on pricing decisions at both horizontal competition and vertical competition levels. The analysis suggests that the type of price leadership scenarios, the level of product substitutability, and the relative channel status play a significant role in decision making. For instance, in case 1, the symmetric leadership (two manufacturers or two retailers are leaders) is always the dominant strategy and equilibrium for either two manufacturers or two retailers regardless of product substitutability and relative channel status. Nevertheless, the asymmetric leadership may lead channel members to encounter a prisoner’s dilemma if the relative channel status is small. By contrast, in Case 2, the symmetric leadership is not the unique dominant strategy for either two manufacturers or two retailers. In contrast to many earlier results, we also show that whether the first-mover and the late-mover advantages exist, depending on the level of related channel status.</jats:p>",

Using Bellman’s continuous dynamic programming theory, this work obtains the optimal feedback strategies of price and big-data marketing effort, brand goodwill, return rate of used products and corporate profits under the three business models. Comparing the three scenarios and analyzing the sensitivity of key exogenous parameters, it can be found that the involvement of Internet service platform has a crucial impact on the sustainable profitability of supply chain enterprises. Considering the reference price effect of consumers, enterprises should adopt different strategic alliances in different periods, which can also gain new development momentum in the context of data-driven marketing, achieve the improvement of the triple-bottom line of closed-loop supply chain and even reach a win-win situation for supply chain enterprises.</jats:p>"

It is shown that the various problems of stabilizing the voltage levels in the traction network and reducing electrical energy losses can be solved. The computer-aided modeling indicates that to install RPS into all phases of traction substations is the best way to stabilize voltage levels in traction networks and reduce electrical energy losses. When the reactive power sources are present in the free phase, traction network losses increase in comparison with the option when the RPS are not present. The installation of sources in the retarding or leading phase allows stabilizing voltage in the load utilizing equipment, reducing losses and non-symmetry in supply mains. The best option in terms of electrical energy losses is connecting the RPS to the leading phase. In terms of non-symmetry in supply mains, the best performance is produced when the RPS are installed in the retarding phase.</jats:p>",

The safety, stability, reliability, and efficiency of this water system are critical for the daily work and livelihood of the people dependent on it. However, with the development of cities in China, the water supply systems in urban communities require constant re-building and improvement, which complicates the system. Considering the defects of obsolete design, lack of information, and irregularity of the constructions over the years, the maintenance of underground pipelines in older communities is onerous and arduous. In this work, the older pipeline system at the Taibai campus of Northwest University, Shaanxi Province, was taken as one typical old urban community and investigated by different measures. Detection was performed from the available concentrated water supply wells to surrounding areas combining electromagnetic induction, geophysical method by ground-penetrating radar (GPR), and acoustic detection methods. Applying the integrated detection method and considering known pipeline network designs, the properties and complex relationships of different pipeline materials (cast iron, polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) were determined. In addition, a spatial distribution map of the pipes from wells and the main input water supply pipelines was achieved. The results suggest that the integrated detection scheme combining these three methods provides an effective approach to analyze complex water supply pipelines in older communities, in which each single detection method has more uncertainties. The study provides valuable references for similar communities in many developing countries.</jats:p>"

The main innovation is application of a glass blocks instead of the ordinary glass panels. A mathematic model of a Trombe wall with a glass block has been developed, which takes into account the radiative and convective heat-mass-exchange between air of a room and a Trombe wall.

This paper discusses the optimization of the water price for public water supply by considering the dominant parameters related to operational costs, government subsidies, and the ability to pay. The study location is the Jatigede reservoir, located in the Province of West Java with an effective reservoir volume of 877 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, and supplying public water supply at a rate of 3.5 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/s. To investigate the feedback loop of the complex system of water price optimization, the system dynamics approach was applied. The study results showed that the water tariff for raw water reaches a numerical balance and can meet the annual operation and maintenance costs by up to 100%. The results of the analysis of the system dynamics model showed that the optimal price for raw water supply is lower than the price of raw water in other river basins.</jats:p>",

This causes the growth of healthy business phenomena such as supplements and herb in Thailand. Cordyceps which is known as “winter worm summer grass” is a famous Chinese herbal medicine and very expensive because it is rare. People believe that it provides benefits for enhancing health and boosting energy. Today Thai farmers and entrepreneurs can cultivate cordyceps by themselves resulting in widespread use and lower the price. The objective of this research is to analyze a cordyceps beverage supply chain of a small-sized entrepreneur using Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0). It explains the overall flow of business and related activity of cordyceps beverage. Then we conduct an analysis of the current problems and recommend how to improve the efficiency of the supply chain. Currently, there is a lack of systematic data collection, no proper KPI and inventory policy and low forecast accuracy. We recommend the entrepreneur to use the spreadsheet for forecasting and record data, create KPI to evaluate performance, set standard and target. Establish an inventory policy to manage material and evaluate supplier’s performance. We hope our research will promote the entrepreneur to stay competitive in the dynamic market.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the adequacy of dentist supply and to predict the proper supply of dentists in Korea for the next 10 years. Methods and materials: Using the data from 2004 to 2017 in the Statictics Korea, the dental needs were measured as days of admission and the annual total dental care hours in 2020, 2023, 2026 and 2030 were predticted using regression analysis. The dental care productivity (average in-office hours) of dentists was analyzed using regression analysis including age, gender, education level and region as a confounder. The annual care hours were predicted according to seven scenarios based on the percentage of women among dentists, post-dentist education levels, the percentage of dentists in the metropolitan area, aging and retirement age. Results: The needed dentist based on the data in the Statictics Korea will be 27, 288 ~ 27, 311 in 2020, 28,104 ~ 28,1785 in 2023, 28,977 ~ 29,124 in 2026, and 30,174 ~ 30,413 in 2030. On the other hand, the number of dentists in Korea will be 26,945 in 2020, 28,813 in 2023, 30,682 in 2026 and 33,173 in 2030. The adequacy index of dentist supply will be -0.01 in 2020 to +0.10 in 2030. Conclusions: Our data showed that dentists will be adequately supplied in Korea for the next 10 years. Overall, the ratio between dentist versus 1,000 Koreans will be increased from 0.5 in 2019 to 0.7 in 2020, which will meet the mean of OECD countries.</jats:p>",

Firstly, such areas as the Far East, Eastern Siberia and the northern part of Western Siberia are difficult to access. Secondly, the gas pipeline located next to settlements does not always guarantee affordable gasification of the area. Larger consumers benefit from liquefied gas. The article suggests methodological recommendations for choosing rational gas supply schemes for consumers. Ensuring the proper level of gasification of the country will improve, and in some areas create, energy infrastructure, ensure economic growth in the regions, improve the ecological situation, and also partially solve problems with overpopulation in the central regions of the country through the active development of remote territories of the Russian Federation [1, 2, 3]. Thus, the issue of gasification of the Russian Federation does not lose its relevance to this day. A promising direction is development of the gas supply in rural areas. The weak infrastructure of the countryside strongly inhibits the economic development of the country as a whole. The proper level of gasification will ensure the creation of industries that do not require powerful energy sources and a large number of service personnel.</jats:p>",

We explored firms’ choices of governance in a specific context of Vietnam, where legal institution is characterized by a weak legal system for contractual enforcement and socio-economic institution is characterized by transition from central planning into market mechanism. This study examines how firms in the cassava sector in Vietnam structure their transactions and how supply network governance relates to certain supply network outcomes. A comparative case study method was adopted in this research. Two cassava supply networks, of which one is traditional type and another is led by a foreign invested firm, were selected for study. Our findings indicate that institutional context, supply chain structure, product characteristic, relationship investment influence on firms’ choices of governance and firms’ choices of governance affect supply chain network outcomes and local firms’ catching up. In the absence of legal enforcement, market governance is popularly applied in the supply chain with fragmented structure while relational governance is a popular used in more concentrated supply network. Higher value creation and more possibilities for catching up but more inequality in income distribution in supply chain with large scale lead firm. Lower value creation, rare possibilities for catching up but more equality in income distribution in supply chain with fragmented small scale firms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstrak&lt;/strong&gt;: Kajian ini menyelidiki tentang bagaimana transaksi antar perusahaan diorganisasikan dalam sebuah pasar yang sedang berkembang, serta bagaimana tata kelola jaringan pasokan mempengaruhi hasil jaringan pasokan dan mengejar ketertinggalan dari penggabungan pasar perusahaan.

About 50% of under-nutrition around the world is associated with infections caused by unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene. However, there are limited available data which associate water supply, sanitation and hygiene practices and childhood malnutrition in Ethiopia particularly in the study area. Therefore, the objective of this study was designed to examine the association of water supply, sanitation and hygiene interventions and childhood malnutrition.<jats:bold>Methods: </jats:bold>Case-control study design was conducted from December 2018 to January 2019 Kersa and Omo Nada districts of Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. Randomly 126 cases and 252 controls were selected from the malnourished children and normal children, respectively. A pretested, structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify the study variables associated with childhood malnutrition and to adjust for confounders. The crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence interval was calculated to assess the level of significance and reported for each confounding variable.<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The results of this study showed that <jats:bold>c</jats:bold>hildren living with mothers/caregivers lack of formal education were found to have 57% times less likely developed malnourished, compared to those living with mother/caregiver who attended secondary and above (AOR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.26-1.24). The odds of having malnutrition were increased among children who were breastfed after one hour of birth (AOR=2.60; 95% CI: 1.02-6.65) and children who had diarrhea (AOR=9.50; 95% CI: 5.19-17.36).Collecting water from a distance of less than/equal to one kilometer (AOR=2.52; 95% CI: 0.56-11.39), defecating in open pit(AOR=1.33; 95% CI: 0.62-2.83),under-five children open field defecation practices (AOR=1.17; 95% CI: 0.42-3.23) and lack of hand washing at critical times (AOR=2.38; 95% CI: 1.07-5.29) were positively associated with childhood malnutrition. <jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>: We conclude that improvement in the initiation of breastfeeding within one hour, diarrhea prevention, use of improved latrine and hand washing at critical times is needed to improve the nutritional status of children.</jats:p>"

A successful distribution system requires an effective distribution strategy selection and optimum route planning at the right time and minimum cost. Furthermore, customer’s demand and location can vary from order to order. In this situation, a mixed delivery system is a good solution for it and allows the use of different strategies together to decrease delivery costs. Although the “distribution strategy selection” is a critical issue for companies, there are only a few studies that focus on the mixed delivery network problem. There is a need to propose an efficient solution for the mixed delivery problem to guide researchers and practitioners. This paper develops a new “modified” savings-based genetic algorithm which is named “distribution strategy selection and vehicle routing hybrid algorithm (DSSVRHA).” Our new algorithm aims to contribute to the literature a new hybrid solution to solve a mixed delivery network problem that includes three delivery modes: “direct shipment,” “milk run,” and “cross-docking” efficiently. It decides the appropriate distribution strategy and also optimal routes using a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles at minimum cost. The results of the hybrid algorithm are compared with the results of the optimization model. And the performance of the hybrid algorithm is validated with statistical analysis. The computational results reveal that our developed algorithm provides a good solution for reducing the supply chain distribution costs and computational time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Growth of coastal dunes requires a marine supply of sediment. Processes that control the sediment transfer between the sub-tidal and the supra-tidal zone are not fully understood, especially in sand flats close to inlets. It is hypothesised that storm surge events induce sediment deposition on sand flats, providing fresh material for aeolian transport and dune growth. The objective of this study is to identify which processes cause deposition on the sand flat during storm surge conditions and discuss the relationship between the supra-tidal deposition and sediment supply to the dunes. We use the island of Texel as a case study, of which multi-annual topographic and hydrographic data sets are available. Additionally, we use the numerical model XBeach to simulate the most frequent storm surge events for the area. Results show that supra-tidal shore-parallel deposition of sand occurs in both the numerical model and the topographic data. The amount of sand deposition is directly proportional to surge level and can account for more than a quarter of the volume deposited at the dunes yearly. Furthermore, storm surges are also capable of remobilising the top layer of sediment of the sand flat, making fresh sediment available for aeolian transport. Therefore, in a sand flat setting, storm surges have the potential of reworking significant amounts of sand for aeolian transport in periods after the storm, and as such can also play a constructive role in coastal dune development.\n                        </jats:p>"

Cholera surveillance databases from the Ministry of Health were analyzed to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of the outbreak using epidemic curves and maps.<jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>From January 2017 to November 2018, a total of 1,712 suspected cholera cases were reported in Kinshasa. During this period, the most affected health zones included Binza Météo, Limeté, Kokolo, Kintambo and Kingabwa. Following implementation of the response strategy, the weekly cholera case numbers in Binza Météo, Kintambo and Limeté decreased by an average of 57% after two weeks and 86% after four weeks. The total weekly case numbers throughout Kinshasa Province dropped by 71% four weeks after the peak of the outbreak.<jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold>During the 2017-2018 period, Kinshasa experienced a sharp increase in cholera case numbers. To contain the outbreak, water supply and hygiene response interventions targeted case households, nearby neighbors and public areas in case clusters using a grid approach. Following implementation of the response, the outbreak in Kinshasa was quickly brought under control. A similar approach may be adapted to quickly interrupt cholera transmission in other urban settings.</jats:p>"

The research results show that: first, a two-part tariff contract can effectively coordinate the IBWT green supply chain and improve operational performance; second, the fully/partial backlogging strategy can effectively improve the operational performance of the IBWT green supply chain; third, fully backlogging is the first-best strategy and partial backlogging is the second-best strategy for the IBWT green supply chain.</jats:p>",

Consistent with the importance of the household demand channel, we find that credit supply expansion boosts nontradable sector employment and the price of nontradable goods, with limited effects on tradable sector employment.

The study was conducted in 2017 and involved 144 farms selected on purpose, with animals of native breeds such as cattle, sheep and pigs. The territorial scope of the research covered the Lubelskie, Małopolskie and Podkarpackie province. The method of direct interview (PAPI) was used to obtain information. The use of short supply chains for the sale of farm produced food has positive effects. Farmers see the greatest benefits in improving farm functioning in such business areas like profitability, integration with other participants of the local market and image change. As food of animal origin on farms is produced and offered to consumers, a transition from the sale of agricultural raw materials to higher added value food products takes place. For farmers, another important area of farm functioning, which benefit from selling food in short supply chains, is the integration links between the farm and other local market players. The integration of actors involved in the production and distribution of food is one of the success factors of such undertakings and contributes to the relationships between sectors of the local economy. The image of the farm belongs to non-material elements which build trust and links with customers and, consequently, decide about the prosperity of the business.</jats:p>",

A novel approach combines the use of magnetic particles which can capture heavy metal impurities in microfluidic ducts. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mixing mechanism of two water streams, one with magnetic particles and the other with wastewater. The optimum mixing is obtained when particles are uniformly distributed along the volume of water in the duct for the combined action of a permanent, spatially and temporally aligned magnetic field. Results showed that mixing is enhanced as the frequency of the magnetic field decreases or its amplitude increases, while magnetic gradient is found to play an insignificant role in the present configuration. Moreover, for simulations with low frequency, the mean concentration of particles is found to be twice as high as compared to the cases with higher frequency. Optimum distribution of particles inside the micromixer is observed for the combination of 0.6 T, 8 T/m and 5 Hz for the magnetic magnitude, gradient and frequency, respectively, where concentration reaches the optimal value of 0.77 mg/mL along the volume of the duct.</jats:p>",

Safe operation is supposed to be ensured through analysis and prevention of possible emergency situations. The development of the transport standby mathematical models is based on the energy equivalence of subscriber subsystems of heat supply systems, which distinguishes the obtained mathematical models from existing analogues. To evaluate the impact of parametric optimization results on economic indicators, a computational experiment was conducted. As an object of study, the design scheme of a residential neighborhood was considered. An analysis of the computational experiment results proved the efficiency of the obtained transport standby mathematical models for running heat supply systems. It is possible to provide transport standby for systems of any sizes and configurations or for the studied fragments of these systems.

In this study, MDC performance and water biofouling conditions were tested as an efficient pretreatment desalination process of reverse osmosis (RO). The experiments were designed in a three-chamber reactor to compare the performance of batch and continuous fed modes, using bio-cathode and synthetic wastewater in four different hydraulic retention times and 17 and 35 g/L NaCl concentrations. According to the results, maximum salt removal of about 52.3% was obtained in the continuously fed MDC at 35 g/L NaCl concentration. The maximum salt removal at 17 g/L NaCl was also observed in continuous mode. The anolyte pH in both batch and continuous modes dropped from 7 to 6.32, 6.47 and 6.37, 6.48 in 17 and 35 g/L NaCl concentrations respectively. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal values in the continuous mode were 61 and 65% in the anolyte and catholyte respectively, higher than those of fed-batch MDC. The biofouling of the middle chamber solution was confirmed by conducting bio-microbial tests. Our results suggest that the type of hydraulic flow can improve the performance of MDC in different concentrations of NaCl.</jats:p>",

Due to their properties, PMOC might be partially eliminated by advanced water treatment technologies. The goal of this study is to investigate the rejection of 22 PMOC (highly mobile and persistent) by reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes. The impact of transmembrane pressure was evaluated through laboratory-scale cross-flow constant pressure filtration tests. Among the investigated experimental conditions, PMOC rejection with NF at eight bars is comparable to values obtained on RO at 15 bars. Negatively charged PMOC are highly rejected by both RO and NF membranes while guanidine-like compounds exhibit higher passage values and are strongly impacted by transmembrane pressure. In order to model the rejection mechanism, decision tree methodology was employed to link PMOC physicochemical properties to rejection values. Based on laboratory-scale results, decision trees were computed and emphasized that the NF rejection mechanism is governed by electrostatic interaction and sieving effects. In contrast, PMOC rejection on the RO membrane strongly depends on the topological polar surface area (TPSA) of the PMOC. This study suggests that micropollutant TPSA should be more investigated in order to describe RO removal efficiency. Moreover, it is shown that the decision tree is a powerful numerical tool in order to reveal the specific sequence leading to micropollutant removal by RO and NF membranes.</jats:p>",

Herein, a zero-gap CDI cell fixture with various flow configurations was utilized to investigate the effects of flow directionality on the CDI performance of activated carbon cloth (ACC) electrodes. Salt adsorption capacities and salt adsorption rates were determined for three commonly studied flow field designs (parallel (PFF), interdigitated (IDFF), and serpentine (SFF)) at various flow rates (2–128 mL/min). Increasing the flow rate was found to result in decreasing CDI performance for SFF and IDFF designs. On the other hand, the peak performance was observed for the parallel flow field at 32 mL/min flow rate. Additionally, the pressure drop values for different flow configurations were measured, and the energy consumptions were calculated. Overall, the findings showed that the performance of CDI systems strongly depends on the selected flow field geometry. Among the tested flow fields, the parallel configuration offered the best balance between CDI performance and energy efficiency. However, the designs that exert high hydrodynamic forces on the electrode plane showed poor performance due to rip-off of ions from the double layer causing a significant capacity loss for ACC electrodes.</jats:p>",

This study analysed the impact of these import quota and reference price policies on the shallot price and supply in North Sumatera.

This research was conducted in Nekmese Village in Kupang Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province. This village is one of the villages that has not received good clean water services, even though this village has sufficient availability of clean water throughout the season. This study aims to examine the perception of rural communities in the provision of sustainable clean water. Data collection is done by observation and survey by interview and questionnaire. The results showed that 41% of respondents felt they were insufficient in providing clean water, while the other 59% felt they were insufficient. This fact is supported by the data on the use of clean water on average by 40 Lpcd. For the sustainability of clean water supply, the results of the study show positive perceptions from the community, but contrary to wasteful measures in water use, maintenance of water sources and participation in water supply in his village. This could be due to the low level of public education, and lack of hearing about information about clean water. The research recommends increasing the awareness and participation of the community in the provision of sustainable clean water.</jats:p>",

With the expansion of market demand, people have put forward higher requirements for the safety and quality of cold chain logistics, which provide opportunities for the development of cold chain logistics enterprises. In recent years, due to the deterioration of the world environment and the continuous consumption of resources, green sustainable development has become an inevitable trend of society and the development of the times. The drawbacks of the traditional cold chain logistics continue to be highlighted. If the cold chain logistics enterprises with high energy consumption and serious pollution want to obtain the opportunity of survival, they must integrate the concept of green development into the company’s operation and management. Based on this, the paper builds a performance evaluation system for cold chain logistics enterprises based on green supply chain, and uses fuzzy analytic model to evaluate enterprise efficiency. After research, it is found that the scale but the low efficiency is an important reason that affects the development of China’s cold chain logistics enterprises. In order to achieve green and efficient operation, enterprises must accelerate capital management, and at the same time optimize talents and technology to gain market share in the wave of green sustainable development.</jats:p>",

The earthquake caused fatalities and damage to infrastructures, including the facilities of clean water. The main objective of this study is to know the impact of the earthquake towards clean water facilities damage, and to analyse clean water demand and supply after earthquakes in North Lombok Regency. Another purpose is to propose disaster mitigation to be implemented in the other disaster prone regions of Indonesia. The primary data were collected through field survey and questionnaire samples of 110 respondents. Secondary data regarding the damage of clean water network were collected from the Regional Water Company (PDAM) of North Lombok. The results of this study show that many clean water facilities were damaged due to earthquake. The amount of clean water demand in Lombok Island after the earthquake was decreased by 19.03%. The number of wells users after the earthquake increased from 22.73% to 57.27%. The potential groundwater for clean water in the Lombok Island is more than sufficient to fulfil the requirement of clean water during disaster. However, further studies are required to realize such idea.</jats:p>",

However, the linkage of root morphology to anatomy and root nutrient, and its implication for root function at the heterogeneous application of bio-organic and chemical fertilizer have not yet been defined, especially for pear trees.Results: In this study, a split-root experiment was conducted using 1-year old ‘Cuiguan’ trees. No fertilizer (NF), chemical fertilizer (CF), and bio-organic fertilizer (BIO) were paired to test six combinations: NF-NF, NF-CF, NF-BIO, CF-CF, BIO-BIO, and BIO-CF. Root morphological, anatomical traits and root nutrient concentrations, and their relationships were determined. Trees receiving BIO had significantly higher lateral root numbers, activity, total lateral root length, and specific root length than trees receiving no BIO, while the effects on root tissue density were the direct opposite. Compared with CF-CF treatment, root xylem thickness, stele diameter, vessel diameter, and number of vessels all increased in response to BIO-CF treatment. Root growth was synergistically promoted in BIO-CF, with increased special root length and root nitrogen concentration, but root tissue density and the carbon:nitrogen ratio were reduced. Intriguingly, the synergistic effect resulted in greater trunk girth without sacrificing height, compared to trees receiving CF or BIO alone.Conclusions: The combination of BIO and CF improves root traits and tree growth, suggesting that using bio-organic fertilizer as a supplement to reduce the application rate of chemical fertilizer is beneficial to orchard ecosystems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, the clamp double sub‐module (CDSM) topology with its DC fault clearance ability has become more attractive for use in the modular multilevel converter (MMC)‐based high‐voltage DC transmission systems. However, the capacitor voltage imbalance caused by the discreteness of the device parameters during the uncontrolled pre‐charging process seriously affects the system's safe start‐up. To solve this problem, this study provides a novel CDSM‐MMC capacitor static voltage balance method. Since the power supplies obtaining energy from the CDSM capacitors greatly influence the static voltage balance, the power supply input current is chosen as the control variable. On the basis of the control signals generated by the voltage balance algorithm, the control of the CDSM power supply input currents makes the arm energy be an average distribution in the CDSM capacitors. This method can replace the capacitor equalising resistors of CDSM to achieve capacitor voltage balance and can reduce the CDSM‐MMC's losses. The method requires no additional circuits, and the control strategy is simple. Moreover, the method can apply to the static voltage balance control of other SM topologies with two capacitors. An arm cascaded with two CDSMs is tested and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

We then use the triangular fuzzy number method to define the uncertain demands and convert the model into its equivalent auxiliary crisp counterpart. To derive Pareto solutions more efficiently, we propose the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve the model. Finally, we apply the model framework and solution method to a real-world case of regional timber supply in Fujian, China, to demonstrate their applicability. The simulation results of the model show that trade-offs exist between total cost and GHG emissions and that the proper selection of the number and locations of distribution centers can help reduce both the cost and GHG emissions. Demand uncertainty and supply fluctuations across different time periods can increase the cost and GHG emissions. Our empirical results provide useful insights into the design and management of regional timber supply networks, and our generic model is applicable to the analysis of regional supply networks of other products or materials besides timber. </jats:p>",

This article contributes to the debate by situating the Accord within a broader set of activities that buyers are engaged in to promote better labour conditions in their supply chains. The authors identify three approaches of buyer engagement: auditing, capacity building and advocacy. Drawing on interviews conducted with European brands and retailers, the article shows how buyers perceive the merits and challenges of these approaches, and whether and how they discharge responsibility and power through these activities. The study shows that the Accord is seen primarily as part of the auditing approach with a key feature being its use of collective leverage as a means of enforcement. While greater buyer power has not necessarily been accompanied by greater responsibility, the article highlights heterogeneity among buyers in how they take up different approaches, painting a more nuanced picture of buyer responsibility and power.</jats:p>",

In Colombia, there is a social program called Bienestarina, which aims to promote food and nutritional security in a vulnerable population. Although the government supports the program for improving nutritional support, there are currently inconsistencies in freight flows, lack of coverage in some areas, and delivery delays. Therefore, this work aims to evaluate the current configuration of the supply chain and propose improvements related to the facility location. Such advances would enable the increase in the efficacy of the network and the reduction of malnutrition in the country. For this purpose, a mixed-integer mathematical programming model is presented, which considers the weighted distance criterion for different demand scenarios and supports the location-allocation decision in a social assistance supply chain. The current network configuration was compared with the optimal proposed structure. The comparisons show highly potential improvements in freight flow allocation, suggests several variations in the existing warehouses emplacement, and generates public policy implications to reduce the logistic cost in the system, prioritizing in turn the demand covering.</jats:p>"

The greater availability of georeferenced databases together with the more and more extensive use of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) is materialising in the proliferation of studies analysing the distribution patterns of tourist territories. The present study uses these techniques to study the degree of equilibrium in the distribution of places and its level of occupation in a region where the use of expansionary policies of growth of the tourism sector has been able to cause a strong imbalance in said activity, i.e., the case of the region of Extremadura. To verify this, both global contrasts, global Moran’s I and G (d) of Getis and Ord, are used, as well as local contrasts, to map LISA (Local Indicators of Spatial Association). The results obtained confirm the existence of strong imbalances in the effectiveness of the places created while allowing the identification of different clusters of high and low values.

This article investigates how far sustainable practices and circular economy concepts have been implemented in retail returns systems; it identifies vulnerabilities, barriers, and challenges to the implementation of sustainable, circular practices and suggests ways to overcome them, as sustainability, loss prevention, and profit optimisation can go hand in hand with the right approach to the organisation of the reverse supply chain. Implications of this research on strategic management are outlined. The research was conducted using in‐depth interviews and observations with four major retailers in the United Kingdom, 17 structured interviews, 100 retailer website reviews, and three retail community workshops, all with British and other European retailers.</jats:p>",

Packaging systems have evolved to be smarter with integration of emerging electronics and wireless communication and cloud data solutions. Although there are many factors causing the loss and waste issues for foods throughout the whole supply chain of food and there have been several articles showing the recent advances and breakthroughs in developing smart packaging systems, this review integrates these conceptual frameworks and technological applications and focuses on how innovative smart packaging solutions are beneficial to the overall quality and safety of food supply by enhancing product traceability and reducing the amount of food loss and waste. We start by introducing the concept of the management for the integrated food supply chain, which is critical in tactical and operational components that can enhance product traceability within the entire chain. Then we highlight the impact of smart packaging in reducing food loss and waste. We summarize the basic information of the common printing techniques for smart packaging system (sensor and indicator). Then, we discuss the potential challenges in the manufacturing and deployment of smart packaging systems, as well as their cost‐related drawbacks and further steps in food supply chain.</jats:p>",

The result showed that there were two Gayo Arabica coffee supply chain models. First, for specialty processed coffee, there are five supply chains, namely farmers, rural traders, red cherry traders, specialty processors, and coffee shop. The farmer’s share value is 5.15%, the share of collecting traders is 5.25%, the share of red cherry traders is 6.25%, the share of specialty processing is 7.25%, and the coffee shop’s share is 80%. Second, for premium or conventional coffee, there are 5 (five) chains, namely farmers, rural traders, hard skin coffee traders, district traders, regency trader (cooperatives and exporters). The share margin farmer’s is 15%, collecting trader’s share is 47%, hard skin coffee trader’s share is 76%, regency trader’s share is 86%, the share of cooperatives and exporters is 100%. The supply chain performance of Gayo Arabica coffee has not been optimally profitable, and the marketing margin has not been profitable for supply chain actors.</jats:p>",

Frequent severe droughts induce water shortages in agricultural reservoirs. The role of drought monitoring and prediction is critical for mitigating the effects of severe drought in agricultural areas. In this study, a compound standardized storage and precipitation index (CSSPI) was developed that adapted the existing drought index-the standardized precipitation index (SPI)-by adding hydrological data on storage rate. Furthermore, the future storage rate was simulated using autoregressive models (AR) to estimate the future CSSPI. A dataset containing records of reservoirs and precipitation at the three areas of Jungbu, Youngnam, and Honam was applied to estimate the current and future status of the CSSPI. The results indicate that the CSSPIs generated accurately present the past pattern of the observed data and that they can be considered as inputs for predicting future drought conditions.</jats:p>",

Similarly, in this study, we propose using autonomous cars and drones to resolve conventional logistics and transport challenges faced by international humanitarian organizations (IHOs) during a relief operation. We do so by identifying, shortlisting, and elaborating critical success factors or key transport and logistics challenges from the existing humanitarian literature and present a conceptual model to mitigate these challenges by integrating unmanned ground (UGVs) and aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the humanitarian supply chain. To understand how this novel idea of using UGVs and UAVs could help IHOs, we drafted three research questions, first focusing on the identification of existing challenges, second concentrating on remediation of these challenges, and the third to understand realization timeline for UGVs and UAVs. This lead to the development of a semi-structured, open-ended questionnaire to record the respondents’ perspectives on the existing challenges and their potential solutions. We gathered data form, ten interviewees, with substantial experience in the humanitarian sector from six IHOs stationed in Pakistan and Austria. In light of the feedback for the second research question, we present a conceptual model of integrating UAVs and UGVs in the relief chain. The results of the study indicate that technological advancement in mobility withholds the potential to mitigate the existing challenges faced by IHOs. However, IHOs tend to be reluctant in adapting UGVs compared to UAVs. The results also indicate that the adaptation of these technologies is subject to their technical maturity, and there are no significant differences in opinions found between the IHOs from Pakistan and Austria.</jats:p>",

The biogas generation potential used BMP bench-test (biochemical methane potential) biodigesters, in which the biogas production was qualitatively/quantitatively evaluated from CEASA waste codigested with different inocula (bovine ruminal fluid, goat manure and UASB reactor sludge) under mesophilic conditions for 80 days. The laboratory test showed that the waste inoculated with ruminant manures (goat and bovine) presented the lowest net volume of generated biogas compared to the other treatments.: 23.2 and 19.2 NmL.gds-1. On the other hand, the treatments with sludge and mixture of all the inocula generated the largest biogas volumes: 37.6 and 44 NmL.gds-1, respectively. A potential of 359 kWh.d-1 of electric power generation was estimated from the biogas generated at CEASA from the BMP bench assay, as well as from the quantitative and physicochemical parameters of the waste generated in this unit. The results indicate high potential for energy generation in the evaluated CEASA plant, promoting the recovery of these wastes as an alternative and renewable source for sustainable energy production, transforming environmental liabilities into potentially energetic assets of aggregate economic value.</jats:p>",

This type of predictive application appears in the literature reviewed on supply chains. This analysis was carried out in a comparative way with the heterogeneous and homogeneous weights of the neuron training.Findings: The main results of this research focus on predicting the level of integration in the supply chain from the neoronal network. This provides a coached neuron that can be applied in other studies and, therefore, predict the outcome. On the other hand, it is shown that if the weights of the integration level variables are not homogeneous, the procedure presents different results depending on the context in which it is developed.Research limitations/implications: Among the limitations of the implementation of neural networks it should be noted, the necessary adaptation to the characteristics of the supply chains and the areas of performance of the business organizations under study, in the framework of activities productive or service itself, in addition to analyzing its corporate purpose in relation to the satisfaction of certain needs of the target markets.Originality/value: The literature shows multiple theoretical sources that refer to studies of neural networks in supply chains, observing the opportunity to apply this technique to predict the level of integration due to its benefits for decision making. The originality of this scientific work lies in the possibility of comparing the historical data of the level of integration and those predicted as a result of the coaching of the neuron with the weights of the heterogeneous and homogeneous variables.</jats:p>"

This paper examines the supply side dynamics of this unprecedented public health phenomenon. We provide evidence for several interrelated supply-side elements that have contributed to the present public health crisis. We observe that initially, persistently high levels of prescription opioid availability and use exposed large proportions of the North American population to opioids, resulting in correspondingly high levels of medical and non-medical use (e.g., involving diversion). While various intervention measures to control prescription opioid availability and use have been implemented in recent years, leading to eventual reductions in opioid dispensing levels, these occurred late in the crisis’s evolution. Moreover, these supply reductions have not been met by corresponding reductions in opioid use or demand levels. These growing discrepancies between opioid demand and prescription-based sources have left major gaps in opioid supplies. In response to such supply gaps, highly potent and toxic illicit opioid products have rapidly proliferated across North America, and become a core driver of the dramatic spikes in opioid overdose fatality levels in recent years. These supply-related interrelations are corroborated by a corresponding increase in illicit opioid-related fatalities, which arose just as medical opioid supplies began to decrease in many jurisdictions. Improved analyses and understanding of the supply-side dynamics of the opioid crisis are urgently needed in order to inform future intervention and policy development. Meanwhile, the high mortality toll related to illicit, highly toxic opioid exposure requires sustained solutions, including supply-oriented measures (e.g., safer opioid distribution for at–risk users) towards improved public health protection.</jats:p>",

The possibility of optimizing the costs of antitumor drugs was studied using a model of a hypothetical region with a population of 2 million. A gradual replacement of the reference drugs with expiring patent protection by generics or biosimilars over 5 years was simulated. Two replacement scenarios were analyzed: 1) maintaining the drug consumption at a stable level; 2) increasing the drug consumption to the level identified in a previous retrospective analysis of the pharmaceutical market. The baseline scenario implied that the drug purchases remained unchanged (in physical and monetary terms) at the level of 2018. We calculated the difference between the drug costs in the baseline scenario and the costs of the same drugs replaced with generics or biosimilars for a 5 year period.</jats:p><jats:p>Results. By gradually replacing the reference drugs with generics or biosimilars in a region with a population of 2 million and keeping the costs of drugs for solid tumors at the 352.2 million rubles for 5 years (baseline scenario), 69.4 million rubles can be saved. That amount represents 19.7% of the base level if the drug consumption remains at the 2018 level. With an increase in the INN consumption after the release of generics/ biosimilars, no saving is expected; on the contrary, expenses will increase by 14.1% to 400 million rubles, although, an 8.45-fold increase in consumption is projected.</jats:p><jats:p>Conclusion. With the appearance of generics / biosimilars for the treatment of solid malignant tumors, the possibility of fund saving depends on the increase in drug consumption.</jats:p>"

A total of 80 groundwater samples were collected and analysed for major ions during pre- and post-monsoon seasons of 2012. Analytical results inferred that Ca, Mg, Cl, SO4 and NO3 surpass the desirable limit (DL) and permissible limit (PL) of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in both the seasons. The elevated content of total dissolved solids (TDS), Cl, SO4, Mg, Na and NO3 is influenced by precipitation and agricultural dominance. PIG results inferred that 52.5 and 35%, 30 and 37.5%, 12.5 and 20%, 2.5 and 5% groundwater samples fall in insignificant, low, moderate and high pollution category (PC) in pre- and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. PC 1 confirms salinity controlled process due to high inputs of TDS, Ca, Mg, Na, Cl and SO4. Also, PC 2 suggests alkalinity influence by pH, CO3, HCO3 and F content. PIG and statistical techniques help to interpret the water quality data in an easier way.</jats:p>",

Much of the existing literature assumes implicitly or explicitly that the manufacturers under QR can always meet the demand because the production capacity is always sufficient. However, when the order comes with a short lead time under QR, availability of the manufacturer's production capacity is not guaranteed. This motivates us to explore QR in supply chains with stochastic production capacity. Specifically, we study QR in a two‐echelon supply chain with Bayesian demand information updating. We consider the situation where the manufacturer's production capacity under QR is uncertain. We first explore how stochastic production capacity affects supply chain decisions and QR implementation. We then incorporate the manufacturer's ability to expand capacity into the model. We explore how the manufacturer determines the optimal capacity expansion decision, and the value of such an ability to the supply chain and its agents. Finally, we extend the model to the two‐stage two‐ordering case and derive the optimal ordering policy by dynamic programming. We compare the single‐ordering and two‐ordering cases to generate additional managerial insights about how ordering flexibility affects QR when production capacity is stochastic. We also explore the transparent supply chain and find that our main results still hold.</jats:p>",

Although there have been many sustainability efforts undertaken by PT Tetra Pak Indonesia, the perspective and implementation of its sustainable supply chain management has never been measured. This research was conducted to measure the perception and implementation of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) activities of PT.Tetra Pak Indonesia, in order to add information about the development of sustainable supply chain management practices in Indonesia. Data were collected in two ways: in depth interviews and questionnaires. Based on the result of interview and questionnaire, PT.Tetra Pak Indonesia gets an actual implementation index value of SSCM activities of 0.88, and has an overall perception index value of 0.85. This indicates that PT. Tetra Pak Indonesia is a company that has a perception towards sustainability and has actually implemented SSCM activities.</jats:p>",

Distributed photovoltaic power supply connected to bus power supply area further increases the uncertainty of bus load and directly affects the prediction accuracy. Aiming at the ultra-short-term load forecasting problem of bus with photovoltaic power supply under complex weather conditions, a method of bus ultra-short-term load forecasting based on feature selection and XGBoost is proposed. Firstly, a high-dimensional feature set is constructed with various influencing factors, and the XGBoost predictor is trained with the original feature set in the typical meteorological day historical data such as rainy and sunny days, and the degree of response between the bus load and the multi-factor is determined during the training process. Then, the MAPE value is used as the evaluation index. Forward search is used to select features to determine the optimal feature subsets of different typical weather day predictors. Finally, according to the selected optimal feature subsets, the optimal XGBoost prediction model for different weather days are established to predict the bus output of different weather days. Experiments on bus data with distributed photovoltaic in a certain area show that the new prediction model has higher prediction accuracy.</jats:p>",

A former monopolist, the state‐owned generator, is assumed to be (partially) privatized. First, we obtain that there is a relationship between privatization and the number of electric power generators concerning the level of consumer surplus and total welfare. Indeed, a fully state‐owned generator is socially optimal, lowering private generators' profits and enhancing consumer surplus; that is, if the degree of privatization decreases, consumer surplus increases compensating the damage imposed on generators' profits. Second, as the number of generators increases, full privatization may provide similar levels of consumer surplus and social welfare than those observed in a mixed oligopoly. Moreover, it is also obtained that price‐cost margins increase as marginal cost increases. Overall, our results suggest that the state‐owned generator should be privatized when entry barriers are low enough, and competitiveness is enhanced. Otherwise, a state‐owned generator may protect consumers, enhancing consumer surplus.</jats:p>",

These debris flows are triggered when overland flow driven by intense summer convective storms mobilizes large volumes of sediment within the channel network. Understanding the debris flow hazard in this, and similar alpine settings, requires determining the magnitude of sediment accumulation between debris flow seasons and identifying the control on sediment production. To address these knowledge gaps, we measured changes in sediment production using a sediment retention fence to quantify how sedimentation was influenced by temperature at the plot scale. These measurements were extrapolated to a larger area, where we extended the sediment fence results to explore how rockfall sedimentation contributed to channel refilling between active debris flow periods. This work shows that debris flow channel refilling is correlated with low temperatures and time in the frost‐cracking window, implicating frost‐weathering mechanisms as a key driver of sedimentation. This sediment production process resulted in a large amount of sediment accumulation during a single winter season in our study reach (up to 0.4 m in some locations). Using these observations, we develop a channel refilling model that generally describes the mass balance of debris flow watersheds in alpine areas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Rectifier locomotives have non-linear current-voltage characteristics and generate higher harmonics (HH) in the power supply networks, which is accompanied by the following negative effects: reduced equipment service life, distortion of electricity metering, occurrence of resonant processes, etc. Therefore, the problem of reducing the levels of harmonic distortion in the networks adjacent to the traction substations of the AC railways is of increased relevance. The level of HH generation depends on the design features of electric locomotives. Electric stock with zone-and-phase regulation creates high harmonic distortions, which results in increased losses, increased electromagnetic effects on adjacent power and telecommunication lines and reduced reliability of power supply. Electric locomotives with asynchronous traction motors (ATM) connected via 4q – S converters virtually do not distort the sinusoidality of the current curve. To measure the degree of reduction of harmonic distortion during the movement of locomotives with ATM, simulation modeling of non-sinusoidal modes of a typical 25 kV traction power supply system was carried out for two variants of the locomotives used: 1) VL-80R with DC motors; 2) UTY –1 with asynchronous traction motors. The methodology for determining non-sinusoidal modes is based on the technology of modeling electric power systems (EPS) in phase coordinates; at the same time, the models of EPS elements were formed as lattice schemes characterized by a fully connected topology. The parameters of these circuits can be recalculated to the frequencies of HH. The proposed approach is universal and can be used to study non-sinusoidal modes in existing and future traction power supply systems. The simulation results showed that the problem of increased harmonic distortion in the networks feeding the traction substations can be completely solved by replacing the acting locomotives with new-generation electric locomotives with asynchronous electric drives and four-quadrant converters.</jats:p>",

The lower level giving priority to renewable energy, which aims at maximizing the renewable energy power generation capacity, determines the size of renewable energy; The upper level ensuring the reliability of the system, which aims at minimizing the cost of the whole life cycle including the system initial investment, operation maintenance cost, fuel costs, environmental penalty cost and government subsidies, ultimately determines the optimal capacity configuration of different power sources in the system. Then a hybrid algorithm that combines the genetic algorithm with linear programming to solve this model is constructed. At last, by comparing the bilevel programming model with single layer and single target programming one, the validity and rationality of the model are fully verified, and the influence of the renewable energy penetration power limit, the cost of renewable energy units and the local climate factors on the optimization results are evaluated too.</jats:p>",

Reliable information on water yield, an important attribute of available water resources in a region, is vital to assess the potential for socio-economic development. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model is applied here to simulate water yield in the Bosten Lake basin. The spatial and temporal dynamics of water yield, and the response of water yield to land use and precipitation change, are analysed for the period 1985 to 2015. The results show that, overall, water yield increased during 1985–2015, and that the magnitude of change was greater in the eastern part of the region. The water yield capacity, positively correlated with precipitation, is highest under grassland vegetation and lowest in cultivated and unused land. The paper demonstrates that statistical downscaling and climate reanalysis data can be used in the InVEST model to improve the accuracy of simulated water yield in data scarce regions.</jats:p>",

Consumers’ concerns about their personal health and food safety have stimulated the demand for green agri-food, which has also made it important to focus on the green agri-food supply chain to improve the food quality and reduce the associated environmental concerns. This paper discusses coordination issues of the green agri-food supply chain under the background of farmers’ green farming and retailers’ green marketing, and the impact of a revenue-sharing contract on key decisions of supply chain participants. On the basis of the two-echelon green agri-food supply chain composed of a farmer and a retailer, a revenue-sharing contract was established that takes the cost of farmer’s green farming and retailer’s green marketing into account. Through the comparison of the model results, it is concluded that the revenue-sharing contract is beneficial to not only increase the greening level, but also improve both the farmer’s profit and the retailer’s profit. Moreover, the effectiveness of the revenue-sharing contract is positively correlated with consumers’ sensitivity to the greening level. Finally, the conclusion is verified by numerical simulation and some management suggestions are given.</jats:p>"

In order to solve a series of problems in the operation of power equipment supply chain, such as lower efficiency of equipment supply chain, higher supply cost and poor stability of supply chain, due to the characteristics of information asymmetry, incompleteness and time lag. The block chain technology is introduced into the supply chain of power grid equipment. A multiple linear regression model is established to analyze the economic value of the system, and the stability of the system is analyzed by combining the basic characteristics of block chains. The feasibility of the theory is verified by case analysis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the present paper a protective device based on the so-called “artificial” short circuit in the input of the network, is proposed. To ensure the necessary time for switching on the protection, the increased power supply voltage is delayed to reach in the input of the protected device by additional inductance L, which is connected in series to the power supply. As a result of this forced short circuit, the DC-power supply is switched off by a standard protective circuit-breaker. The short circuit is realized by a fast-acting semi-conductor device (e.g. diac + thyristor, etc.). The controlling signal is formed as a voltage across a capacitor that is a part of RC-circuits connected in parallel to the DC-power supply network. An analytical expression for this voltage, using a classical method for transient analysis, is obtained. The main aim is to determine the exact time of switching on the protection. The research is confirmed with simulations by OrCAD PSpice under the exact values of the elements in the RC-circuits considered. Two rapid increase cases in the power supply voltage are considered: positive jump and linear increase. The suggested solution is applicable for overvoltage protection of different electrical devices. The electrical scheme, based on the electronic components, ensures a fast-acting breaking, which guarantees secure protection. Based on the analytical expressions, the synthesis of the circuit for control and protection is made and the respective values of its elements are calculated.</jats:p>"

The study used the game theory reverse induction method to compare the Nash equilibrium solutions under different decision-making scenarios and discussed the chain member’s constraint condition of Blockchain system investment. We simulated and analysed the products’ lifecycle information sharing effort cost factor, the influence of price sensitivity coefficient, and expected profits of the supplier and retailer. The study results show that the product lifecycle information sharing effort under the Blockchain system increases the profit of the whole chain and decreases with the increase of customer’s price sensitivity coefficient.</jats:p>",

This study proposed a methodology for determining the location of measuring instruments during abnormal water quality issues. The proposed method focuses on analyzing the sensitivity of the flow path through a pipe. Additionally, this flow sensitivity through the tube is analyzed by considering both normal and abnormal conditions. The sensitivity of a pipe is the rate at which the water-flow direction changes. Further, a tube with low sensitivity under normal conditions but high sensitivity under abnormal conditions is the pipe for which the instrument should be first installed. The results were analyzed by applying the proposed methodology to a conventional virtual network. It is expected that, in future, the proposed method for determining the location of water quality gauges could be a useful tool for determining the location of instruments during emergencies.</jats:p>",

The results indicate divergent impacts of the different urgent scenarios on the logistics service supply chain: the price fluctuation can cause similar profit declines of the supplier and integrator, the reduced capacity can cause the supply chain’s price increase by 50%, and the demand risks can lead to similar changes of the upstream orders, prices and profits.

This leads to the use of distinct and new approaches to its management. In this article, according to the existing problems, a conceptual model of lean and agile supply chain in project-oriented organisations is presented by examining the lean functions and agility of supply chain discussion.   Research methodology: This research is descriptive-analytical in terms of method and applied in terms of purpose. This study's statistical population includes all managers and supply chain experts of project-based organisations and the statistical sample includes 105 people who have been selected using a purposive sampling method. After presenting the conceptual model, a researcher-made questionnaire was used to collect information and to examine the intended model, the structural equation approach with PLS software was used.   Results: The research findings indicate that the 114 identified items for the research model significantly explain their related components. The results of the model fit study showed that based on the convergent validity indices, Cronbach's alpha and Cronbach's alpha, and the subscription validity index and the exponential or redundancy validity index, the model is in the desired condition.   Limitation: This research only described Knowledge Based Centre.   Contribution: Organisations realised that relying on existing knowledge alone was not enough to compete in a competitive environment, and went beyond the boundaries of their organisation to acquire knowledge. Organisations considered customers as a very useful and knowledgeable resource, and activities should be done to interact with customers in leading organisations.</jats:p>"

The BDHC reduces the number of conversion stages when compared to the conventional solar PV based systems to supply the AC/DC loads. A non‐isolated buck–boost bidirectional DC–DC converter is used for charging and discharging of the battery to support the nanogrid. The power reference algorithm proposed in this study provides the proper utilisation of the solar PV in different operating conditions and uninterruptable power supply to the loads along with the battery storage management. A modulation scheme is implemented to operate the BDHC for generation of AC/DC hybrid outputs from a single input. The performance of the proposed system in different modes of operation has been evaluated using PSCAD simulation studies. A laboratory experimental setup is developed and control algorithms are implemented using LabVIEW based FPGA controller for verification of the results.</jats:p>",

The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy, transient photocurrent and EIS. The results showed that as-prepared CuS/Bi2WO6 has flower-like nano microspheres self-assembled by nanoplates and CuS nanorods are uniformly dispersed on its surface. The CuS/Bi2WO6 forms heterojunctions between CuS and Bi2WO6 and shows a wide light response range and a strong light response intensity. The CuS/Bi2WO6 exhibits a better Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation effect than pure Bi2WO6 and CuS, and it can degrade 90% RhB in 50 min and achieve complete degradation in 70 min under Xe lamp irradiation. The CuS/Bi2WO6 has photocatalytic activity in a low pH environment and good stability. The formation of a heterojunction between CuS and Bi2WO6 can effectively separate photo-generated electrons and holes, greatly improving the photocatalytic activity. In the CuS/Bi2WO6-RhB reaction system, O2− is the main active species, and it can rapidly remove the ethyl group from the amino group linked to benzene rings to achieve the N-de-ethylation reaction in the process of RhB degradation. The N-de-ethylated products are simultaneously degraded to small organic molecules and even mineralized into CO2 and H2O.</jats:p>",

Our research mainly has the following findings: Firstly, the government subsidy to the manufacturer can benefit these two parties and can have certain impact on the optimal decisions only by working with the green product market expansion efficiency. Secondly, these two parties’ fairness preference behaviors can cause serious damage to the other party’s profit and the overall profit of green supply chain, and increase the rate of their own profit in the overall profit of green supply chain, but the difference is that the retailer’s fairness preference behavior can cause a greater decline in product green degree and wholesale price, and when certain conditions are met, its own profit may rise compared to its fairness neutral, while the manufacturer’s fairness preference behavior can cause a greater damage to the overall profit of green supply chainand make its own profit always be lower than its fairness neutral. Thirdly, the government subsidy to the manufacturer and the fairness preference behaviors of both parties can cause a stack effect on the optimal solutions, which means that the subsidy government provides for the manufacturer can aggravate the negative influence caused by these two parties’ fairness preference behaviors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In current supply chain operations, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) procure parts from hundreds of globally distributed suppliers, which are often small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs). The SMEs also obtain parts from many other dispersed suppliers, some of whom act as sole sources of critical parts, leading to the creation of complex supply chain networks. These characteristics necessitate having a high degree of visibility into the flow of parts through the networks to facilitate decision making for OEMs and SMEs, alike. However, such visibility is typically restricted in real-world operations due to limited information exchange among the buyers and suppliers. Therefore, we need an alternate mechanism to acquire this kind of visibility, particularly for critical prediction problems, such as purchase orders deliveries and sales orders fulfillments, together referred as work orders completion times. In this paper, we present one such surrogate mechanism in the form of supervised learning, where ensembles of decision trees are trained on historical transactional data. Furthermore, since many of the predictors are categorical variables, we apply a dimension reduction method to identify the most influential category levels. Results on real-world supply chain data show effective performance with substantially lower prediction errors than the original completion time estimates. In addition, we develop a web-based visibility tool to facilitate the real-time use of the prediction models. We also conduct a structured usability test to customize the tool interface. The testing results provide multiple helpful suggestions on enhancing the ease-of-use of the tool.</jats:p>",

An electrochemical process was employed effectively to degrade azo reactive dye with the aim of reducing the production of carcinogenic chemicals during biodegradation. Textile dye C.I. Reactive Red 2 (RR2), a model pollutant that contains dichloro triazine ring, was subjected to the electrocoagulation process using aluminium (Al) electrodes. A maximum of 97% of colour and 72% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies were achieved and 9.5 kWh/kg dye electrical energy and 0.8 kg Al/kg dye electrode consumption were observed. The dye removal mechanism was studied by analysing the results of UV-Vis spectra of RR2 and treated samples at various time intervals during electrocoagulation. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectral studies were used for analysing the electrocoagulated flocs. The results indicate that in this process the dye gets removed by adsorption and there is no significant carcinogenic by-product formation during the degradation of dye.</jats:p>",

This study identifies optimal configurations of multi‐feedstock biomass‐to‐biorefinery supply chains and pertinent feedstock combinations based on spatial distribution of feedstock and lowest delivered cost to the biorefinery. We used the Supply Characterization Model (SCM) to allocate feedstock supplies to candidate biorefinery facilities. Model runs were performed for herbaceous energy crops, agriculture residue, and woody biomass available in 2017, 2022, 2025, and 2030 as estimated by the Policy Analysis System (POLYSYS) and Forest Sustainable and Economic Analysis Model (ForSEAM) models. Three feedstock supply scenarios were compared: (a) an herbaceous scenario: switchgrass, miscanthus, biosorghum, and corn stover; (b) a woody scenario: coppice wood, noncoppice wood, whole trees, and forestry residues, and (c) a mixed scenario: a combination of all feedstocks in herbaceous and woody scenarios. By 2030 the analyses predicted that 323, 168, and 473 biorefineries were sited in the herbaceous, woody, and mixed scenario, respectively, in the conterminous USA. Feedstock mixes supplied to the biorefineries were mostly dominated by a single feedstock. The most prominent feedstock mixes identified were: (1) switchgrass and miscanthus; (2) coppice and noncoppice wood; and (3) coppice wood, noncoppice wood, switchgrass and miscanthus. Biorefineries using multi‐feedstock would be beneficial for growth of bioeconomy, however flexible and cost‐effective conversion platforms should be developed to efficiently utilize multiple feedstocks. This analysis identifies biorefinery locations and feedstock supply mixes while minimizing delivered feedstock costs based on spatial and temporal feedstock availability. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

A revenue sharing contract was introduced to coordinate a competitive supply chain, in which the manufacturers have different fairness concerns based on centralized decision-making in terms of fairness neutrality. Then, we constructed two game models—the manufacturer’s peer-induced fairness concern model and the manufacturer’s distributional fairness concern model and analyzed the influence of a revenue sharing contract on the pricing decisions and profit distribution of a competitive supply chain considering fairness concerns. The results show that there is a revenue-sharing contract parameter in both the peer-induced and distributional fairness concerns of manufacturers, which can effectively realize Pareto improvements in a supply chain. Meanwhile, the retail and wholesale prices both decreased with the increase in the revenue-sharing ratio between retailers and manufacturers, and the profits of retailers decreased accordingly, but the overall utility of manufacturers and supply chains improved markedly. Moreover, the coordination condition is closely related to the level of fairness concerns of the manufacturers and the competition intensity between two manufacturers. The sharing contract designed in this study can not only effectively improve the utility of retailers and manufacturers but also enhance the total utility of the channel to ensure that node enterprises have long-term, stable, and cooperative relationships and to strengthen the overall competitiveness of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Products from the University of Toronto Food Label Information Program 2013 database (n = 15,200) were evaluated using Health Canada’s published criteria: thresholds for sodium, sugars and saturated fats that products cannot exceed in order to be M2K. The proportion of products exceeding no thresholds (i.e., permitted to be M2K), the number of thresholds exceeded, and the proportion exceeding each individual threshold were calculated overall and in the subsample of products displaying M2K on the packaging (n = 747). Overall, 18.0% of products would be permitted to be M2K, versus 2.7% of products displaying M2K. Sodium was the most exceeded threshold overall (57.5% of products), whereas sugars was the most exceeded by products displaying M2K (80.1%). Only 4.7% of all products versus 10.4% of products displaying M2K exceeded all three thresholds. These results highlight the importance of reintroducing federal regulations restricting M2K in Canada and including marketing on product packaging in the regulatory scope.</jats:p>"

By using simulations we identified a mechanism that intensifies the upward trend in ocean heat supply to the Arctic Ocean through Fram Strait. The reduction in sea ice export through Fram Strait induced by Arctic sea ice decline increases the salinity in the Greenland Sea, which lowers the sea surface height and strengthens the cyclonic gyre circulation in the Nordic Seas. The Atlantic Water volume transport to the Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean is consequently strengthened. This enhances the warming trend of the Arctic Atlantic Water layer, potentially contributing to the Arctic “Atlantification.” Our study suggests that the Nordic Seas can play the role of a switchyard to influence the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean.</jats:p>",

The plunge-pool patterns of aeration basins were classified into partially aerated, fully aerated, and vortex expelled, with increasing unit discharge. Relations between the distributions of the time-averaged pressure and the air concentration of the plunge-pools suggested that the ski-jump jet impact and the recirculating vortices are the main causes of plunge-pool air entrainment. Based on the export cross-section of the aeration basins, the bottom air concentrations remained greater than 3.0%. The sidewall air concentrations were greater than 7.5% and followed a logarithmic distribution in the vertical direction, demonstrating that the export flow attains a completely aerated state without any blackwater zones. In addition, increasing the aeration basin length was found to prevent the occurrence of a vortex expelled plunge-pool, thus promoting the appropriate pre-aeration effect under large unit discharges.</jats:p>",

This caused dischargings at the tip of the fracture and melting of the tip of the broken pin which form a river-shaped fracture and granular tissue. The plastic fracture with typical dimple morphology of the pins for the resistor tube occurred during the random vibration. The intergranular fracture appeared at the welding part of the electronic components for array power supply, which presented a brittle fracture mechanism. The fracture was dominated by a ductile fracture for components when the stress produced by the vibration was close to the yield strength of the material.

Considering the differences in purchase behavior, we divided customers into two groups—strategic customers and myopic customers. Furthermore, we distinguished three types of strategic customers according to their different preferences to analyze the optimal pricing and greenness strategies in sustainable supply chain in strategic customer scenarios. Our results led to the following conclusions. (1) Strategic customers’ individual preferences can affect optimum equilibrium and that a higher purchase price threshold can stimulate the manufacturer to improve greenness and set a higher price, while a higher greenness purchase threshold and purchase value threshold will force manufacturer to set a lower price. (2) We observed that strategic customers can increase demand and vender profit. As the number of strategic customers increases, selling price and greenness will experience downward trends in a price threshold scenario but upward trends in greenness threshold and value threshold scenarios. (3) A firm can take measures to mitigate the effects of strategic customers by adjusting price and greenness dynamically according to price and greenness sensitivity, which can play a leading role in actively influencing strategic customer behavior.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The cause of toxicity and damaging effects of uranium and its compounds on the body lies in radioactivity of uranium isotopes and their decay products as well as their high chemical activity. In view of the above, we conducted parallel studies of specific activities and concentrations of uranium in household and drinking water supply sources. Materials and methods. We studied specific activities of uranium-234 and uranium-238 in the centralized drinking water supply sources of the Republic of Khakassia exceeding control levels in terms of specific total alpha activity (Aα) and converted them to mass concentrations of uranium. Parallel analyses of uranium concentrations in water using the luminescent method according to GOST R 54499–2011 were performed. Results. Our assessment of the radionuclide composition of centralized drinking water supply sources showed that Aα levels exceeding control levels were largely due to natural radionuclides uranium-238 (contribution up to 25%) and uranium-234 (contribution up to 69%). Based on the specific activities of uranium-234 and uranium-238, we estimated masses (concentrations) of uranium in water ranging from 0.007 to 0.06 mg/L depending on the water source. In the parallel tests of water samples according to GOST R 54499–2011, uranium concentrations ranged from 0.007 to 0.061 mg/L. Conclusions. The uranium concentrations in the republican centralized drinking water supply sources estimated on the basis of uranium-234 and uranium-238 specific activities differed from the concentrations of uranium measured by the luminescent method according to GOST R 54499–2011 within the error of the test method. In some settlements uranium concentrations in water exceeded the hygienic standard of 0.015 mg/L (GN 2.1.5.2280–07).</jats:p>",

The treatments included: (i) JM3 (straw + Mg fertilizer), (ii) JM0 (straw + no Mg fertilizer), (iii) WM3 (no straw + Mg fertilizer), and (iv) WM0 (no Mg fertilizer + no straw). The results showed that the highest Mg accumulation stage in maize was prominent between the tasseling stage (VT) and blister stage (R2), and JM3 treatment accumulated 13.3% and 26.6% more Mg on average than those of the WM3 and WM0, respectively. Magnesium remobilization in distinct organs was highest in JM3 and there were significant differences between treatments. The total contribution to the grain for the JM3 treatment was higher by 6.0% and 17.9% on average than those for the WM3 and WM0, respectively.

In this research, an experimental platform, including Computed Radiography (CR) imaging system and a GIS model, is built, and extensive tests of different kinds of typical defects are studied. The influence X-ray irradiation on SF6 under different tube voltage levels is firstly examined, which proves that the withstand voltage of SF6 gas has not been affected and no dissociation has been found. Then, several kinds of defects are tested by X-ray digital imaging technology. The successful application examples of “visual” detection of defects further prove the practicability and validity of the X-ray digital imaging technique. Finally, the image database of typical defects inside of GIS is established and the defect risk is also analyzed in three levels, which would be useful for the defect severity diagnosis and risk assessment.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this paper researched the feasibility and characteristics of the surplus power entropy as the reliability index of the water supply network, and established a scheme framework for optimizing and improving the reliability of the water supply network. This paper developed a reliability evaluation model for the water supply network after an earthquake. Combined with the Monte Carlo stochastic simulation hydraulic analysis, this model is also based on the pressure-driven nodes water demand model. In the case study, the surplus power entropy method was applied to test the reliability of the model. The statistical curves of the surplus power entropy of nodes and pipe networks, the distribution of the surplus power entropy with different intensities in pipe networks, and the comparison results of three reliability improvement schemes, before and after, were obtained. The influence factors of the surplus power entropy were obtained from the data analysis. The high consistency between the surplus power entropy and flow entropy verifies the feasibility of the surplus power entropy as a reliability index. The three schemes show that the surplus power entropy index can be used as a beneficial supplement to the reliability evaluation index of the pipe network.</jats:p>"

The influence of the carrier frequency and the structure of the AVI on the shape of the current sine wave is analyzed. A comparison of the values of the coefficient of nonlinear distortions under the same conditions is made. The results are obtained using FFT Analysis in Simulink. The parameters of the induction motor have been calculated, the transient torque, velocity, and current transients of the motor stator and rotor have been obtained and compared. During operation, the engine, besides useful work, releases heat. This effect accompanies it throughout its operation, but overheating shortens the overall life of the machine. The presence of harmonics in the applied voltage can lead to excessive heating. Therefore, the purpose of this article was to compare the topologies of autonomous voltage inverters and to evaluate the effect on electrical and electromechanical motor performance in transients. Three-level AVI diagram of operation is considered. Technique from the aricle by Moshchinsky et al. was used to obtain unknown engine parameters based on passport data. The transients in the asynchronous motor make it clear that the autonomous inverters of both topologies at the tested frequencies make Simulink motor model to speed up to a nominal speed with about equal efficiency, which does not eliminate the fact that the shape of the currents and the electromagnetic torque is significantly distorted. The state of the machine and the losses in the transitional as well as the steady modes require further, more detailed study in the context of other articles.</jats:p>",

Several wireless sensor networks have been proposed for real-time monitoring of drinking water quantity and quality, both in the environment and in pipelines. However, surface fouling significantly affects the long-term reliability of pipes and sensors installed in-line. To address this relevant issue, we presented a multi-parameter sensing node embedding a miniaturized slime monitor able to estimate the micrometric thickness and type of slime. The measurement of thin deposits in pipes is descriptive of water biological and chemical stability and enables early warning functions, predictive maintenance, and more efficient management processes. After the description of the sensing node, the related electronics, and the data processing strategies, we presented the results of a two-month validation in the field of a three-node pilot network. Furthermore, self-powering by means of direct energy harvesting from the water flowing through the sensing node was also demonstrated. The robustness and low cost of this solution enable its upscaling to larger monitoring networks, paving the way to water monitoring with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution.</jats:p>"

As the cement sector is a crucial sector of the Chinese economy, understanding the role of supply‐ and demand‐side factors may help accelerate efforts to mitigate CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. However, few studies have analyzed the critical factors affecting CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions in the sector based on a combined supply‐ and demand‐side perspective. In this study, we developed an integrated framework that included eleven indicators covering both the supply and demand sides. Results revealed that improving cement production technology cannot offset CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions from the growth in demand for cement. Improving technology on the supply side would considerably reduce CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions from Chinese cement production; nevertheless, the combination of rapid urbanization, GDP growth, and an ultra‐high fixed capital formation ratio on the demand side increased CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions nearly 25‐fold from 1990 to 2015. Notably, some demand‐side factors also had an effect that reduced CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. The in‐use stock per unit of fixed capital formation and output per in‐use stock reduced CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions by 332 million metric tons, which is comparable to the contribution of technological progress. Based on these results, we examine why these demand‐side factors substantially influence CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions in the Chinese cement sector, and we provide recommendations for policy‐makers on carbon‐reduction measures in this CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐intensive sector.</jats:p>",

To certify refrigeration succession in a food‐supply chain, a flexible, easy‐to‐interpret, damage‐tolerant, and sensitive time‐temperature indicator (TTI) that uses a self‐healing nanofiber mat is devised. This mat is opaque when refrigerated due to nanofiber‐induced light scattering, but becomes irreversibly transparent at room temperature through self‐healing‐induced interfibrillar fusion leading to the appearance of a warning sign. The mat monitors both freezer (−20 °C) and chiller (2 °C) successions and its timer is tunable over the 0.5–22.5 h range through control of the polymer composition and film thickness. The thin mat itself serves as both a temperature sensor and display; it does not require modularization, accurately measures localized or gradient heat, and functions even after crushing, cutting, and when weight‐loaded in a manner that existing TTIs cannot. It also contains no drainable chemicals and is attachable to various shapes because it operates through an intrinsic physical response.</jats:p>",

Phylogenetic group B1 and A (59.4%) were the most prevalent, whereas groups B2 and D were least abundant. The higher abundance of phylogenetic group D at upstream sites of the Kelantan River suggested fecal contamination mainly of animal origin. Canonical-correlation analysis showed phylogenetic group B2, and phylogenetic groups A and D were greater in waters with higher inorganic nutrients (e.g. NH4, NO2 and NO3), whereas phylogenetic group B1 appeared to have better salinity tolerance between phylogenetic groups.</jats:p>",

During a short nearly circular survey with a 1.8‐km radius around the drifters, the R/V Revelle measured air‐sea fluxes, as well as temperature and salinity stratification in the top 1 m from a towed surface salinity profiler (SSP). A C‐band weather radar measuring rain rate within 1‐ to 100‐km range of the ship observed discrete rain cells organized in a system moving from the southeast to the northwest. Some of the intense rain cells were small scale (1 km in diameter or less) with short lifetimes yet dropped more than 5 cm of water in half an hour near the drifters, whereas the ship measured short rain episodes totaling 1.3 cm of rainfall mostly accompanied by very low wind. The data indicate a large spatial heterogeneity in temperature and salinity, with near‐surface freshening of up to 9 psu measured at different times by the two drifters (separated by less than 500 m) and by the SSP. The drifters indicate deepening of the fresh and cool surface layer during the rain which then thinned during the following 40 min with very low wind speed (&lt;2 m/s). Patchy surface‐trapped cold and fresh layers were also observed by the SSP east of the drifters. The high spatial and temporal variability of rainfall and surface‐trapped fresh pools is discussed.</jats:p>",

Here, using state-of-the-art supply chain data, we introduce an approach to evaluate the impact of ZDCs, linking traders and international markets to commodity-associated deforestation in the sub-national jurisdictions from which they source. We focus on the Brazilian soy sector, where we find that ZDC coverage is increasing, but under-represents the Cerrado biome where most soy-associated deforestation currently takes place. Though soy-associated deforestation declined in the Amazon after the introduction of the Soy Moratorium, we observe no change in the exposure of companies or countries adopting ZDCs to soy-associated deforestation in the Cerrado. We further assess the formulation and implementation of these ZDCs and identify several systematic weaknesses that must be addressed to increase the likelihood that they achieve meaningful reductions in deforestation in future. As the 2020 deadline for several of these commitments approaches, our approach can provide independent monitoring of progress toward the goal of ending commodity-associated deforestation.</jats:p>",

The material flow analysis method was employed in evaluating spatiotemporal variations of the Water Resources Metabolism Efficiency (WME) for exploring the inherent driving mechanisms in the BTH region. Results indicate that the WME increased obviously and differently in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, as well as in the whole BTH region from 1990 to 2015. The changes in WME depend significantly on the improvement in society and economics. Water production and water consumption are crucial for the integrated metabolic efficiency of physical and virtual water, followed by other influencing factors, i.e., freshwater recycling use ratio (Rfw), total retail amount of commodities of unit water use (Cw), and industrial output value per cubic metre of water resources (Uio).

Through the case of Walmart's expansion in Chile, and on the basis of a critical theorization of the circulation of capital, this paper proposes an agrarian question of circulation in which the apparently distinct realms of food production, transport, storage, and consumption are brought together into a contradictory and yet unitary whole. The case of Walmart Chile is illustrative of how the reconfiguration of spaces of urban mass consumption and the organizational restructuring of agro‐industrial hinterlands constitute each other in intricate ways. An agrarian question of circulation, the paper concludes, bears important political implications for rethinking the scope and extent of contemporary discussions on agrarian reform being put forward by transnational rural organizations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reliability and continuity of electricity supply generated by the use of fossil fuels cannot be guaranteed absolutely because of the present decline in oil and gas. Because of this, it becomes necessary to consider another form of energy generation such as biomass. In this work, the potential of electricity generation for a small household rural/isolated location using combustion technique was done. Due to the availability of sufficient biomass (agricultural waste) in rural/isolated locations, rice husk combustion technique for biopower generation was investigated in this work. The experiment was conducted at Uburu in Ohaozara Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. A 12V permanent magnet DC motor was used as the alternator while rice husk was used as biomass fuel. The biopower was achieved by heating water to steam which was used to turn the turbine attached to the permanent DC motor and a maximum of 155Whr was generated. From the result, it can be seen that the typical load of a household in a rural/isolated location is 55W and the peak experimental power is 154.96W. This peak experimental power is sufficient to carry the household load in a rural/isolated location. The peak experimental energy value is 1549.6Whr in a 10 minutes interval which is far more than the energy demand of 260Whr in a typical household in rural/isolated location. The result shows that biomass can be used to generate power for lighting point and power outlet for small households in rural/isolated locations.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we discuss how a retailer and manufacturer with a direct channel should choose single or dual MBG and pricing strategies. We identify the conditions under which a retailer or manufacturer should choose a return strategy and show that the handling return loss and the customer return cost in each channel are critical factors that should be considered by the retailer and manufacturer when choosing a return strategy. In addition, the retailer should cooperate with the manufacturer to establish an offline-to-online (O2O) omnichannel to fully benefit from the convenience and advantages of the retail channel. We find that the adoption of the O2O strategy by the retailer in its retail channel always generates profits, while the manufacturer may implement the O2O strategy in its direct channel when the profit from the Internet service is higher than a threshold. Additionally, the impact of various strategies on pricing, market share, and profits is discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the improvement of people’s living standards, people’s demand of traveling by taxi is increasing, but the taxi service system is not perfect yet; taxi drivers usually rely on their operational experience or cruise randomly to find passengers. Without macroguidance, the role of the taxi system cannot be fully utilized. Many scholars have studied taxi behaviors to find better operational strategies for drivers, but their researches rely on local optimization methods to improve the profit of drivers, which will lead to imbalance between supply and demand in the city. To solve this problem, we propose a Multiagent Reinforcement Learning- (MARL-) based taxi predispatching model through analyzing the running data of 13,000 taxis. Different from other methods of scheduling taxis based on the real-time location of orders, our model first predicts the demand for taxis in different regions in the next period and then dispatches taxis in advance to meet the future requirement; thus, the number of taxis needed and available in different regions can be balanced. Besides, in order to reduce computational complexity, we propose several methods to reduce the state space and action space of reinforcement learning. Finally, we compare our method with another taxi dispatching method, and the results show that the proposed method has a significant improvement in vehicle utilization rate and passenger demand satisfaction rate.</jats:p>",

An important component of the optimal choice is the implementation cost. The evaluation of construction activities can be conducted by estimating their environmental as well as their cost footprint, which is also the demand and consumption measure for the societies' needs. Water and sewerage projects have a key role in the standard of living, Public Health and environment. Therefore, water supply network replacements are important to upgrade the quality and quantity of water, through cost-effective choices. The purpose of this study is to present and comment on the uniform cost footprint through the complete replacement of the old water supply network along with complete reconstruction of pavement compared to local repair activities. Usual practices in repair works of old networks and flexible pavement rehabilitations are presented, assessing the benefits of total reconstruction by carrying out life cycle cost analysis in terms of uniform cost per year. The project of replacing the water supply network in the municipality of Larissa, Greece for the period 2015-2019 is analyzed, linking water savings with simultaneous total pavement rehabilitation, calculating average cost per inhabitant and hydrometer, comparing cost and pavement surface area between total and localized rehabilitation activities for a twenty-year rollback period. The fruitful findings of this research study, indicate that full-width pavement rehabilitation along with new water supply network establishment is economically advantageous compared to local rehabilitation treatments, according to the time period considered. Thus, competent authorities can use the proposed methodology as a useful tool to conclude to the optimal choice for maintaining water supply networks in a cost-effective way.</jats:p>"

The manufacturer incurs uncertain production cost and the retailer faces uncertain demand, but they can acquire independent signals to update production cost and demand, respectively. They commit an initial agreement on an initial wholesale price, minimum order quantity, and information sharing as well as the transfer payment and decisions adjustment when information is updated. We find that due to the joint impact of production cost variation and market variation, the manufacturer may not decrease (increase) her wholesale price when the updated production cost is lower (higher) than expected. The retailer places an additional order even if the wholesale price rises when the market outlook is good, but places an order with the minimum order quantity even if the wholesale price falls when the market outlook is bad. Secondly, for a certain level of information accuracy of the production cost and market demand, the retailer is always better off with information updating, but the manufacturer may be worse off with information updating when facing a bad market outlook. Thirdly, when information accuracy of the production cost and market demand varies, the manufacturer only benefits from a high accuracy of production cost. Profits of the retailer and the supply chain are increasing (decreasing) with accuracy of production cost if the updated production cost is larger (smaller) than expected.</jats:p>",
