      "abstract": "<jats:p>When faced with potential resource scarcities, purchasing managers have to make decisions regarding how to react to such scarcity threats. This can be challenging as there is often uncertainty surrounding the potential scarcity. Buyers’ mitigation decisions are impacted by their perceptions, which may lead to potentially ineffective mitigation responses. Resource dependence theory as well as supply chain literature emphasize the importance of collaborating with supply chain partners to secure access to scarce resources. However, behavioral research argues that the scarcity mindset causes individuals to behave more competitively, rather than collaboratively. This research examines the extent to which buyers’ perceptions of scarcity threats affect the decision to act altruistically towards the major supplier as well as to choose to collaborate with a major supplier in order to mitigate the scarcity. The research uses a scenario‐based role‐playing experiment with respondents serving as purchasing managers. The research demonstrates the complexity of resource scarcity management and illustrates that when faced with resource scarcity, buyers are actually less prone to collaborate with critical resource suppliers. This effect is robust, regardless of the level of relational capital present in the buyer–supplier relationship and regardless of individual factors, such as work experience and previous purchasing experience.</jats:p>",

The pressure reduction, as a measure for loss reduction, not only guarantees less leakage but also minimizes energy consumption. The relationship between energy consumption and pressure in water supply systems has been the subject of many previous studies, mainly based on measurements in real systems. However, a methodology for beforehand assessment of energy savings which occur due to the pressure reduction, has not been proposed yet. The paper proposed a method for the assessment of energy savings in relation to pressure reduction, implemented it on the hypothetical water supply system and verified it on the real system. Results led to the conclusion that the proposed methodology can be considered as a successful tool for better energy and water management. It enables water utility management to estimate energy saving in water supply system in advance, based on the hydraulic model of the system.</jats:p>",

More sustainable supply chains must now consider how product, operations, natural resources, technologies, and multiple tiers of organizations collectively create value for a diverse set of stakeholders. For multiple reasons, research and practice have tended to adopt an outcome-based perspective, whereby these efforts focus on a sustainability “destination,” which suffers from several shortcomings. Drawing from research in operations management, stakeholder theory, institutional theory, and innovation, this chapter posits how more sustainable supply chains might be co-defined and co-developed by emphasizing a journey that engages multiple stakeholders beyond supply chain partners. Design thinking is a very promising approach, with its iterative steps of empathy, defining the problem, ideate, prototype, and test. This journey-based perspective provides a framework for structuring engagement and encouraging openness to new observations and insights. Finally, the breadth and depth of collaboration with stakeholders, the nature of governance mechanisms, and the form and scale of resource investment all provide the means to assess the journey as it occurs.</jats:p>"

In Chitungwiza, provision of water services has been deteriorating since the millennium with residents losing hope for better services. The poor supply of municipal water in Chitungwiza has led to a chronic ‘dry taps situation’ where household taps are dry from periods of several consecutive days to months.Aim: This article assesses the water supply challenges in Chitungwiza through performance evaluation of the water supply services.Setting: The study was conducted in 26 suburbs in the four residential zones of Chitungwiza Municipality.Methods: Performance evaluation of water supply services was carried out using seven performance indicators: coverage of water supply connection, extent of metering of water connections, presence of leakages, extent of non-revenue water, continuity of water supply, quality of water supplied and efficiency in redressal of customer complaints. Two hundred and ninety-eight semi-structured questionnaires were administered in four residential zones of Chitungwiza. Water distribution system surveillance and key informant interviews were also conducted.Results: The results indicate high non-revenue water, poor water infrastructure maintenance, lack of water investment leading to widespread leakages in the distribution system, poor water quality supply and unreliable services provision. A majority, 80.2%, rated the municipal water supply services as poor. To cope with this new reality, households in Chitungwiza implemented a ‘source switch’ to new sources.Conclusion: Household shallow wells were identified as the main adapting strategy with 51.7% households relying on wells despite concerns about the water quality of the wells. Chitungwiza municipality should implement structural reforms that allow the current water service provision to improve.</jats:p>"

That approach is a management system based on goal congruence as a means of improving performance. Since then, this management approach developed from leadership of employees to the arena of buyer–supplier relationships, where the approach is called performance-based contracting (PBC) and merges outcome goals with incentives. This chapter briefly introduces the peculiarities and differences of PBC in contrast to more traditional approaches. The chapter indicates that PBC is not just a contract, but in fact a strategic approach, and thus necessitates strategic management activities. Therefore, the focus of this work is on how to manage PBC. For this purpose, the management problem is differentiated into three management needs in two dimensions: The first dimension is the management of the supply architecture. This dimension has two relevant management needs: (a) positioning of PBC and (b) PBC subsupplier management. The second dimension addresses the need for a PBC (project) management in the buyer–supplier relationship. That dimension is further split into ten different steps. To address the management needs, insights from management control theory and new institutional economies theory are used. On this basis, this chapter conceptualizes both management dimensions. Insights about the main decisions for each dimension are given. These insights build the basis for several propositions and managerial implications.</jats:p>"

The problems ahead include the increase in demand and reduction in water supply resources due to factors that cause uncertainties and the high cost of water supply infrastructures. Most studies in urban water management consider only a single criterion. However, in this research, two objective functions, namely cost minimization and per capita water consumption maximization, were used simultaneously. A portfolio approach based on the balance of water supply and demand was developed taking uncertainty into account. Then, the problem was solved using a hybrid robust–stochastic optimization approach. The results showed the selected supply augmentation and demand management options in each stage under dry, normal, and wet year scenarios.</jats:p>",

Taking the supply chain for large aircraft cockpit control display module as an example to illustrate the application steps and feasibility of the model, the results demonstrate that change of supply chain management responsibilities, implementing hierarchical management of suppliers, seeking coordinated implementation of inventory management mode, and improving the pre-risk identification system, play prominent roles in enhancing supply chain resilience, and the combination of different strategies can indeed enhance the supply chain resilience under the budget constraint.</jats:p>",

They have found that the sharing of greening cost information by the retailer can make both the manufacturer and the retailer better off in terms of profit. They have also found that the greening cost information sharing is all the more important when the greening cost efficiency is weak. The study helps retail managers to make a decision on whether to conceal or reveal the greening cost information with the upstream manufacturer.</jats:p>",

It also refers to “drug czar” William Bennett, who echoed Progressive-era reformers in framing the question about substance use in terms of American moral identity and contended that drugs represented a crisis of national character. The chapter cites the late 1980s and early 1990s as the period in which the United States most forcefully brought the drug war to source countries, aiming to cease the operation of poppy, coca, and cannabis fields in Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico. It elaborates Bush's support in taking military action in other countries to interrupt drug production.</p>",

To perform the tasks of this scientific work, the following general scientific methods of cognition were used, in particular, analysis to determine the main advantages of the development of logistics activities in Ukraine and the world in general; synthesis to identify obstacles to the implementation of logistics activities in Ukraine; deduction to determine the goals and environmental and economic effects of greening logistics activities; hypothetical used to justify logistics as a tool for environmental and economic security of the state; formalization and generalization for the formation of the main directions of greening of modern logistics. The study examines the importance of logistics in the process of competition in national and international markets. Emphasis is placed on the security aspects of logistics. It has been established that security plays an important role in the world's leading companies. It is noted that logistics is an area of activity that allows you to optimize material, information and financial flows, which helps to increase the economic and environmental efficiency of business. Economic security is considered a component of National Security, but it is argued that economic activity causes significant damage to the environment and causes the formation of potential environmental problems. The analysis of approaches to the definition of the theoretical content of the concepts of environmental, economic and ecological-economic security is carried out. It is claimed that eco-friendly logistics is a tool to ensure such development that will help ensure the achievement of economic objectives while minimizing the damage caused to the environment. It has been established that in recent years’ Ukrainian enterprises have appreciated the important role of logistics in improving business efficiency. The main advantages of logistics for business efficiency and the main obstacles for the development of logistics are highlighted. The main goals and directions of greening of modern logistics are singled out, the corresponding ecological and economic effects are formed. Given the global trends of greening and EU integration requirements, it is recommended to strengthen measures of state support and promotion of logistics activities, development of logistics infrastructure and greening of logistics. Summarizing the results of the study, it is established that logistics should be identified as a tool to ensure environmental and economic security of the state. Given the global trends of economic greening, EU integration requirements and trends in the inner economy, there is an urgent need for state support to promote the development of logistics and infrastructure, greening of logistics. The goals of greening logistics are to reduce resource consumption and reduce pollution. In the course of the conducted research the perspective directions of further researches were formed: research of expenses of greening of logistics and their correlation with logistic expenses; formation of measures for the greening of logistics activities of enterprises and industries; development of modern logistics technologies.</jats:p>"

This study unravels how the structure of the supply network influences each firm's ability to form supplier–supplier innovations with other network members. Specifically, we investigate how supplier degree centrality influences the generation of supplier–supplier innovations, and the extent to which this relationship is moderated by the structural embeddedness of firms in the supply network. Using data from the Toyota supply network, the results reveal that a firm's ability to co‐develop supplier–supplier innovations with other network members depends on its number of ties and their direction within the supply network. Although betweenness centrality has no significant moderating effect, closeness centrality, and embeddedness in small world clusters negatively moderate the relationship between supplier degree centrality and supplier–supplier innovations. Additionally, the number of manufacturing plants a firm operates in Japan strengthens the positive effect supplier degree centrality has on the development of supplier–supplier innovations.</jats:p>",

It examines the limitations sections of research on contracting in interorganizational relationships (IORs) published in the decade 2010 to 2019. A synthesis of contracting-related limitations reveals four major sets of issues. First, current conceptualization and operationalization of IOR contracting usually build on a simplified characterization of contracts. More effort should be exerted to study a larger number and variety of provisions in relation to distinct types of contracts, functions of contracts, and contract management. Second, more attention should be devoted to studying a larger number and variety of antecedents to and consequences of contract design and management. In addition, the need for a more systematic investigation of moderators and their effects has been repeatedly indicated in the literature. Third, studies on IOR contracting should focus more on contract dynamics and its interplay with relational and other governance mechanisms as well as the link between contracts and their performance implications. These dynamics should be studied in relation to temporal factors, critical events, and learning. Finally, the chapter notes that findings to date tend to have a narrow generalizability, because studies usually draw on a limited number of theories, use data from a limited number of actors, and mostly rely on subjective and perceptual data. Building on this synthesis, fruitful opportunities for future research into IOR contracting are discussed.</jats:p>"

ATP measurements were taken pre- and post-infrastructure improvements within a watershed and throughout two potable water systems from source to tap. A reduction in ATP, as measured by relative light units, was identified post-infrastructure improvements. Peak ATP values for the watershed were found within the reservoirs. The treated source water remained biologically stable throughout the distribution system, with peaks attributed to nitrification. A mathematical model for predicting microbial ATP using pH, temperature, and alkalinity, was developed for the watershed studied, with an adjusted R2 of 0.84 at a 95% confidence level. Overall, ATP bioluminescence technology was found to be a suitable candidate for rapid microbiological activity testing in drinking water systems; however, technological limitations remain with respect to reproducibility that should be addressed prior to full-scale implementation.</jats:p>",

Once a code completed, to take off without a USB power, questions rise about powering it; What’s the feasible external voltage range? What’s the current? Which cell battery? And so on. These questions cannot be quickly resolved by only skimming datasheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper went over to clarify the obscure information about the DC supply range for the ESP32 development board, especially ESP32-DevKitC V4. The investigation, calculation, experiments, and LTspice simulation disclosed the result. Starting from getting relevance facts from datasheets of essential components on the board, calculated thermal conditions of the heated element, experimented to confirm the deliberate and get empirical data while code running including GPIO and WiFi, and ended with simulation ensure the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper concludes the following result points. The minimum supply voltage is 3.6 V to run an ESP32 module. The supply voltage should be under 10 V for both input capacitor rated voltage and LDO junction temperature rating. The thermal restriction was calculated at an ambient temperature of 25 °C and tried and tested. For a more harsh environment, this way could derate the upper limit voltage. An external power should supply current well over average 100 mA, a good 1 A. In terms of battery, this range reassures that an ESP32 can run with a single cell LiPo. Regarding the USB, both the high power and low power port can supply sufficiently. While an external supply being no less than 5.2 V, both the USB and external sources could work simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

This paper is based on the multi-period CLSCN equilibrium model of remanufacturers' recoveries and multiple planning periods. The consumer preference for products at multiple planning periods are respectively divided into dynamic and static conditions. Moreover, the intervention of government is considered. Meanwhile, the variational inequalities are employed to separately depict the optimal behaviors and equilibrium conditions of the supply chain network. The results show that when the consumer preference for new products is static, the impact of consumer preference for new products has a significant impact on the multi-period CLSCN. If consumer preference for new products is dynamic, at the preliminary planning period, the impact of consumer preference for new products on the multi-period CLSCN will be better defined.</jats:p>",

In order to solve this problem, this article uses the electric spring (ES) in the coal mine power supply system. First, it analyzes the working principle of the electric spring. Next, aiming at the deficiencies of the resonance control strategy, a compound control strategy in which quasi-proportional resonance control (QPR) and repetitive control are parallel is proposed. The introduction of repetitive control can suppress the periodic disturbance of the power grid, effectively improve the steady-state accuracy, and reduce system harmonics. Then, the design method of repeated controller parameters is studied in detail. Finally, MATLAB/Simulink is used to build a simulation model, and dSPACE is used as the control core to build an ES experiment platform. Simulation and experimental results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm, and point out that the electric spring can ensure the voltage stability of key electrical equipment and provide a reliable guarantee for the safe production of the mine.</jats:p>"

Ecological theory suggests that network structure is crucial for the resilience of the food supply chain. Here we show that boosting a city’s food supply chain diversity increases the resistance of a city to food shocks of mild to moderate severity up to 15%. We develop an intensity-duration-frequency model linking food shock risk to supply chain diversity. The empirical-statistical model is based on annual food inflow observations from all metropolitan areas in the United States during the years 2012-2015, years when most of the country experienced moderate to severe droughts. This model is simple, operationally useful, and hazard-agnostic. Using this method cities can improve their resistance to food supply shocks with policies that increase the food supply chain’s diversity.</jats:p>"

With digitalization, some traditional business rules have been altered, removing many physical barriers while at the same time adding more challenges. This chapter first discusses the fundamental changes brought by the digital trend. To begin, it investigates traditional business wisdom and the underlying mechanisms of traditional business operations. The chapter examines the barriers to retailers in the traditional business world. Then, it focuses on how the digitalization trend can transform the realization of those mechanisms in order to remove the barriers and how retailers can best adjust to the changes. The implications of digitalization apply to both current and future marketing operations. When facing the new opportunities and challenges created by the digitalization trend, retailers cannot rely only on the traditional offline channel; they also need to seek omnichannel retailing. However, merging into omnichannel retailing from a traditional offline mode is not easy. The second part of the chapter thus discusses several specific risks that omnichannel retailers must tackle.</jats:p>"

Hard coal represents bulk goods, aluminum primary raw materials with medium quantities, and rare earths primary raw materials with small quantities. Their respective supply chains are analyzed and subsequently possible strategies and methods and their application are discussed. The paper shows for the first time that the selection and application of optimization priorities (e.g. profitability or sustainability) depends on the primary raw material and its integration into global production chains.</jats:p>"

Problem of providing reliable and accessible energy supply becomes extremely important under the Arctic severe climate. Organization of energy supply is affected by many factors. It is suggested to consider natural-resource, economical, social, technological, ecological, and legal factors. Legal factors set legal framework for energy enterprises and energy consumers to act. Economic relations, social guarantees for energy consumers, technological and environmental requirements for energy industry are legally regulated. Thus, legal factors determine other factors of energy supply to significant extent. In this regard, an analysis of the powers and functions of federal and regional authorities in the field of energy supply regulation is relevant. Most of the powers of energy supply regulation are concentrated at the federal level. At the level of the subjects of the Russian Federation energy supply issues are regulated by regional authorities within the framework of their powers. Ensuring reliable energy supply to consumers requires coordinated actions of authorities and energy sector enterprises, taking into account the whole variety of considered factors.</jats:p>"

This chapter first introduces the typical players in a food supply chain and examines the global food system characterized by consolidation and industrialization. It then discusses some critical topics of the sustainable food supply chain that aim to address these challenges. These topics include traceability, transparency, certification and standards, and alternatives to industrialized food systems, including cooperatives, community-supported agriculture, and roles of small and medium-sized growers in regenerative agriculture. The chapter ends with a discussion of several important emerging logistics management topics, including last-mile delivery, new technology, and cold chain management.</jats:p>"

Although a number of studies focus on using the block chain technology in various application aspects, there is not a specific previous study focus on the block chain technology in both technological context and business organizations through the supply chain flows. Therefore, the purpose of this paper empathizes how using the technological theories and block chain technologies through the supply chain will affect it as a whole; in addition to such adoption is very rare to be represented especially in developing countries as this part is fulfilled by our paper research. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected through a self-created questionnaire a number of 427 respondents were included in the questionnaire analysis which were collected from employees of supply chain and logistics companies.  Practical implications – The findings reveal the importance after conducting regression analysis and SEM, it was observed that reducing complexity and lowering supply chain investment costs associated with traditional supply chain transactions were some of the key drivers for block chain adoption, as well as a desire to benefit from enhanced compatibility and regulatory support. However, achieving security is considered as the main and most important driver. Originality/value -This research provides an insight to understand the significant dimensions of block chain adoption, where the dimensions of security, regulatory support, competitive pressure, compatibility, and complexity are found to have a significant effect on block chain adoption.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a comprehensive review on the transient flow research for UWSS management. This review consists of two aspects as follows. The first aspect is about the development and progress of current transient theory, including transient flow models, unsteady friction and turbulence models, and numerical simulation methods. The other aspect is about the utilization and application of transient-based methods for effective UWSS diagnosis and management, including leakage, discrete and extended partial blockages, unknown branch, and other defects in water pipelines. A total of 228 publications have been reviewed and analyzed in this paper. In addition to the state-of-the-art progress and achievement of the research on transients, the advances and recommendations of future work in this field are also discussed for the development and management of next-generation smart UWSS in the paper.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. In the West, concessions are the most common form of public-private partnership in such&#x0D;\nsectors of the economy as telecommunications and communications (60 %), energy production and distribution&#x0D;\n(19 %), transport (18 %), and water supply (3 %). As a form of public-private partnership concession&#x0D;\nagreement pursues the goal of involving private investment in the creation, reconstruction, modernization of&#x0D;\nsocially significant publicly owned facilities. Based on public interests, government will determines the goals and&#x0D;\nparameters of the concession project and takes control over its using, and the concessionaire takes on&#x0D;\noperational activities (development, financing, creation, use, management, provision of services to consumers).&#x0D;\nPurpose. The purpose of this article is to conduct concessions, including the content concluding, amending and&#x0D;\nterminating a concession agreement in the field of heat supply. Methodology. Achieving this goal was&#x0D;\nachieved through the use of general scientific and particular scientific research methods: dialectical, formal&#x0D;\nlogical, systemic-structural, comparative legal, technical-legal, linguistic, scientific analysis method. Results.&#x0D;\nThe historical aspect of the formation of the concession and the analysis of concession models leads to the&#x0D;\nconclusion that this legal framework is the most effective alternative of public-private partnership in relation to&#x0D;\nsocially significant infrastructure facilities. Conclusion. Today, there is a process of implementation of the&#x0D;\nconcession mechanism in Russia, the state is interested in partnerships with private capital in weak investment&#x0D;\nareas. However, society and business have incomplete understanding of the essence of the concession, the&#x0D;\npractice of its application. The transition to a concession system means a change in the essence of relations&#x0D;\nbetween the state and business in both legal and economic contexts. The implementation form of the&#x0D;\nconcession agreement should fix the balance and mutual interest of the parties in the application of the most&#x0D;\neffective, modern and technological methods of construction, reconstruction and use of facilities, as well as the&#x0D;\nprovision of quality services to consumers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Feeding the people sustainably continues to be a challenge in the present times. Enormous amounts of food wastage aggravate this problem. In developing countries, food wastage primarily occurs within the supply chain. Lack of technological infrastructure in these countries causes significant post-harvest loss. While research shows that developments in food supply chains can reduce food wastage, no systematic research has been done so far to show the possible relationship between the use of technology and food loss. This paper attempts to address this gap by studying the supply chains of different food processing organizations in India to assess the role of technological platforms in reducing food wastage in supply chains. Using a qualitative inductive methodology, the author identified the technological platforms that can address food wastage. Then, using multiple case-study analysis, the supply chains of sample firms were evaluated. The author assessed the food loss in these supply chains through comparative analysis to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of selected technological platforms. This study provides managers in the food industry with insights to prevent food loss, as well as some policy implications for developing economies. Overall, this paper throws light on the issue of food wastage and the possible means for its prevention.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The water distribution subsystem is the most failing subsystem included in the water supply system. One of the main consequences of water supply failures is the lack of water supply to consumers, which is always very onerous. The paper presents a method of determining the conditional probability that a break in the supply of water to consumers of a certain duration will be caused by a specific type of failure. The result of the work was to identify water supply network failures that result in the longest water supply suspension time. The method was presented on a real water supply system. In order to reduce the incidence of long-term interruptions in water supply, water supply companies should mainly continue replacing gray cast iron pipes with thermoplastic materials. Actions taken to increase the safety of drinking water supply meet the current standards for the safety of drinking water, developed by the World Health Organization and the European Union.</jats:p>"

There are different types of spillways, with the ogee type being the conventional one. A stepped spillway is an example of a nonconventional spillway. The turbulent flow over a stepped spillway was studied numerically by using the Flow-3D package. Different fluid flow characteristics such as longitudinal flow velocity, temperature distribution, density and chemical concentration can be well simulated by Flow-3D. In this study, the influence of slope changes on flow characteristics such as air entrainment, velocity distribution and dynamic pressures distribution over a stepped spillway was modelled by Flow-3D. The results from the numerical model were compared with an experimental study done by others in the literature. Two models of a stepped spillway with different discharge for each model were simulated. The turbulent flow in the experimental model was simulated by the Renormalized Group (RNG) turbulence scheme in the numerical model. A good agreement was achieved between the numerical results and the observed ones, which are exhibited in terms of graphics and statistical tables.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business processes are present in all types of organizations, regardless of the size or industry within which the organization operates. Successful business process management (BPM) is an indicator of the level of process maturity of the organization. Within the supply chain, it is possible to observe the presence of business processes of a collaborative nature, as BPM relies on the principles of partnership, development, and exchange of information through links that exist within this chain between all actors [1]. Within this paper, BPM in the relations with suppliers and consumers within the supply chain of organizations operating in the fashion industry is considered. Lambert [2] lists eight macro processes that take place in the supply chain, between suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and end consumers, as follows: customer relationship management, supplier relationship management, demand management, order execution, fl ow management production, product development and commercialization and return management. Within this paper, a research is presented which analyzes the segments of managing collaborative business processes within the supply chain of the fashion industry, based on the responses of 508 managers and employees in the fashion industry in the Republic of Serbia. The needs for the development of certain segments in accordance with the needs of modern business process management have been explored.Scientifi c novelty. The research part of this paper relies on the application of Friedman's test which enables the analysis of the current state of BPM in relations with suppliers and consumers within the supply chain of the fashion industry, expressed through workers' responses with a ranking of their preferences. This paper contributes to the creation of a knowledge base within the research in the fi eld of the impact of BPM on improvements in the supply chain, on the basis of which it is possible to conduct further research and upgrade knowledge.Practical value. The fi ndings derived from the results of research of this type contribute to the development of the business from various aspects. The benefi ts can be refl ected not only through the strengthening of the competitive position but also through the sustainability of business on the basis of adequate application of BPM practices in all business segments. Accordingly, in addition to the scientifi c novelty, which is refl ected in the results of the rese arch work, there is a practical novelty, which is refl ected in the guidelines for the development of modern BPM within the supply chain of the fashion industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In light of the latest trends in global installed capacities, the importance of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) to future energy supply systems is evident. Despite this, the inherent intermittency of VRES remains an obstacle to their widespread adoption. Green hydrogen is often suggested as an energy carrier that can account for this in a sustainable manner. In the analysis, a robust European energy system in the context of 2050 and with 100% VRES energy supply is designed through an iterative minimal cost-optimization approach that ensures robust security of supply over 38 weather-year scenarios (1980-2017). The impact of spatial VRES variability is factored in by defining exclusive VRES groups within each optimization region and, from this, it can be seen that higher numbers of groups in each region offer cheap electricity generation locations to the optimizer and thus decrease the total annual cost of the system. Beyond this, the robust system design and impact of inter-annual variability is identified by iteratively combining the installed capacities of different system designs obtained by applying 38 historical weather years. The robust system design outlined here has significantly lower capacities in comparison to the maximum regional capacities obtained in the first round of optimization.</jats:p>"

The objective was to investigate the potential to use controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) to simplify nutrient management in small-scale hydroponic systems. Three experiments were conducted with the goal of a single fertilizer application during the crop cycle of basil (<jats:italic>Ocimum basilicum</jats:italic>). Nutrient release curves were quantified by adding prills to water and measuring nutrient content weekly in the solution for CRF products without plants. In all seven products tested (Osmocote Bloom 2–3M, Osmocote Plus 3–4M, E-Max Calcium Nitrate 2–3M, Agrocote MAP 3–4M, E-Max Keiserite 3–4M, E-Max K-Mag 2–3M, and Agrocote SOP 3–4M) an initial rapid release was followed by a plateau, but release rates differed between products varying from 100% (MgSO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>) to 60% release [(NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>).(H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>)] over an 11-week evaluation period. Total nutrient content in two commercial N–P–K CRF products (3–4 months 15N–3P–10K and 2–3 months 12N–3.1P–14.9K) provided lower Ca and Mg compared with a typical hydroponic solution based on water-soluble fertilizer (WSF). A subsequent experiment evaluated plant growth response using the same two commercial CRF products (single application) or a WSF (replaced weekly) in growth chamber environment. Plants grown for 4 weeks under CRF treatments yielded less than half the shoot fresh weight of plants grown with WSF and exhibited symptoms of Ca deficiency and micronutrient toxicity (confirmed with tissue analysis). Electrical conductivity (EC) of CRF solutions increased over time indicating excess dose compared with plant uptake, reaching a maximum of 5.4 dS·m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Nutrient release curves from the first experiment were then used to estimate product release and create a single-application nutritional program based on a customized “Blend” developed from CRF macronutrients plus WSF micronutrients. Plants were grown hydroponically with two dosages of Blend (1X and 2X) and compared with a commercial WSF with weekly replacement of solution. Blend 2X and WSF treatments had similar shoot fresh weight (241 and 244 g/four plants, respectively) with healthy plant appearance and tissue nutrient levels generally within published survey ranges for basil. Commercial CRF products designed for soil or container production were unsuitable for hydroponics, but acceptable plant performance with the customized CRF Blend demonstrated proof-of-concept for a single CRF application.</jats:p>",

The CPSS score was positively correlated with the SAS score (r = 0.66; P &lt; 0.01), the CPSS score was negatively correlated with the CD-RISC score (r = -0.617, P &lt; 0.01), and the SAS score was negatively correlated with the CD-RISC score (r = -0.477, P &lt; 0.01). The job position, age, and political status of the CSSD staff were the main factors affecting their mental state; for example, the CPSS score and SAS score of the CSSD nurses were significantly different from those of the CSSD logistic staff (P &lt; 0.01). <jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold>During the epidemic, the CSSD staff’s psychological resilience was at a low level; the anxiety level of the CSSD nurses was higher than that of the CSSD logistic staff. Therefore, more attention should be given to the mental health of the CSSD staff, including taking protective measures regarding the risk factors to ensure they can maintain a healthy mental state.</jats:p>"

This study proposes a method for reversing estimated demand trends by considering new value creation requirements such as national economic power or major industry types. Since no direct surveys of the actual status of services supplied through platforms for the weather service market exist, we investigated the web service status of both public (n = 193) and private (n = 144) sectors and established a weather service supply classification system. To analyze the global weather service demand environment, members of the World Meteorological Organization were classified according to their characteristics and compared with the supply status. The trend direction was suggested so that suppliers could provide services suitable for demand trends, and the corresponding significance was discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>A catastrophe such as supervolcanic eruption, asteroid impact or nuclear winter could reduce global food production by 10% or more. Human civilization’s food production system is unprepared to respond to such an event, and current preparedness centers around food stockpiles, an excessively expensive solution given that a global catastrophic risk (GCR) scenario could hamper conventional agriculture for 5 to 10 years. Instead, it is more cost-effective to consider alternative food production techniques requiring little to no sunlight.This study analyses the potential of single-cell protein (SCP) produced from methane (natural gas) as an alternative food source in the case of a catastrophe that considerably blocked sunlight, the most severe food shock scenario. To determine its viability, the following are quantified: global production potential of methane SCP, capital costs, material and energy requirements, ramp-up rates and retail prices. In addition, potential bottlenecks to fast deployment are considered.While providing a higher quality of protein than other alternatives, the production capacity would be slower to ramp up. Based on 24/7 construction of facilities, 7-11% of global protein requirements could be fulfilled at the end of the first year. Results suggest that investment in production ramp up should aim to meet no more than humanity’s minimum protein requirements. Uncertainty remains around the transferability of labor and equipment production, among other key areas. Research on these questions could help reduce the negative impact of potential food-related GCRs.</p>"

What explains these cross-country differences? Adopting an interdisciplinary approach based on data science and economic theory, we developed the following research workflow. First, we gather, clean, and merge different datasets released by institutions such as the Open Knowledge Foundation, World Bank, United Nations, World Economic Forum, Transparency International, Economist Intelligence Unit, and International Telecommunication Union. Then, we conduct feature extraction and variable selection founded on economic domain knowledge. Next, we perform several linear regression models, testing whether cross-country differences in the supply of open government data can be explained by differences in the country’s economic, social, and institutional structures. Our analysis provides evidence that the country’s civil liberties, government transparency, quality of democracy, efficiency of government intervention, economies of scale in the provision of public goods, and the size of the economy are statistically significant to explain the cross-country differences in the supply of open government data. Our analysis also suggests that political participation, sociodemographic characteristics, and demographic and global income distribution dummies do not help to explain the country’s supply of open government data. In summary, we show that cross-country differences in governance, social institutions, and the size of the economy can explain the global distribution of open government data.</jats:p>"

Over the past few years, the water quality of rivers has been adversely affected due to harmful wastes and pollutants. This ever-increasing water pollution is a matter of great concern as it is deteriorating the water quality, making it unfit for any type of use. Contaminated water resources can cause serious effects on humans as well as aquatic life. Hence, water quality monitoring of reservoirs is essential. Recently, water quality modelling using AI techniques has generated a lot of interest and it can be very beneficial in ecological and water resources management. This paper presents the state-of-the-art application of machine learning techniques in forecasting river water quality. It highlights the different key techniques, advantages, disadvantages, and applications with respect to monitoring the river water quality.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In analysing attitudes and perceptions of people and political party proposals, and how we can lay the bases for searching the explanations of characteristics and level of implementation of our two values, first, we recall one of the key findings discussed in this chapter: the changes, the levels, the characteristics of the demand and elite supply of the two values are highly context- and time-dependent. Citizens’ demands and party supply are dependent on the historical trajectory and the economic situation. This partial finding shows that in the middle and long run there is a steady consistency between people’s attitudes and leader actions, on the one hand, and social, economic, cultural reality, on the other. Consequently, the requests for equality and freedom are consistent with the existing socio-economic-cultural reality. A second remark is a difference in terms of volatility/resilience between attitudes and realities. The demand and party supply of equality and freedom can be more or less volatile as reactions to the changes and uncertainties brought about by the economic situation, or other factors, such as technological changes, industrial organization developments, working conditions changes, economic mobility and the whole existing structure of external opportunities. Finally, up to now, the empirical evidence suggests that the demand for implementation of the two values seems to follow different logic and different paths. What this discussion and the related findings are pointing to is also the responsiveness seen from a more realistic perspective.</jats:p>",

An important part of any company’s business is supply chain management. In modern business, this is a comprehensive activity for managing all incoming and outgoing flows of company resources. Implementation of supply chain management on the principles of social responsibility is possible only on the basis of a consistent and integrated approach. The article substantiates the possibility of introducing the principles of social responsibility in the activities of the company based on a balanced scorecard. The balanced scorecard includes four blocks: finance, customers, personnel, and internal business processes. Each block includes a specific list of indicators, which assess the degree of implementation of the principles of social responsibility. A system of specific indicators for companies that manufacture, supply and install climate equipment is proposed: Finance (level of profitability; turnover growth; amount of Freon used (reuse); the amount of a modern group of environmentally sustainable fluorine-free refrigerants used; reuse of materials and assessment of their value; etc.); Customers (percentage of safe refrigerants used in products; percentage of customer refusals from cooperation; percentage of regular customers (more than 2 transactions; more than 1 year of cooperation; etc.); Personnel (the volume and share of expenses for employees’ certification; volumes and share of expenses for personnel development; volumes and share of expenses for stimulating employees); Internal business processes (accelerated service operations; reduction of time for placing orders; reduction of spoilage and waste; reduction of equipment maintenance and repair costs; reduction of time and costs of transportation operations; use of automated warehouse management systems; use of alternative energy sources; etc.). The proposed balanced scorecard allows the company to really build a green supply chain, which is an important competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to propose a new design formula for three types of LID facilities. Through the long-term continuous simulation of EPA SWMM, the Load Capture Ratio (LCR) for LID facilities such as bio-retentions, infiltration trenches, and vegetative swales was estimated. As a result of the sensitivity analysis to verify the newly derived LCR formula, it can be seen that not only the regional rainfall characteristics but also the infiltration capacity of the native soil play an important role in the accuracy of the proposed LCR formula.</jats:p>",

As a secondary metabolite, the production of ascomycin is often limited by the shortage of precursors during the late fermentation phase. Polyhydroxybutyrate is an intracellular polymer accumulated by various microorganisms. The development of polyhydroxybutyrate as a useful carbon reservoir for precursor synthesis is of great significance for improving the yield of ascomycin.<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The fermentation characteristics of the parent strain <jats:italic>S. hygroscopicus </jats:italic>var. ascomyceticus FS35 showed that the accumulation and decomposition of polyhydroxybutyrate were respectively correlated with the growth of strain and the production of ascomycin. The co-overexpression of exogenous polyhydroxybutyrate synthesis gene <jats:italic>phaC</jats:italic> and native polyhydroxybutyrate decomposition gene <jats:italic>fkbU</jats:italic> increased both strain biomass and ascomycin yield. Comparative transcription analysis showed that the storage of polyhydroxybutyrate during the exponential phase accelerated biosynthesis processes by stimulating the utilization of carbon sources, and the decomposition of polyhydroxybutyrate during the stationary phase increased the biosynthesis of ascomycin precursors by enhancing metabolic flux of primary pathways. The comparative analysis of cofactor concentration reflected that the biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate depended on the supply of NADH pool. Under the condition of low sugar content in the later exponential phase, the optimization of carbon source addition further strengthened the polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism by increasing total concentration of cofactors. Finally, in the fermentation medium with 22 g/L starch and 52 g/L dextrin, the ascomycin yield of co-overexpression strain was increased to 626.30 mg/L, 2.11-fold higher than that of parent strain in the initial medium (296.29 mg/L). <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> This paper reported for the first time that the polyhydroxybutyrate was beneficial to the growth of strain and the production of ascomycin by working as an intracellular carbon reservoir, storing as polymers when carbon sources are abundant and depolymerizing to monomers for the biosynthesis of precursors when carbon sources are insufficient. The successful application of polyhydroxybutyrate in increasing the output of ascomycin provided a new strategy for the high yield of other secondary metabolites.</jats:p>"

In this ecological study the relationships between deprivation, dental workforce and oral health are explored. <jats:bold>Method</jats:bold>Twenty-two Unitary Authorities (UAs) serving the population of Wales were studied. The number of dentists were obtained from NHS Business Services as well as the 2019 population figures from StatsWales. As data for whole time equivalent General Dental Practitioner (GDP) workforce were not available, GDP sites were used. The condition of teeth at the age 12 years was used as a measure of oral health from the most recent epidemiological survey available. The relationship between oral health and workforce was established using the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD).<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>Associations were observed between dental sites and population as well as between oral health and deprivation. A new composite variable called the University of South Wales Dental Index (USWDI) was introduced by combining the number of dentists with their corresponding WIMD of the most deprived 10% of the population. Using regression modelling the USWDI demonstrated its superiority in using either the number of dentists or the WIMD most deprived 10% alone to predict decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT).<jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>Workforce levels have increased and there has been a corresponding improvement in oral health over two decades. At the same time deprived subgroups continue to experience relatively higher levels of disease. A proportion of the general dental services delivered in Wales has continued to be based on the principle of supply induced demand for care rather than oral health need. Improving oral health in a diverse population like Wales cannot be achieved by increasing dental workforce alone. It is necessary to account for levels of deprivation. USWDI as a predictor of DMFT could be a useful tool to monitor the macro delivery of oral health care for the future in Wales.</jats:p>"

Many member states initially found themselves dealing with the crisis alone or lacking essential medical resources. Since the early stages, it has become evident that while security of supply has so far been a matter of national decisions, the EU needs a comprehensive strategy to improve its crisis resilience.

This paper also studies the interrelationship and their cause and effect magnitude among various enablers contributing to IoT based food secure model. The methodology used in the paper is Interpretative Structural Modelling (ISM) for establishing interrelationship among the variables and Fuzzy-Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) to provide the magnitude of the cause‒effect strength of the hierarchical framework. Finally, this paper has limitation of taking only factors related to food security system by considering present natural epidemics of COVID-19.

Using hand-collected data from annual reports during 2007–2015, the authors find that manufacturers with a more concentrated supplier base hold fewer inventories, and the efficiency primarily flows through the raw materials and work-in-process inventory accounts. The authors find that small firms benefit more from a concentrated supplier base in inventory efficiency than large firms do. The authors also find that the positive effect of supplier-base concentration on inventory efficiency is stronger as customer-base concentration increases. In an additional analysis, the authors find that firms with a high supplier-base concentration would have better current and future financial performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The present study focuses on a single-vendor, single-buyer supply chain model for a single type of product with upgraded service provided to the buyer by the vendor. Vendors often increase their profit by providing a lower quality of a particular product. In this study, an advanced supply chain model is developed to increase service in the presence of an unreliable vendor and an online-to-offline (O2O) channeling system. The vendor provides lower quality items to the customer, even though they had committed to providing a certain quality product, in order to increase their profit. For more realistic results, demand is considered to be price-, quality-, and service-dependent. To advertise and sell the products, the manufacturer uses an online system, which the buyer also uses to choose and order the product, where the particular product is delivered to the customer by a third (offline) party; that is, the concept of an O2O retail channel is adopted to improve the service level of the supply chain management (SCM). To control the out-of-control state and improve the production quality, investment is used. Contrary to the literature, service is considered to be constrained, which makes the model more realistic. A classical optimization technique is used to solve the model analytically and a two-echelon supply chain model is obtained under the advanced O2O retail channel, along with optimized profit, shipment volume, selling price, ordering cost, service, back-ordered price discount, lead time, and safety factor values. Some numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis of the key parameters are provided, along with graphical representation, in order to validate the model.</jats:p>"

We test for changes to the information environment of firms whose disclosure policy is unaffected by this standard directly. Using a sample of non-users of derivatives, we find an increase in stock liquidity after their critical customers expand derivative disclosures under SFAS 161. The effect persists for one year and becomes insignificant in subsequent years as the firms dial back their voluntary disclosure. The effect is also more salient for firms that have stronger economic links with their customers and for firms whose customers exhibit more significant improvements in derivative disclosures. The findings suggest that the mandatory derivative disclosures due to SFAS 161 lead to short-term positive information externalities along supply chains.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Availability: Data are available from the public sources cited in the text.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>JEL Classifications: G32; M41; M48.</jats:p>",

Performance-based contracting (PBC) can be used to shift the risks associated with performance shortfalls to service suppliers. Attaining specified performance outcomes can, however, be highly uncertain in service triads where there are many factors outside the supplier’s control. In such situations of high outcome uncertainty, suppliers may be induced to shirk their responsibilities since the direct customer–supplier link inherent to triadic structures gives suppliers an opportunity to engage in shirking without being detected. According to established theory, PBC is less effective in such situations, and behavior-based contracting (BBC) is more effective in achieving performance outcomes that are satisfactory to buyers. However, these insights are based on the long-standing assumption that PBC and BBC are substitutes. This assumption has been criticized as not being representative of empirical reality. Therefore, this chapter studies whether combining these contracting approaches during the contract design and contract management phases mitigates shirking of responsibility by suppliers. Using a data set derived from a survey questionnaire, the chapter finds that combining PBC and BBC during the contract design phase does not reduce shirking. However, the results do reveal that responsibility shirking can be mitigated by combining PBC and BBC during the contract management phase. This study provides purchasing managers with new insights concerning how to use PBC to achieve satisfactory performance outcomes, even in uncertain contexts such as service triads.</jats:p>"

The consistency between the simulated water surface and the measured water surface with different n value is compared by using the error analysis method. Manning's n value for a flume model which meets the minimum error requirements is determined. The relative error between n value obtained by the empirical method and n value obtained by the numerical simulation method is analyzed.

In this study, HYDRUS-1D/2D software is used to analyse the effect of critical parameters that influence the behaviour of solute in groundwater flow and its transport under different soil conditions. Also, single porosity and dual porosity approaches are discussed with their respective sensitive parameters. Parameter variations are illustrated in the forms of concentration contours of the solute spread and the breakthrough curves obtained over the flow period. The results of this work can be useful in analysing flow and solute behaviour in the vadose zone.</jats:p>",

This level is tiered from the bottom to the top level as the concept of supply chain management. The qualitative and quantitative research method was used to map and analyze supply chains for each level. The results showed the micro-level is the basis of the supply chain which can be measured by SCOR for example. The meso level focuses on the strength of construction companies. Construction company strategies framework contract and Enterprises Resource Planning (ERP). Macro-level includes supply chain accumulation from micro and meso. It is expected that at the macro level is the harmonization of supply chains between stakeholders, namely the government, contractors, suppliers, and distributors with good policy regulations.</jats:p>"

The share of small and medium-sized organizations for more than 95% of businesses is creating 50% of value added worldwide and depending on the country, production between 60% to 90% of all new jobs. The present paper, with examining the information obtained from 73 small, medium-sized manufacturing enterprises, studied the relationship between information sharing in the supply chain and innovation performance of the organization by considering factors such as quality management and supplier-specific investment. In this study, 4 main hypotheses regarding the relationship between chain information sharing, supply of quality management, supplier-specific investment, and the effect of relationship between quality management and supplier-specific investment on innovation performance of the organization have been examined. The results of the study indicated that information sharing in the supply chain has a positive and direct effect on quality management and supplier-specific investment. The results also showed that the impact of information sharing in the supply chain on the specific investment of the supplier is higher than its impact on quality management. Finally, the impact of quality management on organizational innovation performance is far greater than the impact of supplier-specific investment on organizational innovation performance.</jats:p>"

The most suitable nitrate removal process is heterotrophic biological denitrification. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the performance of three shapes of denitrification bioreactors: triangular, rectangular and semicircular. The main element that was used to remove nitrate was beech woodchips. The concentration of inlet nitrate was 75 mg/l and the salinity of the solution was 1 ds/m and 5 ds/m, for a period of six months. The results showed that the efficiency of the triangular bioreactor with a salinity level of 1 ds/m was 90%, which is more efficient than the rectangular and semicircular bioreactors with performances of 55.8% and 53.8%, respectively. The results also indicated that at a salinity level of 5 ds/m, the semicircular bioreactor with a performance of 50.8% inlet nitrate removal was the best of the three shapes of bioreactors tested, the efficiencies of the triangular and rectangular bioreactors were 49.9% and 48.6% respectively. Also, it was observed that at the salinity level of 1 ds/m, a high hydraulic retention time had a high positive effect on denitrification, on the other hand at the salinity level of 5 ds/m, there was better performance of denitrification if the hydraulic retention time was lower.</jats:p>",

Integrating operation and maintenance activities along this complex network is crucial since the hydrocarbon industry is the most influential sector in the world economy, and any disruptions or variations in hydrocarbon product supply will affect the whole world economy. Therefore, effective and thoughtful maintenance extends the life of an asset and enhances its reliability. To prevent huge losses in production and ultimately satisfy customer needs, the maintenance jobs are preferred to be performed during times of low demand. Thus, operation planning and maintenance scheduling decisions are dependent and should be optimized simultaneously. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop an integrated mathematical model for the operation and maintenance planning of the oil and gas supply chain. The utility of the proposed model has been demonstrated using the Saudi Arabian HCSC. The proposed model effectively produces optimal operation and maintenance schedule decisions. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the effect of critical parameters on the obtained results.</jats:p>"

The research work was conducted through the following methods of data collection, (questionnaire and interview). Krecjie and morgan sampling techniques was adopted in administering the questionnaire, because it was the best sampling techniques that suited the study. The result of the findings indicated that ground water sources are now the major sources of water used in the study area, pipe borne water was generally inadequate. Dala, Kano Municipal, Fagge and Gwale were the areas mostly affected with scarcity of pipe borne water. Other sources of water for household usage included water from vendors and water supply Tankers. Some sources of water were founded inactive (that is sources of water producing less or no water due to some problems). Most people in the area depend on sachet water as their source of drinking water. Finally, in order to overcome some of the problems of water is their source of drinking water.

The standards and practices for implementing this new technology are not yet in place which impede its full acceptance despite being useful. Blockchain applications have specific concerns like non-repudiation, data privacy, immutable transactions etc. which should be addressed for the implementation of technology. Goal oriented Requirements Engineering is a popular technique that helps in understanding business goals in a comprehensive manner.  As a first step towards formalizing the requirements analysis, this paper focuses on identifying the goals and softgoals for blockchain enabled systems. Specifically, a case study on blockchain enabled food supply chain has been explored for identifying the goals and softgoals.

Additionally, the study aims to propose an applicable and consistent method to forecast urban water consumption by using soft computing techniques. The investigation highlights the hourly, daily and monthly water consumption levels as well as the relationship between climate change and water demand using gene expression programming (GEP).

The results of the empirical analysis of 301 companies that are establishing a green supply chain are as follows. First, top management’s support positively affects the level of collaboration with suppliers and customers in the green supply chain. Secondly, support from top management has a direct impact on the company’s environmental performance. Thirdly, the environmental collaboration of participating companies partially plays a mediation role between the support of top management and the environmental performance. This study has significance in that it analyzes the theoretical mechanism of top management’s support for environmental collaboration with participating companies, leading to environmental performance, and draws implications.</jats:p>"

The study design was a randomized complete block design with three replications and 16 treatments with four levels of irrigation water percentage based on field capacity (100% Fc, 80% Fc, 60% Fc and 40% Fc), and four levels of nitrogen (without nitrogen, 100 kg N/ha, 200 kg N/ha and 300 kg N/ha) were used. RWC values were used to evaluate the performance of the eight crop water stress indicators. The results showed that the best performance results of the studied vegetation indices were DANS, CTSD and CTCV, respectively. As observed, R2 values were 0.88, 0.76 and 0.67, respectively.</jats:p>",

Performance evaluation translates into key performance indicators (KPIs) with a high impact on increasing overall efficacy and efficiency. As the pool of KPIs has increased over time in the context of evaluating the supply chain management (SCM) system’s performance and assessing, communicating and managing its risks, a mathematical model based on neural networks has been developed. The SCM system has been structured into subsystems with the most relevant KPIs for set subsystems and their most important contributions on the increase in the overall SCM system performance and sustainability. As a result of the performed research based on the interview method, the five most relevant KPIs of each SCM subsystem and the most relevant problems are underlined. The main goal of this paper is to develop a performance evaluation model that links specific problems with the most relevant KPIs for every subsystem of the supply chain management. This paper demonstrates that by using data mining, the relationship between certain problems that appear in the supply chain management of every company and specific KPIs can be identified. The paper concludes with a graphical user interface (GUI) based on neural networks using the multilayer perceptron artificial intelligence algorithm where the most trustworthy KPIs for each selected problem can be predicted. This aspect provides a highly innovative contribution in solving supply chain management problems provided by organizations by allowing them to holistically track, communicate, analyze and improve the SCM system and ensure overall system sustainability.</jats:p>"

In this sense, applying logistic strategies such as VMI (Vendor Managed Inventory) allows a system to manage distribution processes from a central point or depot. Additionally, the components of the chain work more closely with it, which allows increasing global performance, instead of individually developing each sector.\nMethod: A stochastic mathematical model is proposed which considers a network of customers, where products are delivered from a central depot. These customers can share part of their product with the central depot for redistribution, aiming to minimize shortage for other customers. A mathematical model is proposed which includes the elements involved in distribution processes. It is then reformulated to consider shortage and the linearization of some of its elements.\nResults: Results show that implementing or adapting logistic strategies, such as managing from a central point and sharing resources along the supply chain, allows companies to reduce the complexity of some decisions and improve performance.\nConclusions: Implementing logistic strategies such as centralized management and sharing resources along a supply network allows companies to reduce the complexity of some decisions and, in turn, improve their performance.</jats:p>"

ABC classification is usually used for inventory items classification because the number of inventory items is so large that it is not computationally feasible to set stock and service control guidelines for each individual item. Moreover, in ABC classification, the inter-relationship between items is not considered. But practically, the sale of one item could affect the sale of other items (cross selling effect). Hence, within time-periods, the inventories should be classified. In this article, a modified approach is proposed considering both time-periods and cross-selling effect to rank inventory items. A numerical example and an empirical study with a data set are used to evaluate the proposed approach. It is illustrated that by using this modified approach, the ranking of items may get affected resulting in higher profit.</p>",

It argues that this concept is to some extent embedded in the concept of the undertaking under competition law with the consequence that parent companies – under certain conditions – can be held liable for competition law infringements committed by subsidiaries. The liability can be termed “vicarious” because it is imposed regardless of whether the parent company was involved in or ought to have had any knowledge of the competition law infringements committed by the subsidiary. Whereas such liability has until recently only been imposed for administrative fines, the Skanska decision changes this. Following this decision it must be assumed that parent companies can also be held vicariously liable for civil liability incurred by a subsidiary. It is pointed out that it is a separate question whether the Akzo-presumption rule, established with regard to the imposition of fines for competition law infringements, can also be applied in a pure civil liability case concerning parental liability. Next, the article discusses whether the results reached in the area of competition law can be transferred to other areas of the law. In this regard, the article analyses recent case law with regard to parental liability for workers’ injuries and environmental damage and compares these areas of the law to competition law. Finally, the article discusses whether the concept of the undertaking can be extended to apply also in situations where companies are not tied by ownership but by contract. In this regard the article focuses on the (possibly) emerging concept of supply chain liability.</jats:p>"

Bridges are the vital structures which must be designed to prevent failure against the effects of scour. Scour holes can occur without warning and cause the failure of a bridge. The main significant issues in hydraulic and river engineering are to determine the connection between parameters affecting the maximum and minimum depth of scour. The scour depth in the alluvial stream below a river bed differs based on the flows, pier shape, pier size and sediment characteristics. Dual bridges of basically the same structure are placed parallel to and only a small distance away from an existing bridge, either on the upstream or downstream side. Naturally, the backwater generated by dual bridges is bigger than that of a single bridge but lower than the value resulting from separate consideration of the two bridges. In the present work, an hydraulic model is used to simulate the stability of a bridge in the study area, namely ‘Sardar Bridge’ on the Tapi river. Scour profiles for various flood events have been assessed for a particular bridge. The velocity of flow is used to estimate depths of scour at different piers and abutments. Estimating depth of the scour during the design can significantly decrease the overall cost of bridge foundation construction. Results from the present study show that construction of a new bridge should be proposed on the upstream side rather than downside side of the existing bridge. By doing so, hydraulic stability of the existing bridge is ensured.</jats:p>",

A promising approach is the intelligent control of Industrial Energy Supply Systems (IESS), which provide various energy services to industrial production facilities and machines. Due to the high complexity of such systems widespread conventional control approaches often lead to suboptimal operating behavior and limited flexibility. Rising digitization in industrial production sites offers the opportunity to implement new advanced control algorithms e. g. based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize the operational strategies of IESS.This paper presents a comparative study of different controllers for optimized operation strategies. For this purpose, a framework is used that allows for a standardized comparison of rule-, model- and data-based controllers by connecting them to dynamic simulation models of IESS of varying complexity. The results indicate that controllers based on DRL and MILP have a huge potential to reduce energy-related cost of up to 50% for less complex and around 6% for more complex systems. In some cases however, both algorithms still show unfavorable operating behavior in terms of non-direct costs such as temperature and switching restrictions, depending on the complexity and general conditions of the systems.</jats:p>",

Although blockchain technology has been lauded as a way for firms to build sustainable supply chain networks, the rate of acceptance of this technology remains low. Therefore, this study seeks to identify the factors that discourage firms from merging blockchain with the supply chain. Instead of providing further reasons for adopting blockchain technology, we try to understand what deters firms from adding blockchain to their operations. Following the deductive approach, a confirmatory factor analysis is conducted on pre-test questionnaires to test, improve, and verify the constructs (questions) to measure the hypothesized factors. A theoretical model is proposed based on the hypotheses, and structural equation modeling is applied. The results are estimated using the partial least squares approach and a sample of 83 respondents. Our findings based on our empirical data support most of our hypotheses. We find that various factors impede the adoption of blockchain technologies, including technological barriers, constraints rooted in organizations and the environment, and system-related governmental barriers. In addition, various factors are critical determinants of resistance to blockchain in the technological, organizational, and environmental dimensions.</jats:p>"

This report examines essential job skills required of the middle-skill workforce (workers with more than a high school degree, but less than a four-year college degree). Many of these middle-skill transportation and supply chain jobs are what the Federal Reserve Bank defines as “opportunity occupations” -- jobs that pay above median wages and can be accessible to those without a four-year college degree. This report lays out the complex landscape of selected technological disruptions of the supply chain to understand the new workforce needs of these middle-skill workers, followed by competencies identified by industry. With workplace social distancing policies, logistics organizations now rely heavily on data management and analysis for their operations. All rungs of employees, including warehouse workers and truck drivers, require digital skills to use mobile devices, sensors, and dashboards, among other applications. Workforce training requires a focus on data, problem solving, connectivity, and collaboration. Industry partners identified key workforce competencies required in digital literacy, data management, front/back office jobs, and in operations and maintenance. Education and training providers identified strategies to effectively develop workforce development programs. This report concludes with an exploration of the role of Institutes of Higher Education in delivering effective workforce education and training programs that reimagine how to frame programs to be customizable, easily accessible, and relevant.</jats:p>"

This paper has studied omni-channel retailing in which the retailers sell low-carbon products through online and physical channels. The research has been conducted under three different decision circumstances (i.e., physical store-leader Stackelberg model and online store-leader Stackelberg model under the decentralized decision and centralized decision). The results show that both the retailers' profit in a single channel and the total profit in two channels will decrease with the customers' preference and the effort level of emission reduction. In addition, under decentralized decision, online store-leader Stackelberg model is more beneficial to the retailers.</jats:p>",

The aim of this work is to determine the total concentration and the homological distribution in rivers and there sediments, in central Israel. The concentrations of APEOs in the water of these rivers and in their sediments were found to be 11.83–55.32 μg/L, and 99.68–1,176.61 μg/kg, respectively. The APEOs' concentration level decreases as the sample is taken from a deeper layer of the sediment. A possible explanation for this is that in APEOs molecules, the hydrophilic fraction (CH2-CH2-O) increases the APEOs' absorption into sediment layers close to water, being saturated with water. In addition, the organic biofilm in the sediment layers used as schmutzdecke can reduce the concentration levels of APEOs that penetrates the deep layers of the sediment. The dominant homologues of APEOs in the river watercourse were those with 9–15 units of ethylene oxide (EO). Homologues with 1–12 units of ethylene oxide were found to be the dominant ones in the sediment layers of Hadera and Alexander rivers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globalization of business around the world has turned individual firms into groups of collaborating business units whereby companies do not operate in isolation but function as integral part of big supply chain networks (SCN). Organization of SCN is quite complex as they operate with uncertainty in demands and operations. However, supply chain networks are required to be optimized in order to reduce the overall supply chain cost and increase service levels. Since these objectives are normally conflicting and incommensurable, instead of a singular solution, it is preferred to obtain a set of equitable solutions which is commonly referred to as set of Pareto optimal solutions. Subsequently, a suitable solution can be chosen by the user from the set of equitable solutions. In the present research, a multi-echelon SCN problem is formulated and two important objectives are identified. It is desired to minimize the total cost of supply chain network and at the same time maximize customer service level in terms of supply to demand ratio. Simultaneous optimization of these objectives has been carried out using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) called NSGA-II, which works with population of SCN solutions and is more likely to provide set of globally optimized solutions. However, at the conclusion of optimization, user needs to select a final solution from the Pareto optimal set of solutions after careful analysis. Existing approaches to carry out such analysis are complex and time consuming. We propose a novel method involving fuzzy logic in this research by which fuzzy indices corresponding to each of the solutions in the Pareto Front (PF) are obtained. Fuzzy indices of all the Pareto optimal SCN solutions are later compared to reach to a final solution from the Pareto optimal set.</jats:p>",

The EU wood pellet consumption is expected to further increase in response to the ambitious energy and climate goals for 2030. Currently, wood pellets are mainly produced from sawdust and other sawmill residues; however, other types of forest feedstock are being investigated in order to meet the increasing wood pellet demand and move toward greater energy independence. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the environmental impact of different wood pellet supply chains. A comparative cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment is performed considering the following wood feedstock systems: (i) sawdust from sawmill (S1), (ii) roundwood logs (S2), (iii) whole trees from forest thinning operation (S3), and (iv) logging residues produced during forest tree harvesting (S4). The study focuses on Global Warming Potential (GWP), Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP), Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP), and Human Toxicity Potential (HTP). Results show that S3 displays the lowest figures on all the environmental impact categories considered in this study. Compared to the reference case S1, S3 shows a GWP reduction of 46%, an ODP reduction of 6.6%, a POCP reduction of 14.8%, and HTP reduction of 13.2%. S3 and S4 have lower GWP than S1 and S2, even when the biogenic CO2 emissions are considered. Overall, the life cycle phases that have the highest GWP, POCP, and HTP are the burning phase and the preparation of the material to be pelletized, particularly the drying process. Nevertheless, the main phases that contribute to the ODP are the forest operations and the pellet preparation.</jats:p>"

In this study, an inexact multi-stage interval-parameter partial information programming model (IMIPM) is proposed for urban water resources planning and management under uncertainties. Optimization techniques of two-stage stochastic programming (TSP), interval-parameter programming (IPP), linear partial information theory (LPI) and multistage stochastic programming (MSP) are combined into one general framework. IMIPM is used to tackle uncertainties like interval numbers, water inflow probabilities expressed as linear partial information, dynamic features in a long planning time and joint probabilities in water resources management. It is applied to Harbin where the manager needs to allocate water from multi-water sources to multi-water users during multi-planning time periods. Four water flow probability scenarios are obtained, which are associated with uncertainties of urban rainfall information. The results show that the dynamics features and uncertainties of system parameters (such as water allocation targets and shortage) are considered in this model by generating a set of representative scenarios within a multistage context. The results also imply that IMIPM can truly reflect the actual urban water resources management situation, and provide managers with decision-making space and technical support to promote the sustainable development of economics and the ecological environment in cities.</jats:p>",

The morphometric method was used and statistical analysis was performed. It was found that men and women with dolichocranial type of skull have an asymmetry in the height of the hemispheres of the brain. In men, the height of the left hemisphere of the brain is greater than in women, but the height of the right hemisphere of the brain in men is less. The height of the left hemisphere of the brain in men with mesocranial type is greater than the right, in women the height of the right hemisphere of the brain prevails. In people with brachycranial type of skull, the height of the left hemisphere of the brain prevails in men, in women the height of the right and left hemispheres of the brain are the same. According to the dolichocranial type of skull, the height of the left occipital lobe predominates in men, and the height of the right occipital lobe predominates in women. The height of the left occipital lobe in men with mesocranial type of skull is greater than the right. In women with mesocranial type of skull, the height of the left occipital lobe predominates. In people with brachycranial type of skull, the height of the right occipital lobe of the brain prevails in both men and women. The height of the cerebral hemispheres in men and women with brachycranial type of skull is greater than in those with mesocranial and dolichocranial. The height of the occipital lobes of the brain in men and women with dolichocranial type of skull is slightly higher than in those with mesocranial and brachycranial.

The indicators used included community participation in; project documentation and archiving, procurement closure and bills settlement and project handing over and celebration. The study adopted descriptive survey design and correlation research design. The descriptive survey design was used to describe characteristics of the population being studied whilst a correlational research was used to describe the degree to which variables under the study were related. The target population was 8357 and the sample size was 382. Out of this, 310 positively responded. The sample comprised of households and management committee members. The research instruments included questionnaires, focus group discussion and interview schedules. Stratified proportional sampling and random sampling were used to collect primary qualitative and quantitative data. The data was compiled, given codes and input into SPSS version 25 computer program for statistical analysis and presentation. The study findings showed that community participation in project documentation and archiving (R=0.680, p=0.00&lt;0.05, R2=0.461), procurement closure and bills settlement (R=0.772, p=0.00&lt;0.05, R2=0.595) and project handing over and celebration (R=0.746, p=0.00&lt;0.05, R2=0.554) are significant explanatory variables with respect to project performance at 95% confidence level. Therefore, the study concluded that the community should be encouraged to actively participate more during the project closure process in order to enhance the performance of their community water supply projects.</jats:p>"

The objective of this research is to reflect on the possible impacts of the Coronavirus crisis in the global supply chains and provide some recommendations to overcome the present situation, offering suggestions for future research: (1) What are the contingency factors affecting Supply Chains in the complex COVID-19 operating environment? (2) How do these factors affect post-COVID-19 operating performance? After a contextualization of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and its impacts, theoretical background on Supply Chains and Supply Chain Management are presented, and a summary of the main scenarios for the post-COVID-19 crisis are discussed. The propositions regarding the contingency factors and their impact on the Supply Chain operating performance in post-COVID-19 suggest that successful companies will focus on creating a new kind of operational performance and minimize risks. To that end, companies will aim to improve their operations’ resilience (ability to resist, hold on, and recover from shocks) and accelerate the end-to-end digital transformation. Consumers will have to adapt to the contact-free economy, less low-cost supply chains, and put additional emphasis on service levels. Governments will reinforce the focus in the health sector supply chain and increase spending in the health and social care sectors. Furthermore, the longer, the more concentrated, the less transparent, and the more price sensitivity is the supply chain, the more challenging the adaptation to the new pos pandemic realities. Suggestions for future research are also provided.</jats:p>",

A series of non-dominated solutions, that is, representing the optimal spare parts supply schemes are obtained. In order to comprehensively measure the performance of these solutions, suitable quantitative metrics are selected, and the secondary goal-based cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model has been used to evaluate the efficiency of the obtained optimal schemes. The improved DEA model overcomes the problems that the efficient units cannot be sorted and the optimal weight is not unique in traditional DEA model.

Relevant literatures and available data were reviewed in 2018 to find the trend of food availability and consumption in relation to developing strategies for sustained production and supply in Nepal. The per capita calories uptake is higher (2830 versus 2220 kcal) with higher in rural communities and to the richer families (4000 kcal/person/day). Whereas the protein and edible oil and fat uptake is increasing, but are yet insufficient. The diet is mostly dominated by cereals and the consumption of pulses, fruit, vegetables and animal products were comparatively lower. There is double burden of women under-nutrition (18.2%) and over-nutrition (13.5%). At present, Nepal is self sufficient only on tea, coffee, and poultry eggs. Where the import dependency ratio of fruit (88.1%), oils (83.5%) and pulses (73.4%) were very high and are in increasing trend. However, the self sufficiency ratios of cereals (97.4%), vegetables (65.9%), potato (88.8%), milk (79%), sugar (62.6%) and meat (61%) are still higher. Raising the productivity of cereals by 0.06 t/ha, vegetables 3.49 t/ha, potato/tubers 1.59 t/ha, spices 0.58 t/ ha, milk 0.30 t/head and a considerable increment of meat productivity could make the country self sufficient. Moreover, it is very hard to be self sufficient on fruit, oilseed, and fish because of their small area coverage/herd sizes, low productivity and long gestation period required. It is needed to prioritize the commodities for the allocation of production areas/heard sizes, linking all the development/infrastructure programs and output based investment for improved food production, marketing and consumption to restore national food sufficiency for livelihood support and economic resilience.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examined the relationship between supply integration and relationship stability and the relationship between relationship stability and performance; furthermore, the moderation effect of environmental uncertainty on supply chain integration and relationship stability was analyzed. The subjects are typical small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries that focus on niche markets to compete with large-scale manufacturers. Questionnaires were distributed to manufacturers to collect empirical data; in total, 566 valid samples were gathered. The results indicate that supply chain integration has positive effects on relational stability and that relational stability has positive effects on supply chain performance. Relational stability is a mediator between supply chain integration and supply chain performance. The contingency effects of environmental uncertainty on the relationships between internal integration and relational stability were determined in this research. This research framework extended past research on supply chain management; part of the research explored the relationship between supply chain integration and different measures of supply chain performance, as well as whether uncertainty affects supply chain integration and supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

Meeting water needs in dispersed small islands under changeable climate and frequent extreme events is difficult. Improved governance is central to better water management. Integrated national sustainable development plans have been promulgated as a necessary improvement, but their relevance to island countries has been questioned. Tonga’s national planning instrument is the Tonga Strategic Development Framework, 2015–2025 (TSDFII). Local Community Development Plans (CDPs), developed by rural villages throughout Tonga’s five Island Divisions, are also available. Analyses are presented of island water sources from available census and limited hydrological data, and of the water supply priorities in TSDFII and in 117 accessible village CDPs. Census and hydrological data showed large water supply differences between islands. Nationally, TDSFII did not identify water supply as a priority. In CDPs, 84% of villages across all Island Divisions ranked water supply as a priority. Reasons for the mismatch are advanced. It is recommended that improved governance in water in Pacific Island countries should build on available census and hydrological data and increased investment in local island planning processes.</jats:p>"

Three hundred experimental data were used to derive the generalized clear water scour relationship around circular a bridge pier by using genetic algorithm (GA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) techniques. The GA-based maximum scour depth relationship showed more precise results than MLR. In addition, the present GA and MLR relationships were compared with some equations developed by earlier researchers. Graphically and statistically, it was observed that the GA and MLR relationships provide better agreement with experimental data as compared to earlier relationships.

The study employed stratified random sampling technique in coming up with a sample size. Pilot study was carried out to establish the validity and reliability of the research instruments. The instruments were designed appropriately according to the study objectives. The data collected was analyzed by use of descriptive and inferential statistics. The study used multiple regression and correlation analysis to show the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The data generated was keyed in and analyzed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 to generate information which was presented using charts, frequencies and percentagesResults and conclusion: The regression equation above has established that taking all factors into account (inventory categorization, inventory control techniques, information technology integration and demand and supply forecasting) constant at zero, performance of state corporations in Kenya will be an index of 0.817.The findings presented also shows that taking all other independent variables at zero, a unit increase in inventory categorization will lead to a 0.537 increase in performance of state corporations in Kenya. The P-value was 0.000 which is less 0.05 and thus the relationship was significant. The study also found that a unit increase in inventory control techniques will lead to a 0.097 increase in performance of state corporations in Kenya. The P-value was 0.002 and thus the relationship was significant. In addition, the study found that a unit increase in information technology integration will lead to a 0.067 increase in the performance of state corporations in Kenya. The P-value was 0.000 and thus the relationship was significant. Lastly, the study found that a unit increase in demand and supply forecasting will lead to a 0.08 increase in the performance of state corporations in Kenya. The P-value was 0.001 and hence the relationship was significant since the p-value was lower than 0.05. The findings of the study show that, inventory categorization contributed most to the performance of state corporations in Kenya. The findings of the study indicated that; safety stock management, inventory control techniques, information technology integration and demand and supply forecasting have a positive relationship with performance of state corporations.Unique contribution to theory, policy and practice: Finally, the study recommended that public institutions should embrace inventory optimization practices so as to improve their performance and further researches should to be carried out in other public entities to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

As all blood transfusions carry risk and cost, the avoidance of transfusion through PACS represents an opportunity to reduce risk of allogeneic transfusion related reactions or complications and reduce costs from blood product utilization. Although the benefits of PACS has been documented in the literature, quality assurance demonstrations of the blood volume returned to veteran patients undergoing surgeries with a high likelihood of significant blood loss are sparse; thus, we present the quality assurance study of PACS usage in a VAMC.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Quality assurance documentation from the American Red Cross (ARC) that provides autologous cell salvage services at the VAMC were examined from February 2017 to August 2018, for a total of 17 months examined.

Among the procedures with blood loss, an average of 864 mL of blood was lost (1230 mL when the low blood loss cases are excluded) with an average volume returned of 511 mL or the approximate equivalent of 2 units of RBCs when utilized. Two cases with significant estimated blood loss (5400 mL and 4850 mL) had 2250 mL and 2125 mL or about the equivalent of 9 RBC units each.

The study reviewed both theoretical and empirical literature and then proposed the research methodology that addressed the gaps identified in literature as well as to validate the statistical hypotheses. The researcher preferred this method because it allows an in-depth study of the subject. The study population was all public hospitals in Kenya. To gather data, structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 76 staff in procurement, administration and finance departments from the four largest public hospitals in Nairobi County; Kenyatta National Hospital, Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital, Mbagathi District Hospital and Pumwani Maternity. The target population was all public hospitals in Nairobi City County. The target population was first stratified then using simple random sampling among the four strata, select the samples. The study combined two methods in its data collection that is, questionnaires and key informant interviews. After data collection, quantitative data was coded using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. Data was analyzed through descriptive statistical methods such as means, standard deviation, frequencies and percentage. Inferential analysis was used in relation to correlation analysis and regression analysis to test the relationship between the four explanatory variables and the explained variable.Findings: R square value of 0.647 means that 64.7% of the corresponding variation in performance of public hospitals in Kenya can be explained or predicted by (contract planning, monitoring and evaluation, contractor relationship management and dispute resolution) which indicated that the model fitted the study data. The results of regression analysis revealed that there was a significant positive relationship between dependent variable and independent variable at (β = 0.647), p=0.000 &lt;0.05). The findings of the study concluded that contract planning, monitoring and evaluation, contractor relationship management, dispute resolution have a positive relationship with performance of public hospitals in Kenya.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended that public institutions should embrace contract management practices so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other public institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

The analysis at the aggregate level indicates a significant positive relationship between supplier involvement and overall NPD performance. However, the analysis also indicates that this relationship may be contingent on the presence of various moderating factors. Further, the detailed analysis suggests that it is important to understand that certain supplier involvement dimensions do not simultaneously affect all performance dimensions. This study highlights the dimensions of supplier involvement with the greatest impact, emphasizes the importance of considering moderating factors in future investigations, and identifies areas of future research on the topic.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban shrinkage is a remarkable phenomenon that cannot be convincingly explained by existing theories on urban growth and is closely linked to the global supply chain (SC) nodes in the labour market. This paper shows how a municipality in which an activity SC cell (production or service) is located as a node in the SC graph can be made more attractive for industrial activities and human resources, more sustainable, and less shrinking, through appropriate tax policies and investments in the infrastructure of the central places—cities where production or services are located. To this end, we developed the decision support model for the joint control of urban rightsizing by SC managers and local authorities. In the model we linked the extended material requirements problem (MRP) with a normalised asymmetric gravity model. The paper outlines how local authorities and institutions, when planning for the growing intensity of production or services, in a city where the number of workers is insufficient, should take into account the impact of taxation as well as investment in the infrastructure of a municipality, and not just net wages, in order to attract human resources. They need a decision support model for their negotiations on the rightsizing of the city. The objective was to develop a model of fiscal mechanisms in the interactive decision making processes of local authorities and SC managers to control the availability of labour in the city where production or services are running and need to grow because SC managers want to increase production or services but the available labour force is shrinking. A case study in Slovenia shows how local authorities and SC managers should work together to maintain a sustainable activity cell in a functional region of the urban agglomeration where this production or service is located. It models how to plan the rightsizing. Such an integrated policy best achieves the desired intensity of the supply chain, thereby avoiding the relocation of activities outside the region, which allows unsustainable flows of human resources and uncontrolled shrinking of a city or region.</jats:p>"

This research aims to shed light on the environmental sustainability of companies involved in maritime logistics at the major Finnish seaport, HaminaKotka. This seaport is a part of International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Baltic and North Sea emission control area, with special emission-reducing measures contributing directly to United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by mitigating negative impacts of industrial activity on environment and climate change. Two semi-structured interviews with companies at HaminaKotka were carried out to construct a case study examining the sustainability challenges at hand. In addition, experience of one of the authors in a managerial position at the studied seaport complex, as well as the sustainability communications of the companies situated in the area were used to support the findings. The companies improve environmental sustainability by using multimodal transport chains, alternative fuels in the transports, and environmental sustainability demands towards their partners. However, the most important measures, according to these companies, are transport mode selection and cargo load optimization. Moreover, companies have identified bottlenecks of cargo flow at the hinterland due to road infrastructure constraints. As regulations and customers are requiring environmental sustainability, companies are forced to renew their operations, strategy and business models. Especially, the emission-reducing regulations drive companies to implement means to control the produced emissions.</jats:p>",

The study employed stratified random sampling technique in coming up with a sample size of 127 respondents from a total of 187 target population. Structured and semi structured questionnaires were used to collect data. Data gathered from the questionnaires administered was analyzed by the help of Ms Excel and SPSS version 22, while output was presented inform of frequency tables and charts. The study used both descriptive and inferential statistics to show the relationship between variables.Results and conclusion: The regression equation above has established that taking all factors into account (policy framework, feasibility studies, value for money and risk mitigation) constant at zero, performance of projects among state corporations will be an index of 1.967. The study found that a unit increase in feasibility studies will lead to a 0.358 increase in the performance of PPP projects among state corporations. The P-value was 0.000 and hence the relationship was significant since the p-value was lower than 0.05. The findings presented also shows that taking all other independent variables at zero, a unit increase in policy framework will lead to a 0.132 increase in the performance of PPP projects among state corporations. The P-value was 0.02 which is less 0.05 and thus the relationship was significant. In addition, the study found that a unit increase in value for money will lead to a 0.121 increase in the performance of PPP projects among state corporations. The P-value was 0.000 and thus the relationship was significant because the p-value was less than 0.05. The study also found that a unit increase in risk mitigation will lead to a 0.05 increase in performance of PPP projects among state corporations.

The effect of operating pressure, pH of the wastewater, and sequential treatment option on the permeate flux, COD, phthalate, and micropollutant removal efficiencies were examined. The steady-state permeate fluxes of NF270, NF90, and BW30 membranes were 47.1, 19.0, and 13.9 L/m2/h for 15 bar, respectively. Sequential filtration using NF90 and BW30 membranes to protect the RO membrane was also tested. The initial and steady-state permeate fluxes were 30.4 and 18.9 L/m2/h, respectively, for 15 bar. The effect of wastewater pH in the range 4.0–10.0 was also studied and maximum initial and steady-state permeate fluxes were obtained at pH = 10.0. The permeate quality of NF90 and NF90 + BW30 membranes operated at 15 bar was measured and they showed a high degree for phthalate removal from wastewater from 97.7% to 99.9%. Moreover, a high degree of micropollutants was also obtained from 88.4% to 99.9% for sequential filtration (NF90 + BW30). The COD reduction efficiencies were obtained at 15 bar as 23.3%, 81.5%, and 87.6% for individual NF270, NF90, and BW30 membranes, respectively. However, COD reduction efficiency was increased up to 90.8% when sequential filtration (NF90 + BW30) was applied.</jats:p>",

The model is applied to 27 representative watersheds of the contiguous U.S. to explore how different management strategies can be more effective in mitigating WSDs in watersheds with different drought propagation mechanisms. We find that water supply deficits during droughts (WSDDs) are generally the highest in the Great Plains watersheds, followed by the western U.S. watersheds, and lowest in the eastern U.S. watersheds. We show that different measures can be adopted to mitigate WSDs in different regions. Specifically, in the western U.S. watersheds, the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater can reduce WSDD, that is, increasing surface water utilization and using groundwater recharged through winter precipitation to supplement surface water supply during droughts. In the Great Plains region, water demands need to be brought down to sustainable levels; meanwhile switching from groundwater to surface water supply can significantly reduce WSDD as the alluvial aquifers in this region provide a stable baseflow, which can act as a steady source of water supply during droughts. In the eastern U.S. watersheds, the depletion of limited storage capacity during droughts can lead to WSDD for short periods of time, which highlights the need for expansion of storage capacity in this region.</jats:p>",

This problem is relevant and researches in this sense can help policies that aim to improve the functioning of supply chains. Harmony of supply chain is the collaboration level of supply chain participants which is measured in terms of common planning and action guidelines they have, how they share information and generally the overall relations they have one another. Being descriptive in design, the study has targeted main live animals supply chain actors who are 719 producers, 6 traders and 2 exporters in Gurage zone from whom 257 producers were randomly chosen as a sample and all the traders and exporter have been used directly from whom questionnaires were collected from. The findings have proved that there is relatively consistent flow of information throughout the supply chain actors in live animals export in Gurage zone. Additionally there have been seen that there is a culture of planning jointly among the chain actors followed by having common updating means in case of plan fails to meet the expectations even though there exists problems of sitting for evaluation of actions made by the chain elements which is the key for future improvement of the export business. Finally it has been found that the overall harmony of the chain actors is attractive with some reservations.</jats:p>"

This study was carried out from November 2014 to June 2015 with Landsat 8 reflectance values and field measured water quality data that were used to develop regression-analysis-based retrieval algorithms. Water quality parameters considered included turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), nitrates, ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total algae counts. Results show that turbidity levels exceeded the recommended limits for raw water for potable water treatment while TN and TP values are within acceptable values. Turbidity, TN, and TP and total algae count showed a medium to strong positive linear relationship between Landsat predicted and measured water quality data while TSS showed a weak linear relationship. The regression coefficients between predicted and measured values were: turbidity (R2 = 0.767); TN (R2 = 0.798,); TP (R2 = 0.907); TSS (R2 = 0.284,) and total algae count (R2 = 0.851). Prediction algorithms are generally the best fit to derive water quality parameters. Remote sensing is recommended for frequent and continuous monitoring of Olushandja Dam as it has the ability to provide rapid information on the spatio-temporal variability of surface water quality.</jats:p>",

The desiccant cooling system in the present study has been developed for multi-room control with a hybrid air distribution, whereby mixing and displacement ventilation occur simultaneously. Due to this distribution of air flow, the thermal comfort was changed, and the thermal comfort indicators conflicted. The evaluation indicators included the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) comfort zone, predicted mean vote (PMV), and effective draft temperature (EDT). The dry-bulb temperature displayed a distribution of 26.2–26.8 °C in the cooling spaces, i.e., living room, kitchen, and dining room. When determined based on the standard ASHRAE comfort zone, the space where desiccant cooling takes place entered the comfort zone for summer. Due to the influence of solar radiation, the globe temperature was more than 2 °C higher than the dry-bulb temperature at the window. A difference of up to 6% in humidity was observed locally in the cooling space. In the dining room located along the outlet of the desiccant cooling device, the PMV entered the comfort zone, but was slightly above 1 in the rest of the space. Conversely, as for the EDT, its value was lower than −1.7 in the dining room, but was included in the comfort zone in the rest of the space. By adjusting the discharge angle upward, the PMV and EDT were expected to be more uniform in the cooling space. In particular, the optimum discharge angle obtained was 40° upward from the discharge surface.</jats:p>"

This study aims to contribute to this issue in the competitive context of the tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment centres (DTC) in Douala, Cameroon. Methods: The “observed” number of patients attending the DTCs was compared to the “expected” number, using a bivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression and the analysis of variance were used to identify the factors associated to attendance of DTCs. Spatial analysis was performed to access the spatial-economic model hiding behind the distribution of the DTCs.Results: There is a spatial-economic model hiding behind the distribution of DTCs in Douala, which dictate their solicitation. The decentralization policy advocated by the national program against tuberculosis (NTP) is not always followed by the patients: The “expected” and the “observed” number of patients in DTCs are not correlated. Patients seeking treatment in DTCs closer to their residence are mainly women and patients from relative poor households, while attendance of DTC was associated with the quality of serviceConclusion: Attendance HF is dictate by the spatial-economic model. The policy of creating HF for TB is not followed by patients in competitive context. Attendance of HF by TB patients is associated with some socioeconomics factors;</jats:p>"

It affected particular age groups in more numbers. They were the age group of children and aged peoples. This study of saw dust recycling came under the Indoor air quality Engineering. This paper would give a chance to study indoor air pollution in deep and solve air pollution problems. The saw mills produced more amount of saw dust per year and dumped in open ground. In general, the saw dust was disposed of in the open ground firing method. The air pollution was increased by this type of activity done by the saw mill owners. Due to urbanization and population growth, the living people occupied nearby areas of saw mills would lead to health-related problems. The present study highly focused on the saw dust recycling process with forced air circulation driven by the solar-powered unit and reduction in composting time. The conversion of saw dust into a natural fertilizer (N-fertilizer) was highly possible and served as a natural gift to each farmer. This fertilizer was completely replaced the existing large scale usage of chemical fertilizer in the agricultural lands. This process was an eco-friendly, low cost, and high root absorption rate in agricultural cultivation. The continuous usage of natural fertilizer in a land practice would produce an increased yield up to 20-30% in all cultivation crops. The main benefit of natural fertilizer utilization would maintain the NPK in the soil for a long time.</jats:p>"

The framework of an interactive machine learning algorithm was developed to meet the challenges in solving large-scale optimization problems. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used with the knowledge gained from solving previous problems with different scenarios to define a good starting point for a solution searching process. By using an initial solution, known as “warm start”, the search space can be reduced to get more opportunity to find an optimal solution. The applicability of the proposed method was evaluated by using it to determine the optimal facility locations for a biomass supply chain problem using a real case study from Central Vietnam. The supply chain planning model is based on an optimization model, where the goal is to maximize the benefits from meeting the electricity demand minus the total cost from facility cost, penalty cost from lost demand, and operational costs form the supply chain. The structure of the ANN, the number of intermediate layers and the number of processing nodes, was determined by comparing the accuracy from different configurations. The ANN with two intermediate layers possesses the best performance from the training and testing datasets. The proposed model succeeded in predicting the facility location with more than 98% prediction accuracy. The results from our framework provide optimal solutions while saving runtime.</jats:p>",

A methodology, utilizing a combination of topological network analysis and game theory, is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of protection strategies for certain components in the infrastructure under various attack scenarios. This paper focuses on protective strategies that are based on different attack scenarios as well as on the connectivity of the critical infrastructure components. The methodology proposed allows optimization of protection strategies in terms of investment in critical infrastructure protection in order to reduce expenditures on local infrastructure protection or on a single critical infrastructure for small projects. A case study of a power-supply substation is included to validate the analytical framework. The results indicate that the framework is highly applicable to other types of critical infrastructures facing similar threats. The results suggest that when only terrorist attacks are considered, improving the robustness of CI has a much higher effectiveness and efficiency than improving CI redundancy. The research methodology in this paper can be applied to a wide range of critical infrastructures and systems that may be at risk from manmade extreme events.</jats:p>"

The transport of dangerous and oversize goods is one of the most difficult specialties in the field of goods transport in public transport, in particular in road and rail transport. Such transport is regulated by a number of legal acts that do not apply to companies carrying out tasks related to the transport of loads, the so-called neutral. The United Nations has created a closed TN directory, giving everyone a four-digit \"UN number\", at the same time dividing them into classes depending on the threat or the predominant threat. The provisions of the ADR agreement relate, inter alia, to the rules (requirements) for TN transport in terms of limiting the possible effects of a potential release of hazardous substances (e.g. as a result of road or rail collisions), as well as, above all, the forms and principles of preventing the possibility of such events. The transport of dangerous goods is a special type of transport and it is subject to specific legal provisions, meeting and observing a number of specific requirements. The safety of this type of transport depends on the proper organization of its transport and the maximum involvement of participants in the entire process. The organization of the transport of hazardous materials requires a comprehensive, comprehensive view of the vehicle, packaging and cargo (means of transport and packaging should be adapted to the transported goods) as well as people involved in the preparation of transport, drivers with appropriate authorizations and training, setting the route, securing this routes in terms of maintaining safety in the event of an emergency.

Although there is tremendous emphasis on the implementation of this versatile technology at various levels, many of us are unaware of its significance and its consequences. This study examines the perception and awareness of people in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, of the RWH system through a questionnaire survey. The survey was conducted to infer basic information on rainwater harvesting features, water quality and conservation, economics of implementation and financial support. The results show that there is an increasing need to promote the usage of harvested rainwater for domestic purposes rather than direct groundwater recharge. The potential risks in the reliable supply of available water sources demand large-scale implementation of RWH especially in apartments. Fewer people are aware of the technical details of operation and maintenance of the RWH system (22.2%) while more people are aware of the general layout of the system (50.5%). Longer experience in using RWH systems (for more than two years) builds confidence in using them for consumptive uses compared with the response from recent adopters. This also demonstrates the scope for a radical change in the perception of water quality by continuous awareness and financial incentives.</jats:p>",

The scour hole measurements showed that in both rectangular and trapezoidal models, scour hole parameters increased both with the increase in discharge rate and the increase in weir height. Under similar discharge conditions, the scour depth downstream from the rectangular model was greater than that downstream from the trapezoidal model. The dimensionless maximum scour depth, the distance of maximum scour depth from the weir toe, and the scour hole length for the trapezoidal PKW were, on average, 6, 13, and 11% lower than the corresponding ones for the rectangular PKW, respectively. However, these differences decreased with the increase in falling height. For both weir geometries, the maximum scour depth was aligned with the outlet keys. In addition, the maximum scour depth under the outlet keys was 13% greater than the one under the inlet keys.</jats:p>",

We devise a Bayesian estimation technique that incorporates a Tobit-like specification to deal with the censoring problem. We compare and validate our model specifications using pseudo out-of-sample forecasting exercises and Bayes factors. Our results show that the smoothed value of r* declined sharply around the Great Recession, eventually falling below zero, and has remained negative since then.

Based on a fine-grained analysis of 1,378 hand-coded tweets of Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders, the chapter shows which reference groups they denounce and which groups they claim to support, which issues they prioritize and how they articulate these issues. The findings indicate that the political supply of the two politicians is highly comparable. Rather than offering standardized ‘products’ to a general electorate, both radical right politicians use relatively similar forms of ‘product differentiation’ (Eatwell, 2000), by articulating the demands and identities of multiple societal groups in a nativist fashion. Importantly, both leaders do so through ‘dual closure’ (Parkin, 1979), denouncing both elites (above) and non-native out-groups (below).</jats:p>",

The rainwater harvesting system (RWHS) carries a huge potential to enhance surface and groundwater resources in regions having a poor water supply. Recently, several countries have started to promote the updated implementation of such practice to tackle the problem of growing water demand. These considerations motivated our enthusiasm for looking at its current circumstances and the possibility of RWHS in the future. In this regard, the study aims to identify the evidence gap among different determinants (climate change, reliability, water quality and financial viability) intertwined with RWHS. In the paper, studies related to the significance of RWHS amidst scarcity of water around the globe, published in valued journals from 2000 to 2020, are reviewed. We found that the RWHS becomes economically viable when certain steps and risk assessment methods are executed in planning and maintaining this system. The study concludes that drinking water sufficiency is possible if a sustainable drinking water supply system is built via RWHS.</jats:p>",

Raw materials, semi-finished products and finished products in the supply chain may form inventory. Generally speaking, the inventory cost will reach about 20% - 40% of the value of these goods. Therefore, it is very important to control the inventory quantity of goods in the supply chain to reduce the inventory cost and capital occupation. With the development of supply chain in big data, people begin to seek the minimization of total cost of supply chain and the maximization of customer service level. In the big data environment, the connotation of inventory management has also changed dramatically, which requires enterprises to shift from the traditional focus on their own inventory management to the inventory control of the whole supply chain. There are many inventory management schemes in the supply chain environment. In recent years, the more advanced one is vendor managed inventor (VMI). However, due to the limited level of cooperation between suppliers and retailers in VMI, it has its own limitations. Big data Internet can break this limitation. The joint inventory management model can achieve this win-win partnership, which provides a breakthrough in traditional management methods for supply chain inventory management.</jats:p>",

Many nations have responded with export restrictions on these products, restrictions that are permitted under international trade law as a temporary response to short supply conditions generally and to public health emergencies in particular. This Essay argues that such export restrictions are economically counterproductive from a global efficiency perspective, and that governments acting unilaterally will nevertheless employ them due to international externalities that propagate through the “terms of trade.” This observation raises a puzzle as to why international law should facilitate rather than curtail them. The most plausible answer is that legal authority for such measures is a politically necessary “escape clause” in trade agreements, akin to safeguard measures.</jats:p>",

The main processes, principles and features of corporate culture transformation as one of the stages of re-engineering of the company's business processes are considered. The main concepts of corporate culture, management innovations, and re-engineering, which are effective tools for improving the efficiency of enterprise management, are defined. An algorithm for creating a corporate culture is proposed, including its positioning at the strategic level, as well as ensuring appropriate financial results. Corporate culture management is considered as an intangible asset that has value and creates conditions for generating income for the enterprise. In addition, it gives the company advantages by reducing conflicts, improving business relationships, reducing non-production time costs, and increasing the economic efficiency of the business. The factors influencing the level of employee involvement in work and transformation of employee behavior in accordance with the leader's strategic vision for company development and in accordance with his decisions on business re-engineering are identified. The main tasks of business process re-engineering are revealed, key directions and necessary tools for implementing the transformation of corporate culture are highlighted. The research methodology is based on methods of theoretical analysis and generalization of scientific literature and periodicals on the research topic, statistical analysis, classification and analytical method and methods for determining economic efficiency. The approach to scenario modeling of the process of managing the development of corporate culture of an enterprise based on a combination of components of culture, methods of managing it, basic values and strategies of enterprise management as a whole has been further developed, which allows taking into account the multidirectional interests of stakeholders and harmonizing them in the process of managing a multinational logistics company.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the effect of disruptive event, namely recession, on supply base management (measured by supply base size) by using a large and longitudinal dataset on Indian manufacturing firms. It is found that the buyer firms have increased their supply base size at the annual rate of 8.23 suppliers per year per manufacturer during the pre-recession (2004–2007) period. The strategy of having a larger supply base is viable, specifically, in an emerging economy (e.g., India) as the probability of disruptions is high due to the inadequacy of basic inputs such as physical infrastructure, logistics services, technology, etc. Therefore, manufacturers tend to have a number of suppliers for the same product group to reduce supplier dependence. Further, we find that buying firms preferred to have a larger supply base even after a recession (2010–2013). However, they have increased their supply base size at the annual rate of just 0.2 (compared to 8.3 during the pre-recession period) suppliers per year per manufacturer during the post-recession. This study highlights the importance of a disruptive event (proxied by recession), by examining its association with supply base size in the emerging economy perspective. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Codes: C1, C5, C8 </jats:p>",

The CJV supply devices have the acronyms: high-momentum confluent jets (HMCJ), low-momentum confluent jets (LMCJ) and low-momentum confluent jets modified by varying airflow direction (LMCJ-M). A mixing ventilation (MV) slot jet (SJ) supply device was used as a benchmark. Comparisons were made with identical set-up conditions in five cases with different supply temperatures (TS) (16–18 °C), airflow rates (2.2–6.3 ACH) and heat loads (17–47 W/m2). Performances were evaluated based on DR (draft rating), PMV (predicted mean vote), ACE (air change effectiveness) and heat removal effectiveness (HRE). The results show that CJV had higher HRE and IAQ than MV and LMCJ/LMCJ-M had higher ACE than HMCJ. The main effects of lower Ts were higher velocities, DR (HMCJ particularly) and HRE in the occupied zone as well as lower temperatures and PMV-values. HMCJ and LMCJ produce MV conditions at lower airflow rates (&lt;4.2 ACH) and non-uniform conditions at higher airflow rates. LMCJ-M had 7% higher HRE than the other CJV supply devices and produced non-uniform conditions at lower airflow rates (&lt;3.3 ACH). The non-uniform conditions resulted in LMCJ-M having the highest energy efficiency of all devices.</jats:p>"

The results show that differentiated guarantees for remanufactured products are beneficial to extending the guarantee period, reducing the price of remanufactured products, improving CLSC members and overall profits. When consumers are less sensitive to differentiated guarantee for remanufactured products, CLSC decision in each mode has little to do with guarantee cost parameters and guarantor selection. When consumers are more sensitive, the advantages of each guarantee mode are significantly different, and manufacturer guarantee is the common choice of both parties. Finally, an example is given to further verify the conclusion.</jats:p>"

This technical note explores this issue by describing an engagement by the research team with a large consumer packaged‐goods company within their cosmetics supply chain during the launch of a new product family. The company was experiencing high supply–demand mismatch costs that they attributed to their supply chain that was designed to emphasize efficiency over responsiveness. We analyzed the appropriateness of the supply‐chain design through the lens of theory and concluded that the efficient design was in fact a good match for the product. A simulation model allowed us to organize available data and identify the root cause of the mismatch costs. Results from the simulation showed that the mismatch costs stemmed primarily from a failure to deploy small but important responsiveness opportunities: Because the supply chain was designated as efficient, responsiveness was ignored, and this substantially increased mismatches. Mismatches also occurred because decision makers failed to distinguish between delivery and decision lead time.</jats:p>",

This study aims to synthesize quantitative research and to analyze potential moderators on the link between SSCM practices and firm performance. This study draws upon resource‐based view of the firm with the extensions of natural resource‐based view and relational view to underpin study hypotheses. The analysis is based on data collected from 145 independent samples composed of 33,886 firms. The research hypotheses are tested using meta‐analytical procedures. The results show that SSCM practices are significantly and positively correlated with firm's social, operational, economic, and environmental performance dimensions. Additional findings from moderator analysis provide nuanced views of SSCM practices‐performance link. This paper contributes to the literature by underlining the relevance of SSCM, identifying and classifying SSCM practices into a coherent framework. The research findings help policy makers, practitioners and other stakeholders to better understand benefits from the adoption of SSCM practices. Additionally, to the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study that meta‐analytically combined existing empirical evidence of the social supply practices on various types of firm's sustainability performance.</jats:p>",

Signaling through inventory being only tenable when inventory transactions are verifiable at low enough cost, we then turn our attention to how this verifiability can be achieved in practice and argue that blockchain technology could enable it more efficiently than traditional monitoring mechanisms. To demonstrate, we develop b_verify, an open-source blockchain protocol that leverages Bitcoin to provide supply chain transparency at scale and in a cost-effective way. The paper identifies an important benefit of blockchain adoption—by opening a window of transparency into a firm’s supply chain, blockchain technology furnishes the ability to secure favorable financing terms at lower signaling costs. Furthermore, the analysis of the preferred signaling mode sheds light on what types of firms or supply chains would stand to benefit the most from this use of blockchain technology. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management. </jats:p>",

Often times, we find that air conditioners are only used to cool only a small part of a room for individual comfort. Therefore, a new breakthrough is needed from a cooling system that does not use chemicals so that it is environmentally friendly, namely using the Thermo Electric Cooler (TEC) cooling module which utilizes the cold side of the Thermo Electric Cooler (TEC). The size of the DC input voltage on the Thermo Electric Cooler (TEC) is adjusted using a buck converter with fuzzy control. When the buck converter closed loop condition with fuzzy control has a rise time value, the settling time and error percentage have a relatively better value than the open loop condition. When the buck converter set point 40V, the minimum water temperature in the air cooler can be reached 220C, when the buck converter set point is 48V the minimum water temperature in the water cooler can be reached 190C, and when the buck converter set point is 56V the minimum water temperature in the air cooler can be reached 180C. When the water cooler uses air cooler by Peltier, the input air temperature and output air temperature decrease in temperature around 10C. this is caused by the evaporative effect caused by water cooled by the peltier.</jats:p>"

This study examines supply chain relationship factors and cyber risk issues to better understand the demand for C-SCRM assurance. Resource-Advantage Theory of Competition provides the conceptual foundation for assessing the dual drivers of relationship building and cyber risk management on demand for assurance. We use a field survey to collect data from 205 professionals enabling evaluation of the complex relationships in the theoretical model. Results support all hypotheses, provide satisfactory model fit, and support the underlying theory. Trust and cyber supply chain risk both positively influence demand for assurance over C-SCRM processes. This study expands the literature on cyber assurance by auditors and elaborates on overall supply chain processes that help drive value from auditors providing such assurance.</jats:p>",

Drawing on the Belief–Action–Outcome framework, we posit that the motivation of individuals (employees, managers, and the leadership) within the firm to access, use, and act on the environmental information available to them would be enhanced by the firm's implementation of AEIs, resulting in more extensive environmental disclosure by the firm. Additionally, building on the literature on supply chain networks, we posit that the structural position of the firm vis‐à‐vis its supply network—reflecting information flows, network learning, and status—moderates the AEI implementation–environmental disclosure relationship. To test our hypotheses, we build a multi‐industry dataset of 3,106 firm‐year observations based on 67,809 dyadic cost‐of‐goods‐sold‐based relationships obtained from Bloomberg's supply chain relationships database to construct the supply networks of focal firms. We also draw on Bloomberg's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data for our AEI implementation and environmental disclosure measures. We find significant evidence to support our hypothesis that AEI implementation is positively associated with the extent of environmental disclosure. However, the implementation of both internal and external forms of AEIs has a more pronounced positive relationship with the extent of environmental disclosure, compared to the implementation of either form alone. With regard to <jats:italic>supply network structure</jats:italic>, we identify three principal variables—<jats:italic>accessibility</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>control</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>interconnectedness</jats:italic>—that influence network learning and status of the focal firm and find that they moderate the AEI implementation–environmental disclosure relationship.

Of specific focus are assessments of the extraction and production of minerals and metals needed for a low-carbon energy future. Current trends and projections suggest that the future low-carbon energy system will have greater material needs than the current one. Thus, it is important to better understand the full impacts of increased resource extraction to help ensure a sustainable and just transition. This review reveals that existing methodologies are currently insufficient in capturing the full suite of environmental, social, and governance concerns. The copper supply chain is used as a case study to highlight areas that require refined or augmented methodologies, with an in-depth examination of the corporate practices of Freeport-McMoRan, Vale, and BHP. Together, this review of existing methodologies and examples from the copper supply chain highlight the incomplete and variable nature of environmental and climate reporting within the mining industry. Areas for future work are defined with the goal of advancing accounting frameworks for the mining industry and the associated supply chain.</jats:p>",

By analyzing a benchmark contract with compensation designed solely by a retailer, we find that compensation alone has no effect on intensifying PSPs' competition such that the PSPs still fully control the total service fee by increasing/decreasing the commission fee imposed on manufacturers. To effectively abate collusion, we propose two potential tactics to intensify PSPs' competition: setting a reserve price and introducing a direct sourcing channel. We find that both are effective in combating PSPs' pricing power. The underlying force is that both tactics create credible threats to walk away from this transaction with PSPs, and hence, both incentivize PSPs to lower the total service fee. However, the retailer reduces total welfare to improve its own profit: (a) when the retailer sets a strategic reserve price and the product's value in the market is moderate or (b) when the retailer introduces a direct channel but its search capability is weak. By comparing these two proposed contracts, we find that the retailer should introduce a direct sourcing channel when the product's value is high.</jats:p>",

The power load parameters were optimized. The average energy consumption was calculated. Results showed that the role of the negative voltage in the bipolar pulse power supply is to restrain the large arc tendency. Under the pulse power supply with a discharge loop, the current and energy consumption decreases with the increase of the discharge resistance at the same pulse parameters. The big arc phenomenon can be effectively avoided and the impact of load capacitance could be effectively avoided by using the pulse power supply with a discharge loop.

The qualitative data generated was analyzed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. The response rate of the study was 82%.Results and conclusion: The results indicate that there is a positive relationship (r=.509) between cost management and performance of state agencies in Kenya. In addition, the researcher found the relationship to be statistically significant at 5% level (p=0.000, &lt;0.05). The results also indicate that there is a positive relationship (r=.398) between quality index management and performance of state agencies in Kenya. In addition, the researcher found the relationship to be statistically significant at 5% level (p=0.000, &lt;0.05). The results indicate that there is a positive relationship (r=.678) between delivery management and performance of state agencies in Kenya. In addition, the researcher found the relationship to be statistically significant at 5% level (p=0.000, &lt;0.05). The results indicate that there is a positive relationship (r=.685) between asset utilization management and performance of state agencies in Kenya. In addition, the researcher found the relationship to be statistically significant at 5% level (p=0.000, &lt;0.05). Hence, it is evident that all the independent variables could explain the changes in implementation of performance of state agencies in Kenya, on the basis of the correlation analysis. The findings of the study indicated that cost management, quality index management, delivery management and asset utilization management have a positive relationship with performance of state agencies in KenyaUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: Finally, the study recommended that public institutions should embrace procurement key performance indicators so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other public institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained</jats:p>"

Research into the execution procedure, terms and conditions of such contracts has both theoretical and practical value. The importance of a foreign trade contract for relations between the parties cannot be overemphasized as its scope determines and legally binds the parties for the achievement of their respective goals. When entering into foreign trade contracts, the parties should consider the impact of natural gas extraction, processing, transportation, storage processes on terms of foreign trade transactions with natural gas. These terms are especially important for long-term natural gas export contracts which are considered to be the traditional form of natural gas trading. However, more recently, forms of foreign trade contracts for natural gas export used to interact with foreign buyers have become more diversified. Natural gas trading under short-term contracts using electronic trading platforms is becoming increasingly important. In this article, the author examines the key peculiarities of such contracts, defines basic advantages and disadvantages of using various contract forms for natural gas export.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article considers one of the directions of digital transformation, namely digital platforms. United Nations Conference on Trade and Development says that digital platforms create new opportunities for companies of all sizes to engage in trade. They can lead to efficiency gains through lower transaction costs and reduced information asymmetries supported by rating systems. Other benefits include lower consumer prices, increased market access, more competition, better use of underutilized resources and increased flexibility for the providers of services. However, gains are not automatic, and there are growing concerns over the rising market power of certain platforms and the related implications for competition, data protection and ownership, consumer protection and taxation and employment policies. Economic policies and regulations will need to maximize the benefits while at the same time minimizing the costs of digital platforms. Accordingly to Digital Economy Report 2019 by UNCTAD digital platforms provide the mechanisms for bringing together a set of parties to interact online. A distinction can be made between transaction platforms and innovation platforms. Transaction platforms are two/multi-sided markets with an online infrastructure that supports exchanges between a number of different parties. They have become a core business model for major digital corporations (such as Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook and eBay), as well as for those that are supporting digitally enabled sectors (such as Uber, Didi Chuxing or Airbnb). Innovation platforms create environments for code and content producers to develop applications and software in the form of, for example, operating systems (e.g. Android or Linux) or technology standards (e.g. MPEG video). Several factors help explain the rapid rise to dominance of these digital giants. The first is related to network effects (i.e. the more users on a platform, the more valuable it becomes for everyone). The second is the platforms’ ability to extract, control and analyses data. As with network effects, more users mean more data, and more data mean a stronger ability to outcompete potential rivals and capitalize on first-mover advantages. Thirdly, once a platform begins to gain traction and starts offering different integrated services, the costs to users of switching to an alternative service provider start to increase. The transformative power of data in the sphere of economic and social interactions means that governments, businesses, and people must adapt to use emerging opportunities and avoid traps and risks. The ability of countries and various stakeholders to master digital transformation varies greatly and depends on their level of development and digital readiness. Developed countries are in many ways better equipped to deal with the growing role of digital platforms than countries with limited resources and capabilities. The aviation, travel and tourism industry has been at the forefront of digital innovation, but industry and technology trends suggest that further change lies ahead. The sector has been an early adopter of digital technologies and platforms, but steep demand for travel, driven by a growing middle class in emerging markets and the increasing importance of digital experiences, implies that further digitalization will be vital if the expectations of tomorrow’s consumers are to be met.</jats:p>"

However, for BWAs to be effective, consumers need to be aware of, understand and comply with the advisories. Although BWAs are a widely used preventive public health measure, compliance with BWAs is rarely examined. In Norway, only one previous study on compliance with BWAs has been conducted. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate consumers’ perception of and compliance with a BWA following a contamination incident at an elevated reservoir in Konnerud (population 10,314), Norway. In total, 2,451 of the 9,312 (26.3%) invited residents responded to the questionnaire. Among the respondents, 97.6% remembered receiving the BWA, of whom 94.6% complied with the advice. Effective compliance with the BWA was thus 92.3%. Only 130 (5.4%) respondents did not comply with the BWA. The main reason for non-compliance was perceived low or no risk of getting sick from the water (34.2%). Our study revealed high awareness of and compliance with the BWA, but the people who did not comply maintained several misconceptions about waterborne infections and transmission. The findings can be used by local health authorities to improve future BWAs.</jats:p>",

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle (NP)-embedded cellulose acetate (CA) film has shown effectiveness against Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 in water. The current study evaluated the effect of natural water compounds on the photo-disinfection efficacy of TiO2 NP-embedded CA film. Humic acid, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and kaolin clay solutions were prepared at four concentrations, respectively. When concentration increased from 0 to 20 ml/L, inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 in humic acid, CaCO3, and kaolin clay solutions decreased from 6 log to 5, 4, and 2 log CFU/ml, respectively after 3 h treatment. Turbidity, UVT-254, water hardness, total suspended solids (TSS), and total organic carbon (TOC) of the solutions were measured. UVT-254 and turbidity had the highest correlation with the inhibition effect of water compounds on photo-disinfection efficacy. A prediction equation was developed with UVT-254 and water hardness as independent variables to predict photo-disinfection efficacy in natural water. E. coli O157:H7 decreased by 1 and 2.5 log CFU/ml in unfiltered and filtered natural creek water samples after treatment. The results from this study showed promise in the use of TiO2 NP-embedded CA film to inactivate pathogens in natural water.</jats:p>",

There is an urgent need for important Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as N95 and surgical masks. This project examined the factors that were associated with nursing homes’ N95 and surgical mask supply. We analyzed data from the Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File and conducted a multivariate logistic regression estimating the association between nursing home characteristics and county-level demographic parameters with mask supply. We found that a high number of resident COVID-19 cases contributed to the supply of N95, but not surgical masks, whereas a high number of staff cases did not lead to an adequate supply of either N95 or surgical masks. Compared with not-for-profit (NFP) facilities, for-profit (FP) nursing homes were less likely to get enough masks. A better supply distribution plan is needed to prepare for future possible PPE shortage. </jats:p>",

In order to achieve accurate closed-loop control of water supply pressure, this paper designs ACLABC-PID controller based on improved Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. First of all, in view of the slow convergence speed and easy to fall into the local optimum of the ABC algorithm, an adaptive comprehensive learning strategy of the ABC algorithm (ACLABC) is proposed. The algorithm adopts the learning strategy of learning from other excellent individuals and global optimal individuals, enriches the diversity of the population, adaptively and gradually reduces the search area, and effectively eliminates the defects of easily falling into local extremum and slow convergence in the later stage. ACLABC algorithm takes both local development and global exploration into account, which improves the convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm. Then, the ACLABC algorithm is applied to the PID control parameter optimization of constant pressure water supply, and compared with the ABC-PID controller and the critical proportion method PID controller, the simulation results show that the ACLABC-PID controller significantly improves the dynamic and steady performance of the system.</jats:p>",

The methodology was applied to a real case in Longkou, China. A three-dimensional variable-density groundwater simulation model was established to simulate and predict the SI process. In the S-O framework, while solving the optimization model, it is required to call the simulation model thousands of times, which leads to enormous computational load. In this case, the Kriging and support vector regression (SVR) surrogate models were established for the simulation model respectively. Furthermore, the ensemble surrogate modeling technique was applied to construct the Kriging-SVR ensemble surrogate model. The most accurate surrogate model was selected as the substitute for the simulation model, saving considerable computing costs. The results show that the ensemble surrogate model performs better than the stand-alone surrogate models in accuracy, indicating that combining stand-alone surrogate models is a potential modeling method for the surrogate model of the variable-density groundwater simulation model. By solving the optimization model, the optimal pumping and injection schemes under different scenarios were obtained. The optimization results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is effective and stable in coastal groundwater management.</jats:p>",

In the WFS model, two concepts called WFS pressure and WFS index are introduced and an additional skin factor in the interface of inner and outer regions is applied based on a radial composite reservoir. Then, a novel multi-stage fractured horizontal well model is developed by considering the WFS, stress-sensitivity effects, and finite-conductivity fractures. The reservoir model is solved by the perturbation transformation, Laplace transform, and numerical inversion. While the fracture model is solved by fracture discretization and superposition principle. Finally, the bottom hole pressure is obtained. Following that, model verification and sensitivity study are performed. It is found that the flow regimes of the WFS model includes bilinear flow, linear flow, first radial flow, bi-radial flow, pseudo radial flow, and WFS flow. An interesting feature of \"hump\" caused by WFS flow exhibits in the pressure derivative curve. The results of sensitivity study show that the height of that \"hump\" increases as the WFS pressure increases, but is independent of WFS index. What’s more, WFS flow exhibits a closed boundary flow when the WFS index is equal to zero, while it appears as a constant pressure boundary flow when WFS pressure is very tiny. Through the WFS model, the fluid supply characteristics of tight gas reservoirs are fully understood.</jats:p>",

Supply chain members will be making decisions regarding movie popularity with regard to licensing contracts, forecasting toy purchases, cross-promotions, etc. at varying times before a movie is released. A simple forecasting approach using publicly available data could improve supply chain decision making. Prior literature suggested that the virtual movie stock market, HSX, was a good predictor. Using a small set of variables including view counts, likes, and dislikes did offer some predictive value. However, HSX produces a forecast that dominates prior models while using a single readily available public data. Further, the HSX-based prediction showed consistency and convergence across a significant breadth of time.</p>",

Category 1 represents secondary effluent with an efficiency of organic matter removal greater than 80%; Category 2 represents effluent that underwent some disinfection step; and effluents that perform less than the other categories were called ‘Uncategorized’. After that, the irrigation water demands for each BHRs were compiled, and finally, the production of water for reutilization was compared with the demand for irrigation. Thus, it was observed that all the sewage flow rates generated in Brazil classified in Categories 1 and 2 represent 9% of the total irrigation water demand in the country (1,078.71 m3/s) and it stands out that only 7% of the flows treated in Brazil undergo a tertiary treatment step.</jats:p>",

Particular attention was paid to the jets having a large impingement height, and which disintegrated into small droplets before reaching the water surface. The dominant sizes and velocities of the droplets generated by jet breakup were 1–4 mm and 4–9 m/s. The results show that for plunging water jets having the same hydraulic head, the air entrainment rate increased as the jet impingement height at first grew, then dropped as the jet impingement height kept increasing. The early increase in the air entrainment rate was due to the growth of jet surface roughness, while the later decrease was caused by the water jet disintegration. The momentum of the plunging jet decreased dramatically due to the reduced mass and the significant energy dissipation through the atmosphere caused by jet disintegration. This led to a much smaller penetration depth and air entrainment rate compared to with a continuous jet.</jats:p>",

Low cost strategies and differentiation are used in measuring competitive strategies. Where differentiation strategies are more applied than low cost strategies due to the object of research in the fields of property, real estate, building construction that produces limited and unique products at high costs.</jats:p>"

These rooms must have supply ventilation to maintain the required microclimate parameters. The article proposes, in addition to fulfilling its main function, to use general exchange ventilation as an air curtain in these types of premises. Due to the supply of air above the doorway with certain parameters, in some cases, it is possible to abandon the thermal air curtain as a separate energy-intensive device. The implementation of this task is supposed to be carried out by organizing the necessary air exchange scheme, without increasing its required performance. The article presents the results of the study, which make it possible to assess the possibility of using the proposed technical solution for the most standard case. In particular, an adapted calculation of the air distribution grille is presented to fulfill the stated purpose.</jats:p>",

It argues that an engagement with the critical geographies of logistics contributes to the study of such “humanitarian goods” in two main ways. First, it foregrounds the technologies that allow emergency shelter products to circulate across production sites and disaster and border zones, and their connections to broader infrastructures and commercial networks in what recent literature has called “supply‐chain humanitarianism”. Second, a logistical lens highlights the disruptions that characterise the production and usage of emergency shelter products. The analysis adds to a body of work that exposes humanitarian technology and design as sites of friction, deeply embedded in global processes of bordering and accumulation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban logistics (or city logistics) is developing rapidly due to the strong growth of e-commerce. Accordingly, the last-mile urban logistics faces a significant number of orders that need to be fulfilled in a dense urban development, environmental constraints and permanent congestion. One of the possible systems of rational city delivery is the use of a network of consolidation centers at the micro level. Such a network provides for a two-tier system of urban delivery - 1) from the central warehouse or warehouses to the network of microconsolidation centers; 2) from microconsolidation centers to end consumers. This scheme is especially relevant in the presence of restrictions on the movement of trucks or heavy vehicles in certain areas of the city, as well as in significant congestion and the problem of parking trucks when unloading at the location of the client. Methods (research methodology). To create a rational delivery network through a microconsolidation system, the primary task is to determine the delivery zones (or geographical clusters) - their number, size, location. To solve this problem, optimization models are proposed based on several minimization criteria - delivery distance, time, cost and integrated distance-time criterion. Results. The result is the optimization models creation, based on those it is possible to divide urban consumers into several delivery zones. Delivery routes are planned within each zone of the respective centroid and minimize the cost of last-mile logistics. Delivery of goods to the centroids can be carried out by light or medium trucks, and within the zones should be dominated by delivery of environmentally friendly modes of transport (motorcycle or moped, bicycle, car, on foot delivery with the possibility of public transport usage). Conclusion. Thus, the article provides a mathematical apparatus for obtaining territorial zoning of existing customers of the city in order to minimize the cost (distance, time or their combination) for delivery within each zone. Perspectives. A perspective study may be an analysis of the costs of operating a network of urban consolidation centers and the delivery of goods from the central warehouse or warehouses to this network. Accordingly, the task of minimizing the total costs of the city freight delivery system should be solved, taking into account economic, environmental and social aspects.</jats:p>"

Genetic algorithms are used to generate a wide range of hydraulically acceptable solutions and search for the most economical solutions. The impact of each cost component on the total cost is determined in this study. The decision variables include the pipe diameter, pipe material, pipe pressure rating, surge tank size and operational and maintenance costs over the project service life. A real-case project is presented to crosscheck the suggested procedure. Significant cost variations are observed, even between equally acceptable designs. Furthermore, the operational cost has a deterministic effect on the parameters of the optimum solution. Compared to conventional design wisdom that focuses on reducing the pipe diameter as much as possible to reduce the project cost, this approach demonstrates that significant savings in pipeline project costs can be achieved by carefully investigating all possible design alternatives under steady and unsteady flow conditions.</jats:p>",

A survey involving managers working in Indian sugar companies was conducted and partial least square (PLS) method was used to test the proposed research model. The findings supported the positive relationshipbetween suppliers' power and competitiveness; suppliers and industry rivalry; buyers' power and industry rivalry; and government dynamics and competitiveness in the discussed industry. Furthermore, entry barriers exerted a hypothesized negative relationship with competitiveness. The government is working as a moderator between the suppliers' (sugarcane growers') power and the competitiveness of the discussed industry as hypothesized. This study discerns the foundational literature from extant research work; lays down basic underpinnings for contextual discussion on competitive forces in the discussed industry and adds empirical facet by surveying the industry professionals.

This research introduces the perspective of supply chain finance, uses in-depth case study methods, and takes Suning’s agricultural supply chain finance as an example to discuss how e-commerce companies relying on big data adopt agricultural supply chain finance practices to promote accurate poverty alleviation. By analyzing Suning’s four agricultural supply chain financial operation models, we find that the internal and external stakeholders of the enterprise are the driving factors for enterprises to adopt agricultural supply chain finance, and the adoption of agricultural supply chain finance measures has brought economic benefits and social benefits to enterprises benefit. Advanced big data tools, fintech and cooperation with other partners are necessary to adopt agricultural supply chain financial measures.</jats:p>",

There is an urgent need to increase supply, as hospitals become inundated with patients requiring intensive respiratory support. Coalitions across the United States have formed in order to create new devices that can be manufactured quickly, with minimal resources, and provide consistent and safe respiratory support. Due to threats to public health and the vulnerability of the U.S. population, the Food and Drug Administration released Emergency Use Authorizations for new or repurposed devices, shortening the approval timeline from years to weeks. The list of authorized devices varies widely in complexity, from automated bagging techniques to repurposed sleep apnea machines. Three-dimensional printed ventilators, such as “CRISIS,” propose a potential solution to increase the available number of vents for the United States and abroad, one that is dynamic and able to absorb the massive influx of hospitalized patients for the foreseeable future.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>"

I use multiple model specifications, examine physicians in high‐risk specialties, young physicians, and physicians in state‐border counties, and explore the potential for asymmetric effects using instances where tort reform has been declared unconstitutional and removed. I find few statistically significant effects. Supplemental analyses show that this may be because the noneconomic damage caps do not significantly affect malpractice insurance premiums, payouts, or claims in the first place.</jats:p>",

Balancing the needs of both buyer and seller is important to ensure a successful long-term supply and demand relationship.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Accurate production forecasting is vital to ensuring optimum field development and management because it is a key input to economic evaluation and subsequent business decisions. To capture the future supply, forecasts are required for both the base production assets and new development projects. Accuracy of the production forecast drives decision making for project approval, project timing, need to engage new commercial contracts and optimization of planned maintenance timing. To ensure that the relationship of supply and demand is captured, the operator use an integrated production forecasting tool called the Gas Planning Tool (GPT).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper explains the methodology behind the GPT and how its results are used to support business decisions in the continued development of the PSC block. The methodology accommodates inputs from multiple disciplines: reservoir, commercial, surface facilities, operations downtime, and new drill/facility project schedules. The inputs are integrated and optimized solving for the interaction among input parameters and generates a production forecast that honors all the constraints. The value from the analysis is insights to improve understanding of relationships between different variables and variance between plans.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Gas Planning Tool (GPT) has sucessfully captured the gas supply-demand relationship and helped optimize incremental opportunities, timing of opportunities and idenfied the need for projects and commercial contracts.</jats:p>",

Along with the impact of oil price shocks, the model estimates the impact of supply and demand shocks, the identification of which is based on the approach of sign restrictions. According to the results obtained, at the end of 2014 and in 2015, demand shocks had a positive impact on GDP growth, which can be interpreted as a positive effect of the ruble devaluation at the end of 2014. In the next years, demand shocks led mainly to a slowdown in economic growth. The paper also attempts to identify monetary policy shocks and assesses their impact on GDP, household consumption and investment. According to the results, the effect of monetary shocks in 2015—2019 on all endogenous variables was negative. However, an increase in the interest rate at the end of 2014 is identified mostly as an endogenous reaction to other shocks, and the effect of the monetary shock on GDP in 2015 is nearly zero. In 2017, monetary shocks slowed down GDP by 0.92 percentage points.</jats:p>"

Therefore, we propose a decision-making approach for objectively selecting multi-tier supply locations based on cost and carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) from manufacturing, logistics, and sustainability-assurance activities, including certificate implementation, sample-checking, living wage and social security payments, and factory visits. Existing studies and practices, logic models, activity-based costing, and feedback from an application and experts help develop the approach. The approach helps users in location decisions and long-term supply chain planning by revealing relationships among factors, TBL sustainability, and potential risks. This approach also helps users evaluate whether supplier prices are too low to create environmental and social compliance. Its application demonstrates potential and flexibility in revealing both lowest- and optimized-cost and CO2e supply chains, under various contexts and constraints, for different markets. Very low cost/CO2e supply chains have proximity between supply chain stages and clean manufacturing energy. Considering sustainability-assurance activities differentiates our approach from existing studies, as the activities significantly impact supply chain cost and CO2e in low manufacturing unit scenarios.</jats:p>"

The sediment supply to the central Yellow Sea since the\nlast deglaciation was uncovered through clay mineralogy and geochemical\nanalysis of core 11YS-PCL14 in the Central Yellow Sea Mud (CYSM). The core\ncan be divided into four units based on the various proxies, such as grain\nsize, clay mineralogy, geochemistry, and Sr and Nd isotopes: Unit 4 (700–520 cm; 15.5–14.8 ka), Unit 3 (520–310 cm; 14.8–12.8 ka), Unit 2 (310–130 cm;\n12.8–8.8 ka), and Unit 1 (130–0 cm; &lt;8.8 ka). Unit 2 is subdivided\ninto two subunits, Unit 2-2 (310–210 cm; 12.8–10.5 ka) and Unit 2-1 (210–130 cm; 10.5–8.8 ka), according to smectite content. Comparison of the clay\nmineral compositions, rare earth elements, and εNd indicate\ndistinct provenance shifts in core 11YS-PCL14. Moreover, the integration of\nclay mineralogical and geochemical indices show different origins according\nto particle size. During the late last deglaciation (Units 3 and 4,\n15.5–12.8 ka), Unit 4 sediments originated from all potential provenance\nrivers, such as the Huanghe, Changjiang, and western Korean rivers, while the\nsource of coarse sediments changed to the Huanghe beginning with Unit 3.\nFine-grained sediment was still supplied from all rivers during the deposition\nof Unit 3. Early Holocene (Unit 2) sediments were characterized by\noscillating grain size, clay minerals, and moderate εNd values.\nIn this period, the dominant fine-sediment provenance changed from the\nHuanghe to the Changjiang, whereas coarse sediments most likely originated\nfrom western Korean rivers. The Unit 1 CYSM sediments were sourced primarily\nfrom the Changjiang, along with minor contributions from the western Korean\nrivers. Possible transport mechanisms concerning such changes in the\nsediment provenance include paleo-river pathways, tidal stress evolution,\nand the development of the Yellow Sea Warm Current and coastal circulation\nsystems, depending on the sea level fluctuations.\n                    </jats:p>"

Although the market-oriented transformation on the supply side is a sustainable way to cope with the pressing demands of elderly care in the long term, the conflict between private and public interests seriously impedes the transformation process in its early stage. From the perspective of maximizing social welfare, this study took the specific situation of China as an example and applied a Stackelberg game model to explore the optimal transformation policy that can balance such conflict of interests. By comparing the effects of two forms of subsidy in China, the results first theoretically verified the importance of subsidy in stimulating the private supply of elderly care, and then emphasized that the size of the gap between supply and demand is the fulcrum of differentiated subsidy, which determines the optimal policy for the development of the elderly care market (ECM) in each aging region. Additionally, the study showed that in the process of market-oriented transformation, the government’s positive response to the demands and preferences of the public, the establishment of market supervision measures, and the increase in the elderly’s affordability all play important roles in improving social welfare. These findings not only have policy implications for the marketization of elderly care in China, but also provide meaningful references for other developing countries in the word that are experiencing or about to experience elderly care problems.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, 120 different laboratory data were used to estimate three parameters of the drop: the relative length, the downstream relative depth, and the residual relative energy in the support vector machine. For each parameter, 12 models were analyzed by using a support vector machine. The performance of the models was evaluated with statistical criteria (R2, DC, and RMSE) and the best model was introduced for each of the parameters. The evaluation criteria for the relative length of the vertical drop equipped with dual horizontal screens for the testing stage are R2 = 0.992, DC = 0.981 and RMSE = 0.050. Also, the values of the downstream relative depth evaluation indicators for the testing stage are R2 = 0.9866, DC = 0.980 and, RMSE = 0.0064. For the residual relative energy parameter, the values of the residual relative energy evaluation indicators are R2 = 0.9949, DC = 0.9853 and RMSE = 0.0056.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: This article analyzes the value of information and coordination in a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) and discusses the benefits of a global or local optimization approach and the impact of uncertainty. Methodology: A theoretical dyadic closed loop supply chain is analyzed where the manufacturer re-manufactures products returned by customers, producing “as good as new products” for the retailer. Twelve coordination scenarios were analyzed. For the definition of these scenarios, a framework based on two criteria was proposed: value of information and perimeter of decision making. Findings: Information on returns leads to lower costs than information on demand. In the presence of complete or partial coordination between the actors in the supply chain, it is preferable to have low product return rates. However, if we are in the complete absence of coordination, high rates of return are more convenient as they function as a buffer against uncertainties. The perimeter of decision making (global or local optimization) does not significantly improve the supply chain performance in relation to its costs. Only the exchange of information improves its performance. Therefore, companies should make efforts to exchange information, first, on their lot sizes, then on their returns and finally, on the customer demand. Originality: The novelty of our work relies on an analysis of the closed loop supply chain performance with the simultaneous presence of information, coordination, and uncertainty.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates the efficacy of zero‐interest early payment financing (alternatively referred to as early payment) and positive‐interest in‐house factoring financing in a pull supply chain with a capital‐constrained manufacturer selling a product through a capital‐abundant retailer. Early payment is the prepayment of a wholesale cost to the manufacturer, whereas in‐house factoring is a loan service provided to the manufacturer by a branch financing firm of the same retailer. We find that the retailer prefers early payment financing to bank financing when the manufacturer’s production cost is low. If the retailer instead offers positive‐interest in‐house factoring financing to the manufacturer, then the financing equilibrium domain enlarges as compared to bank financing. Interestingly, early payment financing can outplay positive‐interest in‐house factoring financing if the production cost is considerably low; otherwise, vice versa. When the production cost is big enough, the retailer will not provide either early payment or in‐house factoring. Furthermore, our main qualitative result sustains with an identical wholesale price across all three financing schemes and the financing equilibrium domain of early payment shrinks as demand variability grows. </jats:p>",

On the farm‐gate side, it is matched by a 20% fall in quantity arrivals of vegetables and fruits. We then show that supply chain disruption is the main driver behind this fall. We compute the distance to production zones from our retail centers and find that the fall in product availability and quantity arrivals is larger for items that are cultivated or manufactured farther from the final point of sale. Our results show that long‐distance food supply chains have been hit the hardest during the current pandemic with welfare consequences for urban consumers and farmers.</jats:p>",

To achieve this, we integrated the machine tool indicator into a cyber–physical system for easy and real-time capturing of data. We also developed software that can turn these data into relevant information (using Python): Using this software, we were able to view machine tool activities and energy consumption in real time, which allowed us to determine the activities with greater energy burdens. As such, we were able to improve the application of Industry 4.0 in machine tools by allowing informed real-time decisions that can reduce energy consumption. In this research, a new Key Performance Indicator (KPI) was been developed and calculated in real time. This KPI can be monitored, can measure the sustainability of machining processes in a green supply chain (GSC) using Nakajima’s six big losses from the perspective of energy consumption, and is able to detect what the biggest energy loss is. This research was implemented in a cyber–physical system typical of Industry 4.0 to demonstrate its applicability in real processes. Other productivity KPIs were implemented in order to compare efficiency and sustainability, highlighting the importance of paying attention to both terms at the same time, given that the improvement of one does not imply the improvement of the other, as our results show.</jats:p>"

Some literature uses qualitative, quantitative, and a combination of the two methods in analyzing the positive impact of GSCM. Literature study was conducted to determine the impact felt by the company if implementing GSCM in its organization. So that it can be a reference for the manager in deciding the application of GSCM processes in the organization. There are four green processes in GSCM, namely: green design, green manufacturing, green logistics, reconditioning and core disposal. Some positive impacts that can be felt by the company, such as increasing organizational productivity (financially and efficiency), improving environmental performance, and to identify trends in organizational development. This practice can be implemented well if it is supported by pressures from various interests and pressures of the organization (management).

Batch experiments were carried out to determine the growth kinetics by inoculating microalgae in wastewater prepared with different dilutions and supplemented with Bold's Basal Medium (BBM). From the values of the saturation constants (KS = 50.25 mgN-NH4+·L−1) and substrate inhibition (KI = 28.12 mgN-NH4+·L−1) obtained in the adjustment to the Andrews kinetic model (R2 = 0.817), the PBRs achieved specific maximum growth rates (μmax) of 0.343 d−1, biomass productivity of 0.141 g·L−1·d−1, lipid content of 12.45%, lipid productivity of 17.63 mg·L−1·d−1 and instantaneous ammoniacal nitrogen consumption rates of 20.06 and 14.22 mg·L−1·d−1. The addition of wastewater to the culture medium provided an increase in biomass productivity of 57.45% in relation to the negative control. The results obtained demonstrate the high efficiency of C. vulgaris in the removal of nitrogenous compounds and the potential of using anaerobically digested gelatin industry wastewater in the production of microalgae biomass.</jats:p>",

Based on the results of a comprehensive analysis of the PR situation, the nature of the crisis has been revealed, which, in terms of its geographical scale, the extent of mass outages of consumers from power supply sources, and the scope of repair and restoration work, was unprecedented in the Russian Federation over the previous 30 year period. It is estimated that the restoration of performance of the electricity network infrastructure took three months (January through March of 2011) and involved huge information and communication resources, mobilization of staff and additional pool of specialists with a total number of more than 3 thousand people. The research methodology is consistent with conventional boundaries, with a full set of approaches typical of research of a systemic social phenomenon, such as the company's communication activities and in interfacing with the essential characteristics of business reputation. As a hypothesis, a convincing and proven assumption has been put forward that mass disruptions of power supply under the influence of natural elements can become a decisive factor for a fundamental shift in public opinion in favor of the power grid company, if the crisis PR program is based on creative ideas for the involvement of journalists, experts, environmentalists, deputies, other stakeholders and opinion leaders in the process of emergency response.

To this end, we expand an existing open-source micro-grid optimization model with a complementary thermal model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the market, once consumers have a low-carbon preference, they will choose green low-carbon products. The market demand for green products is not only related to product price, but also consumers’ low-carbon preference. In this way, enterprise has to consider the cost of carbon emissions in the process of production and operation. In this paper, we consider a two-level supply chain system composed of a manufacturer and a retailer. The supply chain system can determine the price of products and the level of carbon emission reduction through different supply chain contracts: wholesale price contract and revenue sharing contract. However, the power control structure of a manufacturer and a retailer is different, which will further affect the decision-making strategy of the supply chain system. We set up four models (Wholesale Price—NM and NR, and Revenue-Sharing—SR and SM) of the supply chain with carbon emission reduction, and calculated and analyzed. The results show that firstly, regardless of whether the manufacturer’s power control structure or the retailer power structure is dominant, the manufacturer wholesale price with a contract on revenue-sharing is always higher than on wholesale price, and it is inversely proportional to the revenue-sharing proportion. Secondly, under the two power control structures, the carbon emission level of the manufacturer with a contract on revenue-sharing is always lower than on wholesale price, and it gradually decreases with the increase of the revenue-sharing proportion of the manufacturers. Thirdly, when the retailer dominates the supply chain, the retailer selling price with a contract on revenue-sharing is always higher than on wholesale price. Under the manufacturer’s power control structure, when the revenue-sharing ratio is small, the retailer selling price with a contract on revenue-sharing is higher than on wholesale price; when the revenue-sharing ratio is large, the retailer selling price with a contract on revenue-sharing is lower than on wholesale price. Finally, the validity of the model is verified by an example, and the sensitivity of the parameters is analyzed.</jats:p>"

We simulated the model for instability and stability conditions defined by mathematical analysis. Through these results, we verified both classical and reverse bullwhip effects associated with instability and stability conditions, respectively. The model revealed a duality once the control strategy proposed by Helbing and Lamer (2005) for the classical bullwhip effect ends up causing a reverse effect, which is equally troubling. In the reverse bullwhip effect, we observed amplification of the production rates in the network chains from the supplier to the customer in a way that the upstream chain was not able to meet the needs of the downstream chain. To withhold both effects, we suggest the dynamic control of the parameters that describe the network based on Helbing and Lammer (2005) model.</jats:p>"

The study was conducted to assess the different supply chain actors involved in the rice subsector in Kanchanpur district during April- August 2020. Pre-tested semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect the information by selecting 110 respondents including 75 rice producers, 10 agro-vet, 5 millers, 5 wholesalers, and 15 retailers. Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) and Microsoft Excel was used for data analysis. The findings revealed that there was a dominance of males (62%) over females (38%). The mean allocated area and productivity were 0.99 ha and 4.26 Mt/ha respectively. Cooperatives (33.33%) hold a major possession in the case of seed producers whereas their own seed (40.6%) and agro-vet (35.7%) hold a major source of seed in the case of grain producers for home consumption and marketed surplus. The average B: C ratio of the paddy growers was found to be 1.40 in the study area. The market margin and producer's share was higher in seeds supply chain NRs 29 per kg and 47.2% as compared to the grain supply chain as NRs 27 per kg and 46% respectively. About 77% of the paddy growers preferred to sell their produce to house and the remaining 23% sold to market.

In determining effective mitigation strategies for future emissions, it is necessary to know how emissions related to diet vary over time in overall magnitude and due to compositional changes driven by socioeconomic dynamics. This study evaluates the change in dietary GHG emissions in China during the 1997–2011 period by linking environmentally extended input–output tables with individual daily food intake data. It further decomposes the contribution to GHG emission changes of various socioeconomic driving factors. The results show that GHG emissions related to national diet have been decreasing from 1,180 Mt CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e to 640 Mt CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e (a 54% decline), largely due to technical innovation that has reduced the emissions per calorie of food (135% of the total reduction). The change in dietary patterns has had mixed effects, with a decline in calorie intake reducing emissions by 21% while increases in animal‐sourced food consumption have raised emissions by 25%. Our findings stress the importance of technical progress in the historical change in dietary GHG emissions and suggest a focus on behavior changes for future research and policymaking, which has the potential to promote dietary changes toward less animal product consumption. Our findings highlight the importance of both technological and demand‐side behavioral options in reducing the impact of diets on GHG emissions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Surgeons are often unfamiliar with the costs of surgical instrumentation and supplies. We hypothesized that surgeon cost feedback would be associated with a reduction in cost. A multidisciplinary team evaluated surgical supply costs for laparoscopic appendectomies of 7 surgeons (surgeons A-G) at a single-center academic institution. In the intervention, each surgeon was debriefed with their average supply cost per case, their partner’s average supply cost per case, the cost of each surgical instrument/supply, and the cost of alternatives. In addition, the laparoscopic appendectomy tray was standardized to remove extraneous instruments. Pre-intervention (March 2017-February 2018) and post-intervention (March 2018-October 2018) costs were compared. Pre-intervention, the surgeons’ average supply cost per case ranged from $754-$1189; when ranked from most to least expensive, surgeon A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D &gt; E &gt; F &gt; G. Post-intervention, the surgeons’ average supply cost per case ranged from $676 to $846, and ranked from surgeon G &gt; D &gt; F &gt; C &gt; E &gt; B &gt; A. Overall, the average cost per case was lower in the post-intervention group ($854.35 vs. $731.11, P &lt; .001). This resulted in savings per case of $123.24 (14.4%), to a total annualized savings of $29 151. </jats:p>",

The article analyzes the literature sources and scientific publications on the effectiveness of the heat pump in heat supply systems. The results of research of efficiency of application of the heat pump in systems of heat supply at use of natural waters as a source of low-potential thermal energy are presented. Energy and exergy analysis of heat pump efficiency indicators, the working fluid of which is R134a freon, was performed. The energy efficiency of the heat pump cycle was determined by the conversion factor of the heat pump. The thermodynamic efficiency of the heat pump in heat supply systems was evaluated using exergetic efficiency, which is one of the main indicators of the efficiency of heat pump processes and cycles. The calculation of energy indicators of the heat pump, such as: specific heat load in the evaporator and condenser, as well as the conversion factor of the heat pump. The calculation of exergetic efficiency for ambient temperature from  +10 to -10 ºC. Thus, the energy and exergy analysis of the efficiency of the heat pump, the working fluid of which is Freon R134a with a conversion factor = 4.8. This indicates that the heat pump is a reliable, highly efficient, environmentally friendly source of energy for use in heating systems. A heat pump heating system will always consume less primary energy than traditional heating systems if natural water is used as a low-temperature heat source for the heat pump. The efficiency of the steam compression cycle of the heat pump largely depends on the temperature of low-potential heat sources. The use of HV in heating systems reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional types of heat supply, which is relevant to the ecological state of the environment.</jats:p>",

The amount of water used for drainage of the mesh filter can be controlled by setting the start-up time of the blowdown residue discharge of the mesh filter. Through the indoor prototype test, the sediment of the Manas riverbed in Xinjiang, China, was used as the filter medium to test the mesh filter and analyze the water usage volume at each stage. The test focused on the analysis of the trend of the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the mesh filter over the filtration time. The results showed that as the filtration time was prolonged, the inlet and outlet pressure difference of the mesh filter showed an S-shaped curve with time. The pressure difference between the inlet and outlet can be divided into four stages, i.e., the start of filtering to the first inflection point of the abrupt change in the pressure difference, the first inflection point of the abrupt pressure difference change to the median point of filtering, the median point of filtering to the second inflection point of the abrupt change in the pressure difference, and the second inflection point of the abrupt pressure difference change to the end of filtering. At the same time, the water usage volume for blowdown was calculated under various working conditions. This paper analyzed the start-up time of blowdown at three different time points, i.e., after the completion of the entire filtration cycle of the traditional mesh filter, at the first inflection point of pressure difference, and at the second inflection point of pressure difference. The tests were performed under the condition that the filtration cycle of the mesh filter was ten days. The results have shown that compared with the traditional screen filter that starts the blowdown at the end of the entire filtration cycle, starting the blowdown at the first inflection point of pressure difference can save 200–300 m3 of water resources for a single mesh filter, and starting the blowdown at the second inflection point of pressure difference can save 30–90 m3 of water resources for a single mesh filter. Meanwhile, the working conditions in the analyses in this paper were consistent with the actual engineering operating conditions. It is recommended that the mesh filter in the micro-irrigation system use the first inflection point of pressure difference to control the start-up time of the blowdown residue discharge, which can not only save water resources, but also ensure that the mesh filter runs at the optimal filtering conditions.</jats:p>",

Yet, the majority of economic assessments in the field of desalination plants, so far, use deterministic estimation methods based on ‘best guess’ estimates and ceteris paribus sensitivity analyses. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper introduces a new approach towards comparing alternative technological options for desalination facilities under uncertainty based on the Levelized Cost of Water (LCOW). The proposed framework combines Monte Carlo simulations with scenario analysis and random-walk-based models to account for the cone of uncertainty of the LCOW. For purely illustrative purposes, five alternative combinations of desalination technologies and energy sources are examined in the State of Kuwait. The findings show that the proposed framework, although it cannot eliminate uncertainty, can assist decision-makers in managing it by framing the range of possible outcomes of the LCOW. In this way, it offers an insight into the accuracy of the estimates and allows the validation of the impact of risks and uncertainties against the acceptable tolerance level. Yet, several issues need to be addressed in future research.</jats:p>",

Knowledge and understanding of these interactions are essential for evidence based decision-making on resource use and risk management. In this paper, we explore three research case studies that illustrate co-evolution between people and water systems. In each case study, we highlight how different knowledge and understanding, stemming from different disciplines, can be integrated by complementing narratives with a quantitative modelling approach. We identify several important research practices that must be taken into account when modelling people-water systems: transparency, grounding the model in sound theory, supporting it with the most robust data possible, communicating uncertainty, recognising that there is no ‘one true model’ and diversity in the modelling team. To support interdisciplinary research endeavours, we propose a three-point plan: (1) demonstrating and emphasising that interdisciplinary collaboration can both address existing research questions and identify new, previously unknown questions at the interface between the disciplines; (2) supporting individual interdisciplinary learning at all career stages and (3) developing group practices and a culture of interdisciplinary collaboration.</jats:p>",

The median concentrations of E. coli among the GO-installed and NGO-installed dug wells were, respectively, 41 and 21 cfu/100 ml in the wet season, and respectively 2 and &amp;lt;1 cfu/100 ml in the dry season. In the wet season, 24 and 31%, respectively, of the GO-installed and NGO-installed dug wells were in the high-risk category. All of the dug wells had higher disease burden in the wet season compared to the dry season. The ﬁndings suggest that drinking water from the dug wells is likely to pose health risks to the rural communities.</jats:p>",

Recently, the occurrences and effects of these factors on global economic activities, and thus container port logistics, have been intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Enabling flexibility in port logistics is more important than ever to navigate uncertainties, now and in the post-COVID-19 world. This paper seeks to develop a conceptual framework to holistically capture different dimensions of container port logistics capacity. A systematic literature review method is employed to formulate a conceptual framework depicting the structure of various elements of capacity and the interplay among the logistics <jats:italic>triad</jats:italic> of transport carriers, port operators, and logistics service providers whose interactions and service capacities constitute the overall capacity of the system. The study reveals four dimensions of port logistics capacity, namely seaside interface, platform, landside interface, and system-wide, each of which consists of subelements that can be distinguished into static or adjustable. The proposed framework provides insights corresponding to the logistics triad roles and interactions within the system for understanding uncertainty characteristics, assessing various elements of capacity, and identifying potential levers to build flexibility into these interrelated capacity elements.</jats:p>",

This study deals with the factors that influence the sales of local products with a focus on value-added dairy products. The research involved 30 family businesses operating in the agro-sector. Primary data were obtained by a detailed online questionnaire survey. For deeper examination, five hypotheses were determined and statistically tested using the Friedman test and Nemenyi method. Using the acquired theoretical background and empirical research in a set of family farms, we can state that the goal of farmers is to sell their products through the shortest possible route directly to the consumer. The most commonly used tools of a short supply chain are on-farm sales and telephone order sales, on the other hand, farms rarely sell products in farmers’ markets, celebrations and anniversaries or e-shops, even though these tools all have great potential. The results show that farmers consider the product itself (quality, freshness, locality) to be the most important factor when selling local products, as well as customer recommendations and loyalty. Based on the results of the research, we propose to streamline sales support through new forms of marketing approaches to premium products, such as locally fresh products produced on family farms.</jats:p>"

The grid supply is not regular in these countries and up to some extent, they are dependent on diesel generators for power supply. But these diesel generators have some major issues such as high operating cost due to high cost of fuel, transportation cost of fuel, high maintenance cost, and these diesel generators also emits pollution to the environment. In presented work, an approach has been proposed for telecom companies for providing power supply to their telecom towers. An economic cost analysis has been proposed by considering various criteria such as cost, air &amp; noise pollution and reliability, etc. Some power supply alternatives including unconventional and hybrid of conventional and unconventional alternatives have been compared to find the solution such as diesel-powered telecom towers, solar powered telecom towers, and their hybrids. The main objective of this work is to provide a reliable, cost effective and environment friendly Remote Area Power Supply (RAPS) system for a particular site in India (Uttar Pradesh). A number of criteria are involved in discussed problem in order to select an effective power supply source. Therefore, the problem has been considered as a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. To select the best alternative, a Fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS based approach has been proposed. Fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarchy process) has been used for calculating the weightage of criteria and the concept of Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) has been applied for ranking the alternatives. The results give assured reliability and sustainability for remote areas using a solar photovoltaic (PV)-diesel generator hybrid energy system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this article, we address two network design problems for a responsive supply chain that consists of make‐to‐order (make‐to‐assemble) facilities facing stochastic demand and service time. The response time to customer orders, critical to the success of the supply chain, is the sum of the flow time in the facility and the delivery time to the customers. The response time performance in our models is measured by the probability that the response time is shorter than a constant. This nonlinear performance measure makes the models less or not tractable. The objective of both problems is to minimize the expected network cost that consists of the cost of delivery to customers as a function of the time of delivery (or the mode of transportation), the fixed cost of locating facilities and the capacity cost as a linear function of the processing capacity. The main decision variables are the number and locations of facilities, the resources allocated to them and the delivery mode selected between facilities and demand. In the first problem, a constraint is imposed to ensure an acceptable response time level. In the second problem, a penalty is charged on the number of days that each unit is delivered later than the targeted response time and is incorporated into the objective function. In the first problem, the probabilistic constraint on the flow time can be linearized and the problem can be formulated as an integer linear programming model. In the second problem, we propose an approximation approach to linearize the objective function and an iterative search and cut algorithm to combine linear approximation with neighborhood search. A multi‐start meta‐heuristic is also suggested. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of these solution procedures. Recommendations are made on the basis of the computational results. This appears to be the first study in the area of locating capacitated facilities with stochastic demand to incorporate the delivery mode choice decision and to evaluate the expected congestion cost as a function of the actual flow time in the facilities, instead of the average one. The models developed enable the decision maker to investigate the effect of a combination of facility location, capacity allocation, and delivery mode decisions on the expected network cost and the response time. In addition, the findings of the computational experiments shed light on tuning parameters of approximation algorithms.</jats:p>",

However, the particularities of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and the results of a recent trial raised the question if this subgroup of patients benefits from high oxygen supply. This study aims to evaluate the clinical effect of high oxygen supply in patients with STEMI using a systematic review of the available literature. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the systematic use of high oxygen (6 L/min or higher) versus room air or lower oxygen supply in STEMI patients were included. Systematic review with meta-analysis of trials retrieved in July 2020. Six databases were searched. The confidence in the pooled estimates was ascertained through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. There were five eligible RCTs (7703 patients). High oxygen supply was associated with a significant risk reduction of short-term mortality [risk ratio (RR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.70–0.98; <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">I</jats:italic>\n                           <jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0%].

D-C consists of oil producer and water injector wells, instrument gas system and four pipelines connected to a manned mother platform D-A which is around 2 nautical miles away. The four pipelines are dedicated for gas lift, High Pressure (HP) production, Low Pressure (LP) production and water injection respectively. Pneumatic supply medium for D-C is natural gas, tapped from the gas lift pipeline, which is supplied from the gas lift compressor at D-A. D-C does not have power generation system hence solely depends on instrument gas to energize the instrumentation. In 2019, the instrument gas scrubber on the platform experienced severe corrosion and was sent back to shore for repair, resulting in the natural gas was unable to be channeled to the platform’s instrumentation. This caused the platform to be on unplanned shut down. As D-C is an unmanned facility, a portable air compressor cannot be used for continuous pneumatic supply, as mechanic and fire watcher will be required to be onboard day and night. Hence, an alternative method of supplying pneumatic air for D-C was executed which enabled the platform to be back online without instrument gas scrubber, and in compliance to its unmanned philosophy. Compressed dry air was exported from D-A to D-C via the HP pipeline, and the air from the pipeline was supplied to the pneumatic instrumentation system of D-C. To achieve this, the HP pipeline was de-oiled and continuously pressurized by compressed air which was supplied by portable instrument air compressor at D-A. The compressed air in the HP pipeline was used to supply pneumatic air to the instrumentations at D-C. D-C was successfully operated continuously albeit with minor production deferment (some wells were closed in to minimize back pressure at the LP pipeline due to HP pipeline is unavailable for the wells), throughout the duration of instrument gas scrubber unavailability onsite (around one month). Threat of prolonged total production interruption from D-C was successfully eliminated and production from the platform was partially recovered.</jats:p>",

Due to the complexity of external environmental factors and internal structure, sustainable supply chain management is vulnerable to various risks. The purpose of this paper is to present a new two-stage approach for determining the best practitioner in Iran Pars Special Economic Energy Zone based on the sustainable supply chain risk management (SSCRM). The best and worst method (BWM) is used to determine the weight of risk factors. Then the method of linguistic value soft set is used to assess the impact of risk factors on each company’s sustainable supply chain which is a multiple attribute decision making problem with language preference in the second stage. Consequently, the ranking results of sustainable supply chain of each enterprise are obtained. This study contributes to finding the key risk factors of SSCRM. Evaluating these companies SSCRM with preference information, the best practitioner can obtain. The combination of BWM and linguistic value soft set approach provides a new nonparametric theoretical method and tool for this kind of decision-making problems with this background. At the same time, the conclusions of this study have guiding significance for the implementation of industrial supply chain. Limitations of the study along with future research directions are also presented.</jats:p>",

The experiments have shown that the maximum power factor value of combined rotors reached 0.60, which is almost 1.5–2.0 times higher than that of commercially produced horizontal-axial wind mills. The semi-empirical formula is obtained that allows determining the power factor of the combined rotor with different geometric dimensions of the H-Darier and Savonius rotors that are part of it with different numbers of stages. Energetically, economically and ecologically efficient wind mills with combined rotors with the capacity of 1–10 kW can be used for autonomous power supply of heat supply, water supply of various facilities, for oil production on land and at sea, as well as for driving propellers of small vessels.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the pharmaceutical industry, the goal of a supply planner is to make efficient capacity allocation decisions that ensure an uninterrupted supply of drug products to patients and to maintain product inventory levels close to the target stock. This task can be challenging due to the limited availability of manufacturing assets, uncertainties in product demand, fluctuations in production yields, and unplanned site downtimes. It is not uncommon to observe uneven distribution of product inventories with some products carrying excess inventories, while other products may be close to a stockout. Maintaining high stock levels can have economic repercussions due to the risk of expiration of unused products (whereas products facing a stockout can adversely affect the treatment regimen of patients). The network complexity of pharmaceutical supply‐chains coupled with regulatory constraints and siloed planning systems force supply planners to rely on manual (error‐prone) decision‐making processes. Such an approach results in suboptimal capacity allocation and inventory management decisions. In this work, we propose a stochastic optimization methodology for the production scheduling of multiple drug products in lyophilization units across multiple sites. The framework leverages information obtained from historical and forecast data to generate scenarios of uncertain parameters (e.g., yield, demand, and downtimes) that can realize in the future. The optimization model determines a product filling schedule that maintains product stock levels close to targets under diverse scenarios. We show that this approach helps in avoiding reactive scheduling and in maintaining a more robust production plan than deterministic procedures (which ignore uncertainty). Specifically, planning under a stochastic optimization approach reduces the number of scenarios under which backlogs are observed and also reduces the magnitude of the backlogs.</jats:p>",

This article addresses selected problems for managing modern SCs with a view to shared knowledge based on information management, effects of product and service on the quality of information, effects of consumer demands occurrences on information flow, outsourcing and globalization, and emerging threats to SCs by concerned parties. These problems are classified as concerns of confidentiality and trust, which are unable to share information among SC stakeholders due to a lack of data standards. To address these problems, a hybridized probabilistic performance and logistics framework (HPP‐LF) has been developed that defines the validity of blockchain to help companies throughout the design and deployment of potential blockchain solutions to address the information sharing issues between SC stakeholders. The proposed HPP‐LF results are compared with the existing PMOS, MIP, UTAUT, and ILOG techniques. The experimental result shows that the proposed method has better performance when compared with other existing systems.</jats:p>",

Take Qingdao city as an example, the empirical research indicated that: It was concluded that the demand and supply of the bus service in the research area matched well on the whole, and the supply of buses at the bus stations basically met the travel demand of residents. According to the LISA diagram of station clustering distribution, the stations with a mismatch of supply and demand in the area were identified through spatio-temporal difference analysis, and the mismatch was relatively more obvious in regions where a small number of stations were located.</jats:p>",

This research estimated the possible economic impacts of business interruption to the Sao Paulo Water Utility Company derived from hydrological drought and how this could be mitigated with an insurance scheme. Multi-year insurance (MYI) was proposed through a set of “change” drivers: the climate driver, through forcing the water evaluation and planning system (WEAP) hydrological tool; the anthropogenic driver, through water demand projections; and the economic driver, associated with recent water price policies adopted by the utility company during water scarcity periods. In our study case, the evaluated indices showed that MYI contracts that cover only longer droughts, regardless of the magnitude, offer better financial performance than contracts that cover all events (in terms of drought duration). Moreover, through MYI contracts, we demonstrate solvency for the insurance fund in the long term and an annual average actuarially fair premium close to the total expected revenue reduction.</jats:p>"

We use the case study of the Los Angeles City’s Department of Water and Power (LADWP), located in a densely populated, environmentally progressive, and water-poor region, to highlight the trade-offs and tensions that can occur in balancing priorities related to reliable water supply, energy demand for water and greenhouse gas emissions. The city is on its path to achieving higher fractions of local water supplies through the expansion of conservation, water recycling and stormwater capture to replace supply from imported water. We analyze scenarios to simulate a set of future local water supply adoption pathways under average and dry weather conditions, across business as usual and decarbonized grid scenarios. Our results demonstrate that an aggressive local water supply expansion could impact the geospatial distribution of electricity demand for water services, which could place a greater burden on LADWP’s electricity system over the next two decades, although the total energy consumed for the utility’s water supply might not be significantly changed. A decomposition analysis of the major factors driving electricity demand suggests that in most scenarios, a structural change in LADWP’s portfolio of water supply sources affects the electricity demanded for water more than increases in population or water conservation.</jats:p>"

This model describes the electromagnetic and information processes within the device and is implemented as a digital module within the control system of the converter. A block diagram of the model in MATLAB Simulink can be implemented as both continuous averaged and discrete. This depends on the control signal applied to the model input, i.e. continuous or pulse periodic with duty ratio D. The continuous averaged model is used for the digital synthesis of the converter, whereas discrete is employed to test the boost converter of the load simulator. A current transfer function of the converter with variable parameters depending on the duty ratio is derived. The developed boost converter provides the load current of up to 360 A. The ripple coefficient of the input current is under 0,6 %.

Orthodox current sees the money supply as an inventory and external variable that can be increased and decreased by the central bank (CB) according to the money holding preferences of the people and money is demanded only for transaction purposes. The Mundell-Fleming Model (MFM), which is included in this flow and adds the balance of payments to analysis, accepts the money supply only endogenously in the fixed exchange rate system. The aim of this study is to explain the endogenity of money supply in an open economy within the framework of Post Keynesian economics (PKI), which is based on the fact that the investment and production process takes place in a purely monetary economy. In this framework, compensation thesis which provides an alternative explanation for open economies has brought about a new expansion that is completely different from the MFM. In this expansion, two types of financial systems are defined as overdraft and asset-based. The endogeneity of the money supply in both systems in the PK can continue to be valid. These opinions oppose the endogeneity approach of the money supply discussed in MFM, and concurrently, the externality of the money supply which exists in the flexible exchange system is not accepted.</jats:p>"

Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the occurrence of (oo)cysts of these protozoans in surface water collected for human consumption in the state of Goiás, Brazil. Fifteen samples of raw water were collected to assess the occurrence of (oo)cysts of the protozoa using the Membrane Filtration method, in addition to turbidity and pH analyses. Recovery rates in tests with ultrapure water reached the USEPA (2012) criteria for Giardia (78.1% ± 0%) and for Cryptosporidium (60.6% ± 32.6%); however, recovery in raw water was lower due to turbidity. All samples (n = 15) were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts, with a maximum concentration of 250 oocysts/L, demonstrating that these protozoa are disseminated in the aquatic environment of the state of Goiás and pose a risk to public health. Due to the use of water sources for public consumption, it is recommended that public authorities and sanitation companies act to preserve and maintain water courses, carry out periodic monitoring of treatment plants that supply the Cerrado, Santana and São Manoel streams and improve existing treatment technologies. The results did not allow to infer whether animal load and grazing area promote an increase in contamination of the lotic aquatic systems.</jats:p>"

However, most of the approaches employed for NPS control are low-efficiency or impractical owing to ignorance of the willingness of participants, as well as the high cost. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency, this study newly proposes a resource-based approach for agricultural NPS pollution control via using biological agents. In this approach, the domestic organic waste and livestock manure are economically utilized to produce organic fertilizers and plant protection agents to replace harmful chemical fertilizers and pesticides, respectively. The approach has been applied in the Danjiangkou catchment area in Nanyang City, and the results show that: (1) the most severe pollutants, total P and total N concentrations have been effectively reduced and their values in 2025 are predicted to be the same level as that before significant deterioration; (2) with unpowered sewage treatment and spontaneous participation of farmers, the treatment cost is significantly reduced; (3) the resource-based treatment of domestic waste and livestock manure supports the development of an efficient and sustainable agricultural economy.</jats:p>",

There is thus a need for studies to analyze the detail cost and benefit of an early response to  this pandemic. This work sets out to calculate the costs and benefits of early response in the COVID-19 outbreak in Cameroon using DALYs, healthcare expenditure and labour supply lost. In order to do this, secondary data was collected from the Ministry of Public Health periodic reports on the COVID-19 situation and from the global disease burden report published in 2015. Data were analyzed using standard formula as used in Shutterstock, (2020) to calculate DALY, while percentages, algebra and other descriptive statistical tools like charts were used to present findings. Results showed that Cameroon had 658, 2265, 7599 and 14,916 cases one, two, three and months respectively after the outbreak. Results further show a 16.37 loss years of “healthy” life per person and a total of 10771.46DALYs, 37078.05DALYs, 124,395.6DALYs and 244,174.9DALYs after one, two, three and four months of onset. Health care expenditure for all patients stood at 2.632M, 9.060M, 30,396M and 59,664M FCFA for one, two, three and four months respectively after onset COVID 19 6 of March 2020. Lastly, all patients in total lost 105,280, 362,400, 1215840 and 2386560 hours of labour one, two, three and four months respectively after the onset of COVID 19 in Cameroon. This study thus concludes that COVID-19 has enormous cost to patients and government and a timely intervention will lead to great benefits. It recommends strict adherence to government’s preventive measures modified from the WHO guide. This will lessen the economic consequences of COVID 19 in Cameroon thus preventing the Economy from sinking into a recession.&#x0D;\nKey words : Covid-19, Cost, benefit and Intervention, Cameroon, DALY, economic, Recession </jats:p>"

For this optimization, researchers have used evolutionary and meta-heuristic algorithms, which are generally inspired by nature. These algorithms have been developed to achieve optimal/near-optimal solutions by a smaller number of function evaluations with less calculation time. In this research, the flower pollination algorithm (FPA) was used to optimize: (1) Aidoghmoush single-reservoir system operation for agricultural water supply, (2) Bazoft single-reservoir system operation for hydropower generation, (3) multi-reservoir system operation of Karun 5, Karun 4, and Bazoft, and (4) Bazoft single-reservoir system for rule curve extraction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the FPA, it was first applied to solve the mathematical test functions, and then used to determine optimal operations of the reservoir systems with the purposes of downstream water supply and hydropower generation. In addition, the FPA was compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the non-linear programming (NLP) method. The results for the Aidoghmoush single-reservoir system showed that the best FPA solution was similar to the NLP solution, while the best PSO solution was about 0.2% different from the NLP solution. The best values of the objective function of the PSO were approximately 3.5 times, 28%, and 43% worse than those of the FPA for the Bazoft single-reservoir system for hydropower generation, the multi-reservoir system, and the Bazoft single-reservoir system for rule curve extraction, respectively. The FPA outperformed the PSO in finding the optimal solutions. Overall, FPA is one of the new evolutionary algorithms, which is capable of determining better (closer to the ideal solution) objective functions, decreasing the calculation time, simplifying the problem, and providing better solutions for decision makers.</jats:p>",

This article provides an overview of the water footprint and virtual water incorporated into power supply chains. A water-use mapping model of the power supply chain is proposed in order to map the analysed research works according to the considered aspects. The distribution of water footprint per power generation technology per region is illustrated, in which Asia is characterised by the largest variation of the water footprint in hydro-, solar, and wind power. A broader consensus on the system boundary for the water footprint evaluation is needed. The review also concludes that the water footprint of power estimated by a top-down approach is usually higher and more accurate. A consistent virtual water accounting framework for power supply chains is still lacking. Water scarcity risks could increase through domestic and global power trade. This review provides policymakers with insights on integrating water and energy resources in order to achieve sustainable development for power supply chains. For future work, it is essential to identify the responsibilities of both the supply and demand sides to alleviate the water stress.</jats:p>"

The management culture adopted for food supply chains has an impact on the quality of the end product and the vitality of the businesses involved. In this report, we focus on the use of blockchain technology, and distributed ledgers in general, for managing supply chains in the food and agricultural sectors. We explore the challenges with which typical management systems are faced, such as food safety, food fraud, and inefficient processes, as well as ethical aspects like fair trade, animal welfare, and the environmental impact of food production. The use of blockchain‐based systems for managing a supply chain offers significant benefits, such as faster and more reliable traceability. Our analysis, involving small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from Denmark, highlights that SMEs could benefit from blockchain‐based systems that encourage fair trade and authenticity documentation, expose good practices, and decrease management costs. However, due to a lack of important policies and standards, and due to the limited understanding of the technology itself, its large‐scale adoption is at the moment immature. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:p>",

This document examines the role of ecosystems in household energy supply in Africa and explores pathways to ecosystem-based approaches to bioenergy generation by building on the regenerative economy concept. An ecosystem-based approach to bioenergy is an energy supply and utilization mechanism aimed at enhancing sustainable management of the sources of ecosystems with minimal trade-offs on/from other sectors directly linked to energy issues. Our analysis revealed that about 87% of energy supply to the population originated from agroecosystems and is challenged by the severe ecosystem degradation happening due to natural and anthropogenic factors. However, ecosystem restoration and effective use of agricultural residues could provide hope for making energy supply sustainable. Our analysis showed that restoring sparsely vegetated areas and degraded forest and savannahs, promotion of agroforestry in degraded agricultural lands, and use of agricultural residues could generate close to 71 billion gigajoules (GJ) of energy and provide sufficient energy for about 2.5 billion people if implemented in all potential areas identified. Ecosystem-based approaches to bioenergy along with a well-balanced involvement of sectors and industry actors coupled with knowledgeable management of the ecosystem could lead to beneficial outcomes for the society and environment.</jats:p>"

This study presents a new framework for categorizing a floodplain into critical risk zones by considering hydraulic and topographical aspects related to flood zoning. The framework was developed by integrating output of the MIKE Hydro River Model with an artificial neural network (ANN) technique which was explored in the lower part of Damodar river basin (Jharkhand, India). A total of nine flood causing factors were selected in three layers of ANN architecture which were optimized by a grid search technique. A confusion matrix was employed to check the unevenness and disproportionality in datasets from which were calculated F1 score values for low (0.815), moderate (0.731), high (0.818) and critical (0.64) zones with best overall accuracy of 75.06%. The results were presented in a GIS environment which shows the model correctly predicted 16, 38, 54 and 24 sites under critical, high risk, moderate risk and low risk zones respectively. Elevation and distance from the river were the most sensitive parameters. Further, this study contributes towards flood susceptibility mapping thereby supporting hydrologists in the course of action and decisions for combating floods in watersheds.</jats:p>",

In light of the ongoing policy debate and successful implementation of similar policies in Peru and Chile, we explored manufacturer reformulation in the Colombian food supply. We compared the quantities of nutrients of concern (including sugar, sodium, and saturated fat) from the nutrition facts panels of the same 102 packaged foods and 36 beverages from the top-selling brands in Colombia between 2016 and 2018. Our analyses showed a substantial decrease in median sugar content of beverages, from 9.2 g per 100 mL to 5.2 g per 100 mL, and an increase in the percentage of beverages containing non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), from 33% to 64% (p = 0.003). No meaningful changes in the quantities of nutrients of concern among foods were observed. Our findings suggest little reformulation has occurred in Colombia in the absence of mandatory policies, except for the substitution of sugar with NNS among beverages.</jats:p>"

The application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to the optimization of e-commerce supply chain can help e-commerce enterprises to monitor each product in real time and manage logistics system reasonably; thus, the circulation process of e-commerce product in the supply chain can be monitored and shared, and the product information at each stage of the supply chain can be analyzed and predicted, helping e-commerce companies to estimate the future trends or accident probability. On the analysis of summarizing and analyzing previous works, this article expounded the research status and significance of e-commerce supply chain optimization, elaborated the development background, current status, and future challenges of the IoT technology, introduced the methods and principles of the node distribution model and constraint parameter analysis of logistics supply chain, constructed the IoT-based e-commerce supply chain linear and nonlinear model including competition and risk-control modules, performed the design of IoT-based e-commerce supply chain optimization, and discussed the solutions to procurement robustness optimization and management process optimization. The final simulation analysis showed that the proposed optimization model can effectively predict e-commerce product information in each stage of the supply chain; the IoT-based e-commerce supply chain optimization can enable each node company in the supply chain to improve the quality of information transmission and reduce the risk of information asymmetry in the process of e-commerce exchanges and can quickly and easily respond to the sudden changes of market and environment, thereby promoting them to cooperate with each other for establishing a supply chain network structure with closer business relationships, smoother logistics transportation, more reasonable benefit sharing, and stronger market competitiveness.</jats:p>",

During this transition process, the organization faces many barriers such as financial, organizational, technology‐based, social, policy‐related, market‐based, and logistics‐based barriers. The objectives of this study are to propose a framework highlighting policy‐related barriers for a supply chain in the transition to CE and finally discuss potential implications on enhancing corporate environmental performance of a business. Further, this study evaluates the causal relationships between the policy‐related barriers using fuzzy Decision‐Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The application was conducted in an apparel firm in Turkey. From findings, lack of legislation for efficient CE (C4), lack of mandatory requirements and responsibilities for manufacturers/suppliers for the CE (C17), and lack of government support for environmentally friendly policies (C2) are revealed as the most important barriers, respectively. It is found that lack of attitude and awareness about CE in government institutions (C19) is the most influencing factor, whereas lack of effective recycling policies to achieve quality in waste management (C8) is the most influenced factor. The recommendations were developed for enhancing the corporate environmental performance of businesses through incentives and unique rewards, improving communication among stakeholders, the government's perception of CE and current linear economy, cooperation with nongovernmental organization (NGOs) and civil actions, the vision of government towards circular principles, the circular public procurement, the local governments in circular policymaking, and awareness of bureaucracy and government officials.</jats:p>",

The operations literature has traditionally approached supply chain network design with the objective of minimizing the overall costs from a centralized standpoint. We study the strategic consequences of the focal retailer's supply chain design decisions, and demonstrate how pursuing “cost‐raising” internalization could be beneficial. We build a stylized game‐theoretic model that captures the cost implications of the focal retailer's internalization decisions, and analyze the impact of these decisions on the equilibrium outcome. Under various assumptions on the nature of retail competition and supply chain contracts, we obtain simple and intuitive sufficient conditions for the profitability of cost‐raising internalization. Moreover, we study how the intensity of horizontal and vertical competition, respectively, may influence the focal retailer's supply chain decisions. Finally, we examine the impact of cost‐raising internalization on consumer surplus and channel performance, and find that welfare may increase under certain conditions. Our results challenge the presumption that supply chains always benefit from lowering their costs and highlight the fact that strategic considerations can sometimes lead a firm to make cost‐raising decisions within its supply chain.</jats:p>",

By changing the location of the supply diffuser from the contaminant source, PM concentration was analyzed in the kitchen and living room of an apartment house in Korea.

Research into the execution procedure, terms and conditions of such contracts has both theoretical and practical value. The importance of a foreign trade contract for relations between the parties cannot be overemphasized as its scope determines and legally binds the parties for the achievement of their respective goals. When entering into foreign trade contracts, the parties should consider the impact of natural gas extraction, processing, transportation, storage processes on terms of foreign trade transactions with natural gas. These terms are especially important for long-term natural gas export contracts which are considered to be the traditional form of natural gas trading. However, more recently, forms of foreign trade contracts for natural gas export used to interact with foreign buyers have become more diversified. Natural gas trading under short-term contracts using electronic trading platforms is becoming increasingly important. In this article, the author examines the key peculiarities of such contracts, defines basic advantages and disadvantages of using various contract forms for natural gas export.</jats:p>",

Hence, for water managers it is of key importance to evaluate and report on the quality of water and the level of purification treatment that is required. For this purpose a novel framework of indices is defined, and their definition allows the inclusion of new, emerging substances. The indices can be calculated based on micropollutant characteristics alone and do not require any knowledge of specific purification treatment installations. Applying this framework of indices to water bodies provides an objective and reproducible way of evaluating the required purification treatment level. The indices were calculated for water quality data for up to 600 micropollutants from five sampling locations along the river Rhine in the Netherlands. This revealed differences between the sampling sites (index values ranged from 145 to 273) and showed that for the river Rhine the required purification treatment level, as well as the underlying removal requirement and purification treatment effort, have not improved over the years, despite the introduction of the WFD in 2000.</jats:p>",

In hydro-geological terms, the research area is located within the Irtysh artesian basin, covering a vast territory in the south of the West Siberian lowland. The Cenozoic sediments that compose the described territory contain a number of underground reservoirs, horizons and water-resistant strata separating them. The waters of Quaternary, Neogene and Oligocene sediments are of practical importance as a source of water supply. Groundwater is exploited by wells and shallow waters (in Neogene and Quaternary sediments) are exposed and exploited by many shaft wells. The article provides a generalized characteristic of the quality of underground waters of Quaternary, Neogene and Paleogene deposits, as well as production wells drilled in the Krutinsky district of the Omsk region. As a result of research, it was found that groundwater does not meet the requirements of SanPiN 2.1.4.1074-01. The use of these waters for household and drinking purposes will be environmentally safe for the population only if such indicators as turbidity, color, chlorine, iron, dry residue and microbiological indicators are adjusted.</jats:p>",

The platelet supply could be improved through the expansion of the donor pool, the identification and sustained utilization of high‐quality donors, and changes in component processing and storage that result in a longer platelet shelf‐life. Refrigerated platelets, stored at 1° to 6°C, have the potential to improve patient safety by decreasing the risk of bacterial contamination while concurrently allowing for a longer storage period (eg, 14 days) and improved hemostatic effectiveness in actively bleeding patients. An approach utilizing remuneration of apheresis platelet donors combined with pathogen reduction of the platelet components could be used as a means to increase the donor pool and identify and sustain safe, reliable, high‐quality donors. Remuneration might provide an incentive for underutilized populations (eg, individuals &lt;30 years old) to enter the apheresis platelet donor population resulting in a significant expansion of the platelet donor pool. Over time, approaches such as the use of refrigerated platelets, platelet donor remuneration, and the application of pathogen reduction technology, might serve to attract a large, reliable, and safe donor base that provides platelet collections with high yields, longer shelf‐lives and, excellent hemostatic function.</jats:p>",

All operations were performed by a locally trained general surgeon and a clinical officer.&#x0D;\nResults: Twenty-three (47.9%) of 48 male patients with urinary retention assessed for eligibility for open simple prostatectomy were deemed eligible and underwent the procedure. Of the patients who underwent an open simple prostatectomy, histopathological findings demonstrated benign prostatic hyperplasia in 19 patients (82.6%), while six patients (26.1%) had coincidental malignancy. At postoperative followup, the entire cohort was catheter-free and reported regular sexual activity and the ability to return to work, while 87.0% noted improvements in social integration and 34.8% cited higher self-esteem. Two patients required treatment for infection and one patient experienced fascial dehiscence. Two months following prostatectomy, all patients were catheter-free and able to void independently.&#x0D;\nConclusions: Local surgical practitioners without formal urology training can successfully perform open simple prostatectomy to relieve patients of chronic indwelling catheters and assist in addressing the disease burden in a low-resource setting.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The fastest land animals are of intermediate size. Cheetah, antelope, greyhounds and racehorses have been measured running much faster than reported for elephants or elephant shrews. Can this be attributed to scaling of physical demands and explicit physiological constraints to supply? Here, we describe the scaling of mechanical work demand each stride, and the mechanical power demand each stance. Unlike muscle stress, strain and strain rate, these mechanical demands cannot be circumvented by changing the muscle gearing with minor adaptations in bone geometry or trivial adjustments to limb posture. Constraints to the capacity of muscle to supply work and power impose fundamental limitations to maximum speed. Given an upper limit to muscle work capacity each contraction, maximum speeds in big animals are constrained by the mechanical work demand each step. With an upper limit to instantaneous muscle power production, maximal speeds in small animals are limited by the high power demands during brief stance periods. The high maximum speed of the cheetah may therefore be attributed as much to its size as to its other anatomical and physiological adaptations.</jats:p>",

In this study, an optimized rainfall method based on maximum rainfall intensity and self-similarity was established to provide different rainfall data for the physically based distributed hydrological model. The results showed the following: (1) the increase of time scale resulted in decreased rainfall intensity and an evenly distributed rainfall pattern; (2) the established disaggregation method for rainfall well described the uneven distribution in time; (3) the influence of time scale could be divided into 1–20, 20–120, and 120–360 min; (4) the conversion method between rainfall intensity and saturated hydraulic conductivity was effective at ensuring the physical meaning of the parameters on a time scale of 20–90 min. Furthermore, results showed that the reasonable time scale of application of the CASC2D model is less than 120 min. For longer time scales, the model was able to simulate peak discharge but unable to describe the flood process.</jats:p>",

These challenges often arise due to a lack of trust, poor collaboration and an inability to respond to disaster affected areas in a timely manner. Our study attempts to understand how these challenges are overcome by seeking answers to questions related to the topics of swift-trust, collaboration and agility in humanitarian supply chains. For instance, in our study we have attempted to examine how information sharing and supply chain visibility in humanitarian supply chains improve the swift-trust among the humanitarian actors engaged in disaster relief operations. Further, we attempt to understand how-swift trust, commitment and collaboration among the humanitarian actors improve the agility in humanitarian supply chains. In our study we provide both theoretical and data-driven answers to our stated research gaps. Our theoretical model is firmly grounded in organizational information process theory and relational view. We tested our research hypotheses using variance based structural equation modelling with survey data collected using a web based pre-tested instrument from 147 NGOs respondents drawn from the National Disaster Management Authority database. Our results help to advance the theoretical debates surrounding “swift-trust”, “collaboration” and “agility” in humanitarian settings. We further provide direction to managers engaged in disaster relief operations. The humanitarian actors engaged in disaster relief often fail to understand how to build swift-trust. Moreover, how swift-trust further affects commitment and collaboration which in turn further affect agility in humanitarian supply chains. Thus humanitarian organizations must understand how information sharing and supply chain visibility is key to swift-trust among humanitarian actors and agility in humanitarian supply chains. Finally, we outline the limitations of our study and offer some future research directions for investigation.</jats:p>",

Water needed for irrigation of rice fields in Bua District, especially in the Bua, Malenggang, and Salu Beroa watersheds are experiencing drought each year. This means that water needs are not in accordance with the existing water supply, so research needs to be done related to water supply and rice field irrigation water needs. This study aims to determine the water supply of Bua, Malenggang, and Salu Beroa watersheds based on the existing land cover and the spatial pattern of the Luwu Regency in 2030 and the need for water for rice fields in this area. Data was used in this study include existing land cover maps, Luwu Regency spatial pattern maps in 2030, soil type maps, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, and daily climate data analyzed by using the SWAT model. The results of SWAT model analysis based on existing land cover found that water supply in Bua watershed is 40.291.452 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year, Malenggang watershed is 19.467.893 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year, and Salu Beroa watershed is 2.685.224 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> / year. Meanwhile, based on the spatial pattern in 2030 found that water supply in Bua watershed is 40.076.558 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year, Malenggang watershed is 19.396.958 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year, and Salu Beroa watershed is 2.689.116 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year. The amount of water needed for irrigating in these watersheds is 50.848.015,7 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year or 81% out of the total water supply of existing land cover and 82% out of the total of spatial pattern water supply in 2030. It is showed that if the spatial pattern plan is implemented and simulated by using a watershed-based SWAT model, the water supply in the study area will be reduced or lower than 281.937 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> at the end of the planning year, which are the total water supply based on existing land cover is 62.444.569 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> while the water supply based on the spatial pattern is 62.162.632 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. Therefore, an evaluation of the implementation of the Luwu Regency spatial plan is needed. The monthly demand of rice fields is 4.237.335 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> while water supply in August is 3.377.597 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, September is 3.340.444 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, and October is 3.484.457 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. It means that the demand for rice fields is not fulfilled in August, September, and October. Thus, in that month, Drought occurs.</jats:p>",

This is particularly important for meat and ethanol, which consume nearly half of global crop production as feed and feedstocks. However, lack of data has thus far limited the ability to trace inputs and impacts of commodity crops through domestic supply chains. For the first time, we use a commodity-flow model to link spatially distributed water resource impacts of corn and soy to individual meat and ethanol processing facilities. This creates transparency in the supply chains, illuminating substantial variation in embedded irrigation water and water scarcity footprints among meat and ethanol processed at different facilities. By calculating unique blue water scarcity footprints for end-products, we show that beef processed in Iowa or Illinois, for example, has fewer water impacts than chicken processed in California and pork processed in Oklahoma. We find that over 75% of irrigated feed embedded in meat is consolidated in six companies and 39% of irrigated feedstock for ethanol is consolidated in five companies, with potentially negative impacts to supply costs and risk management. This subnational variation and consolidation of impacts in key supply chains creates opportunities for producers and consumers of agriculture-based products to make management, investment, and sustainability decisions about those products.</jats:p>",

Aviation safety is an important component of the concept of general national security, the system of personal security, ecological and public safety and transport safety from external and internal threats. Maintaining an acceptable level of national aviation safety is a priority for the industry. In the context of globalization, ecological safety is becoming especially important. World leaders gathered at the United Nations (UN) and adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is a plan of action aimed at achieving global sustainable development in economic, social and environmental areas, which ensures that no UN member state is left behind. The 17 sustainable development goals on the 2030 Agenda can be used as benchmarks for the coordinated development of UN member states. One of the most important goals for the global survival of humankind is Goal 13 “Climate Change”.  In order to find an adequate answer to this challenge, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has identified the following areas that can contribute to the attainment of the global aspirational goal: aircraft related technology and standards; improved air traffic management and operational improvements, development and deployment of sustainable aviation fuel and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The implementation of CORSIA is carried out not only at the global level, the initiative requires the search for effective management solutions at the national level. Statistics on the activities of the aviation industry of Ukraine indicate its stable development. However, unfortunately, the dynamic growth of air traffic entails an increase in emissions of chemical elements into the atmosphere, which are a real threat to the environment and can contribute to climate change processes. The main tool for ensuring ecological safety tasks is proactive risk management. The development of proactive tools for environmental risk management is relevant and has practical implications for sustainable development, both in the industry in particular and for the state as a whole. The articles offer the author's approaches to the identification of air transport ecological component level.</jats:p>"

In this study, phytoplankton and cyanotoxins analysis, as well as cellular and genetic biomarkers of toxicity (Allium cepa test - higher plant test system), were evaluated in water samples of Alagados Reservoir during a cyanobacterial bloom in South Brazil. The water samples were collected during the wet season at two sites in the Reservoir. Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) were detected in both samples (sites 1 and 2); however, the levels of PSTs were higher in site 1. Gonyautoxin 2 was the major cyanotoxin found in the Reservoir. Both samples were able to induce cytotoxic effects (reduced Mitotic Index) and damage the genetic material (i.e., increased frequencies of chromosome aberration and micronuclei) of meristematic cells of A. cepa. The cellular and genetic damages were higher in the sample site 1, wherein high levels of PSTs were verified. Thus, our findings suggested that cyanotoxins-contaminated waters may damage the genetic material of living organisms, and therefore this group of contaminants should be assessed for their potential genotoxicity.</jats:p>"

The study adopted the Classical Linear Regression Model for the empirical analysis. The result showed that ICT, power supply (proxied by electricity consumption) and population impact positively on human capital development, while infant mortality has a negative impact on human capital development in Nigeria. The impact of ICT on school enrolment suggests that technology is fast evolving and new technologies are preferred to old ones. The study, therefore, recommended that Nigeria should follow in the trend of ICT globally in harnessing her human capital endowments. In conclusion, the Nigerian government should harness her ICT and electric power potentials and develop the human capital available to her to prevent the emigration of her human resource endowment to more resilient and promising economies.</jats:p>",

Here we demonstrate that the annual water supply of the Colorado River is predictable up to several years in advance by a drift-free decadal climate prediction system using a fully coupled climate model. Observational analyses and model experiments show that prolonged shortages of water supply in the Colorado River are significantly linked to sea surface temperature precursors including tropical Pacific cooling, North Pacific warming, and southern tropical Atlantic warming. In the Colorado River basin, the water deficits can reduce crop yield and increase wildfire potential. Thus, a multi-year prediction of severe water shortages in the Colorado River basin could be useful as an early indicator of subsequent agricultural loss and wildfire risk.</jats:p>"

However, so far, the rates at which energy is supplied to the p modes have not been detected to be sensitive to the level of magnetic activity. We set out to re-inspect their temporal behaviour over the course of the last two Schwabe cycles. For this, we use Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) p-mode parameter tables. We analyse the energy supply rates for modes of harmonic degrees l = 0–150 and average over the azimuthal orders and, subsequently, over modes in different parameter ranges. This averaging greatly helps in reducing the noise in the data. We find that energy supply rates are anticorrelated with the level of solar activity, for which we use the F10.7 index as a proxy. Modes of different mode frequency and harmonic degrees show varying strengths of anticorrelation with the F10.7 index, reaching as low as r = −0.82 for low frequency modes with l = 101–150. In this first dedicated study of solar p-mode energy supply rates in GONG data, we find that they do indeed vary through the solar cycle. Earlier investigations with data from other instruments were hindered by being limited to low harmonic degrees or by the data sets being too short. We provide tables of time-averaged energy supply rates for individual modes as well as for averages over disjunct frequency bins.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasing water scarcity in developing world cities combined with poor performance of water supply systems has led to an increasing reliance on informal water supply systems. Although the availability of informal supply provides a coping mechanism that enables water consumers to be resilient to failures in water supply, the longer-term effects on formal water supply systems (FWSS) are uncertain, with a potential reduction of tariff recovery (RT), and in turn a service provider’s financial sustainability. This motivates an analysis of the coevolving dynamics and feedbacks involved in water systems where formal and informal components co-exist. Investigating Hyderabad, Pakistan as a case study, a dynamic socio-hydrologic system model is built, comprised of a formal system’s water and fund balance, consumer behaviour and infrastructure conditions. Simulations are executed on a monthly basis at a household level and for a 100-year period (2007–2107) using data available from years 2007–2017. Demand shift to informal is observed to be weakly associated with lower recovery rates, with household income as a major predictor. The FWSS’s financial balance, predominantly driven by infrastructure condition, appears to be less sensitive to recovery of a tariff to generate sufficient revenue.</jats:p>"

The number of remanufacturing generations is one of our concerns since we consider a type of product that could not be remanufactured in an unlimited number of time. Thus, how many times the product should be remanufactured becomes important. In this study, we also investigate the environmental impacts in term of carbon emissions, energy usage, as well as annual disposed items.

First, the Black Hole Clustering Algorithm is employed to divide the WDS into different partitions. Second, two types of outliers are eliminated by multistage iterative processes including traverse, k-Nearest neighbor, and the Warshall algorithm. Finally, the boundary conditions of the partitions are optimized by a Non-dominated Sorting Porcellio Scaber Algorithm to minimize the number of boundary pipes required to balance pressures and reduce leakages. Seven WDSs are employed as case studies to verify the practicability of the method. The Open Water Analytics toolbox is applied to code the hydraulic calculation program. The result demonstrates that average pressure and leakage cost decreases after optimization.</jats:p>",

The experiments were designed to study how sediment supply influences step formation, step location, and step stability. Our results show that steps are more likely to form in segments of the channel where the width narrows because of particle jamming, and these steps are also more stable. Sediment feed increases particle activity which generates a dynamic channel morphology with steps forming and collapsing. A comparison with experiments without sediment feed shows that sediment supply does not inhibit step formation. Time series of step formation, evolution, and destruction show that the maximum number of steps is achieved when the sediment feed is larger than zero but smaller than the transport capacity. We summarize this outcome in a conceptual model where the dependence of step frequency on sediment supply is expressed by a bell curve. Sediment yield measured at the channel outlet followed the sediment feed at the inlet closely, even when we fed 50 % more and 50 % less than the calculated transport capacity. This outcome challenges the applicability of the concept of transport capacity to steep channels and highlights the key role played by sediment feed in dictating sediment yield and channel response. Finally, we detected a positive correlation between sediment concentration and step destruction, which stresses the importance of particle interactions for step formation and stability.\n                    </jats:p>"

Maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum sp.) are important crops for human and animal nutrition, as well as for bioenergy. The aim of this study was to investigate maize and sorghum in mixed cropping with soybean (Glycine max) and faba bean (Vicia faba) regarding biomass yield, drought tolerance, phosphorus (P) availability, and enzyme activity in soil as affected by the single and combined effects of water and P supply in two outdoor pot trials with rainout shelters. Maize had the highest biomass under sufficient water supply (80% water holding capacity, WHC), but a sharp decrease of its biomass of about 60% was measured when water was limited (30% WHC). In the mixtures, drought induced reduction of biomass was less than 40%. For mixed cropping usually higher contents of labile P fractions in soil than for sole cropped monocots were found. This was especially true for the combined stress of water and P deficit and can be partly explained by a higher activity of the acid phosphatase in the soil of the mixtures. A higher yield stability of the crop mixtures makes them a suitable agronomic alternative to sole cropped maize or sorghum under suboptimal conditions of water and P shortage.</jats:p>"

In the water of a reservoir in Shenzhen, four kinds of organic matter were detected: iodoform &amp;gt; diiodo-bromomethane &amp;gt; dibromo-iodomethane &amp;gt; dichloromethane. As pH increased from 3 to 10, I− conversion rate decreased from 31.0% to 11.0%. There is basically no iodic acid () generated under alkaline conditions, probably due to these organic matters. When PDS concentration is low, PDS can oxidize part of I− to IO−, and the oxidation of I− into reaction and continued oxidation reaction exist at the same time, so some is generated in the system. As the proportion of Fe (II) increases, the generation rate of gradually increases. When Fe2+/PDS is 1:5, 2:5, and 3:5, the conversion rates of are 4.7%, 6.5%, and 8.4%, respectively. There are two main reasons for this: (i) the reaction of IO− produced in the system with humic acid (HA) inhibits the further conversion of IO− to ; (ii) both HA and I- in the system can react with PDS, resulting in a reduction in the oxidation rate of I−.</jats:p>",

This problems can be solved with the use of a graph of exergy and economic expenditures for the pairwise interaction of flows. The purpose of the study is to specify the concept of exergy schedule and economic costs applied to energy supply systems (ESS). We shall interpret a graph of the exergy and economic expenditures of an ESS, having an arbitrary structure, as a bipartite graph Z such that the set of its nodes C corresponds to the heating H and heated C flows, and the set of its arcs D to a possible distribution of the exergy and economic expenditures in the corresponding elements of this ESS in the course of interaction between the heating and heated flows. A symmetric graph represents an oriented graph, whose arcs can be grouped into pairs of parallel but oppositely directed arcs. Such graphs, having no isolated nodes, are convenient for studying complex interrelated systems. If we have determined the optimal pair of elements (аі, aj), corresponding to the sequence of nodes, beginning from the root of the foretree and finishing by a suspended node, giving a matrix of unit dimension, then the obtained sequence of elements forms a single-contour system with the minimum level of exergy and economic expenditure. For finding the optimal solution it is advisable to use the method of branches and boundaries, which enables one to improve the solution simpler than with the application of different methods of exergy analysis.</jats:p>",

The remote sensing ecological index evaluation model was used to evaluate the ecology of the Fuxian Lake area from 2013 to 2018. Environmental quality in the study area is monitored and analyzed. By developing a unified organization and management module of spatio-temporal data in the collaborative production of multi-source heterogeneous data, the mapping relationship between data and parameters is established. The 3D-web data integration decision platform is constructed. Based on the Cesium engine real-time rendering and interactive visualization network 3D platform, real-time calculation and visualization of the ecological evaluation of the Fuxian Lake area between 2013 and 2018 is realized. The ecological environment of the study area continued to deteriorate from 2013 to 2015, improved slightly in 2016, and improved significantly in 2017–2018. The platform has the functions of searching, selecting the base map, measuring on the map, and positioning the coordinates, which can achieve the real-time ecological analysis function and show the change process of the ecological environment and natural resources.</jats:p>",

The logistics performance is of critical importance to provide a high level of efficiency in operations and a high degree of customer satisfaction. The Handling Unit, or the minimum quantity to send to retail stores (the ship-pack), is a factor of considerable influence on logistics efficiency and costs. In this work, it was developed a simple analytical cost model for a Portuguese food retail two-tier distribution system (distribution centre and store) to support the evaluation of the conversion of the handling unit to half-pallet. The results of the model, considering a pilot study with three scenarios, suggest an economic gain of approximately 75% (comparatively to the current situation) in logistics costs. These quantitative results were decisive to guide decision-makers.</jats:p>"

Currently, high AM unit costs or low AM part reliabilities deem the application of AM economical inferior to conventional manufacturing (CM) methods in most cases. In this paper, we investigate the potential to overcome these deficiencies by combining AM and CM methods. For that purpose, we develop an approach that is tailored toward the unique characteristics of dual sourcing with two production methods. Opposed to the traditional dual sourcing literature, we consider the different failure behavior of parts produced by AM and CM methods. Using numerical experiments and a case study in the aviation industry, we explore under which conditions dual sourcing with AM performs best. Single sourcing with AM methods typically leads to higher purchasing and maintenance costs while single sourcing with CM methods increases backorder and holding costs. Savings of more than 30% compared to the best single sourcing option are possible even if the reliability or unit costs of a part sourced with AM are three times worse than for a CM part. In conclusion, dual sourcing methods may play an important role to exploit the benefits of AM methods while avoiding its drawbacks in the low-volume spare parts business.</jats:p>",

The proposed cascaded‐AITSMC‐TDE scheme is composed of two components: time delay estimation (TDE) technique and cascaded‐adaptive integral type‐terminal sliding mode control (AITSMC). The TDE is employed to approximate unknown uncertain dynamic. The cascaded‐AITSMC is integrated with TDE to control oxygen excess ratio (stoichiometry) and air flow rate keeping a proper system performance under load disturbance, avoiding the oxygen starvation. The stability of the proposed cascaded‐AITSMC‐TDE via closed‐loop system is verified by Lyapunov approach. In order to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed cascaded‐AITSMC‐TDE, a comparative study with a single loop AITSMC, cascaded integral type‐terminal sliding mode control (cascaded‐ITSMC) and cascaded integral sliding mode based‐time delay estimation (cascaded‐ISMC‐TDE) is carried out, and the corresponding simulation results exhibit that the proposed controller provides fast convergence of tracking trajectories with less fluctuations.</jats:p>",

It also gives the answer to the question of how such a Supply Chain (SC) can be evaluated using Net Present Value (NPV) approach. The procedures include a real-time calculation and communication about the remaining shelf life (RSL) during transportation and other logistic manipulations from one chain node to another if the time to exceed the contractually stipulated Customer Remaining Shelf Life (CRSL) is distributed by known distribution. Planning and control on the skeleton of the extended material requirements planning (MRP) model are advised, where time delays and their impact on the CRSL can be easily calculated. The changes in the NPV at contractually stipulated CRSL are calculated dynamically in real-time. Smart devices, tracking temperature, humidity, and gas concentration enable such reports immediately after detecting a high probability that CRSL, as stipulated in a contract, will not be achieved, based on the known parameters of the exponential distribution of the remaining shelf life as a time to failure at each node of the graph. The model includes possibilities to deliver the meat to the local market or to the reverse logistics plants in the nodes of the remaining route, if the expected contractually stipulated CRSL becomes too high. On this way, shortening unnecessary routes further contributes to less pollution.</jats:p>"

The information gain method is introduced to the predictor processing of the forecast model. Then the characteristics of many rainstorm predictors are calculated and screened on the basis of feature weight, information is condensed, some non-correlated forecast information variables are extracted, and the network structure of the forecast model is optimized. The modeled samples are determined and reconstructed by setting thresholds, and the modular forecast models of heavy rainfall and weak rainfall are established. The actual forecast results of the 24 h experimental prediction of the independent samples of large-scale rainstorms in Guangxi in 2012–2016 showed that the information gain-based modular FNN rainstorm forecasting model has higher prediction accuracy and a more stable forecasting effect. The various types of scores of 24 h of rainstorm (≧50 mm) at 89 weather stations in Guangxi from 2012 to 2016 are: threat score (TS) is 0.368, ETS: equal threat score (E) is 0.141, hit rate (POD) is 0.296, empty report rate (FAR) is 0.559, forecast bias (B) is 0.671, and HSS skill score (H) is 0.247. Further comparison and analysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) numerical forecasting model forecast results indicated that the new model performed nonlinear intelligence calculated interpretation modeling on ECMWF numerical forecasting model products, and forecasting accuracy is improved to a certain extent compared with that of the original model. Forecasting techniques are positive and have good release effects, thereby improving the rain forecasting ability of ECMWF to a certain extent and providing a better reference value for business forecasters.</jats:p>",

Electronic maps (for monitoring water resources) were developed at scale of 1:200000; databases are being under development. Improvement and development of the Republic’s water utilization system should be based on the principles of ecosystem water use, providing for strict monitoring and control over quantitative and qualitative indicators of water resources based on a technologically advanced monitoring system including the options regulating standardization, eco-quality, and economical consumption.</jats:p>",

Herewith the effects of N nutrition (8.47, 12.71 and 16.94 mg · L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N) and shading percentages (0 and 70%) on plant morphology and chemical composition of the essential oil of marigold (<jats:italic>Tagetes erecta</jats:italic> L.) ‘Inca’ were assessed. Increasing N levels enhanced the number of secondary branches and the flower diameter, while shading reduced height of side branches, number of primary branches and opened flower buds. In leaves, flowers and stems, 15 different compounds were identified. In leaves, low and medium N levels and high light level increased the synthesis of ocimene, limonene and piperitone. As well, medium and high N doses, independently of the light level, stimulated the synthesis of caryophyllene and β-phellandrene in leaves. Nevertheless, increasing N doses and shading level decreased the synthesis of β-myrcene and α-pinene in leaves. In flowers, medium N level and high light intensity increased the synthesis of <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>-pinene. Piperitone and verbenone were identified only in flowers of plants with high N doses and lower light intensity. In the stems, caryophyllene, piperitone and β-farnesene were more abundant with medium and high N levels. The interaction of study factors differentially affected both morphological variables and the composition of essential oil among organs studied. Therefore, N nutrition and light intensity are key factors that modify the morphology and composition of the essential oil in <jats:italic>T. erecta</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

The high oxidizing potential of ozone justifies the possibility of its use for removing organic films under atmospheric pressure. The experiments were carried out using the developed research bench, in which the mode and method of heating, as well as the method of supplying gas to the surface of the photoresist, were varied. Silicon wafers with a formed 1,35-μm thick masking photoresist film were used as experimental samples. It was found expedient that uniform heating of the plate over its entire surface can be achieved using a ceramic IR heater. When the ozone-air mixture was introduced into the center of the heated sample, the presence of the removed photoresist residues was observed, which was associated with a temperature drop in its surface area. To solve this problem, the computer models of the temperature regimes of the reaction volume elements were calculated. They showed that the scattering of the working gas flow over the surface of the silicon wafer would significantly increase the efficiency of photoresist removal, and with a good selection of the treatment regime it would ensure complete removal of the photoresist. The data obtained were experimentally confirmed by using an ozone-air mixture flow separator. Experiments were carried out to study the effect of the distance from the wafer surface to the working gas inlet on the photoresist removal rate. They showed that a decrease in the distance reduces the ozone loss due to thermal decomposition and, consequently, increases the material removal rate.</jats:p>"

Despite the growing interest in this approach, limited studies focus on quality assurance (QA) in RLSC, which is crucial to resolve the issue of the low quality in reprocessed products. This study aims to explore the elements which contribute to the QA of RLSC of demolition waste (DW) by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR). A total of 91 articles available in six search engines between 2000 and 2019 were exposed to descriptive and content analysis. The descriptive analysis revealed that most of the articles were experimental studies (35%) and published during the recent period of 2013–2019 (64%). Furthermore, 60% of articles were originated from developed countries while 32% originated from developing countries. The results of the content analysis established that an information-centric integrated system of process, people, policy and technology is needed for QA in RLSC, which is supported by government, regulatory bodies, industry and universities/research institutions. The study addresses the existing gap by proposing a conceptual framework, which could be considered as the foundation in enforcing QA in the RLSC of DW. Finally, the implications for research and practice and some recommendations for further research were presented. The study facilitates in paving the path to sustainable development through building the foundation to enforce QA in RSLC of DW. </jats:p>",

We then explored potentials of a full spectrum of GHG emission mitigation strategies ranging from production‐efficiency improvement to process optimization, food‐waste reduction, trade‐pattern change, and diet‐structure change, both individually and in an integrated framework. The results showed that 63% of tomato loss and waste occurred at the processing and consumption stages (over half in Italy and Spain), and 54% of GHG emissions were from production (notably greenhouse based). Although the reduction of tomato products consumption (considered as the substitution by other vegetables) presented the highest potential of emissions reduction, reducing retailing and consumption waste were found to have great effect on GHG emissions reduction as well for all EU member states, especially for United Kingdom and Germany. The combined effects of different mitigation strategies with high levels of change could reduce GHG emissions by 39% compared to the current level.</jats:p>",

Through comparative proteomic analysis and transcriptional confirmation, we identified five potential ABC transporters (Pdr5p, Pdr10p, Snq2p, Yor1p, and Yol075cp) for β-carotene efflux. The accumulation of β-carotene also affects cell physiology in various aspects, including energy metabolism, mitochondrial translation, lipid metabolism, ergosterol biosynthetic process, and cell wall synthesis. Here, we adopted an inducible GAL promoter to overexpress candidate transporters and enhanced the secretion and intracellular production of β-carotene, in which Snq2p showed the best performance (a 4.04-fold and a 1.33-fold increase compared with its parental strain YBX-01, respectively). To further promote efflux capacity, two strategies of increasing ATP supply and improving membrane fluidity were following adopted. A 5.80-fold increase of β-carotene secretion and a 1.71-fold increase of the intracellular β-carotene production were consequently achieved in the engineered strain YBX-20 compared with the parental strain YBX-01.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Overall, our results showcase that engineering endogenous plasma membrane ABC transporters is a promising approach for hydrophobic product efflux in <jats:italic>S. cerevisiae</jats:italic>.

Reductions in social care supply may also have impacted demand for NHS services, particularly for those whose care is provided at the interface of the health and care systems. We analyzed a panel dataset of 150 local authorities (councils) to test potential impacts on hospital utilization by people aged 65 and over: emergency admission rates for falls and hip fractures (“front‐door” measures); and extended stays of 7 days or longer; and 21 days or longer (“back‐door” measures). Changes in social care supply were assessed in two ways: gross current expenditure (per capita 65 and over) adjusted by local labor costs and social care workforce (per capita 18 and over). We ran negative binomial models, controlling for deprivation, ethnicity, age, unpaid care, council class, and year effects. To account for potential endogeneity, we ran instrumental variable regressions and dynamic panel models. Sensitivity analysis explored potential effects of funding for integrated care (the Better Care Fund). There was no consistent evidence that councils with higher per capita spend or higher social care staffing rates had lower hospital admission rates or shorter hospital stays.</jats:p>",

Our study developed a methodology for optimizing sampling for monitoring multiple chemicals along the dairy supply chain. We used a mixed integer nonlinear programming approach to maximize the performance of the sampling in terms of reducing the risk of the potential disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in the population. Decision variables are the number of samples collected and analyzed at each stage of the food chain (feed mills, dairy farms, milk trucks, and dairy processing plants) for each chemical, given a predefined budget. The model was applied to the case of monitoring for aflatoxin B<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>/M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>(AFB<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>/M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and dioxins in a hypothetical Dutch dairy supply chain, and results were calculated for various contamination scenarios defined in terms of contamination fraction and concentrations. Considering various monitoring budgets for both chemicals, monitoring for AFB<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>/M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> showed to be more effective than for dioxins in most of the considered scenarios, because AFB<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>/M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> could result into more DALYs than dioxins when both chemicals are in same contamination fraction, and costs for analyzing one AFB<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>/M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> sample are lower than for one dioxins sample. The results suggest that relatively more resources be spent on monitoring AFB<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>/M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> when both chemicals’ contamination fractions are low; when both contamination fractions are higher, relatively more budget should be addressed to monitoring dioxins.</jats:p>",

We establish a three-dimensional discrete dynamic model with time delay. Firstly, the sufficient conditions for Neimark–Sacker bifurcation are obtained by using different combinations of decision delay periods as bifurcation parameters, and the effect of the adjustment speeds of decision variables on the system stability and impact of time delay on the system stability are discussed, respectively. Secondly, we perform numerical simulation of this model from the perspective of entropy theory. Finally, we propose two methods to control chaos. Results show that when the time delay or the adjustment speed of decision variable exceed a certain threshold, the system will be led into a chaotic state and the entropy of the system will increase. For alleviating the negative effects of chaotic systems, we introduce control parameters to make efficient control on the chaos. At the critical point, the critical value of the adjustment speed of design effort level (or marketing level) of OEM increases as the adjustment speed of the manufacturing effort level of CM decreases, and vice versa.</jats:p>",

We demonstrated in a first step that a poly‐<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>‐lysine coating improved the mechanical stability, without altering the metabolic activities necessary for bioartificial liver applications (such as ammonia and lactate elimination). In a second step, we tested the optimized biomass in a newly designed perfused dynamic bioreactor, in the presence of the medium model for pathological plasma for 6 h. Performances of the biomass were enhanced as compared to the steady configuration, demonstrating its efficacy in decreasing the typical toxins of ALF. This type of bioreactor is easy to scale up as it relies on the number of micro‐encapsulated cells, and could provide an adequate hepatic biomass for liver supply. Its design allows it to be integrated into a hybrid artificial/bioartificial liver setup for further clinical studies regarding its impact on ALF animal models.</jats:p>",

In addition, high efficiency of the HS system is a factor that can ensure the preservation of its vital functions.  Solving the problem of increasing the energy efficiency of the heat supply system is a complex problem that requires changes at all stages of heat transformation: in the energy source, heating networks and subscriber heating systems of heat consumers.  The purpose of this study is to identify the impact of heat dissipation control processes in district heating systems on their energy and economic efficiency, provide recommendations for improving control processes taking into account modern challenges and regulatory requirements, analyze heat dissipation temperature schedules and select the optimal temperature schedule.  It is shown that the optimal is the combined quantitative and qualitative regulation of heat release, which should be carried out both at the energy source and at consumers. The paper considers the possibility of using combined control systems in the existing district heating systems of Ukrainian cities. It is shown that the achievement of high energy efficiency is possible only with the introduction of automatic individual heating points with weather control and pressure drop regulators at the inlet to the buildings in the subscriber heating systems. Calculations of the amount of heat consumption reduction of centralized heat supply systems with the introduction of optimal control systems are performed.</jats:p>",

While many muscle cell types (myofibres, satellite cells, endothelial cells, macrophages and fibroblasts) express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), most muscle VEGF is stored in myofibre vesicles which can release VEGF to signal VEGF receptor‐expressing cells. VEGF gene ablation in myofibres or endothelial cells alone does not cause capillary regression. We hypothesized that simultaneously deleting the endothelial cell (EC) and skeletal myofibre (Skm) VEGF gene would cause capillary regression and impair exercise performance. This was tested in adult mice by simultaneous conditional deletion of the VEGF gene (Skm/EC‐VEGF<jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup> mice) through the use of VEGF<jats:italic>LoxP</jats:italic>, HSA‐Cre‐ER<jats:sup>T2</jats:sup> and PDGFb‐iCre‐ER<jats:sup>T2</jats:sup> transgenes. These double‐deletion mice were compared to three control groups – WT, EC VEGF gene deletion alone and myofibre VEGF gene deletion alone. Three weeks after initiating gene deletion, Skm/EC‐VEGF<jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup> mice, but not SkmVEGF<jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup> or EC‐VEGF<jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup> mice, reached exhaustion 40 min sooner than WT mice in treadmill tests (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.002). WT, SkmVEGF<jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup> and EC‐VEGF<jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>, but not Skm/EC‐VEGF<jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>, mice gained weight over the 3 weeks. Capillary density, fibre area and capillary: fibre ratio in soleus, plantaris, gastrocnemius and cardiac papillary muscle were similar across the groups. Phosphofructokinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities increased only in Skm/EC‐VEGF<jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup> mice. These data suggest that deletion of the VEGF gene simultaneously in endothelial cells and myofibres, while reducing treadmill endurance and despite compensatory augmentation of glycolysis, is not required for muscle capillary maintenance. Reduced endurance remains unexplained, but may possibly be related to a role for VEGF in controlling perfusion of contracting muscle.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In the case of water pipelines, the priority pipes are selected through preliminary evaluation for a detailed evaluation. However, as the preliminary seismic performance evaluation method for existing water pipes solely focuses on their installation year and structural evaluation, it does not reflect the hydraulic characteristics of the water supply, which is the main purpose of water pipes. Therefore, this study proposed an evaluation method for the existing preliminary evaluation judgment index, by considering the calculation method for the probability of spatial failure, as well as the index obtained through hydraulic analysis results. The proposed methodology was applied to a domestic regional water supply system to be verified, and the results were analyzed. The proposed method is expected to serve as a result of basic research to enhance the seismic performance evaluation method in the future.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to investigate the composition of soil P fractions under different phosphorus apparent balances (PAB) in acidic red soil and the bioavailability and the leaching change-points of different P fractions. Five phosphorus (P) fertilization rates were applied (0, 16.38, 32.75, 65.50, 131.00 kg P·ha−1) in every sweet corn cultivation from the field experiment, and the treatments were marked as P0, P1, P2, P3, and P4, respectively. The PAB showed negative values in P0 and P1 which were −49.0 and −15.0 kg P·ha–1 in two years, respectively. In contrast, PAB in P2 as well as in P3 and P4 were positive, the content ranging from 40.2 to 424.3 kg P·ha−1 in two years. Per 100 kg ha−1 P accumulate in the soil, the total P increased by 44.36 and 10.41 mg kg−1 in the surface (0–20 cm) and subsurface (20–40 cm) soil, respectively. The content of inorganic P fractions, including solution phosphate (Sol-P), aluminum phosphate (Al-P), iron phosphate (Fe-P), reduction phosphate (Red-P), and calcium phosphate (Ca-P), significantly increased by 0.25, 16.22, 22.08, 2.04, and 5.08 mg kg−1, respectively, in surface soil per 100 kg ha−1 P accumulated in the soil. Path analysis showed that the most important soil P fractions contributing to Olsen-P were Sol-P and Al-P, which can directly affect Olsen-P, and their coefficients were 0.24 and 0.73, respectively. Furthermore, the incubation experiments were conducted in the laboratory to investigate the leaching risk of different P fractions, and they showed Sol-P was a potential source of leaching, and the leaching change-points of Al-P and Fe-P were 74.70 and 78.34 mg·kg–1, respectively. Continuous P that accumulated in soil changed the composition of P fractions, and the bioavailability as well as the leaching risks increased. This is important in optimizing soil P fertilization management in agricultural ecosystems based on the bioavailability and critical levels for leaching of P fractions.</jats:p>"

The network capacity model is formulated as a bilevel programming problem, with the maximization of total trip generation in the upper level and the combined trip distribution and traffic assignment (CTDTA) problem in the lower level. To reasonably characterize the impacts of the parking pricing and parking delay due to the congestion effect, two classes of travel demand are involved in the CTDTA model. An efficient and practical algorithm is provided for the solution of the bilevel network capacity model.

Subsequently, we conduct comparative and sensitivity analyses for these optimal decisions and profits of the APSC members under different cases. Numerical experiment is employed to investigate the impact of key parameters on equilibrium decisions and profitability. Analytical and experimental results show that the cost-sharing contract of greenness investment for agricultural products helps to strengthen the supply chain members’ effort in improving the greenness and freshness levels of the agricultural product, thereby enhancing both individual and channel profitability of the APSC under certain conditions. This research also reveals a widened profit gap between the producer and the retailer under the cost-sharing contract.</jats:p>",

The change in soil characteristics and the growth of a crop fertilised with algae or WAS was compared with a conventional inorganic fertiliser. Swiss chard plants (Beta vulgaris) fertilised with anaerobically digested (AD) algae or WAS had a significantly higher mean biweekly yield (5.08 ± 0.73 kg/m2) when compared with the inorganic fertiliser control (3.45 ± 0.89 kg/m2; p &amp;lt; 0.0001). No difference was observed in the soil's physical fertility when algae or WAS were applied to the soil (p &amp;gt; 0.05). The nitrogen applied to the soil from algae and WAS biomass appeared to leach out of the soil less than the nitrogen supplied by inorganic fertilisers. The application of WAS or algae on soil increased the soil's sodium concentration and sodium absorption ratio from 774.80 ± 13.66 mg/kg to 952.17 ± 34.89 mg/kg and 2.91 ± 0.04 to 3.53 ± 0.13, respectively.

The prepared samples were tested as sorbents for cadmium in an aqueous medium. The best performances were obtained with the material treated at 200 °C (HAp200), as the relevant sorbent textural features (SBET – specific surface area and Vp – total volume of pores) were least affected at this low calcination temperature. The maximum adsorption capacity at standard ambient temperature and pressure was 216.6 mg g−1, which increased to 240.7 mg g−1 by increasing the temperature from 25 to 40 °C, suggesting an endothermic nature of the adsorption process. Moreover, these data indicated that a thermal treatment at 200 °C enhanced the ability of the material in Cd2+ uptake by more than 100% compared to other similar studies. The adsorption kinetic process was better described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin–Kaganer–Radushkevich isotherms were applied to describe the sorption behaviour of Cd2+ ions onto the best adsorbent. Furthermore, a thermodynamic study was also performed to determine ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔG° of the sorption process of this adsorbent. The adsorption mechanisms were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy-transmission electron microscopy (SEM-TEM) observations.</jats:p>",

A key challenge for such companies is demonstrating that their efforts are leading to meaningful progress toward their climate mitigation commitments.

Furthermore, we present a generalized environmental model that will allow food‐supply‐chain companies to translate aggregated and anonymized changes in average N balance across their supplying farms into aggregated changes in N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions. This research is an important first step, based on currently available science, in helping companies demonstrate the impact of their sustainability efforts.</jats:p>",

Besonders dramatisch ist dies für die Arbeiter:innen am Anfang der Wertschöpfungskette. Die Verletzungen international anerkannter sozialer und ökonomischer Rechte in globalen Lieferketten sind heute massiver als vor der Krise und offenbaren ein weitreichendes Konfliktpotenzial. Der Beitrag verdeutlicht diese Situation beispielhaft für Brasilien und Indien und problematisiert auf dieser Grundlage globale Lieferketten als Thema der Friedens- und Konfliktforschung. Lieferketten sind Räume politischer Auseinandersetzungen um materielle und ideologische Bedingungen der Produktion, die durch eine Vielzahl institutioneller Kontexte und Akteure mitgestaltet werden. Ein umkämpfter Gegenstand ist dabei der mangelnde Arbeits- und Menschenrechtsschutz. Der dominante Weg zur Adressierung dieses Mangels sind die Institutionen und Praktiken der transnationalen privaten Governance durch Standards, Zertifizierung, Monitoring und Audits. In der Pandemie offenbaren diese ohnehin lückenhaften Ansätze, dass sie gerade in Krisenzeiten ungeeignet sind, um grundlegende Arbeits- und Menschenrechte zu sichern und bestehende Konflikte zu befrieden. Der Beitrag betont abschließend die Verbindung zwischen globalen Lieferketten und lokalen Konflikten und plädiert für eine Forschungsagenda zu „Lieferketten und Konflikt“.</jats:p>",

However, the evolution of shelf mud in response to climate change during the Holocene is poorly understood. Here, we present high‐resolution sedimentary records of heavy minerals and mass accumulation rates (MARs) from the East China Sea shelf to study the response mechanisms of the Holocene shelf mud supply, transport, and sedimentation to the climate‐driven variations in fluvial discharge and ocean currents. The results indicate that the shelf mud primarily originates from the Changjiang (Yangtze) River and has been mainly transported by wind‐driven longshore currents in suspension since approximately 8.0 ka. A comparison of the MARs with several shelf mud sedimentation‐rate records and climate changes during the Holocene on millennial timescales showed that strong (weak) precipitation in the river basin, which is positively linked with Asian summer monsoon and El Niño‐driven storms, could intensify (weaken) the fluvial sediment supply, thereby increasing (decreasing) the shelf mud deposition flux. On multicentennial timescales, changes in the relative intensities of different ocean currents due to climate oscillations during the Holocene could generate frequent migrations of the current shear front (a hydrodynamic barrier), which has trapped an abundance of suspended materials on the shoreward side and resulted in rapid mud sedimentation (~2.3 g/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/year) at different sites during different periods. Therefore, our study highlights that the Holocene shelf mud evolution responds sensitively to climate changes on different timescales.</jats:p>",

In today’s complex markets, the susceptibility of the supply chain is viewed as an ongoing issue for several industries and it is no different for fashion designers. As a result, in the past, the visibility of South African fashion designers in the retail environment appeared to be minimal, due to a number of challenges.  This paper is based on qualitative research that made use of in-depth semi-structured interviews with a total of twenty-four participants, with the sample divided into five groups representing different industry professionals. Semi-structured interviews allowed the participants to answer the questions unreservedly based on their own personal and professional experiences. The findings revealed that South African fashion designers in the retail industry experienced a number of supply chain challenges such as cash flow and funding, fabric, challenges associated with cutting, making and trimming (CMT) companies, skills and knowledge, fashion designer’s business acumen, market access and location, human skilled resources, garment and production quality, fragmentation, costing, marketing, competition, and other isolated challenges that were mentioned by a few participants.  The practical implications of this paper include the need for responsible stakeholders to put in place mechanisms to reduce the supply-chain-management challenges South African fashion designers are facing in the retail clothing industry. As a result, close proximity supply chain networks that could support effective communication amongst members of the supply chain are recommended.</jats:p>",

With regard to the preferences of consumers for different channels and carbon cap-and-trade mechanisms, profit-maximization models are developed on supply chain members and systems in decentralized and centralized cases. Based on a backward induction, the corresponding formulae for decision variables are obtained. Then the effect of the industry emission control coefficient is analyzed and the optimal decisions of two cases are compared. Finally, the coordination mechanism and numerical analysis are presented. The result indicates that: (1) As the free carbon allowances granted by the government to the manufacturer increases, the investment in carbon reduction from the manufacturer will increase. As the industry emission control coefficient increases, the carbon emissions per product and the prices of new and remanufactured products will decrease, while the demands of the new and remanufactured products and the profits of supply chain members and systems will increase. (2) As the direct sale channel preference coefficient increases, the profits of the manufacturer and the system will increase while the retailer’s profit will decrease. Correspondingly, the carbon emissions of unit product will decrease, and the sales of the direct sale channel will increase while the sales of the retail channel will decrease. (3) The decision in the coordinated case not only ensures emission reduction and system profit to reach the level of the centralized case, but also raises the profits of supply chain members in the decentralized case. Therefore, it is preferable to other decisions. (4) As the carbon trading price increases, the emission reduction investment from the manufacturer will increase while the profits of the supply chain and its members will increase.</jats:p>"

The form and concentration of arsenic in the anodic cell and cathodic cell were detected. Experimental results proved that at 40.0 V, As(III) in an acid electrolyte in the cathodic cell was firstly mainly reduced to AsH3 with trace As(0) as intermediate. As the electrolysis time arrived at 27 min, pH in the cathodic cell jumped suddenly from acidity to alkalinity, accompanied by the majority of the remaining As(III) converting to As(V) for an instant. As time went on, As(III) and As(V) remained almost unchanged at the ratio of 1:3, and the reduction of As(III) became extremely weak in the alkaline environment. When pH in the cathodic tank was adjusted to keep it acid, As(III) was eventually converted to AsH3. Compared with high voltage, at a low voltage of 1.0 V the cathode failed to achieve the potential of As(III) reduction and As(III) was eventually oxidized to As(V) in the acid catholyte. Electrochemical oxidation of As(III) in the open cathodic cell was likely caused by in-situ generation of peroxide from electrochemical reduction of O2. Theoretical support for electrochemical oxidation of As(III) on a carbon cathode in neutral and weak alkaline media is provided in this study.</jats:p>",

The structure of the developed model of an integrated power supply system contains four types of agents and connections between them. An experiment has been conducted on the basis of the developed model, in which the optimal solution was found for energy supply of consumers. The results of the conducted computational experiment show that the specified conditions and restrictions are met; messages and parameters are correctly transmitted between the agents and the agents perform the assigned functions in the system. The results obtained will allow to model real power supply systems of any complexity in order to study the properties and improve the efficiency of these systems.

Phototransformation is an important process to remove chlorothalonil from the aquatic environment. The mesoporous ammonium phosphotungstate/silica catalyst (NH4PW/SiO2) was synthesized from cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as raw materials by adding insoluble ammonium phosphotungstate into the alkaline alcohol–water system by the sol-gel method. The structure of NH4PW/SiO2 was characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The photocatalytic activity of NH4PW/SiO2 was evaluated by using the organic pesticide chlorothalonil as a model reactant. The result indicated that when the dosage of NH4PW/SiO2 is 0.02 g, the illumination is 180 min, the concentration of chlorothalonil is 5 mg/L, pH = 5, the degradation effect is better, and the degradation rate reaches 83.23%. The results contributed to the understanding of chlorothalonil phototransformation and the potential of mesoporous SiO2 to effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity of NH4PW (64.16%) to reduce aquatic toxicity and pollution by chlorothalonil.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to determine the number of patients with COVID-19 who required intensive care and to compare the numbers with Japan’s intensive care capacity. Materials and Methods: Publicly available datasets were used to obtain the number of confirmed patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) between 15 February and 19 July 2020 to determine and compare intensive care unit (ICU) and attending bed needs for patients with COVID-19, and to estimate peak ICU demands in Japan. Results: During the epidemic peak in late April, 11,443 patients (1.03/10,000 adults) had been infected, 373 patients (0.034/10,000 adults) were in ICU, 312 patients (0.028/10,000 adults) were receiving mechanical ventilation, and 62 patients (0.0056/10,000 adults) were under ECMO per day. At the peak of the epidemic, the number of infected patients was 651% of designated beds, and the number of patients requiring intensive care was 6.0% of ICU beds, 19.1% of board-certified intensivists, and 106% of designated medical institutions in Japan. Conclusions: The number of critically ill patients with COVID-19 continued to rise during the pandemic, exceeding the number of designated beds but not exceeding ICU capacity.</jats:p>"

In this study, nitrogen gas plasma was further evaluated for its potential effects on prions, which are well known to be the most resistant pathogen to both chemical and physical inactivation. Aliquots (10 μL) of mouse brain homogenate infected with Chandler scrapie prion were spotted onto cover glasses and subjected to nitrogen gas plasma. Treated samples were recovered and subjected to further analyses. Control prion samples were prepared in exactly the same way but without plasma treatment. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) showed that nitrogen gas plasma treatment at 1.5 kilo pulse per second for 15 or 30 min caused a reduction in the in vitro propagation level of PrPres (proteinase K-resistant prion protein), which was used as an index of abnormal prion protein (PrPSc). Moreover, mice injected with prion treated with plasma for 30 min showed longer survival than mice injected with control prion, indicating that nitrogen gas plasma treatment decreased prion infectivity. Altogether, these results suggest that nitrogen gas plasma treatment can inactivate scrapie prions by decreasing the propagation activity and infectivity of PrPSc.</jats:p>"

In recent years, a number of reports have demonstrated the effective delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 machinery via zygote electroporation as an alternative to the conventional delivery method of microinjection. In this study, we have performed side-by-side comparisons of the two RNP delivery methods across multiple gene loci and conclude that electroporation compares very favourably with conventional pronuclear microinjection, and report an improvement in mutagenesis efficiency when delivering CRISPR via electroporation for the generation of simple knock-in alleles using single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) repair templates. In addition, we show that the efficiency of knock-in mutagenesis can be further increased by electroporation of embryos derived from Cas9-expressing donor females. The maternal supply of Cas9 to the zygote avoids the necessity to deliver the relatively large Cas9 protein, and high efficiency generation of both indel and knock-in allele can be achieved by electroporation of small single-guide RNAs and ssODN repair templates alone. Furthermore, electroporation, compared to microinjection, results in a higher rate of embryo survival and development. The method thus has the potential to reduce the number of animals used in the production of genetically modified mouse models.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the nexus of three key factors that have a significant impact on the decision-making process of the rehabilitation plan for WDSs. The factors considered include the problem formulations, the pipe selection methods for identifying critical components of WDSs, and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). The nexus was revealed by considering all the combinations of two variants for each factor. The optimal rehabilitation problem of the Exeter network was used as a case study. Results exhibit that the problem formulation determined the range of Pareto fronts essentially, which should give the highest priority in the decision-making process. The pipe selection method played a secondary role, mainly affecting the shape of Pareto fronts. Optimization algorithms also had a considerable impact on the optimality of solutions, subject to their characteristics and parameter settings. This paper also highlights that breakthroughs need to focus on these key factors to facilitate a more cost-effective solution to the rehabilitation of large WDSs.</jats:p>",

These cost-related risks interact with each other along with the project progress and involve different stakeholders, forming a stakeholder-cost risk network. Previous studies have discussed the stakeholder-cost risk network; however, few studies have considered its dynamic characteristics. Different from traditional methods, this study employed the social network analysis (SNA) to explore the key indicators of cost-related risks within the supply chain and identify the key risks and stakeholders across four project stages: the planning start-up stage, design preparation stage, construction period, and operations and maintenance period. From a horizontal point of view (i.e., network development process), the complexity of the stakeholder-cost risk network demonstrates a U-shaped development process during the project life cycle, ranging from simple to complex to simple. From a vertical point of view (i.e., network hierarchical characteristics), the important cost-based risks are diversified within each stage. The current study contributes to forming a better understanding of the stakeholder-cost risk network from a dynamic perspective as well as the crucial cost-based risks within each stage of the project. The findings provide implications for managers to better align cost-based risk intervention strategies, thereby facilitating the achievement of construction project success.</jats:p>",

An evaluation index system is established for Dari County based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) conceptual framework. Combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with the cloud model, an ecological environment evaluation model for Dari County is established, and the ecological environment of Dari County is quantitatively evaluated. The model organically combines the ambiguity and randomness of the uncertainty concept. It not only describes the ambiguity of the evaluation level with a membership function, but also considers the randomness of the membership itself using the concept of superentropy, which is more in line with the actual evaluation object. The results indicate that the ecological situation of Dari County is in a ‘general’ state that should be urgently protected for sustainable development, and land degradation is the most important factor affecting the ecological environment of Dari County.</jats:p>",

This paper put forward the evaluation method of rain–flood utilization availability at the distributed watershed scale. Based on the water node, some indices of rain–flood utilization availability were defined. Then the evaluation method and calculation process were unified. Finally, the status and potential of the rain–flood utilization of Hanjiang River Basin were analyzed. The results indicated that the rain–flood resource in the whole basin is 48.9 billion m3, the outflow is 29.9 billion m3, and the actual utilization is about 19.0 billion m3. The current available rain–flood amount and rain–flood utilization potential are 27.7 billion m3 and 11.0 billion m3, and the rain–flood utilization rate is 49.4%. Limited by regulation ability and the rain–flood resources, current rain–flood utilization has a clear threshold range. The potential utilization objects are mainly for a rainfall process of about two to ten years return period. The application in Hanjiang River Basin offers some practical information for assessing rain–flood utilization scientifically, and the premise for effectively guiding and formulating adaptive countermeasures for water resources management.</jats:p>",

The results of CA showed that the months can be divided into the following groups based on the similarities in the water quality characteristics: group 1 (dry season), January-April and December; group 2 (flood season), August-September; and group 3 (flat season), May-July and October-November. In group 1 the river is remarkably polluted. The main parameters that distinguish the spatial differences are pH level, chemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a, fecal coliforms, and electrical conductivity. All sections of the river meet the National Level III standard, and the water quality of the Jinsha River is generally good. Spatial results show that the Luoguo station is seriously polluted compared with the other two stations. Significant negative correlation is found between forest land and COD (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Therefore, the management of land use and pollutant discharge should still be strengthened in the Luoguo section to improve the overall water quality of the Jinsha River.</jats:p>",

In this study, six conceptual models were applied in three semi-humid or semi-arid catchments to investigate the correlation between catchment characteristics and model structure selection. In addition, the impacts of precipitation and topography in model simulation were analyzed. The results show that runoff generation are highly impacted by catchment topographic index and land cover change, and the influence of slope for river channel is greater than mean slope for the whole catchment due to the runoff generation for partial area. For the catchments under similar climate condition, the impact of topographic features for runoff generation process is greater than the difference of precipitation. It indicates that for a specific catchment, the selection of appropriate model should base on better understanding of the rainfall-runoff relationship.

Study of Malawi’s Lake Chilwa Basin, including sampling of 330 water points in Phalombe District, enabled assessment of groundwater quality influence upon supply. The control of larger Lake Chilwa paleo-environments on current Basin groundwater quality is demonstrated. Lacustrine sediment deposition forming high-level deposits under open lake conditions and terrace deposits under open and closed lake conditions significantly control the groundwater major-ion quality and salinity now observed. Paleo-lake extent marks the transition between low-TDS (total dissolved solids) groundwater suitable for water supply at higher elevations and high-TDS brackish groundwater in areas overlain by lacustrine deposits closer to the current lake level. Low-TDS groundwater is limited to mid-to-low reach influent leakage of rivers incising terraces. Permeable fluvial deposits within the deeper paleo-river channel may possibly provide low-TDS water. The conceptual model, whereby paleo-lake controls groundwater salinity, provides science-based evidence to address policy to manage the significant water point functionality concerns quantified at the district and river basin scales. Targeting of the low-TDS groundwater alongside improved use of upland low-TDS stream/river sources with fewer, but larger capacity, and better maintained gravity-fed supply schemes are recommended. This study hence shows the value of paleo-geohydrology interpretation of the lake–groundwater system conceptualisation to inform Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6.5.1)—integrated water resources management policy for rural water supply.</jats:p>"

Based on the assumption that the decision-maker does not make a decision instantaneously, we present a decision-making time-delay model. Firstly, we captured some sufficient conditions of delay-induced bifurcation for the model by regarding different combinations of the decision delay periods as the bifurcation parameters and analyzed how the speed of decision-making adjustment of distributor or retailer affects the critical point of system stability. Secondly, we made a numerical simulation on the model by using a two-dimensional bifurcation diagram, largest Lyapunov exponent, and entropy and chaotic attractor, respectively. Finally, we used two coordination methods to control chaos and compared them. The results show that when the decision delay exceeds a certain threshold, the system will lose stability or go into chaos. The precipitous speed of decision variable adjustment of the distributor or retailer will increase the entropy of the system and lead the system into a chaotic state. When the vaccine supply chain is in chaos, the effect of external control on chaos is better than that of internal control on chaos.</jats:p>",

In this sense, this study aimed at evaluating the effect of decreasing the hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the stability and efficiency of a hybrid anaerobic biofilm baffled reactor (HABBR) treating simulated fat- and salt-rich dairy wastewater, followed by its agricultural reuse. The reactor was monitored over 328 days, during which 72, 24, and 12 h were the hydraulic detention times. After achieving steady-state, the reactor presented organic matter removal greater than 90% and produced biogas with 41 ± 23%, 53 ± 3%, and 64 ± 12% of methane for HRTs of 72, 24, and 12 h, respectively. The best process performance was observed for an HRT of 24 h, and thus, a lettuce culture was irrigated with the treated effluent. The irrigation was performed in five different treatments, for which the amount of treated effluent added to tap water varied from 0 to 100%. Both the effluent and the harvested vegetables were evaluated for microbial contamination. Apart from the 75% effluent supply condition, there were no losses in leaf mass or area observed; instead, there was an increase of these parameters for the 25% and 50% effluent supply treatment. The use of dairy effluent treated by the HABBR allowed for microbiologically safe food production. Therefore, the process offered both potential cost reduction for fertilizers, preservation of water resources, and a renewable energy source.</jats:p>",

Research shows that the government subsidy mechanism directly affects the profit of the port and shipping service supply chain, which is the key factor in implementing the ECA’s policy and promoting the emission reduction of the port and shipping enterprises. The revenue sharing of the port and shipping enterprises plays a decisive role in the revenue of the shipping enterprises. Cooperative emission reduction mechanism should be led by port enterprises to promote the balance between revenue and emission reduction in the supply chain system. Results provide a reference for the Chinese government to formulate corresponding incentives and subsidy policy under the new ECA’s regulations as well as solving the problems of how to balance emissions reduction and cost improvement for port and shipping enterprises.</jats:p>",

The relative demand for renewable energy compared to traditional energy is an important index to determine the energy supply structure.

Data mining methods like decision trees are quite effective in such time series forecasting, but theory behind them is rarely discussed in research. In this paper, some theories are explored about decision trees including the behavior of bias, variance, and squared prediction error using trees and the prediction interval analysis. After that, real UK grid data are used in interval forecasting application. In the renewable energy ratio forecasting application, the ratio of renewable energy supply over that of traditional energy can be dynamically forecasted with an interval coverage accuracy higher than 80% and a small width around 22, which is similar to its standard deviation.</jats:p>",

In order to understand the present water quality of the Diaohe River section of the route, four samplings were conducted at Diaohe Aqueduct in the winter of 2018. The main results of this study are as follows: 62 species (or variants) of phytoplankton belonging to 32 genera, 22 families and six phyla were identified during the study period, among which Bacillariophyta are the most dominant species. The identified phytoplankton fall into eight indicator grades: os; ps, αm; ps, αm, βm; αm; αm, βm; αm, βm, os; βm; and βm, os. A total of 17 functional groups are detected, among which TB is the absolute dominant functional group. Based on the composition characteristics of phytoplankton, the water quality trophic state of Diaohe Aqueduct is mesotrophic. However, other physical indexes show that the water quality of the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project is good. The conclusions drawn using phytoplankton alone as the evaluation index may not be comprehensive. In future research, how to build a comprehensive index system combining other water quality indexes for the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project needs yet to be improved and tested.</jats:p>",

Based on an improved analysis of the principle components of the network and statements of a self-organizing neural network, this article proposes the method to evaluate the operating state of medium- and low-voltage distribution networks. At the first step, the system of evaluating indices of the network is formed by advanced component analysis. The evaluation system is grounded on four aspects, including safety, reliability, quality and economy. Next, the self-organizing neural network is used to identify and clean up the data regarding the operating state of the distribution network. At the next step, the indicators are modeled at all levels; the entropy method is applied to calculate the total weight of all indicators. Then the value of each indicator is found and the weak links of the distribution network are determined. At the final stage, the comprehensive assessment of the real operation of the distribution network in Guangxi province is carried out. As shown, the method can effectively reduce the effect of abnormal data and subjectivity factor on the results of evaluating the state of the distribution network. That confirms the feasibility and practicability of the proposed method. References 22, figures 6, tables 6.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The price risk of fresh agricultural products has been a significant topic in recent years. Taking the two-level fresh agricultural product supply chain as the research object, this paper studies the optimal ordering and coordination of supply chain based on two-period price, wholesale price and option contract. The optimal order decision of the retailer at the single period price and the optimal decision corresponding to the supplier are obtained when the output of the supplier is uncertain under decentralized decision-making. The range of penalty cost parameter that avoids supplier default is also obtained. The effect of two-period price on the optimal order decision and supply chain profits is discussed when the production yield of the supplier is fixed. Cost-sharing contract is introduced to increase the order quantity and achieve coordination because the option contract cannot completely make the supply chain coordination with two-period price. This paper provides a low-cost approach that can be applied in fresh agricultural supply chain to solve financing and order problems. </jats:p>",

Differences in plantation activities and environments create a unique sustainability profile for each oil crop that may impose more sustainability issues such as deforestation problems in oil palm plantations. This paper embraced the unique sustainability index profile of each oil crop, and an investigation was performed to evaluate the feasibility of integrating multiple oil crops into the existing biodiesel refinery to improve its economic and sustainability performances. The selection of the process feed is proposed to be based on oil crop properties such as iodine value, peroxide value and saturated and unsaturated fatty acid contents. The sustainability profiles considered in the study include deforestation, oil yield, fertiliser impact, water impact and carbon footprint. Case studies demonstrated that a more balanced sustainability index profile could be achieved at a higher production cost—from USD 6.43 billion·y−1 in a cost-saving-centric solution to USD 39.90 billion·y−1 in a sustainability-improvement-centric solution. The study provided excellent insight into the impact on production cost to achieve sustainability which can help stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility of integrating multiple oil crops in the system.</jats:p>"

Fifty sampling points were set up in the studied area. The fluoride was tested by the ion-selective electrode method. The health risk model recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency was used. Based on the Chinese population, human health risk assessment was performed for fluoride in shallow groundwater in the studied area, and the Kriging interpolation method was used to simulate the spatial distribution of fluoride concentration in the area. The research showed the following. (1) The concentration of fluoride in the shallow groundwater samples in the studied area was 0.06–0.78 mg/L, with an average value of 0.35 mg/L, which was in line with the limit value (1.00 mg/L) in the standards for drinking water quality (GB 5749–2006), but its maximum value was 0.78 mg/L, which was 1.86 times of the background value. (2) The average hazard index of children and adults were 0.27 and 0.15, respectively, which were less than 1, and the risk was at an acceptable level; the noncarcinogenic risk of children was 1.8 times that of adults; the average values of total risk quotient for groundwater fluoride intake by children and adults were 0.27 and 0.15, respectively, and 1.19E-03 and 7.26E-04 by skin, respectively. This indicated that of the two routes, oral intake was the main route of exposure to fluoride. The noncarcinogenic risk values of fluoride in rural and urban areas were similar, and both were less than 1. (3) The high-value areas of fluoride were mainly concentrated in the southeast of the area, which was mainly affected by the superposition of natural factors and industrial park sewage discharge. Through human health risk assessment and spatial distribution of fluoride in regional groundwater, it can provide a theoretical basis for regional groundwater pollution prevention.</jats:p>",

In recent years, the application of HWTS has shown a growing trend, and its performance in controlling chemicals has also received much attention. Disinfection by-products (DBPs) are formed by the reaction of chemical disinfectants and precursors, and are present at sub-μg·L−1 or low-to-mid-μg·L−1 levels in drinking water. Although precursor control and disinfection operation modification could contribute to DBP mitigation to some degree, DBP removal after their formation emerges as an important strategy due to the ubiquitous existence of DBPs in distribution systems and tap water. In order to figure out how DBP concentrations vary during the residence time of drinking water in households, this review summarizes the effectiveness and mechanism of HWTS and combination technologies for DBP control in municipal tap water, and makes a comparison with regard to technologies implementing different removal mechanisms as well as DBPs possessing different natures. Based on these results, this article provides an insight into DBP risk assessment and human health protection.</jats:p>",

The theoretical substantiation of reliability estimation of functioning of transport systems using logical structural schemes of reliability is given and it is revealed that their construction is based on the analysis of consequences of failures of individual elements. Properties of elements and systems for their working and inoperable states are highlighted. The formulas for calculating the probability of failure-free operation and failure of the chain or the transport system as a whole, as well as their time to failure. The dependence of the probability of failure-free operation of the transport system on the level of probability and the number of its elements is shown. Cases of serial and parallel connection of elements in the transport system chain are considered. Methods of calculation of structural reliability schemes are presented and formulas are used for estimating the probability of trouble-free operation of technical and transport systems, as well as the probability of their failures. Dependencies of reliability indicators on number of elements are constructed. It shows the reliability estimation of bridged structural diagrams using the methods of minimum paths, minimum cross sections, transformation of the connection of elements \"triangle\" - \"asterisk\", a key element. It is found that complex technical and transport systems have a large number of elements, and therefore the reliability of such systems depends not only on the reliability of the individual elements, but also on the nature of the connections between them. Carrying out the reliability analysis of transport systems is possible with the help of their structural functional circuits of reliability and unlike physical circuits that reproduce physical connections between elements, logical reliability circuits are built to show what combinations of failures of individual elements of the system lead to failure of a circuit or system in general. Thus, the construction of logical reliability schemes is based on the analysis of the consequences of the causes of failures of individual elements, which can later be used in the development of theoretical bases for improving the reliability of the functioning of road transport systems.</jats:p>",

By quoting the negative utility formula of consumers’ anticipated regret under price discount, it quantitatively describes the demand function of the original product and the discount product. The model under centralized and decentralized decision making is constructed, and revenue-sharing contract is adopted to coordinate the supply chain. The conclusions are as follows. (1) Affected by the anticipated regret under the price discount, the price of the product increases first and then decreases with the regret sensitivity coefficient and consumer heterogeneity sensitivity increases. In addition, the price under the leadership structure of the manufacturer is the highest. (2) Price discounts enhance consumers’ perception of anticipated regret. Under the stimulation of price discounts, the price of products increases first and then decreases. (3) The revenue-sharing contract could not coordinate the supply chain, and the introduction of a profit-sharing mechanism is achieved the Pareto improvement of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Traditional evolutionary game models cannot describe this effect. In this study, Gaussian white noise is introduced into the stochastic evolutionary game model of PPP supply chain knowledge sharing. The numerical simulation of the model is carried out to analyze the influence of parameter changes on the strategy selection of enterprise groups. The result shows that the strong knowledge power enterprise group is more sensitive with the variation of parameters than that of the weak knowledge power enterprise group. However, the weak enterprise group has a more vital willingness to share knowledge. Incentive measures can increase the knowledge-sharing benefits and promote the strong knowledge powerful enterprise group toward the sharing strategy. Increasing the mutual trust coefficient, reducing the sharing cost, and improving the enterprise’s transformation ability will help both sides to evolve into the sharing strategy more quickly. This study would have significance for PPP project performance and industry innovation.</jats:p>",
