An example of this can be seen at Matsushita, a Japanese‐based industry leader who has had to fight to remain competitive in the face of low‐cost Chinese competitors. Faced with declining sales and profits due to cost deficiencies in its supply chain, Matsushita realized that its long‐term success was contingent upon a supply chain realignment. This realignment has included the transfer of many tasks to China. Historically known for its inexpensive land and labor, China is increasingly becoming recognized for its technological expertise and the availability of low‐cost production components. Matsushita’s revamped supply chain is utilizing all of these resources. Through this realignment Matsushita hopes to reverse its recent trend of declining sales and profits; the early results are promising.</jats:p>",

It brings the revolutionary philosophy and approach to manage the business with the sustained competitiveness. However, the existing performance measurement theory fails to provide its necessary support in strategy development, decision making, and performance improvement. This paper attempts to propose an innovative performance measurement method to contribute to the development of supply chain management. A process‐based systematic perspective is employed to build an effective model to measure the holistic performance of complex supply chains. Fuzzy set theory is introduced to address the real situation in judgment and evaluation processes. The main framework of this method is outlined with some suggestions and a simple example.</jats:p>",

In 1993 Océ initiated this project to enable innovation by creating inter‐organizational teams and new combinations based on the knowledge and skills of different suppliers. Based on data collected from 28 interviews with respondents that were involved at both the Océ and supplier side of ten different “knowledge clusters”, it is concluded that the critical success factors primarily point at the importance of creating trust in such inter‐organizational teams.</jats:p>",

The objectives of the present research were to examine the possibility of slow granular filtration (SGF) as advanced treatment of secondary effluents for reuse purposes and examine filter performance under various design regimes. Slow granular filtration runs where made with four different filters at rate of 0.15 m/h. 0.6 mm, 0.25 mm sand or tuff grains or their combination were used. Grain size of 0.25 mm gave low impurities concentration in the effluent but short filtration runs. Double layer bed caused longer filtration run as well as lower impurities concentration in the effluent, Combining the tuff as the top bed layer caused longer filtration run, probably due to the morphologic and chemical properties of the tuff. The water column above the bed plays an important role in the filtration process. Intense microbiologic activity in the column changes the TSS and COD concentration as well as the availability of the biodegradable matter. The dissolved oxygen concentration in the water column above the bed, and in the bed depth can serve as a good indicator for ripening of the biological layer.</jats:p>",

This gap is closely linked with agricultural production and environmental issues. It is probably due to small amounts of precipitation and low availability of natural water sources. Special ventures have to be undertaken in order to supply water at adequate quality for all requirements. These can be accomplished by development of additional water sources that currently are considered marginal. The additional sources include saline ground water, treated wastewater and runoff water and are usually required to augment the limited supply from the regional conventional high quality local sources. The paper presented options for development of the marginal water sources in arid zones in conjunction with minimizing the dependence on high quality water. Domestic secondary effluent is a valuable water source for reclamation however, additional treatment is required to use it for unrestricted purposes. It can be achieved primarily by implementation of the membrane technology, namely ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) stages.</jats:p>",

Rising demands for water to supply agriculture, industry and cities are leading to competition over the allocation of limited fresh water resources. This paper examines how water reuse increases the available supply of water and enables human needs to be met with less fresh water. The paper is illustrated with water reuse case studies in agriculture, urban areas, industry and water resource supplementation in Australia and other countries. The links between water reuse and sustainable water management are examined. Water conservation and water reuse produce substantial environmental benefits, arising from reductions in water diversions, and reductions in the impacts of wastewater discharges on environmental water quality. Some examples are presented demonstrating the environmental benefits in quantitative terms. The paper also describes the economic and environmental benefits identified in a number of recent integrated water cycle planning studies in Australia.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The World Health Organization and others have proposed international guidelines for the safe reuse of domestic wastewater. Treatment and microbial standards have been suggested with varying microbial water quality targets to suit local circumstances of affordability and health risks. However, it is important to recognize that universal application of bacterial standards for water quality assessment will not yield the same risks from microbial pathogens in reclaimed wastewater around the world. The concentration and types of pathogens in raw wastewater varies from one region of the world to another depending on the incidence in the community. This is influenced by the general hygiene, season, and per capita water use. Also, different treatment processes may be more effective in removing indicator bacteria and certain groups of pathogens than others. Proposed guidelines have also neglected the importance of water in the transmission of viral and bacterial diseases in developed countries and their impact on morbidity and mortality. Additional research is needed to better reduce the uncertainly of proposed guidelines for water recycling and to better define the risks associated to the exposed populations.</jats:p>",

Two effects can be observed: at low ultrasound doses bacteria flocs can be declumped by mechanical shear stresses, and at increased doses ultrasound cavitation has an impact on the cell walls such that they are broken. In lab scale experiments a horn sonotrode operated at 20 kHz was run in combination with a low-pressure mercury arc lamp to treat wastewater samples taken from the effluent of a municipal treatment plant. At low ultrasound intensities a drastic change in samples' particle size distribution was observed. Consequently, subsequent UV irradiation was far more efficient as the number of large particles which impede disinfection processes was minimised by the sonication. Hence, applied UV doses could be reduced notably to obtain the same or even better disinfection effects.</jats:p>",

UV can be used both to disinfect wastewater discharged to the environment, and to disinfect that water when it is picked up again for human consumption. UV readily blocks infectivity by such chlorine-resistant pathogens as Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia and Legionella pneumophila. Multiple disinfectant use is now being discussed to broaden the spectrum of pathogens that can be inactivated by using disinfectants in their most strategically advantageous dose and function. Optimizing multiple barrier strategies requires attention to validation of the concepts and technologies involved. UV technology validation ensures that the equipment can deliver the target UV design dose, and that the monitoring/control technology modulates the dose appropriately with changes in water quality or operating conditions. The bioassay approach for UV reactor validation is recommended over analytical and numerical models. Analytical models, which provide an average dose estimate, have been shown to be inadequate. Numerical models, which utilize Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and UV light intensity models to predict reactor performance, can be accurate when used by skilled professionals but require significant validation and/or calibration against bioassay data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Wastewater in most countries of the Near East Region (NER) is being more and more recognized as of vital importance to be treated and made safe for reuse. It contributes considerably to the water budget in several countries, particularly those suffering from water scarcity. Treated wastewater is used directly in irrigation of farms or landscape green areas. Limited indirect use includes recharge of groundwater aquifers to control over-draft and salt intrusion in coastal areas. A large share of wastewater is still not treated and part of it is used in an uncontrolled manner, including for the production of uncooked food crops the consumption of which poses health risks. Expansion of treated wastewater reuse in the region is linked to a number of issues and constraints. The high cost of treatment and management of reclaimed wastewater is one of the major limitations facing the week economy of most countries. Unclear polices, institutional conflicts and lack of regulatory frameworks constitute other important constraints that hinder implementation and proper operation of wastewater reuse projects. The manpower capacity is at varying levels between countries, but additional training and capacity strengthening are generally needed throughout the region. This paper gives an overview of the existing practices of wastewater reuse in the NER and of the constraints facing it. It concludes with recommendations and policy options that are likely to lift these constraints and to make a better use of the wastewater potential.</jats:p>",

The system provides an optimal year-round treatment/reuse/disposal plan, which maximizes the wastewater reuse for irrigation, meets the applicable minimum municipal wastewater treatment requirements and observes the water quality standards of receivers with the minimum treatment costs. The solution is dynamic in the sense that varying monthly design values can be assigned to the input variables used in the computation of irrigation requirements, assimilative capacity of receivers and performance of natural systems. The above procedure shows that the use of multiple receivers over the year is often highly advantageous; combining for example the increased treatment efficiency and reuse potential for irrigation during summer with the increased assimilative capacity of a river during winter. The expert system incorporates a number of design and ambient quality models, for which graphical solutions have been developed, so as to enable manual application if desired. The entire procedure is implemented in an integrated computer program that facilitates and refines problem solution. The expert system provides interactive guidance for collecting the necessary field information. Finally, the results of a case study for the management of wastewaters from the six communities of the Municipality of Keramoti are presented.</jats:p>",

This paper suggests a suitable methodology for sustainable wastewater reuse in the Mediterranean area by considering not only technical and economic, but also, environmental and social aspects of wastewater reuse. Alternative strategies based on different treatment and storage technologies are evaluated by using the Multicriterion Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. Alternative strategies are formulated by combining elements such as different treatments, different disposal sites, the type of irrigation scheme, crop pattern, water pricing and the use of fertilizers. The criteria used to evaluate the most sustainable strategy include firstly public health and environmental factors, that pose risks on human health, water pollution during and after irrigation, efficiency of water use, secondly economic factors, including the water cost, the initial cost of the irrigation system, maintenance costs and crop profitability, and thirdly social issues including the employment of rural labour. Various MCDA techniques, namely, ELECTRE-3, ELECTRE-4 and Compromise Programming (CP) may be employed to rank alternative strategies and find out the most sustainable alternative.</jats:p>",

Each treatment was replicated four times. The agricultural income was assessed using the yield of the crops and the economic data of the area. The results showed that in the case of corn, the treatment WTF gave the highest agricultural income. The treatments W and WSF gave higher agricultural income compared to the control but was not significantly different compared to the treatment MF. In the case of cotton, all the treatments included wastewater use, increased significantly the agricultural income in comparison to the control, but at similar level as the treatment MF did.

T‐test evidence suggests that all proposed critical variables, with the exception of coercive power, are of significant importance for achieving a high rate of perceived relationship satisfaction, regardless of whether the relationship is characterized by a high or a low level of trust and commitment. A good reputation, close relationship and positive relationship benefits are key variables for the achievement of high satisfaction in a “high‐trust and commitment relationship”.

Testing lasted for about 4 months, during which the pilot plant was fed by effluent from the wastewater treatment plant. Results show that the permeate was of high quality. The membranes were very efficient in reducing turbidity (94.5%) and TSS (98.7%). The reduction of COD (around 35%) was also good. The permeate also showed low SDI values (usually &amp;lt; 3%). With respect to microbiological parameters, treatment was shown to be above all efficient in the removal of Escherichia coli. The permeate already respects required quality standards set forth by a new technical law decree on water reuse, soon to be approved within Italian Legislation. Based on these test results, a preliminary design of a wastewater treatment plant with the complex of structures necessary to the distribution of the treated wastewater in the industrial area located closed to the plant, has been created. Under this design, treated water could be produced at a cost of 0.38 Euro/m3, which includes investment, financial charges and maintenance costs.</jats:p>",

For multi‐echelon supply chains adopting different inventory and forecasting policies at the echelon level, simulation is the most appropriate analysis tool. In this paper, we describe the development of a simulation workbench for modelling and analysing multi‐echelon supply chains. The workbench facilitates study of inventory and forecasting policies practised by the echelons, and models different information exchange mechanisms adopted by them. An experiment conducted, to test the workbench and demonstrate its capabilities, confirms that the workbench is a useful tool for gaining valuable insights into information exchange in a particular supply chain.</jats:p>",

Coagulation tests, with alum doses varying from 0.1 mM to 2.5 mM, were applied prior to chlorination to the nitrified effluent in order to remove organic carbon and thereby control the formation of THM. The results indicated that the operational variables of contact time, ammonia nitrogen concentration, pH and chlorine dose had significant effects on THM formation. In tertiary effluents, as the coagulant dose increased, THM formation decreased with a more pronounced reduction for doses higher than 1.5 mM. Modelling of the THM formation was made by means of empirical exponential models. For the chlorination of the nitrified secondary effluent, contact time, chlorine dose, pH and temperature were the model's independent variables, while for the partially nitrified secondary effluent the equivalent independent variables were the contact time, the chlorine dose and the ammonia nitrogen concentration. Modelling of THM formation during chlorination of tertiary effluent was based on either the DOC concentration or the ultraviolet absorbance, as well as on a combination of both. The three exponential models fit reasonably well the experimental data for all the coagulant doses, except for the 2 and 2.5 mM dose, where the reduction in organic matter was not as high as the equivalent reduction in THM formation. The use of the ultraviolet absorbance alone as an independent variable in the model provided a slightly better simulation of the measured THM concentrations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper discusses the concepts and results from two contrasting types of water recycling initiatives in Australia. The first type of initiative is a centralised scheme based on local authorities recycling sewage effluent and/or stormwater in urban areas. A new urban subdivision in Queensland (Springfield) is provided as an example of such a centralised scheme, with uses ranging from dual reticulation, to public space irrigation, to urban lakes. The importance of strong public consultation and partnership is stressed for scheme success. A second example of a centralised scheme is an upmarket subdivision in Adelaide, South Australia (Mawson Lakes), where stormwater and recycled effluent are designed to supply in excess of 70% of the community's total water requirement. Scheme success is highly probable because of the ready adoption of innovative water supply alternatives by South Australians. The other type of initiative operates at a household scale (Healthy Home) and demonstrates that reinventing old ideas using new technologies can allow urban households to become largely self reliant for their potable and non-potable water needs, at least in high rainfall coastal areas. However, the cost effectiveness of this self reliance will require a substantial change in the sharing of savings from deferred public infrastructure costs. We include for comparison an analysis by Coombes et al. for the Lower Hunter region which clearly demonstrates that adoption of water sensitive urban design features, such as rainwater tanks in new developments, is not only more cost effective than traditional infrastructure solutions, but also allows the deferral of new urban water supply dams by the order of decades. We conclude the paper with the observation that advances in incorporating externalities into water development economics, the \"trickle down\" effect of new distributed technologies, and the growing desire by urban communities to live within the capacity of their regional ecosystems will probably ensure that reforms in the urban water and wastewater cycles will pioneer the way to genuinely sustainable and liveable urban communities in the near future. In short, the Ecological Footprint of urban development will be substantially reduced.</jats:p>",

Water reuse is a growing field and many projects have been occurring throughout Europe in the last fifteen years. Most of northern EU countries have abundant water resources. In this case, the need for extra supply through the reuse of treated wastewater is not a priority, but the protection of the receiving environment is considered as an important issue. The situation is different in the southern EU countries, where the additional resource brought by water reuse promoted the implementation of a number of new projects. One of the major constraints for water reuse and its public acceptance is the lack of relevant legislation at EU level. As a result of this situation, both strict and flexible standards can be found in Europe, even in the same country (Spain, for example), illustrating an important equity issue, which needs to be addressed.</jats:p>",

We consider a variety of scheduling, batching, and delivery problems that arise in an arborescent supply chain where a supplier makes deliveries to several manufacturers, who also make deliveries to customers. The objective is to minimize the overall scheduling and delivery cost, using several classical scheduling objectives. This is achieved by scheduling the jobs and forming them into batches, each of which is delivered to the next downstream stage as a single shipment. For each problem, we either derive an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that minimizes the total cost of the supplier or that of the manufacturer, or we demonstrate that this problem is intractable. The total system cost minimization problem of a supplier and manufacturer who make cooperative decisions is also considered. We demonstrate that cooperation between a supplier and a manufacturer may reduce the total system cost by at least 20%, or 25%, or by up to 100%, depending upon the scheduling objective. Finally, we identify incentives and mechanisms for this cooperation, thereby demonstrating that our work has practical implications for improving the efficiency of supply chains. </jats:p>",

The experience of Hong Kong suggests that supply chain virtualization has propelled a structural change in buyers‐intermediaries‐sellers relationships, called for a novel approach to knowledge management, and accelerated internationalization of small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises.

The common macrophyte in Egypt Typha latifolia (cattail) was used at a planting density of three rhizomes/m2. To evaluate the role of plants in the treatment process, an unplanted gravel bed identical to the SSF unit was operated as control. During the study period, the wetlands were fed with the UASB effluent at an organic loading rate ranging from 17.3 to 46.8 kg BOD5/ha·d (55.1 to 134.6 kgCOD/ha·d). Effectiveness of the system for the removal of key constituents (COD, BOD, TSS, nutrients and FC) has been investigated. The results showed that, the level of CODtot, and TSS in the final effluent of SSF was lower than that of FWS. Subsurface flow wetland has demonstrated higher overall efficiency than the unplanted control. FC reduction reached 4 log units.

Extensive reclamation technologies are well adapted to the Mediterranean context for their easy and cost effective O&amp;M; however their ability to reliably meet health related standards have been questioned. The paper reviews the main factors of variations in the bacterial abatement provided by extensive treatment techniques - stabilisation reservoirs, ponds and infiltration percolation. Thanks to advances in the knowledge and modelling of disinfection mechanisms, the predictability of microbial decontamination by extensive technologies is being significantly improved; the development of better design tools leading to reliable treatments is foreseen. However, due to limitations in the microbial removal, extensive techniques cannot meet highly conservative requirements. Extensive techniques will play an important part in the development of water reuse and fresh water savings in the Mediterranean as far as water quality standards only aim at limiting health risks to an acceptable level.</jats:p>",

A panel consisting of 14,468 forest owners during the period 1989–1997 (except 1991) is used for the statistical testing. The results indicate that the current and lagged price, interest rate and various owner and property characteristics are relevant explanatory variables when evaluating factors affecting Norwegian NIPF owners' short-term roundwood supply. It is demonstrated that the econometric results differ quite substantially between the two models. Both the common interpretation of the results from pooled and FE models, the match to the theory of forest owner behavior, and the statistical measures suggest that panel data methods, like the FE model, are more suitable for short-run roundwood supply analysis than the conventional pooled model. Special attention is given to the price elasticity and its variability across regions and time. Based on the empirical results it is concluded that, among other factors, both the nature of the price data and the distribution of the price elasticity estimates are important to consider when comparing stumpage price elasticity estimates from different analysis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An innovative scheme of groundwater recharge for wastewater effluent reuse has been practiced on a large scale in the Dan Region Project in Israel since 1977. The system, referred to as SAT (for Soil Aquifer Treatment), provides advanced treatment prior to effluent reuse for unrestricted irrigation. A major study recently carried out consisted of a comprehensive analysis of the water quality data available in the recharged effluent (before SAT), as well as in observation wells and recovery wells (after SAT). The results obtained with respect to suspended solids, organics and nutrients (nitrogen compounds and phosphorus) are presented and discussed. The main processes occurring in the soil-aquifer system, which are responsible for the removal of the above contaminants are filtration through the upper soil layer, organic matter biodegradation and adsorption, ammonia adsorption and biological nitirification-denitrification, and chemical precipitation and adsorption of phosphorus. The findings of the study have provided valuable information on the above processes and their interaction, and have demonstrated that the SAT system should be considered an attractive method for effluent reuse in areas where hydrogeological conditions are suitable for groundwater recharge via spreading basins.</jats:p>",

The SR systems were planted with four plant species eucalyptus, acacia, poplars and reeds to evaluate their effects on wastewater treatment and produced biomass.

The SR systems, displayed a good performance as regards COD BOD, TKN, NH3-N and bacteria removal (TC and FC). However, relatively increased values of NO3 were detected in 60 cm. In terms of plant species used, there were no significant differences in treatment efficiency among the four SR systems. Although, significant differences were observed in biomass production with acacia trees producing the greatest amount of biomass followed by reeds, while the lowest one produced by eucalyptous and poplar trees.</jats:p>",

This can be attributed to either farmers' unwillingness to use or to pay for reclaimed wastewater. Therefore, a field survey was conducted in Jordan and Tunisia, which are considered as representative to the MENA region, using a prepared and pilot tested questionnaire. This study applies the contingent valuation method to elicit the willingness of farmers to pay for reclaimed wastewater. Logistic regression analysis is applied in an attempt to build a model that correlates qualitative responses of farmers to monetary stimuli. The water price seriously affects farming profitability and farmers' willingness to pay for reclaimed wastewater. Farmers prove to be unwilling to pay more than 0.05 $/m3 of reclaimed wastewater primarily because of quality concerns, comparatively easy access to freshwater, and price.</jats:p>",

The studied technologies after a classical activated sludge treatment were infiltration-percolation, ring filtration, sand filtration, and coagulation-floculation plus sand filtration. Analysis of VOCs were performed at the different stages of the treatment by closed loop stripping analysis (CLSA) method which is able to determine compounds at trace levels (ng/L) and covers a wide range of organic pollutants. The CLSA extracts were further analyzed by GC/MS. Organic compounds such as tert-butyl alcohols and ketones, musks; iso-propyl fatty acids, and other minor components were regularly identified in the influent. Removal of all pollutants was partially achieved by all methodologies tested except the musk compounds which proved to be recalcitrant in all cases but one. The sole metodology that exhibited a total elimination of all organic compounds identified in the effluent including musks was infiltration-percolation.</jats:p>",

Worldwide examples of reuse schemes are presented with particular detail to two key European sites where greywater has been used for toilet flushing, the Millennium Dome in the UK and a residential block of flats in Annecy, France. It was demonstrated that the interest in water reuse is growing steadily, not only in acknowledged water deficient areas, but also in countries which have not historically appeared to have a water supply problem. The latter include Northern European States such as Belgium, France, the UK and Germany, as well as in tourist coastal areas and islands.

Disinfection efficiency was comparable for E. coli, TC and FC, and lower for total heterotrophic bacteria (THB), and clearly grew with increasing Cát values. The effect of contact time was greater at the lower doses. Microbial counts, performed by both traditional methods and flow cytometry, immediately and 6 hours after the sample collection (PAA was previously inactivated by sodium thiosulphate and bovine catalase), showed that no appreciable re-growth took place after 6 hours for coliform group bacteria. THB formed a slightly lower number of colonies immediately after collection than after 6 hours. The slight variations observed after 6 hours were the result of the recovered ability of forming colonies and of the lysis of some of the residual bacteria, as it was shown by flow cytometry.</jats:p>",

The die-off of Cryptosporidium spp. reached only 1 log after incubation for 20 days in loamy soil saturated with either deionized water or secondary effluent at room temperature (25°C), whereas a 2 log die-off was recorded for Giardia spp. cysts. Under the same test conditions, negligible die-off was observed for MS2 bacteriophage. Filtration of secondary effluent through 25-cm long loamy soil column resulted in the reduction of 99.99% of the seeded Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts, whereas negligible reduction was observed for MS2 bacteriophage. The highest percentage of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts was recovered from the upper 3 cm of the soil column. Destruction of oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. in the soil matrix can be attributed to high microbial activity. The results of this study indicate that oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. might survive for prolonged period in saturated soil and in secondary effluent under moderate temperature conditions. However, oocysts are efficiently retained in loamy soil, which hinders their access to groundwater.

Carbamazepine slowed down, i.e. caused a decrease in the COD consumption rate in the activated sludge process, especially after longer term exposure, while the anaerobic sludge process was unaffected in the operating conditions that were applied. The compound was not degraded under either short term or long term exposure to either aerobic or anaerobic degradation processes. Carbamazepine seemed to biosorb to solid phases (soil, sludge) and this strength of sorption was related to the organic content of the solid phase.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The mean annual cycle of new primary production is determined for each of five hydrographic provinces contained within the combined Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank region using potential new production (PNP) as a proxy for new primary production. PNP is computed using in situ data and defined as the difference between the time rate‐of‐change of vertically integrated nitrate (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) in the euphotic zone and vertical flux of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> into the euphotic zone assuming Fickian diffusion, after conversion of nitrogen to carbon using the Redfield ratio. Maximum recharge rate of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> in the euphotic zone occurs primarily during fall, between yeardays 300 and 330 (late October to late November), in agreement with the timing of fall turnover of the water column. Maximum utilization rate of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> in the euphotic zone occurs between yeardays 60 and 120 (March to April), in agreement with the timing of the spring bloom, with little phase difference between provinces. Peak‐to‐peak amplitude (maximum recharge rate to maximum utilization rate) is largest for Jordan Basin, Northeast Channel, and the western Gulf of Maine province. Wintertime NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> recharge into the euphotic zone within the Gulf of Maine is largely the result of vertical NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> flux, except for eastern Gulf of Maine waters where advective NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> flux into surface waters is important. However, there still exists a significant deficit for fall NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> recharge for eastern Gulf of Maine which cannot be accounted for by either vertical diffusive or horizontal advective NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> fluxes. Annual totals of integrated total primary production (ITPP) and PNP summed over the full study region (including the southern New England shelf) are 44.33 tg C yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and 9.96 tg C yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively, for an annual mean potential <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>‐ratio of 0.22. Exclusion of the southern New England shelf increases the annual mean potential <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>‐ratio value for the remaining Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank region to 0.25. Inclusion of a time‐varying horizontal advective flux of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> into the eastern Gulf of Maine south of Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, increases the annual total of PNP for the full study region to 10.66 tg C yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, for an annual mean potential <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>‐ratio of 0.24. Annual mean potential <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>‐ratio for only the Gulf of Maine (excluding Georges Bank and southern New England shelf) using model‐derived K<jats:sub>z</jats:sub> values and horizontal advective flux of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> into eastern Gulf of Maine waters is 0.17, above oligotrophic ocean values of ∼0.1, but well below the value of 0.40 used to calculate nitrification within the Gulf of Maine. Greater than one half (53.3%) of total regional PNP occurs within the hydrographic province (annual mean potential <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>‐ratio = 0.58) bounded by the tidal mixing front on Georges Bank but comprises less than one fifth (17.3%) of the region's total area. PNP indicates primary production on the crest of Georges Bank is largely recycled, with an annual mean potential <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>‐ratio of much less than 0.1, suggesting nitrogen limitation. However, error estimates for PNP and potential <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>‐ratio on the crest of Georges Bank are large due to the paucity of data collected in this shallow province.</jats:p>",

Integrating literature on international diffusion, “success-breeds-success” trends, and the theatrical motion picture industry—the focus of the empirical analysis—we develop a dynamic simultanenous-equations model of the drivers and interrelationship of the behavior of consumers (“audiences”) and retailers (“exhibitors”). Our findings emphasize the importance of considering the endogeneity and simultaneity of audience and exhibitor behavior, and challenge conventional wisdom on the determinants of box office performance (which is predominantly based on modeling frameworks that fail to account for the interdependence of performance and availability). Specifically, we find that variables such as movie attributes and advertising expenditures, which are usually assumed to influence audiences directly, mostly influence revenuesindirectly, namely through their impact on exhibitors' screen allocations. In addition, consistent with the idea that the “buzz” for a movie is perishable, we find that the longer is the time lag between releases, the weaker is the relationship between domestic and foreign market performance—an effect mostly driven by foreign exhibitors' screen allocations. </jats:p>",

Wastewater effluent reuse and desalination have become the main source of water to compensate for the future water shortage.

The Dan Region Reclamation Project (Shafdan) is the largest wastewater treatment and reclamation project in Israel. 130 Mm3/yr of reclaimed water is used for unrestricted irrigation after soil aquifer treatment (SAT). Extensive water quality monitoring is performed to keep an efficient and safe wastewater reuse system. After 25 years of operation, the Shafdan deals with the following operational issues on an ongoing basis: Biofouling of the effluent pipelines from the wastewater treatment plant to the SAT, and a lack of capacity in the SAT system. Biofilm growth in the pipelines is controlled by intermittently applying chlorine based compounds at a 10 mg/L dosage for a few hours.</jats:p>",

The sand-filtered water was further treated with one or two UV reactors. The quality changes of wastewater were measured with transmittance, total phosphorus, soluble phosphorus, and somatic coliphages, FRNA-coliphages, FC, enterococci and fecal clostridia. Sand filtration alone without coagulants improved slightly some physico-chemical parameters and it had almost no effect on content of microorganisms. If coagulants were used, the filtration was more effective. The reductions were 88-98% for microbial groups and 80% for total phosphorus. The wastewater would meet the requirements for bathing waters (2,000 FC/100 ml, EU, 1976). UV further improved the hygiene level; this type of treated wastewater could be used for unrestricted irrigation (2.2 TC/100 ml, US.EPA 1992). The improvement was better if coagulants were used. The price for tertiary treatment (filtration + UV) would have been 0.036 Euro/m3 according to prices in 2001 in 22 Mm3/a. The investment cost needed for the filtration unit was 0.020 Euro/m3 (6%/15a). Filtration with coagulants is recommended in spite of its costs, since the low transmittance of unfiltered wastewater impairs the efficiency of the UV treatment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In arid and semiarid regions the reclamation and reuse of municipal wastewater can play a strategic role in alleviating water resources shortages. Public awareness is growing about the need to recycle and reuse water for increasing supply availability. Many wastewater reuse projects have been put in operation in European and Mediterranean countries adopting extensive treatment systems such as aquifer recharge, lagooning, constructed wetlands, and storage reservoirs, mainly for landscape and agricultural irrigation. In agricultural reuse systems, there is an increasing interest in extensive technologies because of their high reliability, and easy and low cost operation and maintenance. Wastewater storage reservoirs have become the option selected in many countries because of the advantages they present in comparison with other treatment alternatives, namely the coupling of two purposes, stabilization and seasonal regulation. This paper describes an example of a wastewater storage system, built in Caltagirone (Sicily, Italy). The storage results in a tertiary treatment of a continuous inlet flow of activated sludge effluents. The prediction of the microbiological water quality has been evaluated by means of a non-steady-state first-order kinetic model. Single and multiple regressions were applied to determine the main variables that most significantly affected die-off coefficients. The proposed model has been calibrated using the results of a field monitoring carried out during a period from March to October 2000.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) to the east of the Melville Fracture zone receives anomalously low volumes of melt on average. However, a small number of ridge segments appear to receive more melt than this regional average. We use off‐axis bathymetry, gravity, and magnetic data to show that this melt distribution pattern, quite distinct from what is observed at the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge (MAR), has been a characteristic of the easternmost SWIR for at least the past 10 myr. We also show that segments of the easternmost SWIR are substantially shorter lived than most segments of the MAR. Melt distribution in our SWIR study area is therefore both more focused and more variable in time than at the MAR. We tentatively propose a mechanism by which strong and transient melt‐focusing events could be initiated by a localized increase in the volume of melt supplied by the melting mantle to the base of the axial lithosphere, causing thermal thinning of this lithosphere and along‐axis melt migration. These two processes may combine to effectively focus larger volumes of melt toward the center of future thick crust segments. Rapid melt extraction by dikes that feed large volcanic constructions on the seafloor, followed by tectonic disruption of these volcanic constructions by deep‐reaching faults, may then cool the axial lithosphere back to its original thickness and end the melt‐focusing events. The easternmost SWIR is also characterized by a common departure from isostatic compensation of seafloor topography and by a pronounced asymmetry of crustal thickness and seafloor relief between the two ridge flanks. At the faster spreading MAR, similar characteristics are found near the ends of ridge segments. We propose that spreading at the ultra‐slow SWIR during periods when the melt supply is low (i.e., most of the time for the easternmost SWIR) is dominated by large offset asymmetric normal faulting, with significant flexural uplift of the footwalls. Faults face either north or south, and changes in fault polarity are frequent, both along axis and along flow lines (i.e., with time). Producing large faults and maintaining high uncompensated reliefs require the axial lithosphere to be thick, a predictable characteristic for this ultra‐slow ridge, which has an anomalously low regionally averaged melt supply.</jats:p>",

Whereas there is no discernible shortage of people willing to serve as principals in either society, there are serious concerns about the quality of both incumbent and future principals. The reasons behind these interrelated phenomena, however, are very different in each society and relate to a unique mixture of political, structural and cultural factors. For example, the extreme centralisation of the political and structural systems in Singapore explains the steady supply of new principals. By contrast, the much more disconnected nature of education governance in Hong Kong accounts for the ready supply of available new principals.

Line A consisted of a deep anaerobic pond followed by a facultative and two maturation ponds. The anaerobic pond supplied with 120 m3/d was also feeding line B at a ratio 1:3 (line A: line B).

Risks arise mainly when an “intramedullary” spinal cord AVM fed by anterior spinal artery (ASA) needs to be treated. Superselective catheterization technique and embolization agents represent important risk factors. The aim of this report is to evaluate the results and limits of embolization therapy of these malformations on the basis of our experience. Since 1996 we treated 51 spinal vascular malformations, 29 were true SCAVMs. The main ASA supply was observed in 17 cases. All were intramedullary AVM with “nidus” type appearance. Complete embolization was achieved in 23.5% of cases. Complications related to the procedure were observed in 28% of cases. Our results confirm that ASA embolization is at high risk of hemorrhage and ischemia. We believe that this technique should be reserved for patients with previous hemorrhage and when a high risk of hemorrhagic event is recognized. Moreover, a poor natural history of this illness suggests that conservative treatment is not always recommended. In these cases a fractionated superselective embolization to reduce hemorrhagic events could be a good option. </jats:p>",

This research aimed to discover the vertical temperature distribution and cooling load reduction relating to displacement ventilation in atrium spaces. The air temperatures at different levels (0.1, 0.7, 1.2, 1.7, 3, 5 and 7 m), within a 25 m high exhibition atrium, were monitored. Using the measured surface temperatures as boundary conditions, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed to examine the vertical temperature distribution. Further, by using parametric studies, the influences of occupant load, equipment load, lighting load, floor and wall surface temperatures, and supply air conditions were investigated with 12 CFD simulation cases. Based on the simulation results, load reduction factors - with three grouping methods of heat sources - were then developed. Temperature stratification was present even under the condition of a low cooling load. Load reductions were lower for occupant and equipment loads than for a lighting load. The best grouping method was to consider the heat released from the floor as an individual group of heat sources, which is an indication that secondary heat from the floor should not be neglected during the design of displacement ventilation. </jats:p>",

Wastewater contains a wide variety of microbial pathogens that may pose a risk to human health if not properly controlled; however, there are currently no national standards for microorganisms or consistent treatment requirements in the US with regards to reclaimed water. Besides the routine monitoring for TC and FC bacteria that has been used for assessing water quality, several types of alternative microorganisms have been suggested as indicators of water quality, fecal pollution, and public health risks. These include enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, and coliphage among others. This project evaluated the removal of both indicators (TC and FC, enterococci, C. perfringens and coliphage) and pathogens (enteroviruses, Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp.) at 3 water reclamation facilities with varying treatment designs and operations. The facilities evaluated range in size from 20 to 44 million Liters per day capacity, with both shallow and deep bed sand/anthracite filters. Differences also existed in the disinfection processes for the 3 reclamation plants. The TC and FC showed a 5 to 7 log reduction throughout the treatment processes with no detectable levels in the final effluent. However, even though the alternative indicators (enterococci, C. perfringens and coliphage) showed reductions that varied from 2 to 6 logs, some levels of these indicators were consistently detected in 2 of the 3 facilities in the final reclaimed effluent. Both Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. were detected in the final effluent in all 3 facilities, even when no indicators were present. Virus detection was seasonal, and associated with cooler temperatures and less disinfection. The results of this study indicate that differences in filter design, operations, and disinfection approaches were responsible for differences in inter and intra facility water quality variability.</jats:p>",

However, the PCCM requirement for physicians to accept assignment of a caseload of patients and to provide all of their primary care likely conflicts with the approach of limited Medicaid participation favored by many Medicaid physician participants. This study examines the early impact of PCCM implementation, in the absence of physician reimbursement level increases, on the patterns of Medicaid participation by physicians in communities in Georgia and Alabama. We find that the implementation of PCCM under these conditions often was associated with reductions in the proportion of physicians participating in Medicaid, reductions in the number of very small Medicaid practices, and declines in Medicaid visit volumes across all participating physicians. We also find evidence of an overall reduction in the number of primary care visits per Medicaid enrollee, but an increase in the proportion of these visits that were for preventive care services associated with initial PCCM implementation. </jats:p>",

It was initially proposed that this mutant was defective in a carbonic anhydrase (CA) that was a key component of the photosynthetic CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM). However, more recent identification of the genetic lesion as a defect in a lumenal CA associated with photosystem II (PSII) has raised questions about the role of this CA in either the CCM or PSII function. To resolve the role of this lumenal CA, we re-examined the physiology of the cia3 mutant. We confirmed and extended previous gas exchange analyses by using membrane-inlet mass spectrometry to monitor16O2,18O2, and CO2 fluxes in vivo. The results demonstrate that PSII electron transport is not limited in the cia3 mutant at low inorganic carbon (Ci). We also measured metabolite pools sizes and showed that the RuBP pool does not fall to abnormally low levels at low Ci as might be expected by a photosynthetic electron transport or ATP generation limitation. Overall, the results demonstrate that under low Ci conditions, the mutant lacks the ability to supply Rubisco with adequate CO2 for effective CO2 fixation and is not limited directly by any aspect of PSII function. We conclude that the thylakoid CA is primarily required for the proper functioning of the CCM at low Ci by providing an ample supply of CO2 for Rubisco.</jats:p>",

However, it is not certain how much lactate, directly taken from the blood circulation, may replace glucose as an energy source. This study aimed to estimate the uptake, release, and utilization of lactate entering the brain from the blood circulation. The change in cerebral venous-arterial glucose and lactate differences after lactate infusions in the anesthetized rat were measured. Ultrafiltration probes were placed in the aorta and in the jugular vein, and connected to a flow injection analysis system with biosensors for glucose and lactate. Measurements were taken every minute. Lactate efflux was observed at baseline, whereas an influx of lactate was seen during lactate infusion. Immediately after the infusion there was a net efflux of lactate from the brain. The results suggest that the majority of lactate moving into the brain is not used as an energy substrate, and that lactate does not replace glucose as an energy source. Instead, the authors propose the concept of a lactate pool in the brain that can be filled and emptied in accordance with the blood lactate concentration, but which is not used as an energy supply for cerebral metabolism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Cedarhemlock forests on Vancouver Island are primarily nitrogen limited and characterized by an under story dominated by the ericaceous shrub salal (Gaultheria shallon Pursh.). In 1984, an experiment was established on regenerating cedarhemlock forests to determine the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus (N + P) fertilization and vegetation control on conifer growth. It was hypothesized that these treatments would not only stimulate tree growth, but also improve nutrient supply, stand productivity, and site quality. To test this hypothesis, tree height growth, canopy closure, salal biomass, foliar and forest floor N and P concentrations, and seedling growth on forest floor were measured 1013 years after treatment. Both salal control and fertilization increased tree growth and canopy cover, and reduced salal biomass. However, only fertilized plots showed changes in site quality measurable 1013 years following N + P application. Hemlock foliar P concentrations, forest floor total N and P levels, and hemlock height increments were higher in these plots. Forest floors from the fertilized plots also supported greater growth of conifer seedlings. These results suggest that sustained changes to site quality may be achieved with N + P fertilization of cedarhemlock forests. </jats:p>",

        "not establish missions, even though they sometimes desired to do so. The first necessity was a body of people with the degree of commitment needed to live on someone else’s terms, together with the mental equipment for coping with the implications. Such commitment was in turn most likely to arise in the wake of powerful religious influences. Times of religious renewal were nec-essary for the recruitment of a sizeable company of such people, and the maintenance of a succession of them. A tradition of mental training, how-ever, was also needed; charismatic inspiration alone would not suffice, and indeed the plodder might succeed better with a new language and a new soci-ety than the inspired preacher. The second need was for a form of organization which could mobilize committed people, maintain and supply them, and forge a link between them and their work and the wider church. Since in the nature of things both their work and the conditions in which they carried it out were exceptional, the necessary structures could not readily emerge in very rigid regimes, whether political or ecclesiastical. They needed tolerance of the exceptional, and flex-ibility. The third factor necessary to overseas missions was sustained access to overseas locations, with the capacity to maintain communication over long periods. This implies what might be called maritime consciousness, with mar-itime capability and logistical support. All three factors were present in the first, Catholic, phase of the missionary movement. The Catholic Reformation released the spiritual forces to produce the committed worker, the religious orders offered possibilities of extension and adaptation which produced the structures for deploying them, and the Portuguese enclaves and trading depots provided the communication net-works and transoceanic bases. When in the course of the eighteenth century the Catholic phase of missions began to stutter, it was partly because the three factors were no longer fully in place. The Protestant movement developed as the Catholic movement weakened. It began, not at the end of the eighteenth century (that is a purely British per-spective) but at the end of the seventeenth; not in England, but in Germany and Central Europe. Its main motors were in Halle and Herrnhut, though, just as German Pietism drew on the English puritan tradition, it had a puri-tan prologue. William Carey’s Enquiry did not initiate it; the object of that"
