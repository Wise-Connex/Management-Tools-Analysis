      "abstract": "<jats:p>I investigated the abundance, diet and food supply of ground finch species (Geospiza Gould) at different altitudes over a calendar year on Isla Pinta, Galapagos. The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate which of three alternative hypotheses best explains the present distributions of species along the vegetation gradient: habitat structure, food supply, or current interspecific competition. Isla Pinta was specifically chosen because Lack (1947) thought that on this island one species, G. difficilis, was competitively restricted to the highlands by the morphologically very similar species, G. fuliginosa. Four of the five species present were broadly distributed among habitats, and their altitudinal ranges overlapped considerably. The fifth, G. scandens, was rare and little was learned of its habit. G. difficilis ate mainly litter arthropods and gastropods, especially at high elevations. The remaining three species, G. fuliginosa, G. fortis, and G. magnirostris, were primarily granivorous, but each species consumed a different range of seed sizes. Diet overlap between species was highest when food production was high, and lowest when food was scarce. Seasonal declines in overlap seemed to be mainly due to finches' response to asynchronous food production and a gradual broadening of the available food spectrum. In the dry season the abundance and distribution of the four common species matched to varying degrees the abundance and distribution of the foods they consumed. Effects of current competition on these distributional patterns were not detected. Most Geospiza species did not seem to possess strict habitat requirements, and it is unlikely that variation in habitat structure greatly influenced distributions. One possible exception to this is G. difficilis, where litter supply may be important. Overall, the data suggest that while competition may be occurring between species, variation in food supply is currently a far more important determinant of distributions on Pinta.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Resident populations of the Coppery—rumped Hummingbird, Amazilia tobaci, occupy the West Indian Islands of Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad has 15 other hummingbird species, Tobago only 4 others. We predicted that A. tobaci on Tobago would have a broader feeding niche and a denser population than would A. tobaci on Trinidad. We monitored populations of Amazilia tobaci for 13 mo at study sites in the Arima Valley of northern Trinidad and in central Tobago. The two sites had nearly identical climates, and similar assemblages of flowers visited by hummingbirds. At both sites, food available to nectar—feeding birds varied &gt; 100 fold over the year. For 9 mo (December—August), neither A. tobaci population faced a severe food shortage. From September through November, nectar was scarce at both sites. During this period, Tobago A. tobaci faced only two other, uncommon species of nectar—feeding birds, which had very different feeding habits. The Trinidad population endured the food shortage along with six other hummingbird species. At this time Tobago A. tobaci utilized variously sized and shaped flowers of numerous plant species. On Trinidad, where many flowers were visited by the other hummingbird species, A. tobaci primarily used flowers that matched their bill size, which resulted in narrower feeding niche than on Tobago. These effects of \"ecological release\" on Tobago were apparent for only 3 mo, however, and when data for an entire year are compared there were few statistically significant contrasts between Tobago and Trinidad populations. At both sites, niche (diet) breadth responded in density—dependent fashion to changes in food density, broadening with high densities of A. tobaci relative to food, narrowing when food was abundant. Median values for niche breadth, population density, and population density per unit resource were not significantly greater on Tobago than on Trinidad. Ecological differences between the two populations during the food shortage may be linked to a phenotypic difference. We found no increase on Tobago in the intrapopulation variance of any morphological parameter important to feeding. However, Tobago, A. tobaci had longer wings than Trinidad conspecifics, resulting in lower wing disc loadings (ratio of body mass to area swept out by the wings). Among hummingbirds in general, low wing disc loading indicates a capacity to forage at a wide variety of flowers, which suggests that the Tobago population has undergone \"within—phenotype nich expansion.\" Two experiments showed that individuals from the Tobago population of A. tobaci used a wide variety of artificial flowers, and a wide range of flower densities in field manipulations, than did conspecifics from Trinidad. The results suggest that occasional food shortages play a crucial role in the ecology and evolution of island populations, and that this might be undetected in short—term studies.</jats:p>",

At 20/12°C day/night temperatures, direct competition for soil nitrogen resulted in lowered growth of Bouteloua when growth in mixtures with Agropyran. However, at 30/15° day/night temperature the situation reversed, in that the growth of Agropyron was restricted when grown in the presence of Bouteolua, through competition for nitrogen. Based on the relative crowding coefficient, competitive ability is more closely related to temperature and the photosynthetic pathway type than soil nitrogen supply. The relative crowding coefficient for Agropyron was much greater at 20/12° than 30/15°, whereas values for Bouteloua were greatly depressed at 20/12° compared with 30/15°. Analysis of the competitive and noncompetitive aspects of plant interference occurring in this study is also made. Although differences in nitrogen uptake and use occurred between these two species, the growth differential at two temperatures would result in uneven utilization of the soil nitrogen resource on a seasonal basis. There was little evidence to support the postulate that differences in nitrogen—use efficiency between C<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> pathway plants may be advantageous for C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> plants only.</jats:p>",

Since the discussion of these benefits has been a recent development and has generally excluded local water supply managers, a question arises as to whether supply managers are implementing conservation programs to exploit these benefits. A survey of the managers at 35 Maryland water utilities provides insight into the prevailing attitude toward conservation in a water rich eastern state. The results indicate that most managers continue to view conservation only as a short term response to temporary supply shortages. Only 12 Maryland utilities have undertaken any form of water conservation activity and just two systems have ongoing, comprehensive conservation programs. Institutional, perceptual, economic, political, and time constraints all contribute to the managers’attitudes and general inaction. If water conservation is to be widely practiced, these issues must be addressed and the benefits attributed to conservation must be better documented and articulated to supply managers.</jats:p>",

In both species, retia originate from major vessels in the neck, thorax, and lumbar regions, then extend into the neural canal and cranium to supply the spinal cord and brain. The system generally consists of arteries embedded in á matrix of fatty connective tissue. Constituent vessels are only occasionally reated to veins or venous sinuses. Though retial anatomy is similar in the two species, there are two related features that appear species specific: (1) amount of retia originating from the supreme intercostal arteries and (2) thoracic retial size. Both are larger in the narwhal, as are values for hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration, which, in this study, we use as indices of diving ability. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the retia are in some way linked to diving ability. The nature of this link is not known; however, we discuss our results in the context of the most popular hyotheses of retial function.</jats:p>",
