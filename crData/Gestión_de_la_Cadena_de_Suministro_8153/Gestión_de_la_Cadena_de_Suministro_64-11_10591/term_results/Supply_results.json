The endurance load was determined as a percentage of the maximum strength of each muscle group and, in this study, varied from 35 to 85%. Load was graphed against endurance and equations were established for the relation which, under the conditions of high loading in the experiment, appeared to be linear. </jats:p><jats:p> contraction metabolism; strength as a predictor of endurance; contraction producing intramuscular vascular occlusion </jats:p><jats:p> Submitted on December 30, 1963 </jats:p>",
