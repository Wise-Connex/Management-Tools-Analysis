      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Supply chain management and procurement processes are a crucial element within every organisation, both public and private. Behind every company or government success story, there is generally a supply chain process that helped deliver that success. Whether delivering the goods to keep operations running smoothly, ordering equipment and materials for a new project or working with suppliers in finding solutions to address unique problems, procurement is at the centre of most organisational plans and processes. Supply chain management took centre stage during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, as many jurisdictions across the United States vied for the same products over a very short timeframe. Companies which produced such products were caught off-guard by the sudden demand and any stockpiled resources were quickly consumed. The resulting effects were hoarding behaviours by purchasers who did not know when supplies would be restocked, or territorial disputes as the federal government or states often pulled rank over smaller entities by confiscating or rerouting incoming deliveries to serve their own priorities. During the past few years, many governments and companies built their supply chain on ‘next day’ delivery from suppliers, minimised their warehousing operations, or relied heavily on bids and request for proposal (RFP) processes that often take months to complete. The new challenges presented throughout the pandemic required updated supply chain strategies and contracting methodologies to serve the ever-changing operational and safety demands of their customers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic is not comparable for extension and implications to any other crisis faced by organizations over the last decades. Understandably, in its first and most acute phases, managers have focused their attention on how companies could ensure business continuity at the organizational level, by guaranteeing safe operating conditions and reshaping working procedures. Yet, for companies operating in business markets, adjusting internal processes to face a supply chain disruption is not enough to ensure business continuity, as these companies also need to sustain the network of external relationships in the whole supply chain in which they operate. To avoid jeopardizing their long-term survival, maintain their scope of action, and keep up with the challenges of the new normal, business companies need to engage in effective strategies that focus on a different component of business continuity, which we call relational continuity. After a brief review of the literature, the chapter first introduces the relational continuity concept in supply chain relationships. Drawing on a series of qualitative in-depth interviews with managers from the industrial machinery industry, whose sampled firms are actually connected through a direct supplier-client relationship, the chapter identifies three strategies that industrial companies should implement to ensure relational continuity with their key partners (suppliers and especially clients): supply chain intelligence, relational slack and key partners’ integration. Their full-fledged implementation proved to smooth and strengthen relationships among all players in the supply-chain and make business companies more responsive and capable to address the relational challenges of the “new normal” scenario.</jats:p>"

It explores the economic impact of the large-scale movement of goods and supplies required to support military advance, and to meet the expectations of the unusually large garrison stationed in Britain. The underwriting of these food supplies can be treated as an early form of military <italic>annona</italic>, sharing characteristics with arrangements made for the feeding of larger cities. It is argued that London’s economy and port, revolved around the needs of <italic>annona</italic> supply embracing military and civilian consumers. The infrastructure developed to support the annona stimulated a wider trade in luxury imports, best evidenced by the pottery carried to and through London (such as Samian and amphorae). This long-distance supply is the most archaeologically evident aspect of London’s Roman economy. The use of coin is another, and this chapter reviews the use of small change within London’s internal economy and local taxes. Coin-based market economies may not have penetrated far into the surrounding countryside, where subsistence and peasant farming was allowed to persist and rent and tax could be obtained through sharecropping and other ‘in kind’ arrangements.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An agile supply chain is important in a struggling post-COVID-19 economy to manage costs and to respond to customer demand. And, the ability to react rapidly is the key to satisfying customer demand. Supply chains, their re-organisation as platform-mediated ecosystems, are now primed for their biggest change yet. The Platform refers to a technology that allows open interaction between market players, such as producers and consumers. A digitised supply chain also provides opportunities for completely new revenue models beyond the redesign of processes. Specifically, a whole range of modern business models are able to monitor a product past the handover to the consumer, and on to actual use. The aim of this chapter is to explain the complexities of the supply chain during the age of COVID-19, which contributed to an improvement in social value for consumers, especially in digitizing the process. This paper is inspired by several sources, such as Deloitte Insight released at the end of 2020, which raises the future of mobility after the COVID-19 pandemic (Corwin, Zarif, Berdichevskiy and Pankratz, 2020). Corwin et al (2020) mention the term ecosystem when describing the reality of mobility during a pandemic. Viswanadham and Samvedi (2013), on the other hand, define the supply chain ecosystem as the elements of the supply chain as well as the entities that control the movement of goods, knowledge, and money across the supply chain. Today’s supply chains, as the final frontier, are being re-architected as environments coordinated by central networks. In this chapter, there are a numbers of case study about limited mobility during a pandemic that triggers service providers to search for innovative ways to survive. Second, with regard to numerous parties promoting increasingly large online shopping activities and enabling the home business sector to be easier and easier to enter the community, this is what is known as consumer social value. This case study will be taken from a variety of Asian countries, one of which is Indonesia. Third, the next challenge facing businesses in managing supply chains will raise the social value of consumers, especially when the pandemic ends.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Surface water bodies, which are sources of drinking water supply, receive a significant amount of pollution from wastewater. This negatively affects the ecological condition of water resources and poses a threat to the health and sanitary well-being of the population. The main pollutants of surface sources are: sewage of economic-fecal and industrial sewage, which contain organic pollutants, surfactants, heavy metal ions; oil products coming from industrial sites and urban areas; effluents from livestock farms and storage ponds of production waste; washing of mineral fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural lands. Adjustment of surface springs additionally affects the deterioration of water quality in them. Therefore, existing water treatment technologies may not always provide the required degree of drinking water purification. According to monitoring studies, more than 38% of water samples taken at centralized water supply facilities did not meet regulatory requirements. This situation encourages the search for ways that would create conditions for more efficient operation of water supply systems. Modernization of existing water supply facilities and application of new water treatment technologies can help solve the problem. The article illustrates constructive schemes of shore and channel water intake and treatment facilities, the use of which makes it possible to reduce the dirt retention load on the main treatment facilities, increase the reliability of fish fry protection and improve the ecological condition of reservoirs at water intake sites. For effective removal of organic matter at water treatment plants, it is advisable to use bioreactors and contact-clarifying filters. Such solutions allow not only to increase the productivity of the water treatment plant, but also significantly reduce its construction cost, simplify the operation of facilities and reduce annual operating costs.</jats:p>"

Consequently, supply chains have been required to reevaluate how to manage their key functions to cope with harsh business environment under this pandemic outbreak scenario. Therefore, supply chain strategies have taken an essential role in achieving resilience, flexibility, responsiveness and sustainable operations. As a result, the introduction of new digital technologies has contributed to enhance organizational performance and to face COVID-19 challenges in global markets. The purpose of this chapter is to provide insights of current literature on supply chain operations by identifying strategic practices within this pandemic health outbreak crisis. The chapter introduces an overview of the supply chain key functional areas. Then, the discussion concentrates on describing a series of observations and empirical research developed by academics and experts on the topic. After that, supply chain strategic practices are analyzed, followed by a description of digital technology as a critical tool to achieve operational excellence and to compete in tougher market conditions. Finally, a conceptual model is proposed to ensure effective supply chain functioning and value creation across the entire firm’s operations. Conclusion are drawn to summarize the contribution of this chapter and to highlight the importance of rethinking new practices for achieving higher performance results. Future research suggestions are presented to advance the discussion and research in embracing new supply chain models under market uncertainty in terms of demand, supply and operations.</jats:p>"

Systematic literature review approach focusing on challenges and policy and economic and business responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online databases utilising Scopus and ISI Web of Science (WoS) for studies published from 2019-2021. 28 journal articles were selected for the final review. There is compelling evidence that COVID-19 has made profound impact that governments and companies seek to strengthen operations and business resilience, underscore the importance of supply chain resilience and risk management is more critical than ever. Prolong COVID-19 trade measures such as borders closure, export embargo and import sanction are a threat to supply value chain and total lockdown should be implemented with caution. Currently, many companies have begun to move from a “recovery mode” to more “sustainable and resilient mode” and have started longer term planning. The implication of the study is that policymakers and business leaders should pay attention to more proactive and flexible policy, economic and structural business reform. This review will help policymakers and business leaders to enforce policy and economic as well as business reform that build upon resilient supply chain to mitigating economic risks in bad times to reduce the effect of COVID-19 on global supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, owing to the increasing demand for water and pressures on water resources as a result of climatic variability, water utilities in rural areas are facing financial, operational and environmental challenges which prevent them from responding adequately. These challenges require highly resilient considerations in the design, construction and management of water supply and sanitation facilities and access to financial resources to overcome unforeseen risks. Oxfam's experience in Tajikistan shows that a community's socio-economic status and water utilities’ business operations were key factors for building the resilience of water and sanitation (WS) systems in rural areas. In this paper, the approach in building WS systems that are highly resilient to disasters or risks in rural areas is investigated along with how different factors such as demand and supply, institutional capacity, access to finance and community ownership affect the sustainability of WS services.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, one of the sources of energy supply is waste incineration. One of the sources of combustible waste is overproduction and stimulation of demand for clothing. The new concept of \"fast fashion\" is to limit the cost of clothing indefinitely by minimizing the cost of raw materials, wages, working conditions, neglect of basic safety rules, etc., and on the other hand - to stimulate predatory demand for clothing through psychological impact on young people through advertising, suggestion consumer \"standards\" of life such as \"every event is a different image\", propaganda of shopaholism, etc. According to research results, burning cotton clothes for heating is possible. However, this produces a significant amount of triatomic (greenhouse) gases, in particular carbon dioxide 102.84 kg / GJ. In terms of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy (emission index), cotton fabric is ahead of all fossil fuels, even coal - 93.74 kg / GJ. Thus, excessive production of garbage through \"fast fashion\" has more negative consequences for the environment than benefits for heat supply. Thus, the results confirm the 12th goal of sustainable development - \"responsible consumption and production\". At the same time, the priority is to reduce the amount of waste production. The main stimulus for \"fast fashion\" is the predatory accumulation of capital by producers. This can be overcome only by reassessing people's values. In particular, it is necessary to form the attitude to money not as an ultimate goal, but as a payment instrument to achieve certain other life goals. In this case, predatory accumulation for the sake of accumulation becomes meaningless. After all, one's own well-being, children's well-being and confidence in the future are impossible in the conditions of low quality of the environment and in anticipation of an ecological catastrophe. This work was done in support of the international campaign \"Fashion Revolution\" for the global fashion industry, which preserves and restores the environment and values people.</jats:p>"

One of the options to reduce the cost of solar collectors and increase their efficiency is to use polymeric materials instead of metals. The main advantages of using polymeric materials in solar thermal collectors are their cost, especially if you are taking into account the growth of the renewable energy market and rising prices for metal .

The United States government response to the pandemic from manufacturing vaccines to distribution to consumers in a very short period of time created further uncertainty as the local authorities where vaccines were to be administrated were unprepared for implementing the vaccine supply chain. The federal pandemic supply chain, Operations Wrap Speed (OWS) actually contributed to confusion, uncertainty and the panic environment at the local level. Panic for the fear of virus and confusion ensued until the end of March 2021. Lack of communication and information sharing among stakeholders are to blame for such an inefficient and ineffective pandemic supply chain execution. Once information filtered through the local level, the pandemic supply chain functioned well as it should have performed.

However, utilizing prefabrication introduces uncertainties inherent with the supply chain of the process. These uncertainties, if not managed, can disrupt the prefabrication process and result in schedule delays and cost overruns. This study proposes a model to measure disruption risks in the prefabrication process. The model was used in measuring the disruption risks of prefabrication of headwalls in patients’ rooms for a healthcare project as a pilot study. The risk model could successfully identify the disruption risks originating anywhere in the supply chain based on input information such as required material quantity, batch sizes of material deliveries, production rates, and batch sizes of transporting the headwall units. Using the model, the project team identified two uncertainties that could lead to possible disruptions: the start of the prefabrication processes and the required production rate to meet the on-site schedule. This is a first step to developing a risk exposure model that can prove valuable to the risk managers to analyse and manage the impact of disruptions. This will help the risk managers in making informed decisions about where to focus their limited resources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a slowdown in the global economy, and the Indonesian economy has also been affected. The implementation of industry 4.0 is considered the right strategy to revitalize the manufacturing sector. This study aims to determine and understand the effect of information technology implementation on supply chain performance through information sharing and supply chain collaboration. This study uses a quantitative approach to measure an independent variable effect on mediation and dependent variables to test the predetermined hypotheses. The data was collected using a non-probability sampling technique with a purposive sampling method through a questionnaire instrument with the total number of respondents of 70 manufacturers in Surabaya. Then, the data were analyzed using Partial Least Square software and Structural Equation Modeling based on components or variants. The results indicate that the relationship between supply chain collaboration and information sharing creates competitive advantages. Consequently, the existence of precise, accurate, and qualified information can facilitate joint decision-making. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of supply chain collaboration with information technology can improve company performance. In conclusion, a manufacturing company can maintain its supply chain performance during the Covid-19 pandemic by implementing information technology, information sharing and collaboration with partners in a supply chain. This study provides insight and guidance for managers on ways to improve supply chain performance. This study can also contribute to current research in supply chain management theory.</jats:p>"

This study examines the use of a multi-criteria decision making method using analytic network process (ANP) to estimate the how supply chain activities of the selected manufacturing firms’ influences its firm performance in other to enhance the satisfaction of customers. The population of the study is the manufacturing firms quoted in the Nigeria stock exchange. An ANP-based questionnaire was administered to Managers of selected manufacturing firms for pairwise comparison of supply chain factors relative influences and dependencies on their customers. A nonlinear network model was built to capture all the factors of supply chain practices and firms performance into clusters, nodes and dependences for the purpose of estimating various influences supply chain practices on the performance of the various companies studied.. Data collected were analysed using software of Super decision 3.0version. The results revealed factors of supply chain practices that have a great connection with one another and strong relationship indicating that without the implementing the key factors of supply chain there would not be a significant improvement in the performance of the organisation which will also affects the desire of the customers. The ANP model has helped to show the interdependencies and feedback among the various factors of practices of supply chain to augment the level of performance of the firms.</jats:p>",

However, the immediate response to an emergency is relatively short in duration, while the services, particularly water supply, often need to meet the needs of affected populations for many years. Often crises are protracted in nature and it is therefore important to understand how service performance evolves and whether service users are satisfied with the level of water supply. This is an important consideration because long-term sustainability may not represent an important part of initial thinking by humanitarian agencies. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees estimates the average time spent by a refugee in a camp is 10 years, while the average refugee camp remains for 26 years. Two questions arise: first, how will humanitarian agencies ensure emergency water supplies reach the desired performance levels; second, how will local institutions be able to manage, modify and finance the services that camp or settlement dwellers and host communities will depend upon. In this chapter the authors explore experiences from two country case studies and monitoring data extracted from ongoing humanitarian crises. The main conclusions are: service level enhancements are often slow to materialise and widespread efforts are required to raise performance levels.</jats:p>",

Under the influence of market segmentation, O2O supply chain  is not necessarily better than single-channel supply chain structure. But adopting advertising and other means to improve consumers’ online channel acceptance, it can realize transformation from single-channel  to O2O structure. The benefits of showrooming effect can eliminate the disadvantage of market segmentation.

The demand projections were computed using simple growth rate model under the assumptions of 6, 7 and 8 per cent GDP growth rate representing low-, moderate- and high-income growth. Results indicated that in both India and Nigeria increase in income do not cause any significant increase in the demand for cereals.  It is concluded that India would be a self-sufficient in rice, wheat and maize with deficit in sorghum for the years 2030, 2040 and 2050 respectively. On the other hand, Nigeria would be plunging into a huge deficit in rice, wheat and a marginal surplus in maize and sorghum for the year 2030 with deteriorating deficits in the years 2040 and 2050 in rice, wheat, maize and sorghum respectively. In the study period, there would be surplus of cereals in the India with exception of sorghum; these prospects need to be strengthened and expand to sorghum through vigorous expansionary production programs as well ensure more availability, accessibility and affordability of cereal among poor families of India.  For Nigeria to meet the future food requirements, the country shall have to either increase agricultural production, or depend on imports. As such, the paper suggests that the policy focus needs to be lunched, towards massive production, productivity enhancement in agriculture, through public investment in irrigation, credit facilities, research and extension.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our conventional, biogenic agriculture (CBA) has failed to provide a reliable concept to feed a growing population in a sustainable way. In particular CBA suffers from severe environmental externalities - such as the massive use of land area, water for irrigation, fertiliser, pesticides, herbicides, and fossil fuel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here we suggest the artificial synthesis of carbohydrates from (atmospheric) carbon dioxide, water, and renewable energy, which would allow not only a highly reliable production without those externalities, but would also open the possibility to increase the agricultural capacity of our planet by several orders of magnitude. Our study shows that saccharose could be produced from CO2, water and electrical energy with an efficiency exceeding 30% equivalent to about 15 kWh per kg of sugar. Factoring in the efficiency of photovoltaic electricity generation we derive a &amp;amp;#8222;sun to sugar&amp;amp;#8220; efficinecy exceeding 6%, which is about 10-times the efficiency of CBA sugar beets or sugar cane.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All required technology is either commercially available or at least developed on a lab-scale. No directed research has, however, yet been conducted towards an industry-scale carbohydrate synthesis because the CBA carbohydrate production was thought to be economically more competitive. However, considering the environmental and socioeconomic externalities of the conventional sugar production, this economical narrative has to be questioned. We estimate the production costs of artificial sugar at about 1 &amp;amp;#8364;/kg. Today&amp;amp;#8217;s spot market price for conventional sugar is about 0.3 &amp;amp;#8364;/kg, however, we estimate its total costs (including external costs) at &amp;gt;0.9 &amp;amp;#8364;/kg in humid regions and &amp;gt;2 &amp;amp;#8364;/kg in semi-arid regions. Accordingly, artificial sugar appears already today to be the less expensive way of production. The artificial sugar production allows in principle also for a subsequent synthesis of other carbohydrates such as starch as well as of fats. These synthetic products could be used as a feedstock to microorganisms, fungi, insects, or livestock in order to enhance also the sustainability of the biogenic production of, e.g., proteins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

In the production process, Logistic supply partner Machining is a Logistics Sub-division whose task is to carry out the distribution process of small parts. Supply is carried out by Man power to the available shelves on the production line, in the process this activity has some potential for waste or what is called Muda. If supply activities experience problems that cause delays in the supply process, then the worst possibility is that the production line can stop and make the company suffer losses. For this reason, it is necessary to make efforts to eliminate these Muda potentials which is the purpose of this research. Process small part is carried out using dolly. This can lead to the potential for Muda. Of the 8 types of Muda, there are potential for 3 types, namely muda waiting, muda transportation and muda motion. For this reason, it is necessary to increase the number of dolly, in order to avoid the potential of double handling. In addition to this dolly, the manufacturing process must follow the rules of anthropometry, which is a collection of numerical data related to the characteristics of the human body in the form of size, shape and strength, as well as the application of these data to handling design problems. In addition to anthropometric data, data are also needed that will affect the design of the dolly such as the size and shape of the box to be carried. By using the 50% percentile of anthropometric data and also box size data, the dolly design to be made is 156 cm long, dolly width 83 cm, dolly height 83 cm and dolly handle height is 96 cm.\n</jats:p>"

This study responds to a gap in understanding the role of supply chains in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and how firms in Latin America, especially in Peru, apply supply chain concepts. Findings indicate that companies should prioritize their integration efforts depending on the type of supply chain strategy. Likewise, results show that customer integration is directly related to a firm’s financial performance. This study responds to the need to understand the development of supply chain strategies and the generation of competitive advantage in Peruvian export-manufacturing SMEs.</jats:p>"

The final model indicated that information management capacity significantly influences the supply chain performance and supply chain management components, namely supply chain competence, practices and concerns mediate the relationship between information management capacity and supply chain performance. The results of this study provide a significant contribution to the theory of resource-based view.

It examines the effect of two strategically important pillars: supply chain relationships or capabilities. However their isolated investigation leads to a limited understanding of “how” they can be combined to increase firm performance. In this study we argue that beyond their direct effects the relational and the capability-based determinants of a supply chain have a network of indirect relationships that concurrently and differentially affect firm performance. Building on the relational and resource-based views we develop a serial-mediation model examining the mediating effects of trust in supply chain and collaborative advantage (i.e. relational determinants), and supply chain agility and coordinated supply chain (i.e. capability-based determinants) of SCM. Through the use of hierarchical linear regression analysis we show that trust, agility and collaboration act as serial mediators that carry the indirect effect of coordination to firm performance.</p>",

In accordance with emergent themes from the data — and given that the Scottish Government, Police Scotland, and the National Crime Agency have all highlighted the significant threat posed by drug abuse and serious organised crime related to the illegal supply of narcotics — it was perhaps not surprising to find drug supply, and drug misuse, at the forefront of the young people's narratives. Therefore, the chapter explores drug supply and the impact on young people, as well as their own descriptions of their roles in drug distribution networks. It would seem that sustained efforts by interventionist agencies, police, and the Scottish Violence Reduction Unit (SVRU) to tear down long-held territorial barriers in the west of Scotland may have had unforeseen consequences in that this has allowed youth to move about more freely and thus develop, or at least engage in, existing drug supply networks. Ultimately, drug dealing has replaced gang violence and many young people are serving as useful points of contact for dealers looking to reach new clientele.</p>",

We estimate, in a difference‐in‐differences framework, that such a reform would: reduce the probability of co‐residential informal caregiving (usually, provided by spouses) by around 18% and, conditional on co‐residential caring, reduce such informal care by 1.3 hours per week. These estimates suggest that an additional hour of formal care displaces approximately 1 hour of such informal care. However, we find no displacement effect on extra‐residential informal caring (often supplied by adult daughters). We also find evidence of increases in labour market participation and hours worked.</jats:p>",

In this respect, water yield is an ecosystem service with significant roles in the sustainability of societies and ecosystems. The present study aimed to model the supply and demand of water resources and identify their scarcity and stress in the Sirvan river basin. For this purpose, we employed the ecosystem services concept as new thinking in earth sciences and using soil, climate, and land use data. Firstly, the Landsat satellite images of 2019 were prepared after different corrections, and the land use map was produced. Then, precipitation, evapotranspiration, root restricting layer depth, and evapotranspiration coefficients of the land uses were prepared and modeled in the InVEST 3.8.9 software environment. The findings indicated that the water yield in this river basin is 5,381 million m3, with sub-basins 5, 11, and 1 having the highest water yield per year and sub-basin 2 having the lowest water yield. Moreover, sub-basins 5 and 11 had the highest water consumption. Based on the estimated water scarcity and stress index, sub-basin 8 has experienced water scarcity and sub-basin 4 water stress. We conclude that applying the InVEST Water Yield model to assess water resource status at the basin and sub-basins level can provide suitable results for planning.</jats:p>",

Broiler chicken is one of the animal protein food products that is favored by people from various circles because it has a relatively cheaper price compared to other meat commodities that provide animal protein, is easy to obtain, and has good organoleptic quality. The purchasing power of the people of the Special Region of Yogyakarta (DIY) is also increasing due to increased nutritional awareness related to the fulfillment of animal protein. The broiler production process contains uncertainty because it is seasonal. This causes a fluctuating price change. Fluctuations in broiler prices are not a new phenomenon in the DIY. Price fluctuations usually occur at certain times such as during religious holidays and this phenomenon occurs repeatedly every year. So we need a broiler supply chain research to maintain price stability using a dynamic simulation system model of the broiler chicken supply chain in DIY. This study develops a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) and Stock and Flow Diagram (SFD) of system dynamic model of the broiler supply chain in the DIY and simulates the model using Powersim Studio 10 software. The simulation is confirmed verified and valid, therefore for the next research model can be used to solve the problem by generating policy scenario.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>Within the boundaries set by public regulation, the drive towards liberalized energy markets in Europe has created space for commercial contracts as a governance tool, aiming to align market activity with fundamental notions of public interest. Concurrently, contractual practice from electricity supply markets show suppliers reserve themselves the authority to change terms and conditions for business customers within the contract period. Such clauses challenge basic principles of contract law, potentially leaving business users in a regulative vacuum, where neither administrative nor contract law doctrines can be relied upon to curtail supplier discretion. Despite this, unilateral variation clauses cannot be assumed to entail an unlimited right for electricity suppliers to dictate the content of the end users obligations. This article examines the legal effect of unilateral variation clauses in commercial standard terms for electricity supply in England and Denmark. Based upon the complex regulatory patterns, and the resulting hybrid nature of contractual practices, we show how contractual discretion is restricted by standards of interpretation. These standards emerge from public law, but will also be recognized as governance structures in certain purely commercial settings.</jats:italic></jats:p>\n<jats:p>Electricity, supply contracts, private governance, variations, authority, discretion, unfairness, interpretation, liberalization</jats:p>",

Thus, it is necessary to sustain a minimal concentration of free residual chlorine (FRC) throughout the entire distribution system. The present study investigated the decay process of FRC concentration in water destined for human supply. The decay was evaluated in bench-scale testing, using sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, sodium dichloroisocyanurate (organic chlorine) as disinfectant agents, and also an alternative disinfectant solution (ADS) produced in loco, with oxidizing and disinfectant properties, which is being used in Brazilian sanitation industry. To evaluate the decay, four models were fitted: first-order, nth-order, limited first-order and parallel first-order, hence determining the corresponding parameters which describe the decay speed of the FRC concentration in water. Achieved results demonstrated that all models were statistically significant and predictive. However, the parallel first-order model produced the best fit. Regarding the evaluated disinfectants, there was preeminence of the ADS solution when compared to the others, since it imparted a higher FRC over time, a behavior indicated by lower values for reaction rate constant in all models and when compared to other disinfectants used in this study.</jats:p>",

The present study reports the application of a Shaft in WTN for improving the efficiency of the pumping system. The Shaft is a hydraulic isolation structure based on a similar hydraulic principle as Break Pressure Tank (BPT). The benefits of using Shaft are quantified based on the two case studies from Maharashtra, India. The impact of Shaft on the WTN is reported using energy grade lines, energy performance indicators, and life cycle energy cost. In addition to the reduction in energy consumption, from the case studies, it is shown that the system’s carrying capacity could be increased by using the Shaft at an appropriate location in WTN. Overall, a Shaft provides operational flexibility to the operators, improving the efficiency of the system.</jats:p>"

In many communities especially in developing countries like Uganda, most households use the indirect cold water supply system, particularly because of the intermittent water supply problems. However, research has linked the main component of this system particularly water storage tanks to contamination of water. There is a paucity of research regarding which features of these tanks contribute to water contamination. This study investigated the effects of storage tank features and cleaning practices on water quality. The results revealed that the treated water received by households became significantly (α= 0.05) contaminated with faecal coliforms (p= 0.001), total coliforms (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and heterotrophic bacteria (p &amp;lt; 0.001) while in storage tanks. Furthermore, Fe, and Mn significantly increased in stored water (with p= 0.001, and p= 0.023, respectively) while residual free chlorine significantly reduced (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The study revealed that tank type, tank connectors, and tank age significantly affect water quality. The study concluded that tank cleaning does not guarantee improvement in quality of stored water. Further research is recommended to determine the best tank cleaning methods and optimal cleaning frequency.</jats:p>"

Fisheries in developing nations are one such sector where the complexity is not only due to the produce being perishable but also due to the livelihood dependence of others in the coastal regions that belong to the section of economically disadvantaged. This paper explains the contextual challenges of fish supply chain in a developing country and describes how integrating disruptive technologies can address those challenges. Through a positive deviance approach, we show how firms can help unorganized supply chains with economically disadvantaged suppliers by carefully redesigning the supply chain through the integration of satellite imagery and blockchain technology. With COVID-19 in the backdrop, we highlight how such technologies significantly improves the supply chain resilience and at the same time contributes to the income generating opportunities of poor fisherfolks in developing nations.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research investigates how biomass supply chains (BSChs) for bioenergy within the broader bioeconomy could contribute to the post-COVID-19 recovery in three dimensions: boosting economic growth, creating jobs, and building more resilient and cleaner energy systems in four future scenarios, in the short term (by 2023) and long term (by 2030). A SWOT analysis on BSChs was used for generating a questionnaire for foresight by a two-round Delphi study. To interpret the results properly, a short survey and literature review is executed to record BSChs behavior during the pandemic. In total, 23 (55% response rate) and 28 (46% response rate) biomass experts from three continents participated in the Delphi and the short survey, respectively. The strongest impact from investment in BSChs would be on economic growth, followed by a contribution to the resilient and cleaner energy systems and job creation. The effects would be more visible in the long- than in the short-term period. Investments with the most impact on recovery are those that improve biomass material efficiency and circularity. Refurbishment of current policies to enhance the supply of biomass as a renewable resource to the future economy is a must.</jats:p>"

Governments, organizations and rights holders struggle to regulate the distribution and consumption of counterfeit products, so that consumer awareness has emerged as to what goods people counterfeit, and most importantly, why people intentionally buy counterfeit items. This article illustrates the incentives that inspire buyers to purchase counterfeit products, tactics that brand owners use to fuel their interest. It involves the development of demand, marketing tactics, and the implementation of consumer approach strategies by brands. It also reveals the complicated logistics and transporting routes creating manufacturing and transit hubs for counterfeiting,; it also demonstrates the lack of government intervention as well as the desperate need for policy revision. This article shows counterfeiting is phenomenon that governments, organizations, and most importantly, consumers all have equal interest in fighting against.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purposes of this study are to introduce the concept of Service Quality (SQ) in E-Supply Chain Management (E-SCM) and its impact on increasing Customer Satisfaction (CS) and provide insightful enhancements to the literature. In addition, the paper also examines the influence of SQ of E-SCM on CS in online shopping. After a comprehensive literature review, four key factors for measuring the E-Supply Chain (Process Control, Interaction with Supplier, Management Support, and Focus on Customers), four key factors for measuring CS (Informing Customers, Attention to Customers&amp;rsquo; Needs, Staff Performance Accuracy, and Easy Access to Services), and four factors for measuring the quality of identification services (Assurance, Accountability, Tangibility and Reliability) were selected. The proposed conceptual model was then presented. This model was validated by data collected through a survey of 150 respondents in order to identify customer satisfaction, including that of customers of online websites in Iran. The sample data was analyzed using SPSS21, after which the interrelationships between the model and factors were examined based on the Partial Least Square-Structural (PLS). Model fit indices were then calculated for the dataset. The proposed model was validated using factor analysis and structural equation modeling techniques. The results indicated that E-SCM has a direct impact on CS. The effect of SQ was also confirmed. A positive and significant relationship was identified between E-SCM and CS, E-SCM and SQ, as well as SQ and CS (P&amp;gt; 0.05). The first limitation was to convince respondents to cooperate with the researchers. The second one was the lack of research-related background due to the subject being relatively new. This study, to the best of the authors&amp;rsquo; knowledge, is the first empirical analysis on the CS assessment of SQ of E-Supply Chain in online shopping. This important link to online shopping has rarely been explored. It is expected that by filling this gap, this study will help in strengthening online shopping, which needs a change in the marketing area.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Securing sufficient truckload transportation capacity is a challenge for most shippers. The dominant design currently used across North America is to run an annual reverse auction collecting rates from carriers on each of their freight lanes (origin-destination pairings) and then feeding these rates into the shipper’s transportation management system (TMS), which then uses a routing guide to determine which carrier to tender a load to when a particular shipment materialises. Unfortunately, the routing guide frequently fails. This results in the shipper having to use backup carriers or the spot market, thereby incurring much higher rates. This paper explains why the current dominant design arose in the first place and why it is no longer sufficient. Four promising practices that can improve the transportation procurement process for shippers, carriers and brokers are presented and discussed: Data-driven analysis, transportation portfolio management, dynamic contracting and continuous procurement. These practices are meant to complement the current procurement methods in order to reduce the risk and level of uncertainty for all parties by making the procurement process more dynamic and responsive to the market.</jats:p>"

Its main focus is\non TSSC successful management model within the chain, addressing the key components. Tourism service supply chain coordination management\nstrategies have already been adopted by many large tourism service providers, such as hotels and airlines, tour operators, and travel agencies.\nAmongst the key benefits that businesses receive are: improved brand value, reputation, image and status. In the context of the current Covid-19\npandemic, special attention must be given to priorities such as cost reduction and operational efficiency. This new study selected to examine the\nTSSC management of bilateral relations in the context of economic disruption: relations with government, tour operators and competitors to achieve\nproductive performance indicators such as customer satisfaction, profit and profit margin, flexibility, liquidity, reliability, productivity, transparency,\nsustainability, and risk resilience. Overall, the management of the tourism services supply chain (TSSC) during the pandemic became one of the most\ndominant topics in the tourism business environment. As circumstances change, consumer behavior and constraints imposed by public\nadministrations, business organizations must respond and change their supply chain management strategy, which depends on the region, size and\nnature of the business. A properly functioning TSSC is the optimal balance between two opposite poles - efficiency and sensitivity, which represent\ncustomers’ satisfactory level. This balance is dictated by the adopted TSSC performance governing strategy, which must specify the relevant\nrequirements for the management of relations with the government, tour operators and competitors. This achieves the level of service dictated by the\nmarket, and provides a competitive advantage. Based on the analysis of the scientific literature and the available empirical data, it has been\nestablished that the problems of the tourism service supply chain lie in its mismanagement.</jats:p>",

The authors provide evidence that the CISG contains rules enabling a general legal framework for establishing uniform sustainable standards for goods concerning suppliers, sellers and buyers located in different countries. For instance, the CISG provisions on contract formation ease the incorporation of joint codes of conduct for sustainable trade in GSCs. In addition, the contracting parties’ circumstances and current trade usages are now more relevant to determine what constitutes conformity of the goods under the contract and the default warranties in Article 35 CISG. On the level of remedies, the authors show that best-efforts provisions, possibly included in a code of conduct or inferred from standards applicable to the goods, may redefine the notion of impediment in Article 79 CISG, which could lead to exoneration of liability for the seller. They also demonstrate why fundamental breach and the calculation of damages are at the centre of the discussion regarding the remedies for breach of an obligation to deliver sustainable goods.</jats:p>",

Competitive AFSC as an important component of AFSC, its investment and coordination laws after using the BBTS obtain more attentions. To explore these laws, we constructed two competitive AFSCs, and each of them includes a supplier and a retailer. Considering the new changes of consumers' perception on product quality and safety after using the BBTS, the demand function was modified. Then, considering the BBTS costs and the new changes of consumers perceived on quality and safety, we built the income functions of chain members under the proposed three situations, i.e., 1) neither of the two supply chains invests in the BBTS, and 2) one supply chain invests in the BBTS, and 3) both supply chains invest in the BBTS. The research finds that: 1) if both of the two supply chains invest in the BBTS, supply chain members will gain a bigger threshold value sum of the BBTS costs, moreover, supply chain members will gain more benefits compared with them no investment BBTS. Thus, governments need to guide more enterprises to adopt BBTS. 2) The competitor’s perceived quality is negative with the threshold value sum of the BBTS costs. When the competitor’s perceived quality is high, investors should reduce investment costs. 3) If investors or decision makers about BBTS want to get a big the threshold value sum of the BBTS costs, they should reduce the cost optimization coefficient and avoid fierce price competition as much as possible. Results can offer a theoretical guidance of adopting BBTS for FPSC.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most countries satisfy domestic food consumption by importing from foreign supplies, thus highlighting the role of agricultural exports in maintaining and diversifying the global food supply. In the age of globalisation, whether the flourishing number of regional trade agreements (RTAs) has been facilitating greater market access of agricultural and food products is questioned by national governments. Meanwhile, logistics performance has been the bottleneck of emerging economies, which exerts negative impacts on agricultural export competitiveness in foreign markets. Overall, the interlink between globalisation, logistics and food supply has not been addressed adequately. Therefore, this paper employs the trade gravity model to examine the relationship between agricultural exports, RTAs membership, and logistics performance in the case of Vietnam and her 97 major trading partners. Static and dynamic panel data estimation are employed with the methods applied to solving the zero trade and endogeneity concerns. Findings confirm the interlink between globalisation, logistics and food supply. RTAs-based globalisation and logistics policies are intertwined to secure and diversify import-driven food supply. The unified framework for long-term and sustainable development which aims at strengthening the interlink between globalisation, logistics, agriculture and global food supply should be considered in policy formulation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Supply Chain Management is in the core of businesses’ operational activities worldwide. Its main purpose is the proper management of resources and the assurance of the sustainable operation of the economic entities. However, Supply Chain Management is exposed to breaches related to the code of conduct as well as fraud. Integrating the principles of Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) can help build a healthy, sustainable, and resilient supply chain. The purpose of the research is twofold and refers to: (i) highlight those factors of the ESG that contribute to the decrease and mitigation of the fraud in supply chain and (ii) the business strategies that can be developed from businesses and can be based on ESG factors. In this context, a log-log model of multiple linear regression was proposed. Secondary data were extracted from the Thomson Reuters database. The model was based on 681 observations concerning companies operating in Europe. The results have led to the conclusion that the existence of policies related to human resources and technology contribute significantly to tackling supply chain fraud. Regarding the first factor, Human Resource is important to feel safe and their rights should be protected by companies. Securing their rights can lead individuals to their commitment to the work environment, as well as to their protection from threats and violations. Finally, the role of technology is fully consistent with transparency in the supply chain. For this reason, the adoption of reliable solutions and technologies, which turn to the green economy, offer visibility and optimization of processes.</jats:p>"

Politics was exceptionally conflictual, interaction between spheres of government responsible for various aspects of water supply far from perfect, with public perception and media frenzy driving a focus on matters which played a very small part in the effort not to run out of water. During this time, Cape Town was building a water strategy, specifically aimed at making Cape Town more resilient against future droughts by addressing all possible factors contributing to the drought crisis. With dams close to overflowing in 2020, the next challenge is to ensure that the strategy is implemented according to plan.</jats:p>",

According to international organizations, a half of the world's population by 2025 will live in areas with significant water shortages. The sufficient standard of living and environmental safety is one of the citizens’ rights defined by the main law of Ukraine, which provides for the provision of quality drinking water in the required amounts and in accordance with established standards for the quality of drinking water. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has approved the concept of the state target social program \"Drinking Water of Ukraine\" for 2022-2026 for this purpose. The unsatisfactory state of water quality in Ukraine is associated with moral and physical depreciation of main resources, underfunding of water supply and sewerage industry. The situation is complicated by the lack of qualified personnel in rural areas. A large part of the inhabitants’ rural settlements use groundwater aquifers for their drinking purposes, which often contain excessive concentrations of total iron. The water treatment facilities were built according to standard designs using non-reagent methods for water iron removal in small settlements. The practice of individual treatment plants operation has shown their low efficiency, due to the unreasonable use of such methods. The improvement of existing water treatment schemes should be carried out taking into account the peculiarities of the physicochemical composition of water and the use of existing water treatment equipment. The purpose of the work is to improve the technological scheme of water iron removal and improve the quality of the filtrate. It is established that the reason for the unsatisfactory operation of treatment plants is due to the low alkalinity of groundwater. The rational types of alkalizing reagents and their calculated doses are substantiated by the results of experimental studies, the dependences of changes in the hydrogen index on the type and dose of reagents, residual alkalinity of water, the efficiency of water iron removal.</jats:p>"

A number of proposals have been made for the etymology of this root, but there continues to be no consensus on this question. The present note argues that the verbal root √prns ‘to distribute, supply’ derives from Greek προνοῆσαι, the aorist infinitive of προνοέω ‘to perceive, foresee; to provide, take care of’.

However, even after more than 10 years of the technology’s existence, it is barely used for any self-sustaining applications. This raises the question of why BC cannot prevail against its alternatives. With this paper we want to identify criteria by which the added value of BCT can be measured. Furthermore, we want to evaluate how well the different supply chains (SC) exploit the added values of BCT. Methods: For this, we identified real-world examples and case studies for luxury, food, and healthcare SCs. These examples are described in detail and then analyzed for their added value compared to possible alternatives. Results: The results show that in the clusters of food and healthcare SCs, no general added value of BC over current best-practice solutions could be verified. Luxury SCs manage valuable products that are typically traded in small quantities. It is within this cluster that the implementation of BC can be justified best. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study shows that the application of BCT is especially beneficial for goods with a high value and low trade volume. In addition, the interface between reality and the digital twin should be as secure as the database or BC solution itself. Furthermore, the demand for transparency and immutability of data should be more important than the need to protect sensitive data. Finally, SC participants, especially the end customer, must also be able to appreciate the advantages of BCT.</jats:p>"

Also, high uncertainty in the planning of demand in oil and gas leads to reordering of unnecessary materials because of high order quantity minimums or having the required parts as a part of kits (usually other items in such kits are nonmoving). Another supply-chain issue is long lead times for purchasing materials, especially internationally. Moreover, additive manufacturing can be a cost-effective solution with less material waste, especially for precious materials. Finally, additive manufacturing can help relieve the problem of working capital being locked up in inventory as a result of accumulation of dead inventory (nonmoving items), leading to scrapping or write-off of unused spare parts.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Fig. 1 compares the cost of traditional methods of reverse engineering with 3D printing. Conventional methods of reverse engineering, such as casting or forging, can be cost-effective for noncomplicated configurations. As the complexity of the part increases, however, the cost increases exponentially, revealing 3D printing as the more cost-effective approach.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Several commodities in the oil and gas industry can be plotted beyond the breakeven point in the figure.

If any certified local workshop or 3D printing facility is able to produce like-original-equipment-manufacturers’ (OEM) spares, then certificates of conformity and warranty should be provided that match OEM warranties (generally 12 months from installation or 18 months from receiving the materials, whichever comes first).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Still, there seems to be no common understanding of the term in scientific literature. Moreover, the broad field of LSCM allows for a multitude of feasible application areas and use cases, yet there exists no conclusive list of them as to date. Methods: This study builds upon a systematic literature review of 66 DSCT articles to identify application areas of DSCT in LSCM as well as specific use cases and their respective intended benefits. Results: To start with, the study derives a unified definition of DSCTs, including possible scopes of applications. Afterwards, five application areas of DSCT in LSCM are synthesized as well as 14 individual use cases and their respective intended benefits. Conclusions: The study leads towards a conceptual clarification of DSCT that is of importance for research and practice alike. For managers it additionally provides up-to-date use cases to guide DSCT applications in practice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supraglacial debris strongly modulates glacier melt rates and can be decisive for ice dynamics and mountain hydrology. It is ubiquitous in High-Mountain Asia (HMA), yet because its thickness and supply rate from local topography are poorly known, our ability to forecast regional glacier change and streamflow is limited. Here we resolved the spatial distribution of supraglacial debris thickness (SDT) for 4401 glaciers in HMA for 2000-2016, via an inverse approach using a new dataset of glacier mass balance. We then determined debris-supply rate (DSR) to 3843 of those glaciers using a debris mass-balance model. Our results reveal high spatial variability in both SDT and DSR, with supraglacial debris most concentrated around Everest, and DSR highest in the Pamir-Alai. We demonstrate that DSR and, by extension, SDT increase with the temperature and slope of debris-supply slopes regionally and that SDT increases as ice flow decreases locally. Our centennial-scale estimates of DSR are an order of magnitude lower than millennial-scale estimates of headwall-erosion rate from 10Be cosmogenic nuclides, indicating that debris supply to the region's glaciers is highly episodic. We anticipate that our datasets will enable improved representation of the complex response of HMA's glaciers to climatic warming in future modelling efforts.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on five classes: ’Inspection Results’, ’Defect Rate’, ’Transportation Modes’, ’Routes’ and ’Cost’. According to my findings, Random Forest classifier indicated 87% accuracy in the ‘Inspection Results’ and ‘Transportation Modes’ classifications whereas KNN classifier signified an impressive accuracy of 86% in the ‘Routes’ classification. These findings underline the need for ML approaches within different classes. The diversified performances of classifiers within classes highlight the importance of selecting the most suitable algorithm based on supply chain aspect. This research not only shows the effectiveness of ML classifiers in healthcare supply chain optimization but also highlights the possibility of automation for different surface of supply chain management.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>he main directions of increasing the efficiency of solid fuel heat generators are analyzed. It is noted that in industrial designs of heat generating installations depending on their class technological schemes of burning of solid fuel are applied at various levels on capital and operational expenses. The most expensive are the technologies of combustion of pre-prepared high-quality fuel in heat generators with complex mechanization at all stages of the combustion process, which provide high thermal and environmental performance. Cheaper combustion technologies are widespread, according to which the normative performance of heat generators is achieved due to the rational ratio of design and mode parameters of the combustion zone with the thermophysical characteristics of the burned fuel, including low-grade. Examples of realization of such technological schemes of combustion on the basis of results of theoretical and experimental researches in designs of solid propellant heat generators are resulted. The paper proposes a constructive scheme of a small-capacity heat generator with a combined technology of two-chamber solid fuel combustion, in which a layered (or shaft-layered) combustion process with combustion in volume is combined: in the primary combustion chamber above the burning fuel layer on the grate, and in the secondary cyclone chamber (or cameras). Due to the vortex motion in the lined secondary chamber of high-temperature gases containing solid particles carried by the flow from the combustion zone of the primary chamber, there is both afterburning of combustible substances and separation of ash particles with their discharge into the ash generator. This combustion technology also allows increasing the forcing of the combustion layer on the grate, increasing the stability of the process and reducing the dimensions of the structure. Improving the efficiency of a solid fuel heat generator with a two-chamber furnace is achieved by reducing heat loss with mechanical incomplete combustion of carbon particles in the exhaust gases, as well as reducing the concentration of ash particles in the gas stream at the inlet of convective heat exchange surfaces and increase their thermal efficiency. This is confirmed by the calculated dependences of the efficiency of the mechanized solid fuel heat generator under different technological schemes of solid fuel combustion</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increased competition, efficiency and profit orientation largely determine the operation of today’s companies. While the XX. In the twentieth century, the emphasis was on mass production, large batch numbers, and economies of scale, until today, consumer demand has shifted significantly toward individualized products and services. The consumer expects almost perfect quality, reasonable price and immediately available stocks. That is why it is necessary to tailor the supply chain to the needs of consumers as perfectly as possible. Every small change in the way a company operates can have different effects that managers need to respond to immediately. In a company where there is some flow of auxiliary fuels, semi-finished or finished products, the proper design of the supply chain is a focal point that largely determines its operation and efficiency, as logistics costs significantly affect the consumer prices of products and services. The solid foundation of my topic is provided by the logistics knowledge and the supply chain management that extends it, which already examines the entire supply chain instead of one player at a time. A XXI. The development of information and IT in the 21st century makes it possible to apply new approaches in this field as well and to develop an approach in which we do not assess the effects of changes in retrospect, but prepare for them in advance. In my research work, the optimization of logistics activities through simulation is the focus. The simulation has been an integral part of technical sports and engineering work for many years, this methodology is not yet used in the field of supply chain management, which would provide an opportunity to analyze the effects of changes without risk and would be a tool for companies to model and measure their activities. And measurability would provide an opportunity for correction and improvement, which plays an essential role in increasing efficiency and effectiveness. Based on this line of reasoning, I believe that the combination of supply chain management and simulation holds untapped potentials. In my article, I will review the currently known and useful simulation methodologies, which shows the processing of the issue and the prevalence of the methodologies.</jats:p>"

Thanks to the recent advancement in IoT, specialized sensors can keep track of the required supply chain environment. With the help of blockchain, the supply chain data can be immutably saved for further sharing with stakeholders. Due to the introduction of AI as an embedded element within 6G networks, the end-to-end supply chain process can now be automated for safety, security, and efficiency purposes. By leveraging 6G, AI, blockchain, and IoT, the supply chain data during the transportation or at rest can be monitored for any changed environment during the movement of the ship through national or international routes. In this paper, we study the requirements of such intelligent and secure supply chain management system conducive to the oil and gas industry. We also show our proof-of-concept implementation and initial test results. Our obtained results show promising prospect of the current system to be deployed to safeguard the oil and gas supply chain.</jats:p>",

The nature of this process is analyzed, and the corresponding demand and supply functions with single- and multi-stage discount strategies are constructed respectively to create a working model. The optimal discount ratios for supermarkets and agricultural cooperatives in decentralized and central-ized decision-making modes coupled with single- and multi-stage discounts are calculated respectively. Finally, a universal optimal strategy is designed, which can be applied to various quantity decay scenarios and makes the discount strategy more generalized. The results show that discounts can coordinate supply chains more effectively; not only is fresh agricultural produce sold before it starts to rot, but the benefit conflicts arising from both supermarkets vs. cooperatives and traditional vs. E-commerce channels are equilibrated. Further, multi-stage discounts are more effective than single-stage ones, but optimal discount ratios rely on the initial quantity of fresh agricultural produce in the supply chain; its market share in the traditional distribution channel; the potential market size; retail price; the price sensitivity coefficient of the channel; the cross-elasticity coefficient of prices between different channels; and the properties of the quantity loss.</jats:p>"

This study includes a comparative analysis of the two machine learning techniques, M5P model tree (M5P) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP), in predictions of the infiltration characteristics. The models were trained and tested using the 7 combination (CMB1 – CMB7) of input parameters; moisture content (m), bulk density of soil (D), percentage of silt (SI), sand (SA) and clay (C), and time (t), with output parameters; cumulative infiltration (CI) and infiltration rate (IR). Results suggested that GEP has an edge over M5P to predict the IR and CI with R, RMSE and MAE values 0.9343, 15.9667 mm/hr &amp; 8.7676 mm/hr, and 0.9586, 9.2522 mm and 7.7865 mm for IR and CI, respectively with CMB1. Although the M5P model also gave good results with R, RMSE and MAE values 0.9192, 14.1821 mm/hr, and 19.2497 mm/hr, and 0.8987, 11.2144 mm and 18.4328 mm for IR and CI, respectively, but lower than GEP. Furthermore, single-factor ANOVA and uncertainty analysis were used to show the significance of the predicted results and to find the most efficient soft computing techniques respectively.</jats:p>",

In this work, 78 articles were extracted from 2016 publications using systematic literature review methodology and were analyzed to answer two research questions: (1) How are the HSC problems that have been solved from Metaheuristics classified? (2) What is the gap found to accomplish future research in Metaheuristics in HSC? After classifying them into deterministic (52.56%) and non-deterministic (47.44%) problems; post-disaster (51.28%), pre-disaster (14.10%) and integrated (34.62%); facility location (41.03%), distribution (71.79%), inventory (11.54%) and mass evacuation (10.26%); single (46.15%) and multiple objective functions (53.85%), single (76.92%) and multiple (23.07%) period; and the type of Metaheuristic: Metaphor (71.79%) with genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization as the most used; and non-metaphor based (28.20%), in which search algorithms are mostly used; it is concluded that, to consider the uncertainty of the real context, future research should be done in non-deterministic and multi-period problems that integrate pre- and post-disaster stages, that increasingly include problems such as inventory and mass evacuation and in which new multi-objective MHs are tested.</jats:p>"

Many business actors are involved in the activities of this product supply chain system, they are supposed to be lower income This research tried to explain in a detailed and systematic description so that the three activities in the robusta coffee supply chain system in Kepahiang Regency. Snow ball sampling method was used to determine actors sample in Supply Chain System of Robusta Coffee. Secondary data was production, land size, and productifity were collected from Central Bureau of Statistics, Regional Agriculture Office of Kepahiang Regency and coffee consumption was collected from International Coffee Organization. Primary data was product, price, quantity, delivery time, payment, and delivery services. Data analysis used Hayami et al model for value added, share margin for financial flow, flow diagram for information and product flows. The results showed that there are three patterns of robusta coffee supply chain in Kepahiang Regency, namely Pattern 1: Coffee farmers –Village collectors – Regency Collectors-Coffee Shop Palembang. Pattern 2: Coffee farmers –Village collectors – Regency collectors 1– Coffee company- Exporter. Pattern 3: Coffee farmers - Regency collectors 2 - Coffee company - Exporter. Generally, business activities in the supply chain in namely 1) categorization of the quality and quantity of large products in the supply chains 2, and 3, 2) Flow of price information is obtained from business actors downstream as price maker to actors upstream as price taker in the supply chain system, and 3) financial flow and the largest marketing margin in supply chains 2, 3 and 1 respectively,and 4) the payment system being carried out in three, namely cash, credit and payment. Value added is received by company was Rp12.151 per kgs since it was grading treatment for gaining better product quality. The development of processing industry of robusta coffee could increase added value of product and income of actors in Supply Chain System, then contribute to regional economy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health issue. One key factor contributing to AMR is the ability of bacteria to export drugs through efflux pumps, which relies on the ATP-dependent expression and interaction of several controlling genes. Recent studies have shown significant cell-to-cell ATP variability exists within clonal bacterial populations, but the contribution of intrinsic cell-to-cell ATP heterogeneity is generally overlooked in understanding efflux pumps. Here, we consider how ATP variability influences gene regulatory networks controlling expression of efflux pump genes in two bacterial species. We develop and apply a generalisable Boolean modelling framework, developed to incorporate the dependence of gene expression dynamics on available cellular energy supply. Theoretical results show differences in energy availability can cause pronounced downstream heterogeneity in efflux gene expression. Cells with higher energy availability have a superior response to stressors. Further, in the absence of stress, model bacteria develop heterogeneous pulses of efflux pump gene expression which contribute to a sustained sub-population of cells with increased efflux expression activity, potentially conferring a continuous pool of intrinsically resistant bacteria. This modelling approach thus reveals an important source of heterogeneity in cell responses to antimicrobials and sheds light on potentially targetable aspects of efflux pump-related antimicrobial resistance.</jats:p>"

Here the soil can be described as cambic chernozem, partially gleized. Wheat plants were fertilized with ammonium nitrate in five experimental doses, 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha-1, respectively. Healthy, intact, with no visible damage leaves were harvested (BBCH Code 45) and taken into a laboratory. The samples were scanned, dried in an oven, incinerated and organic matter per surface (OMPS) was determined. This index described the realized investments in organic substances in the case of leaves and had bigger values for doses between 100 and 200 kg ha-1 N. Moreover, classical gravimetric indices, LDW – leaf dry weight, LAC – leaf ash content, OM – organic matter, were determined in order to realize correlation analysis between all parameters. Also, foliar areas, perimeters and lengths were determined. Mathematical models for foliar area, leaf dry weight and organic matter determination in relation with other indices were developed. Positive correlation were noticed between the majority of the studied indices. Also, PCA and Cluster analysis were realized, resulting in two major groups of plants: those fertilized with N0 and N50, and another group formed by N100, N150 and N200 group.</jats:p>"

This paper analyzes risk in supply chain management (SCM) through the lens of the responsibilities and costs imposed by Incoterms®. The authors also conducted a survey of 100 supply chain decision makers on supply chain contracts creation and Incoterms® knowledge in the population. Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) of Incoterms® reveals many scenarios that pose financial, operational, and even legal risk to firms. Results suggest Incoterms® rules are poorly understood by supply chain practitioners in general, are often chosen by personnel who are not aware of the implications of their choices, and are therefore frequently chosen incorrectly or non-strategically, thereby increasing cost and risk. This paper discusses the implications of the analysis and survey results on supply chain performance as well as mitigation strategies for practitioners in strategically using Incoterms® to remove cost, risk, and delay from supply chain transactions.</jats:p>"

Microgrid architectures increase installation energy resilience through redundant local generation sources and the capability for grid independence. However, deliberate attacks from near-peer competitors can disrupt the associated supply chain network, thereby affecting mission critical loads. Utilizing an integrated discrete-time Markov chain and dynamic Bayesian network approach, we investigate disruption propagation throughout a supply chain network and quantify its mission impact on an islanded microgrid. We propose a novel methodology and an associated metric we term “energy resilience impact” to identify and address supply chain disruption risks to energy security. The proposed methodology addresses a gap in the literature and practice where it is assumed supply chains will not be disrupted during incidents involving microgrids. A case study of a fictional military installation is presented to demonstrate how installation energy managers can adopt this methodology for the design and improvement of military microgrids. The fictional case study shows how supply chain disruptions can impact the ability of a microgrid to successfully supply electricity to critical loads throughout an islanding event.</jats:p>"

An emergency on a single node or line in the supply chain network usually affects other nodes in the supply chain and brings significant risks to the enterprise. The impact of other nodes can cause the entire supply chain network to collapse, especially if the production and operation of a single-node enterprise in the supply chain may be interrupted or malfunctioned, especially in the event of an emergency. It also threatens development greatly, affecting the production and livelihoods of enterprises in the supply chain and people's lives, and has a major negative impact on social and economic development. These emergencies continue to affect the supply chain network, and the originally fragile companies face greater risks. This paper establishes a supply chain hyper-network model considering the risk function under emergencies. When an emergency occurs, the demand in the consumer market decreases or increases due to different emergencies. Therefore, revenue sharing contracts are used to coordinate, build a supply chain network model under emergencies, and solve them to obtain a model equilibrium Solution, that is, the new equilibrium state after the occurrence of an emergency.</jats:p>"

Existing deironing stations using simplified aeration-filtration technology are not able to remove Fe (II) compounds from water in the presence of humic complexes. Therefore, in modern conditions, the urgent task is to intensify their work through the introduction of new technologies, including biotechnology with the development of appropriate mathematical models. It is shown that much less attention was paid to modeling the kinetics of groundwater treatment processes in bioreactors than to traditional physicochemical methods, for which modern mathematical models were developed.&#x0D;\nThe aim of the work is to develop a mathematical model of the kinetics of the process of groundwater treatment in bioreactors. The mathematical model is represented by the Cauchy problem for a nonlinear system of differential equations in partial derivatives of the first order. The system of the Cauchy problem consists of five equations with five unknown functions, which describe the distribution the concentration of ferrum cations, bacteria and the matrix structures in two phases (movable and immobilized) both in space and time. The inverse influence of the characteristics of the process, in particular, the concentration of matrix structures in the inter-pore space, as well as characteristics of the medium with the help of coefficients of mass exchange and porosity, were taken into account. The model allows determining the optimum operation time of a bioreactor between washings</jats:p>"

These mainly include materials for advanced batteries, motors and electronics, lightweight structures, and other components specific to each vehicle type. Particularly strategic and widely used minerals and elements/structures for electric vehicles include nickel, cobalt, rare-earth minerals, lightweight and high strength steel alloys and underlying metals (e.g., magnesium and aluminum), carbon fiber, graphite and graphene, copper, and steel alloying materials. Additional key considerations include those around component and vehicle supply chains, repurposing and recycling vehicle components at end of vehicle life, and environmental and humanitarian considerations around the extraction and transport of the evolving set of materials needed for modern electric vehicle production.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>",

It concentrates on the labor income uncertainty by addressing saving against unemployment risk in terms of changes in credit supply and households’ financial wealth. Time series analysis uses dataset of quarterly observations from 2003 Q4 to 2019 Q3 for Poland. It provides empirical evidence of the negative relationship of changes in households’ financial wealth and credit availability with the household propensity to save, in line with the buffer saving model. Furthermore, it contributes to the discussion on the choice of uncertainty measures referring to the labor market with a recommendation to employ the subjective (perceived) unemployment expectation index rather than the objective unemployment rate. These results are meaningful for policy implications. They emphasize the role of credit availability for household consumption/saving decisions. In case of expansionary monetary policy and making credit easier to acquire for households, all other things equal, a negative effect on the household saving rate may be expected. This poses a question about the risk of households’ overreliance on credit and therefore about their financial stability in emergency situations.</jats:p>",

The results show that JPM organizations implement green purchasing and green selling, while weakly implementing green operations. At the same time, for CA dimensions, the results show that JPM organizations are more concerned with quality, speed (time), and reliability than cost reduction and innovation. Moreover, the results show that the relationship between GSCM and CA is very strong. The results also show that green supply chain components affect the CA of JPM organizations, where green operations have the highest effect on total CA, followed by green purchasing and finally, green selling. Additionally, the green supply chain affects CA dimensions of JPM organizations, where GSCM has the highest effect on quality, followed by innovation, then time, while GSCM does not have any significant effect on reliability and cost.</jats:p>"

Managers try to increase the sustainability of SCs to achieve a competitive advantage in today’s growing market. Designing a sustainable supply chain (SSC) by integrating economic, social, and environmental dimensions affects the SC’s overall performance. To achieve the SSC, decision makers (DMs) are required to evaluate different strategies and then apply the most effective one to design SC networks. This study proposes an assessment approach based on the network data envelopment analysis (DEA) to choose an efficient strategy for each stage of an SSC network. This approach seeks to provide a sustainable design with DMs to avoid imposing additional costs on SCs that result from noncompliance with environmental and social issues. To this end, we consider sustainability-concept-related inputs and outputs in the network DEA model to choose the most efficient strategy for SSC design. The strategy selection process can become an important issue, especially when SCs active in a competitive environment. Accordingly, a crucial feature of the presented model is considering the issue of competition to choose the efficient strategy. Furthermore, undesirable outputs and feedbacks and independent inputs and outputs for intermediate stages in the network system are considered to create a structure compatible with the real world. The output of the proposed approach enables DMs to select the appropriate strategy for each stage of the SSC network to maximize the aggregate efficiency of the network.</jats:p>"

Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) are key\nstructural lipids and their dietary intake is essential for brain\ndevelopment of virtually all vertebrates.

The availability of\nn-3 LC-PUFA in the prey communities is driven by primary producers and\nit is therefore distributed heterogeneously, but predictably across\necosystems, being higher in aquatic than in terrestrial food webs.\nConsequently, the numerous consumers foraging on the interface of\naquatic and terrestrial food webs can differ substantially in their\nintake of n-3 LC-PUFA, which may lead to in brain development, yet, this\nhypothesis still remains to be tested.</jats:p>\n    <jats:p id=\"p2\">2.

Our study thus suggests that increased reliance on low quality diet\nof n-3 LC-PUFA deprived subsidies from terrestrial food web can have a\nsignificant negative impact on brain development of wild trout.

The crisis began long ago, in the 1990s, and is gradually deepening. Several attempts to stop this process and level the playing field at the state level have failed. At the same time, the process of intensive development of such systems has begun in the countries of Northern Europe. Moreover, both at the theoretical level and in the practical implementation of theoretical developments. According to the theoretical analysis of the life cycle of district heating systems, they are now in the fourth stage of their development in the countries of Northern Europe. This stage has the main features - low temperatures in the network (temperature graph), the combination of district heating systems with district heating systems and their deep integration into the overall energy system of cities, as well as the gradual replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. District heating systems in the cities of Ukraine are only in the second stage of development. In order to remain competitive against decentralized systems, a sharp transition to the third and at least partially the fourth stage of development of such systems is required. district heating systems are in the active phase of their expansion in European countries and have great prospects for further development, including in Ukraine. District heating systems together with cold supply systems in the process of development are integrated into the energy supply systems of cities and in general in the urban economy. Renewable heat sources will increasingly displace the equipment for combustion of excavated fuel with the prospect of complete abandonment of the latter. In order to preserve the remnants of district heating systems in Ukrainian cities, it is necessary to study and use the experience of the Nordic countries and organize this work at the state level. Unfortunately, neither the governing bodies nor the general public have this understanding. The extraordinary task is to improve the skills of managers and the operational status of city district heating systems and officials of city administrations.</jats:p>"

This paper analyses the vulnerability of segments of WDNs from the viewpoint of the consumers that is the product of the failure rate and the relative demand loss. Real pipe failure database, pipe material and pipe age data are used to increase the accuracy of the failure rate estimation for 27 real-life WDNs from Hungary. The vulnerability analysis revealed the highly exposed nature of the local vulnerabilities; the distribution of local vulnerability values follows a power-law distribution. This phenomenon is also found by investigating the artificial WDNs from the literature using N rule in terms of isolation valve layout, namely the ky networks, with similar results.</jats:p>",

Thus, the cost of fresh pineapple which is the main raw material in canned pineapple products is inexpensive during its season because of its abandance. The color of the pineapple also determines the price of the canned pineapple. However, the availability of different colors (referred as â€œchoiceâ€ and â€œstandardâ€) is dependent. Specifically, if for a given month the ratio of the choice-color pineapple increases, the ratio of the standard-color pineapple decreases. There are several costs involve such as fresh pineapple cost, can cost, sugar cost, water cost, labor cost, energy cost, and inventory holding cost. This problem is formulated as a mathematical model to maximize the total profit over four-months planning horizon. Two supply uncertainty cases are tested which are low and high ratios of the choice color. The results show that the profit depends on available color ratios of the pineapple. The production planning is best if it matches with the availability of the color ratios. In certain months, some fresh pineapple purchased exceed the need of the production because of the dependency of the two colors. The inventory holding cost also influences the production decisionâ€”whether to produce the canned pineapple in earlier months or it is better to produce only the canned pineapple when it is needed to serve the customer orders.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The industrial sector is experiencing increasingly fierce competition, requiring each company to continue to improve its competitiveness. The competitiveness of the company can be done through improving product quality as well as understanding and fulfilling the needs and desires of consumers. In order to make this happen, it is necessary to pay attention to supply chain activities from upstream to downstream, from selecting suppliers to distribution activities to consumers.X Bakery is one of the food industry sectors in the city of Bandung. In its activities, X Bakery involves several activities, namely procurement activities, manufacturing activities to distribution activities. However, the products produced by X Bakery do not have a halal certificate so it is necessary to check the flow of their supply chain. In their activities, small and medium enterprises are not yet aware of the importance of halal certification in the products they produce, in line with public awareness of halal assurance, the halal supply chain can be a solution to this problem. So that in this study, performance measurement in supply chain activities added several aspects related to the halal concept.The supply chain performance measurement is carried out using the SCOR model approach and the weighting is carried out using the Fuzzy AHP method. Based on the research, it is known that the overall value of the assessment is included in the average category with a value of 69.59. Of the 15 KPIs studied, there are 8 KPIs that are still low. Of the 8 low-value KPI’s, 3 of them are KPI’s with the halal concept, including KPI’s for product storage time, cleanliness of transportation equipment, and product time. Where improvements need to be made in order to improve the company's performance by providing several improvement proposals in order to help improve the performance of the X Bakery company.&#x0D;\nAbstrak. Sektor industri mengalami persaingan yang semakin ketat menuntut setiap perusahaan agar terus meningkatkan daya saingnya. Daya saing yang dilakukan pada perusahaan dapat melalui peningkatan kualitas produk serta dengan memahami dan memenuhi kebutuhan dan keinginan konsumen. Agar bisa mewujudkan hal tersebut, maka perlu diperhatikan pada kegiatan rantai pasok dari hulu hingga hilir, mulai dari pemilihan supplier hingga pada kegiatan pendistribusian ke konsumen. X Bakery merupakan salah satu sektor industri makanan di Kota Bandung. Dalam kegiatannya X Bakery melibatkan beberapa aktivitas, yaitu aktivitas pengadaan, manufaktur hingga aktivitas distribusi. Namun produk yang dihasilkan X Bakery belum memiliki sertifikat halal sehingga perlu dilakukan pemeriksaan pada aliran rantai pasokmya. Dalam kegiatannya usaha kecil menengah belum sadar akan pentingnya sertifikasi halal pada produk yang dihasilkannya, sejalan dengan meningkatnya kesadaran masyarakat akan jaminan halal, maka dengan mengadopsi halal supply chain dapat menjadi solusi untuk permasalahan tersebut. Sehingga dalam penelitian ini pengukuran kinerja pada aktivitas supply chain yang ditambahkan beberapa aspek terkait dengan konsep halal. Pengukuran kinerja supply chain dilakukan dengan pendekatan model SCOR dan pembobotan dilakukan dengan metode Fuzzy AHP. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian diketahui bahwa nilai keseluruhan penilaian kinerja termasuk pada kategori average dengan nilai 69,59. Dari 15 KPI yang diteliti, terdapat 8 KPI masih memiliki nilai rendah. Pada 8 KPI nilai rendah, 3 diantaranya merupakan KPI dengan konsep halal, yaitu KPI waktu penyimpanan produk, kebersihan alat transportasi, waktu pengembalian produk. Dimana perlu dilakukan perbaikan agar dapat meningkatkan kinerja perusahaan dengan diberikannya beberapa usulan perbaikan agar dapat membantu peningkatan kinerja perusahaan X Bakery.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In traditional agricultural supply chain management, due to involvement of many stakeholders in the entire procedure ranging from farmers, retailers to final vendors, it is merely the producer of the agricultural products i.e., farmers get its direct benefit. The middle stakeholders are always more beneficial than farmers and hence, the conditions of farmers are always the same though they sometimes get good earning and it is becoming a very serious concern in India. The major reason behind it, the transparency and traceability of the entire supply chain of this agricultural products journey from farm to vendor shop. In addition, consumers are becoming more conscious of where their food and food products come from. Block chains have distributed ledger technology (DLT) which has potential to provide transparency and trust for agricultural product supply chains at its different stages and even useful for improving its efficiency. This can boost confidence of all stakeholders who are involved in this farming supply chain. This research paper proposes the same concept in its subsequent sections.</jats:p>",

An appropriate planning horizon is important to save costs and avoid over-design. Typically, a master plan is practiced around every 20 years. The complexity of WDN and computational demands have prevented a full network study of the impact of planning horizons on system cost and efficiency. In this paper, a dynamic network model was employed to simulate the growth of WDN under different growth patterns (exponential and linear) and planning horizons to explore the optimum planning horizon under different interest rates. It is found that the choice of the optimum (i.e. least costly) planning horizon is sensitive to the interest rate. For both growth patterns, a shorter planning horizon is favored with higher annual interest rates while a longer planning horizon is favored with lower rates. With the same interest rate, exponential growth pattern generally favors a shorter planning horizon than a linear growth pattern due to more excess capacity provided at the beginning of the study period. The optimum planning horizon is longer than 20 years when the interest rate is lower than 3.0% for linear growth or 2.0% for exponential growth.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, distributed generators (DGs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) introduced into CPPS add uncertainties to both the supply side and demand side of power energy. In this paper, we detail the model of CPPS and its coupling mechanism in operation and discuss the propagation mechanism of cascading failure within and across a physical power grid and a communication network. For uncertainties of power energy in the supply and demand sides, the generation and load of each day are divided into 24 time segments for modeling. In the case study, the well-being criteria and reliability indexes are employed to analyze the effect of DGs and cyber–physical interdependence on the reliability of CPPS when DGs suffer aging failure and cyber attacks, and the simulations indicate that introducing DGs can effectively enhance the period of healthy and marginal states. Furthermore, cyber attacks can sharply destroy the CPPS compared with aging failure.</jats:p>"

The disadvantage of such a system is the limitation of the speed range in which it is possible to power consumers of electric power of a passenger car from the main source: as a rule, the lower limit of this range is 35 km/h. The article proposes a variant of a technical solution that will expand the speed range of using the undercar generator by lowering the lower limit to 25 km/h: it is proposed to provide self-excitation of the undercar generator through an inverting-type DC voltage pulse converter. The parameters of the elements of the pulse converter circuit and the possibility of expanding the boundaries of the high-speed range of operation of the EGV.08.1U1 undercar generator are estimated.</jats:p>",

In this study, I conduct a bibliometric review and computational text analysis of over 2700 publications to identify the key themes, geographies, and public policy concepts (not) examined in the research on energy policy in India. I find that: (i) the literature is dominated by topics in energy supply and less attention is paid to demand-side management, energy efficiency, and electricity distribution; (ii) existing studies have hardly examined subnational policy (-making), especially in the case of eastern and north-eastern India; and (iii) research on both analysis for policy and analysis of policy is limited. I conclude that the current foci lack the breadth and depth necessary for supporting the Indian energy transition and urge scholars to diversify the thematic, geographic, and conceptual engagement in future research.</jats:p>"

The hindbrain has an angioarchitecture that is homologous to that of the spinal cord, and the hindbrain vascular system can be analyzed at the longitudinal and axial structures.

This review discusses the basic pattern of the blood supply of the hindbrain, the development of vascularization, and the anatomical variations, with a special reference to the embryological point of view of two main longitudinal anastomoses (longitudinal neural artery and primitive lateral basilovertebral anastomosis). The formation of commonly observed variations, such as fenestration and duplication of the vertebrobasilar artery, or primitive trigeminal artery variant, can be explained by the partial persistence of the primitive lateral basilovertebral anastomosis. Understanding the pattern and the development of the blood supply of the hindbrain provides useful information of the various anomalies of the vertebrobasilar junction and cerebellar arteries. </jats:p>",

Data quality is one of the most significant factors affecting the analysis results. However, currently, most datasets in inventory databases are generic, i.e., they may represent the material and energy flow of a process at a market average, instead of a specific process used by a manufacturer. As a result, stockholders are unable to track their supply chain to find out the actual environmental impact from each supplier and to compare the environmental performance of alternative options. In this paper, we developed a new framework, i.e., blockchain-based LCA (BC-LCA), where blockchain technology is adapted to secure and transmit inventory data from upstream suppliers to downstream manufacturers. With BC-LCA, more specific data can be acquired along the supply chain in a real-time manner. Moreover, the availability, accuracy, privacy, and automatic update of inventory data can be improved. A case study is provided based on an industrial supply chain to demonstrate the utilization of BC-LCA.</jats:p>"

Two 39-item- questionnaires of a five-point Likert-type scale were used for each enterprise with a total of 134 questionnaires.  Internal consistency of 120 valid questionnaires by using Pearson correlation revealed that the questionnaire was stable and valid. Descriptive statistics for all items of the questionnaire were carried out. The relationship between supply chain practices and marketing performance by Pearson correlation revealed there was a positive relationship between supply chain practices parameters; (supplier relationship management, intermediaries and distributers' relationship management, and customer relationship management) and marketing performance. The correlation coefficients of marketing performance were 0.609, 0.539, and 0.794, respectively.  Estimation of differences in supply chain practices and marketing performance by one-way ANOVA and T-test revealed significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in age and size of the capital of supply chain and job title and experience of marketing performance. In conclusion, this study provides the top managers in SMEs the power to make decisions under normal and abnormal circumstances, as in the COVID 19 crisis, which may be crucial in the survival and existence of SMEs.          </jats:p>"

The smart contract function in the BC will strengthen the execution of credit agreements between enterprises. In the application scenario of smart contract, as long as one party performs its economic activities, the system will force the other party to perform the contract directly, which improves the credibility of all parties in the chain and reduces the risk of default. To avoid false trade, commercial factoring risk management, one is to establish a cooperative relationship with banks. The second is to issue asset securitization products. Third, cooperate with internet financial platform. In 2018, under the background of slower growth in operating income, the balance of accounts receivable of enterprises fell more, and 2019 performance it began to pick up, and the substantial increase in operating income has also brought about a substantial increase in accounts receivable. Since then, operating income has maintained a rapid growth rate, but the balance of accounts receivable has not increased significantly, but has decreased slightly. After the implementation of supply chain financing, the proportion of accounts receivable of B advanced manufacturing company in operating revenue has decreased from 23.17% in 2018 to 13.45% in 2020.

A study of ferritative wastewater treatment from chromium compounds, which belong to the first class of danger. The efficiency of thermal and electromagnetic pulse activation of the process is compared. Appropriate experimental setups were developed and the main parameters of the purification process were studied and determined: the ratio of iron (II) and chromium (VI) ions, magnetic field strength, frequency of electromagnetic pulses, ferritization process duration, temperature and pH of the reaction mixture.&#x0D;\nThe expediency of using electromagnetic pulse activation of the reaction mixture by passing electromagnetic pulses through the reaction mixture has been studied and scientifically substantiated. Rational values ​​of the strength and frequency of the electromagnetic field when using this method of activation, which are 0.01 - 0.14 Tl and 1 Hz, respectively, as well as the ratio of concentrations of heavy metal ions Fe2 + / Cr6 + = 10/1 for washing water chrome plating line . It is shown that purified water meets the requirements of category 1 when reused in production. The results of X-ray diffraction analysis of ferritization sediments showed that stable crystalline phases, such as chromium ferrites and magnetite, are formed with increasing magnetic field strength. The chemical resistance of sludge allows them to be safely disposed of. It is established that this method of electromagnetic pulse activation is not inferior to thermal, and the technical and economic calculations confirmed a significant reduction in industrial costs in its application</jats:p>"

Sequential extraction technique was used to identify the distribution of trace elements binding in different fractions; i.e., exchangeable, carbonate, Fe and Mn oxide, organic matter and residual. Heavy metal concentrations were least at upstream and significantly higher in mid and downstream. Fractionation indicated that dominant metals were bound in residual fraction to the bed sediments except for Cd and Pb, which were bound in an equivalent fraction. Geo-accumulation index factor reveals that the enrichment of heavy metals in the bio-available fraction is contributed anthropogenically. Hierarchical cluster analysis also shows the metal pollution load in the river. Risk assessment code of Cd and Ni showed very high risk (ranged from 54.41 to 85.56 and 20.57 to 44.92 respectively) followed by Pb (high risk), Zn, Co (medium risk), Cr, Mn, Cu, Fe (low risk) in Gomti River water. Further, concentrations of Cd and Pb at mid Lucknow were 31 and 75%, high enough to pose a substantial risk to the environment.</jats:p>",

Sayur Mayur berada di wilayah Malang Raya, Yogyakarta dan Jawa Tengah. Dalam memenuhi permintaan retailer, perusahaan melebihkan jumlah pesanan kepada pemasok sebesar 9% hingga 40% terganting jenis produk untuk mengantisipasi adanya cacat/rusak karena produk bersifat perishable atau tidak tahan lama. Pertimbangan melebihkan pesanan tersebut ternyata berdampak pada timbulnya bullwhip effect atau peningkatan variabilitas permintaan. Maka dari itu, tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui nilai bullwhip effect di tingkat distributor, tingkat retailer dan tingkat retailer kategori produk, sehingga nilai bullwhip effect merupakan dasar penentuan rekomendasi perbaikan untuk mengatasi permasalahan bullwhip effect pada perusahaan. Berdasarkan hasil perhitungan, dapat diketahui bahwa terjadi bullwhip effect sebesar 81.3% di tingkat distributor, 80% di tingkat retailer, dan 66.7% di tingkat retailer kategori produk. Produk maupun kategori yang mengalami bullwhip effect dimana nilai BE lebih besar dari parameternya dipengaruhi oleh adanya selisih yang cukup signifikan antara demand dan order, sedangkan produk maupun kategori yang berada di posisi stabil dipengaruhi oleh selisih antara demand dan order yang tidak signifikan sehingga nilai BE tidak melebihi parameternya.</jats:p>"

Some existing literature has employed producer-specific variables such as quantity sold and producer reputation in hedonic functions to potentially capture supply influences on prices. This practice is inconsistent with the original Rosen (1974) hedonic theoretic foundation. To overcome this deficiency, we extend the literature by using the Rosen two-stage approach, employing data from multi-markets for similar wines to estimate inverse supply functions. The application to Australian produced wines sold in different countries demonstrates the importance of a wine's quality and age as attributes in inverse supply functions. Results imply the additional costs of producing better quality and older wines are increased as both quality and age are increased. Estimates also suggest that lower marginal costs for attributes are associated with a smaller producer size and older more established producers. (JEL Classifications: C21, Q11)</jats:p>",

The concept of human factors in ship design was operationalised into eight dimensions: habitability, workability, controllability, maintainability, manoeuvrability, survivability, occupational health and safety (OHS), and system safety. Inferential statistics were applied in order to draw conclusions, including means comparisons and multivariate regression analyses. The results show that human factors were given significant importance in the ship design. The level of accomplishment of human factors differs from one dimension to another. The highest satisfactory dimension was OHS and maintainability was the lowest, but still considered adequate. Design is revealed to have an impact on human factor ratings. Further, OSV design and human factor ratings are identified as having effects on particular incidents on board.</jats:p>"

Little is known about the effect of genotypic variation in the tolerance to osmotic stress under different K treatments in barley. In this study, we measured the interactive effects of osmotic stress and K supply on growth and stress responses of two barley cultivars (Hordeum vulgare L.) and monitored reactive oxygen species (ROS) along with enzymatic antioxidant activity and their respective gene expression level. The selected cultivars (cv. Milford and cv. Sahin-91Sahin-91) were exposed to osmotic stress (−0.7 MPa) induced by polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) under low (0.04 mM) and adequate (0.8 mM) K levels in the nutrient solution. Leaf samples were collected and analyzed for levels of K, ROS, kinetic activity of antioxidants enzymes and expression levels of respective genes during the stress period. The results showed that optimal K supply under osmotic stress significantly decreases ROS production and adjusts antioxidant activity, leading to the reduction of oxidative stress in the studied plants. The cultivar Milford had a lower ROS level and a better tolerance to stress compared to the cultivar Sahin-91. We conclude that optimized K supply is of great importance in mitigating ROS-related damage induced by osmotic stress, specifically in drought-sensitive barley cultivars.</jats:p>"

Namely, this represents an important moment in the era of depletion of energy resources. The use of solar energy is a promising economical item for all countries of the world, meeting their interests also in terms of energy independence, thanks to which it is confidently gaining a stable position in the global energy sector. The cost of heat obtained through the use of solar installations largely depends on the radiation and climatic conditions of the area where the solar installation is used. The climatic conditions of our country, especially the south, make it possible to use the energy of the Sun to cover a significant part of the need for heat. A decrease in the reserves of fossil fuel and its rise in price have led to the development of optimal technical solutions, efficiency and economic feasibility of using solar installations. And today this is no longer an idle curiosity, but a conscious desire of homeowners to save not only their financial budget, but also health, which is possible only with the use of alternative energy sources, such as: double-circuit solar installations, geothermal heat pumps (HP), wind power generators. The problem is especially acute in the heat supply of housing and communal services (HCS), where the cost of fuel for heat production is several times higher than the cost of electricity. The main disadvantages of centralized heat supply sources are low energy, economic and environmental efficiency. And high transport tariffs for the delivery of energy carriers and frequent accidents on heating mains exacerbate the negative factors inherent in traditional district heating. One of the most effective energy-saving methods that make it possible to save fossil fuel, reduce environmental pollution, and meet the needs of consumers in process heat is the use of heat pump technologies for heat production.</jats:p>"

After restoration of details the assembly of the diesel engine and its test on stands is carried out. The necessary parts are electrochemically galvanized, chrome-plated or coated with iron. Several local wastewater treatment schemes on the plant with utilization of valuable components and their reuse are offered. Wastewater and waste process solutions are conventionally divided into low-concentrated and concentrated. Low-concentrated wastewater includes effluents from the diesel test site, flushing water from plating baths, and discharge of a revolving diesel cooling system.&#x0D;\nA scheme for wastewater treatment from petrole-um products and substances in the form of suspensions has been developed and researched, which allows reusing wastewater from the re-verse water supply to the diesel test site. The schematic diagram of the reverse water supply of the diesel test area will consist of a column electrical flotation coagulator, contaminated water collectors, saturators and pumps. A scheme of electrochemical purification of waste detergents has been developed, which includes receivers of detergent solution, preliminary settling of coarse impurities, column electrical coagulator-floater with soluble aluminum electrodes, electrolyte collection. The peculiarity of the device is the operation of the electrode system in a pure electrolyte, which eliminates the possibility of contamination and passivation of electrical and chemical processes. The electrically generated coagulant is dosed into the reaction chamber, mixed with the detergent solution, coagulates and floats the contamination, which allows to extend the service life of the detergent solutions in two or three times.</jats:p>"

This trend has raised questions about the sustainability of the U.S. timber supply. Our research addresses concerns that rising demand for mass timber products may result in unsustainable levels of harvesting in coniferous forests in the United States. Using U.S. Department of Agriculture U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, incremental U.S. softwood (coniferous) timber harvests were projected to supply a high-volume estimate of mass timber and dimensional lumber consumption in 2035. Growth in reserve forests and riparian zones was excluded, and low confidence intervals were used for timber growth estimates, compared with high confidence intervals for harvest and consumption estimates. Results were considered for the U.S. in total and by three geographic regions (North, South, and West). In total, forest inventory growth in America exceeds timber harvests including incremental mass timber volumes. Even the most optimistic projections of mass timber growth will not exceed the lowest expected annual increases in the nation’s harvestable coniferous timber inventory.</jats:p>"

Many economists (including Campbell) explain the correlation by neoclassical “consumption smoothing,” while others attribute the connection to monetary policy’s ability to affect the business cycle. We agree with Cwik (2004 and 2005) that the Misesian circulation credit theory of the trade cycle, relying on both monetary and “real” (capital structural) elements, is superior to both flavors of mainstream explanation. In this paper, our contribution is to show that the growth rate of the Rothbard-Salerno measure of the “true money supply” tracks movements in Treasury bond spreads remarkably well. This provides additional support for our claim that the Austrian theory of the business cycle explains the “predictive power” of the yield curve better than the mainstream approach.</jats:p>"

This study aims to identify the stages of the information systems planning (ISP) process that affect the success of developing a strategic decision support system (DSS) for improving the decision-making process in the agrifood supply chains. Data were collected from 66 IT executives from Greek small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the agrifood sector and analyzed using regression analysis. The results revealed that situation analysis is the only stage of ISP that predicts ISP success. These findings can assist managers in appreciating the critical role of ISP for improving the performance of agrifood supply chain operations.

They are also being impacted by the rapid development of advanced technologies and Industry 4.0. More specifically, several technologies associated with Industry 4.0 have been identified for their potential to optimize traditional forest supply chains. However, to date, there has been limited research that has systematically investigated these technologies and the scientific evidence on their impact on forest supply chains. This research systematically reviews the state-of-the-art technologies applied in the forest supply chain and reports on the current (and/or potential) impacts of technologies on the transformation of the forest supply chain towards ‘Forest Industry 4.0′. Methods: The systematic literature review methodology identified 45 peer-reviewed studies for inclusion that are analyzed, interpreted and discussed in this paper. Results: This study developed a framework on the forest supply chain in Industry 4.0. This framework has three components related to forest supply chains: current supportive technologies, improvements and characteristics of the forest supply chain in Industry 4.0, and the strategic outcomes in economic, environmental and social dimensions. The reported impacts of technologies in different phases of the forest supply chain are interpreted and discussed. Conclusion: The study results confirm that most technologies in Industry 4.0 have real or perceived positive impacts on the forest supply chain and reported obstacles and challenges are identified. The results of this study also contribute insights on the wide range of options in terms of technologies available to decision-makers to optimize the forest supply chain towards ‘Forest Industry 4.0′.</jats:p>"

Other entrenched human factors, such as authoritarian rule, limited historical investment in rural water services and the gradual decline of national institutions make it particularly difficult. This has manifested itself today into low levels of water supply coverage particularly amongst rural communities. Trust between rural communities in Kassala and government institutions has also declined for those left behind in rural hinterlands. Providing sustainable and resilient water services in rural Sudan is difficult work, not least because of high rainfall variability, inadequate infrastructure and the lack of continuous external support to communities when problems arise. This paper describes efforts to strengthen links between water resources management and WASH, and the challenges faced when national institutions responsible for water resources and water supply are weak. It documents recent efforts to ensure water supply services can provide water year round and increase collaboration between rural communities and mandated government authorities. It is intended to be read by government personnel, non-governmental organisations and other staff that are directly involved in implementing integrated water resource management programmes in complex environments.</jats:p>",

By adopting a deductive approach and quantitative survey method and using a self-administered questionnaire, the study collects data from 102 Strategic Business Units of apparel companies located in the Western and North Western provinces of Sri Lanka. Descriptive statistics are used for analysing data. Results indicate that only a few companies have adopted all the considered GSCMPs making the supply chain a closed-loop while the majority of companies are focused on few practices. The most adopted GSCMP among the considered companies is green production, and the least adopted practice is green delivery. High transport cost is identified as the most common challenge that restricted companies from achieving closed-loop supply chain, followed by high inventory cost and lack of staff. These findings imply the lacking areas which need to be addressed in achieving a closed-loop supply chain in the Sri Lankan apparel companies.</jats:p>"

Using a game‐theoretic model, we analyze three supply chains: a centralized supply chain in which the manufacturer sells products and optional EWs directly to consumers (Model C), and two decentralized models in which products and EWs are sold through a retailer with the EW offered by the manufacturer (Model M) or a third‐party insurer (Model I). We also study cases where consumers cannot observe product reliability and investigate the impact of unobservable quality. We find that the manufacturer generates most profits by directly selling both products and EWs, irrespective of whether reliability is observable or not; whereas the retailer prefers selling EWs offered by an insurer when consumers can observe product reliability but prefers sourcing EWs from the manufacturer when product reliability is unobservable. In addition, when the reliability is unobservable to consumers, the manufacturer always chooses a lower reliability than that when consumers can observe the reliability. Such information advantage (over consumers) on product reliability hurts the manufacturer and consumers, and the retailer. With the existence of a third‐party insurer, the manufacturer may be indifferent or prefer to provide EWs. But having the manufacturer competing with the insurer benefits consumers and the retailer under certain conditions. This study offers guidelines on how firms should determine product reliability and EW prices in different supply chains, and sheds light on where a retailer should source EWs based on whether reliability is observable to consumers or not. Finally, our results highlight the importance of establishing a mechanism to credibly disclose product reliability information to consumers.</jats:p>",

This research aims at estimating the condition of water pipes in Shattora and Shaker Al-Bahery’s water distribution networks, in Egypt. The developed models involve training the Elman neural network (ENN) and feed-forward neural network (FFNN) coupled with particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithms (GA), the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), and the teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm. For the Shattora network, the inputs to these models are pipe characteristics such as length, wall thickness, diameter, material, lining and coating, surface type, traffic distribution, cathodic protection, flow velocity, and c-factor. For the Shaker Al-Bahery network, the data gathered include length, material, age, diameter, depth, and wall thickness. Three assessment criteria are used to evaluate the suggested machine learning models, namely index of agreement (IOA), correlation coefficient (R), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The results reveal that coupling FFNN with the TLBO algorithm outperforms other prediction models. Therefore, the FFNN-TLBO model can be a valuable tool for simulating the water network pipe condition. This study could help the water municipality allocate the available budget effectively and plan the required maintenance and rehabilitation actions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract: The aim of this research is to use a combination of renewable energy sources and conventional diesel generator to model a cost effective, alternative energy source for telecommunication base stations in Nigeria. Actually, this study uses various theoretical and mathematical modelling tools, such as, Mat lab Simulink and HOMER software. In the same way, the study references several Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) from gsm providers at select geographical locations in Rivers State. The study references BTS infrastructure in locations such as Ogoni, Port Harcourt and Emohua. These locations were selected to reflect different climatic conditions in Rivers state. Against this background, various hybrid combinations comprising at least two sources of renewable energy e.g Wind Turbine generator(WTG) and Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) were modelled. Also, Fuzzy logic optimization algorithm was used in tracking the maximum power in the SPV. A sample Diesel Generator(DG) was studied to analyze which possible combination gives optimum performance and is most cost effective. The total cost for installation and maintenance of the hybrid system was also considered. Consequently, one of the common negative effects of conventional power generation and usage, which is environmental pollution, was also highlighted during the study. In the course of this research, Homer was used to model a hybrid system in which the initial capital Cost (ICC) was N101,517,040 for 96 nos battery, 1 no 10kw WTG, 1 no hydro-turbine, 48 nos converters, labour etc. The replacement cost for component has a depreciation of 30%; while maintenance for diesel is 30% of the ICC. Eventually, the results obtained from the simulations showed that with an increase in supply from renewable energy sources the overall cost spent when compared to using a diesel generator only is cut by 50%, while the pollution effects also dropped. In fact, the cost also reduces if the renewable energy system is designed efficiently to track and harness maximum power. Furthermore, it is also evident that the location of the base station site and the availability of Renewable energy source affects the efficiency and cost of the entire system. Hence, it is recommended that any telecommunication company which intends installing a hybrid power system for its base stations must carry out detailed feasibility studies using input parameters described here; especially, as it relates to siting of base stations in rural off-grid areas.

The research study used previous literature, observation, questionnaires, and in-depth interviews with experts on drivers and barriers to implementing Green Supply Chain Management in construction. Data were analysed using SPSS and evaluated by the ordinal regression analysis method. Based on testing in ordinal regression analysis, seven factors were identified as drivers or barriers to the adoption of GSCM in construction projects in Central Java Province, and four of them affect significantly. The driving factors that significantly affect the adoption of GSCM include government regulations on environmental protection and pressure from the supply chain stakeholders. On the other hand, the barrier factors include the shortage of suppliers who implement GSCM practices in the construction area and inadequate knowledge and awareness about the impact of construction activities on the environment. This work could give the policymakers’ insight into the barriers and drivers to GSCM, thus enabling them to develop strategies in implementing GSCM in the construction industry.</jats:p>"

The study aim is to assess the water resource potential as the basis for the functioning of the water-chemical complex, to determine the levels of technogenic impact on the water resource potential. A review of the sources was carried out using the Google Scholar database by filtering for the period from 2010 to 2021 and mainly revising publications on numerous samples related to monitoring and control of the state of the water management complex of the Poltava region. According to the official report of 2019, the rivers Dnieper, Psel, Sukhoi Omelnik, Uday received an assessment: slightly polluted waters, the Vorskla and Orzhitsa rivers are moderately polluted waters. The main ingredients responsible for the low water ratings as of 2019 are phosphate ions, manganese, as well as nitrite nitrogen, total iron and BOD5. The manganese content was measured in three rivers, and the average estimate ranged from 5.8 in the Psel River to 11.85 in the Vorskla River. According to the Regional Office of Water Resources in the Poltava region, in 2019, 109.8 million m3 were withdrawn from the natural water bodies of the Poltava region, namely underground water bodies, which is 4.6 million m3 less than in 2018 (or 4.0 %), including 69.83 million m3 (which is 3.29 million m3 or 4.5 % less than in 2018). However, the total water intake in the region over the past 10 years has decreased by 2.2 times. A positive trend is that all discharges occur at treatment facilities of housing and communal services. There is no discharge of return water without treatment into surface water bodies of the Poltava region; however, within the boundaries of settlements there is a discharge of under-treated municipal wastewater and runoff from the urbanized territory. Consequently, balancing water use is possible by introducing waterless, low-water and water-saving technologies in all sectors of the economy, maximum use of water in recycling water supply systems; replacement of physically and morally worn out water supply and water protection equipment, etc.</jats:p>"

Some authors showed that sustainable supply chain management doesn’t contribute to the financial performance, while others found the opposite. This research paper is fully in line with this debate and aims to investigate the relationship between the financial performance and the supply chain’s sustainability of Moroccan industrial companies listed on the stock exchange and belonging to three different sectors. A statistical analysis was carried out using the database of Vigeo Eiris, an international environmental, social and corporate governance research and rating agency founded in 2002, and companies’ annual reports. Results show that sustainable relationships with partners in the upstream supply chain impact the financial performance of companies in different ways, depending on the characteristics of each sector. The findings of this research have financial, ecological and social implications as they can help companies understand the importance of having an efficient supply chain while being environmentally and socially responsible.</jats:p>"

The production of fossil fuels is also increasing, but for various reasons it cannot fully cover the required amount from consumers. One of the most important consumption sectors is heat loads from heating, ventilation and hot water supply of industrial and residential buildings. To cover the thermal loads of heating and hot water supply, the necessary heat carrier is water heated to a certain temperature. The most promising from the point of view of heating water for hot water supply are solar collectors. Hot water for heating needs to be reheated practically throughout the entire heating period. The introduction of heat pumps is promising. When using solar collectors, the heating agent can be reheated in heat pumps.&#x0D;\nThe aim of the study is to develop such a combined heat supply system that uses more renewable energy and as a peak source a fossil fuel boiler (electric energy), as well as a method for calculating this system to determine the optimal composition of equipment and rational modes of its operation.&#x0D;\nThe methodology for calculating heat supply systems combining solar collectors, heat pumps and fossil fuel boilers is presented. The problem of load distribution between the main elements of the combined heat supply system should take into account the probabilistic component. This is due to the fact that with a changing real mode of operation, different thermal load of the equipment can be optimal. This is primarily influenced by the variable heat inputs from solar collectors during the day. According to the above method, it is possible to determine the optimal parameters of the heat supply system for different operating modes, at which the minimum consumption of fossil fuel will be ensured.</jats:p>"

WSSs considered include household water-saving fixtures and appliances whose water flows impact water distribution system (WDS) and sanitary sewer (SS) hydraulic performances in different ways. In the proposed flexible approach, a multi-objective optimisation problem was formulated and solved considering trade-offs of three objectives: (1) maximisation of the average cost savings (2) maximisation of the average WDS resilience index and (3) minimisation of the average SS self-cleansing velocity deficit factor. The decision variables include water-saving fixture and appliance capacities that are applied in a deterministic or flexible manner at a household level. The constraints include WDS and SS hydraulic requirements together with decision bounds of the available water-saving scheme capacities. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm was used to obtain trade-off solutions. This method was demonstrated in the corresponding WDS and SS network subsystems of Tsholofelo extension in Gaborone, Botswana. The results indicate that WSSs lead to visibly conflicting WDS and SS hydraulic performances. Moreover, considering the uncertainty inherent in water demand and the corresponding planning and management of WDSs and SSs provides more sustainable solutions as demand uncertainties unveil.</jats:p>",

In this study, the risks associated with the LNG supply chain are categorized into four dimensions: Political and regulatory, safety and security, environmental effects, and reliability of new technologies. A SWOT method is then implemented to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats within the LNG supply chain, where the LNG supply chain of Qatar is considered as a case study. Relevant strategies are then recommended using a SWOT matrix to maximize strengths and opportunities, while avoiding or minimizing weaknesses and threats within the LNG supply chain. Finally, major parameters to be considered to develop a resilient LNG management model are listed based on the level of priority from LNG producer and receiver perspectives. Thus, as part of creating a robust LNG supply chain, decision-makers and stakeholders are urged to use the learnings from the SWOT analysis and experiences from LNG supply chain management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of the study was to investigate the topography of permeable (nutrition) arteries in the lower third of leg during human ontogenesis. Materials and methods. The research was conducted on 30 specimens of human prefetuses and fetuses aged 3-9 months of prenatal development; 28 bone specimens of adult tibia and fibula and 27 series of computerized tomography scans of lower extremities of adults aged 21-72 were used. We have used a complex of methods for morphological research: anthropometry, morphometry, macromicroscopy, injections of blood vessels of X-ray contrasting mixtures, three-dimensional reconstruction and statistical analysis. Results and discussion. Cartilage osteogenesis occurs in the prefetal period of prenatal human development, in which blood vessels play a crucial morphofunctional role. During endochondral ossification of the tibia, the vessels of the bone cuff grow into the diaphysis of the cartilaginous model of the bone and osteogenic cells go beyond their limits. In the third trimester of prenatal development, blood vessels grow into the epiphyseal part of the cartilaginous model and an epiphyseal centre of ossification forms. Between the epiphysis and diaphysis centers of ossification, a metaphysical growth plate forms that develops intraosseous anastomosis between the diaphyseal and metaphysical blood vessels. In the metaphysis region, there are extra-skeletal anastomoses. Often, the insertion of nutrition arteries into the bone of the tibia is usually the middle third of bones (55%) and distal metaphysis (37%). In 10%, there were nutrition foramina in the upper third of the tibia. Three-dimensional reconstruction also clearly shows a more extensive and developed network of vessels in the bone marrow canal in metaphysical regions. In the middle third of the tibia and fibula, 1-3 nutrient foramina can be traced on most specimens. On the fibular, in addition to the posterior-medial localization of the nutrient arteries, there were variants with a \"high\" (above the metaphysis) placement of the entrance of the vessel into the bone substance. Conclusion. The most common places where arteries enter the bones of the lower leg are the middle third of the bones (55%) and the distal metaphysis (37%). In 10%, there were nutrient foramina in the upper third of the tibia. The three-dimensional reconstruction also clearly shows a more extensive and developed network of vessels in the bone marrow canal in metaphysical regions. During the postnatal period, we most often encountered the localization of nutritional arteries on the anterior-lateral surface of the tibia (23%), or their combination – the presence of both nutrient arteries on the posterior and medial bone surfaces (18.3%)</jats:p>",

First, the purpose of this article is to evaluate the possible effects of fiscal and monetary policy on Iraq's balance of payments. Second, the paper examines how these exchange rates are priced during an expansionary monetary policy phase to understand better how unconventional instruments impact them. The analysis indicates that the Iraqi economy became burdensome with the various economic problems represented by high inflation rates, high volume of external indebtedness, and deterioration of the exchange rate of the Iraqi dinar and others. The results also reveal the mismanagement of the ruling regime, whose decisions focused on strengthening the fragile pillars of its rule. The decisions made were political before they were economical and targeted the regime's interests before they were aimed at the interests of the economy.</jats:p>"

The Mendeley database was used to gather English papers on the blockchain domain. Descriptive findings from the review showed that research on the topic was predominant in 2020, which could be attributed to the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, transparency, trust-building and traceability were the most acknowledged benefits of blockchain technology in supply chains. Despite these benefits, some underlying challenges impeding blockchain implementation include the high cost of adoption, limited knowledge on blockchain architecture, and lack of formal laws and regulations of blockchain platforms. Therefore, it is recommended that intense education and capacity-building training should be channelled to supply-chain firms. Further, government and stakeholders should focus on scaling the blockchain-enabled supply chain to ensure the continuous distribution of goods and services in the wake of any unforeseen pandemic such as COVID-19. As such, research targeted at investigating small-scale agribusinesses' readiness to accept blockchain technology would be necessary.</jats:p>",

A qualitative analysis was performed in cooperation with domain experts who practise Food Supply Chain (FSC) through interviews with managers from the Libyan food industrial organizations. For each BSC perspective, a set of 20 KPIs was considered in the analysis, a total of 80 KPIs related the four perspectives. KPIs were collected through studying previous studies and researches related food supply chain. The questionnaire was prepared and distributed on (125) individuals who work in the five levels of SC; (25) individuals for each level, namely, suppliers (S), manufacturing (M), wholesalers (W) retailers (R) and customer (C). The questionnaire was analysed, results highlighted only a shortlist of metrics (only 7, 5, 7, 4 KPIs) respectively for financial, customer, internal process, and learning &amp; growth perspectives. Consequently, a generic BSC model was constructed that can be used for any stage of the food supply chain that includes suppliers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and customers. The proposed model was agreed upon by the industrial experts. Different performance criteria that can be measured by the proposed BSC include reliability, integration, agility, responsiveness, risk management, product safety, collaboration, assets management, cost/profit, time, and sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since 2016, Canada’s federal government has pledged to factor in upstream emissions during the environmental impact assessment of fossil fuel energy projects. The upstream emissions attributable to a proposed project could be compared against a rejection threshold—a maximum permissible level of emissions—or the firm could be mandated to offset the attributed emissions. We adopt a cooperative game-theoretic model and propose the nucleolus mechanism to apportion upstream emission responsibilities in a fossil fuel supply chain, represented by a directed tree, wherein the nodes correspond to various entities in the supply chain such as extractors, distributors, refineries, and end consumers. The nucleolus allocation avoids the distortionary effects of double counting and exhibits a certain consistency property that is especially important in a regulatory context wherein fossil fuel supply chains span multiple legal jurisdictions. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the nucleolus and further prove that it arises as the unique subgame perfect equilibrium allocation of a noncooperative game induced by two easily stated and verifiable policies, thereby providing an implementation framework. We then demonstrate the strong Nash stability of the nucleolus mechanism subject to the two policies, study its sensitivity to parameter changes, and characterize it on the basis of fairness considerations. Furthermore, under the common assumption that the emissions allocated to a firm and the resulting financial penalties do not impact the revenues from the firm’s core operations, we also provide lower-bound guarantees on the welfare gains it delivers to firms in the fossil fuel supply chain and on the incentives it offers such firms to adopt emission abatement technologies. Finally, we contextualize our discussion with a case study on a proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline in Western Canada. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization. </jats:p>",

The main objective of air conditioning, which is impacted by duct position, is to provide thermal comfort in the room. Using Computational Fluid Dynamic, a controlled zone is designed and analyzed in the room with fourteen different duct position cases (ANSYS - FLUENT). The duct position is then optimized based on thermal comfort and uniform distribution of air temperature.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we conducted multivariable regression analysis with the Physician Uneven Distribution Index (PUDI), a recently developed and adopted policy index in Japan that uniquely incorporates the gap between medical supply and demand, as the independent variable and CeVD death rate as the dependent variable. Population density, mean annual income, and prevalence of hypertension were used as covariates. Results: The coefficient of the PUDI for the CeVD death rate was −0.34 (95%CI: −0.49–−0.19) before adjusting for covariates and was −0.19 (95%CI: −0.30–−0.07) after adjusting. The adjusted R squared of the analysis for the PUDI was 0.71 in the final model. However, the same multivariable regression model showed that the number of physicians per 100,000 people (NPPP) was not associated with the CeVD death rates before or after adjusting for the covariates. Conclusion: Incorporating the gap between the medical supply and demand in physician maldistribution indices could improve the responsiveness of the index for assessing the disparity in healthcare outcomes.</jats:p>"

The algorithm is based on the linear programming (LP) embedded inside a multi-objective genetic algorithm, which enables engineering criteria, such as the minimization of the boundary pipes and the maximization of the uniformity of DMAs, to be considered in the partitioning. Furthermore, the application of the algorithm on the dual network topology based on segments and valves guarantees that configurations of DMAs that respect the real positions of isolation valves for WDN partitioning are obtained. After being described on a small WDN, it is successfully validated on a large size WDN, proving better performance than other algorithms in the scientific literature for the generation of engineeringly appealing DMA configurations, with almost identical hydraulic performance to the unpartitioned WDN.</jats:p>",

Public transportation is an important contributing factor to urban sustainability. Effective transportation networks that incorporate public transit livable by easing commute and transportation needs and increasing accessibility. To assess public transportation accessibility in metropolitan networks, two indices are used: the supply level of urban public transportation facilities resource and the public transportation-private automobile traveling time ratio. As the research in the Wolaita sodo town region and the assessment system, an evaluation technique for urban public transportation facility resource supply is developed based on accessibility. Accessibility is a representative indicator for evaluating the supply of bus system. Traditional studies have evaluated the accessibility from different aspects. Considering the interaction among land use, bus timetable arrangement and individual factors, a more holistic accessibility measurement is proposed to combine static and dynamic characteristics from multisource traffic data. The objective is to highlight the main lessons learned and identify knowledge gaps to guide the design and evaluation of future transport investments. Moreover, studies looking at ways to improve the operational efficiency of systems and those seeking to promote behavioral changes in transport users offer great potential to generate learning that is useful for the public and private actors involved.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>: Foodshed approaches allow the assessment of the theoretical food self-sufficiency capacity of a specific region based on biophysical conditions. Recent analyses show that the focus needs to be shifted from foodshed size portrayed as an isotropic circle to a commodity-group-specific spatial configuration of the foodshed that takes into account the socio-economic and biophysical conditions essential to the development of local food supply chains. We focus on a specific animal product (beef) and use an innovative modeling approach based on spatial analysis to detect the areas of the foodshed dedicated to beef feeding (forage, pasture, and grassland), considering the foodshed as a complex of complementary areas called an archipelago. We use available statistical data including a census to address the city-region of Avignon (France) covering a 100 km radius. Our results show that the factors driving the use of short supply chains for beef feeding areas are the foodshed archipelago&amp;rsquo;s number of patches, the connectivity between them, and the rugosity of the boundaries. In addition, our beef self-sufficiency assessment results differ depending on geographical context. For instance, being located within the perimeters of a nature park seems to help orient beef production towards short supply chains. We discuss possible leverage for public action to reconnect beef production areas to consumption areas (the city) via short supply chains (e.g. green, home-grown school food programs) so as to increase local food security through increased local food self-sufficiency.</jats:p>"

The experiments consisted of creating flow conditions carrying sediments with mean diameters of D50 = 0.5, 0.6, and 2.84 mm over both smooth and rough beds. Various sediment concentrations were injected at the upstream end of the flume at non-deposit injection rates to study the effect of various concentrations on flow resistance. The effect of sediment movement on flow resistance was examined by comparing the results with those of clear-water flows (without sediment injection on both smooth and rough beds). The results showed that the sediment transport at maximum injection rate may increase the friction factor up to 50% and 58% in the smooth bed, and up to about 75% and 80% in the rough bed with mean diameter of 0.5 and 0.6 mm. In addition, for D50 = 2.84 mm, the friction factor decreased in the smooth bed and increased up to 50% in the rough bed. In general, it can be concluded that bed-load transport can be increased by the flow friction factor. The results also showed that bed-loads may decrease the average velocity and increase shear velocity with extraction of momentum from the flow, and both the mentioned factors may increase the flow friction factor. Raising the bed-load concentration in the flow may increase the elevation of the friction factor, approaching a constant value after reaching the aggregation threshold and generation of bed-forms.</jats:p>",

Through the performance evaluation of the green supply chain, we can understand the operation of the whole supply chain and its shortcomings, provide a basis for improving related processes, and have important practical significance for improving the competitiveness and protection of its products. First of all, by summarising and analysing the research status of sustainable supply chain management in different countries, the research idea and overall background of this paper are proposed. It discusses the theory of sustainable supply chain management and the performance evaluation system and calculation types of sustainable supply chain management. Finally, the relative weight of each index is determined based on the sustainability calculation method, and then the decentralisation degree of the index is constructed. During this period, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to evaluate the performance of sustainable supply chain, conduct case analysis and summary, and evaluate the performance of green supply chain component in economic, social, environmental and other aspects. In this paper, representative companies are selected as examples to evaluate their green supply chain management performance, and the evaluation algorithm is studied based on sustainable calculation method. The results show that a reasonable and effective evaluation of the enterprise performance of green supply chain management and a sustainable algorithm study can effectively identify potential problems in the operation of the company and improve the overall operation of the company at this stage.</jats:p>",

The city of Brno, Czech Republic, was chosen for this study because it has a long history in the field of water supply, and the city has changed rapidly over the last 200 years. The city’s development necessitated an adaptation of drinking water sources, most significantly the use of the Březová nad Svitavou facility, which resulted in a change of condition of the Svitava River. The notable decrease in river flow, aided by industrial development of settlements within the Svitava River catchment between 1850 and 1950, strongly contributed to the spread of river pollution. However, the construction of wastewater treatment plants during recent decades led to a restoration of river quality and, consequently, of the entire environment of the Svitava River catchment. This paper also presents a view on activities connected with the long term surface water quality monitoring and improvement with regard to water quality conditions in spring areas and the river network influenced by the water supply system.</jats:p>"

There has been previous literature on improving the prefabrication supply chain integration, but few studies about the role of technology in this sector. Therefore, this article provides intuitions into the applicability and benefits of advanced technologies, namely blockchain, for improving supply chain integration in the context of prefabrication in New Zealand. A questionnaire survey was used to identify the channels used for information exchange between clients and contractors. Moreover, the questionnaire ascertained the positive effects of blockchain on enhancing supply chain integration between the two partners. Blockchain has proven to be a secure information integration instrument that can improve the integration of the prefabrication supply chain by fostering collaboration between organisations.</jats:p>"

However, because the global warming problem, various government agencies have rigorous environmental rules and policies, to such an extent that they are forcing companies particularly those that make up the automotive industry, to adopt measures to reduce the pollution generated by their supply chain, since it is one of the industries that generates most pollution globally. Thus, the objective of this study is to provide empirical evidence that helps fill the gap in the current literature, and to analyze the relationship between green supply chain management and business performance, through quantitative, explanatory research, and correlational, through the application of structural equation models. The results obtained show that green supply chain management is correlated by 47.6% with business performance, which allows to conclude that green supply chain management not only improves environmental sustainability, but also increases business performance of companies in the automotive industry.</jats:p>"

This issue arose from the fact that during the operation of the helicopter on the territory of African countries with a hot climate, the engine overheated. The use of helicopters in these conditions was due to the demand in the aviation market. To solve the problem, new elements of the cooling system were selected, i.e. radiator and two types of fans. The research was aimed at increasing the heat transfer from the radiators of the cooling system by increasing the size of the radiator and increasing the air flow rate through the radiator. 3D modeling, design of a new cooling system (CO), and then design of CO in two versions with TEMIC and SPAL fans were done. First, ground and flight tests for two prototypes in a temperate climate were done, as a result of which a prototype with the best performance parameters was determined. During the tests the equipment and measuring instruments were used: voltmeter, ammeter, voltmeter; shunt; motor tester with the ability to transfer data via Bluetooth; smartphone with OpenDiag software installed, which is included and connected to the motor tester via Bluetooth, helicopter objective control system, flight data registration system, equipment and devices normally installed on the helicopter. For flight tests in hot climates, a new cooling system with a SPAL fan was used, these tests lasted three days. This article describes the final stage of a series of tests for the effectiveness of the cooling system of a helicopter and an analysis of the results obtained with confirmation of the final achievement of the set goals, i.e. raising the upper temperature limit of the outside air for the safe operation of the helicopter.</jats:p>"

This paper discusses the lack of motivation for investing in fresh-keeping technology for agricultural products by individual members of an agricultural supply chain composed of a supplier and a retailer by means of mathematical models and data simulations and discuss the optimal price-invest strategies under different sales models.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>First, based on the model of no investment by both sides (NN), this paper considers three models: supplier only (MN), retailer only (NR) and cooperative investment (MR). Then, the authors analyze the influence of consumer price sensitivity and freshness sensitivity on the investment motivation of agricultural products under four models. Subsequently, the paper makes a sensitivity analysis of the optimal strategies under several models, and makes a game analysis of the suppliers and retailers of agricultural products. Finally, we conduct an empirical analysis through specific values.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The results show that (a) when the two sides cooperate, the amount of investment is largest, the freshness of the agricultural products is highest, and the sales volume is greatest; however, when both sides do not invest, the freshness of agricultural products and sales volume are lowest. (b) The price and freshness sensitivity of the consumer have an impact on investment decisions. Greater freshness sensitivity corresponds to a higher investment, higher agricultural product price, greater sales volume, and greater supply chain member income and overall income; however, greater price sensitivity corresponds to a lower investment, lower agricultural product price, lower sales volume, fewer supply chain members and lower overall income. (c) The investment game between the supplier and retailer is not only related to the sensitivity to price and freshness but also to the coordination coefficients of interest. At the same time, the market position of agricultural products should be considered when making decisions. The market share of agricultural products will affect the final game equilibrium and then affect the final benefit of the supply chain and individual members.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>These results provide managerial insights for enterprises preparing to invest in agricultural products preservation technology.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>At present, the main problem is that member enterprises of agricultural supply chains operate based on their own benefits and are resistant to investing alone to improve the freshness of agricultural products. Instead, they would prefer that other members invest so that they may reap the benefits at no cost. Therefore, the enterprises in each node of the agricultural product supply chain are not motivated enough to invest, and competition and game states are observed among them, and such behavior is definitely not conducive to improving the freshness of agricultural products. However, the current research on agricultural products is more about price, quality and greenness, etc., and there are few studies on agricultural investment. Through the establishment of the model, this paper is expected to provide theoretical suggestions for the supply chain enterprises that plan to invest in agricultural products preservation technology.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The presence of cuts of the temperature graph, the use of other methods of central regulation, are not reflected in the regulatory documents and require special research, which determines the relevance of the work. Heat losses through thermal insulation structures of pipelines have been determined for various graphs of central regulation. Heat losses were determined for each external temperature, taking into account its duration. It is shown that the average linear annual heat losses for most of the graphs correspond to a lower external temperature than the average external temperature for the heating period. Therefore, the calculation must be performed for a higher temperature of the heat carrier than is accepted according to regulatory documents.</jats:p>",

Tawhidi String Relations (TSR), a methodology derived from Tawhid that uses the Al-Quran and Sunnah as an ontology in each solution variable with the ultimate goal of achieving social wellbeing. This TSR method has the advantage of a process of interaction, integration, and evolution which is understood as the evolution of the formation of human knowledge that is subject to Divine Laws through a shuratic process and ijma’, thus realizing a universal social wellbeing function. This study uses qualitative research methods by exploring through literature studies. Basically, demand, supply, elasticity, and market equilibrium in conventional economics have several differences with those found in Islamic economics where what distinguishes them is demand, supply, elasticity and market equilibrium in Islamic economics has limitations and principles that must be met by individuals to behave accordance with Islamic law which is based on the Al-Quran, Sunnah, Ijma', and Qiyas as the agreed source of Islamic law.</jats:p>"

The development of urban areas requires an integrated approach. Heat and gas supply systems are the main element of energy systems. In accordance with the economic, social and technological conditions, heat and gas supply systems undergo organizational and structural transformations. The purpose of the study is to develop promising schemes of heat and gas supply systems for territories based on mutual influence. Methods. Based on the analysis of the functional and planning zoning of urban areas, the calculation method provides options for the development of heat and gas supply schemes. The implementation of modern standards of heat supply is possible due to multivariate approaches. The reliability of the research results is ensured by the use of proven calculation methods. Residential neighborhoods with a load on heat supply and household consumption are considered as the main consumers. Small industrial and municipal facilities are taken into account when planning the use of energy resources in the considered territory. Industrial consumption, as a rule, has an independent system of heat and gas supply. The method for determining loads is based on specific normative indicators. When developing the gas distribution scheme for urban areas, the possibility of spreading the load on the heat supply is taken into account. Results. On the one hand, the developed variants of heat and gas supply schemes were considered as alternative ones. Both the scheme of the main heat supply networks and the gas distribution scheme will be able to perform functional tasks to provide subscribers with resources for the considered design area independently. On the other hand, at different stages of system development, alternative options can complement each other, according to the periods of phased development, taking into account the criteria of reliability and cost-effectiveness. Conclusions. The variants of heat and gas supply systems allowed us to identify the main linear parameters for different building densities. The general material criterion for heat and gas supply systems is the material characteristic. The development of heat and gas supply schemes, taking into account the mutual influence, ensures a stable and economical development of the territory.</jats:p>"

This qualitative descriptive study is based on a survey in 15 locations for the empowerment of beef cattle farmers who are THK partners outside Java, and observations on program implementation along the supply chain in 2020. The beef cattle supply chain as a result of this study is described in the figure and compared with the supply chain of Kurban animals from previous studies. The results showed that the management of the cattle supply chain in THK's DDR program provided tangible benefits for partner farmers. The results of this study are expected to open new insights about the economic aspects of the implementation of Kurban that provide greater benefits to small farmers, without forgetting other stakeholders involved in the program.

This study experimentally investigates the hydraulic performance of arced-plan porous weirs (APPWs) in different hydraulic and geometric conditions. For this purpose, four different porous and two solid weirs were examined. Experiments were conducted in a horizontal laboratory flume with length, width and height of 20, 0.6 and 0.5 m, respectively, for a wide range of flow rates, particle sizes and three arc lengths. Results showed that increasing filling material sizes increases the free discharge coefficient and reduces the submerged discharge reduction factor (DRF). It was also concluded that the weirs’ effective length significantly impacts the free discharge coefficient and has no significant effect on the threshold submergence index and submerged DRF. Unlike solid weirs, the threshold submergence of porous weirs occurs at a downstream depth lower than the weir's height. Finally, according to the dimensional analysis and gene-expression programming approach, three relations were extracted to calculate the free discharge coefficient, threshold submergence index and submerged DRF for APPWs.</jats:p>",

The main focus of the model is on the transmission system since its imbalance leads to the penalties which must be paid by the suppliers. The total nominated amount of natural gas (the gas injected into the transmission system) must be consumed (withdrawn from the system) in order for the system to be in balance. In practice, this is not the case since it is very hard to accurately predict the future hourly consumption (in order to make a nomination) and certain deviations appear which leads to the imbalance. However, this problem could be solved by introducing a special electromotor valve which would be placed at the beginning of the distribution system and control the accumulation of the system. To test this solution, a simulation model was created using Arena Simulation tool. Data for the simulation model are collected by the natural gas distributor and consist of natural gas consumption and nomination values for one measuring-reduction station on the hourly basis. Thus, the final dataset includes 8.754 records. The separate As-Is and To-Be models for seven (summer) months were made and the results were compared. The simulation experiment shows that the positive rebalancing energy would be reduced by 32%, and the negative one by 34%. The created model can serve as a good initial step for the analysis of the justification of investment in the implementation of a technical solution that would manage the accumulation of the distribution system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to their modest 23% share, private forests in Croatia are a resource that is perceived as less important than state-owned forests. One of the basic characteristics of private forests is fragmentation, which is also the biggest obstacle to a successful and, economically speaking, sustainable management of private forests. The cases in which a private forest with its area and integrity can generate a sustainable economic income to its owner are not common. However, from an economic point of view, private forests still have one advantage. Unlike state-owned forests, private forests can be the subject of investment and change hands. Based on this, this paper investigates the supply of private forests on the free market. For private forests that were publicly put for sale in the period from 2010 to 2020, their spatial-temporal distribution and supply dynamics and trends (price and quantity) were analyzed. The data were collected from the leading real estate advertising platform in Croatia (Njuškalo.hr), and a total of 866 advertisements were analyzed, relating exclusively to the sale of raw wood material along with the accompanying forest land. On the other hand, in order to assess the demand, data were collected on the number of potential buyers who viewed the advertisements (period 2020-2021). In the observed ten-year period, a total of 1,890.63 ha of private forests with a total asking value of €32.14 million were offered on the market. The share of advertisements advertised through real estate agencies is 42.1%. The average total annual supply is 170 ha and has a growing trend (in the advertisements in the coastal part of Croatia, the average area is 1.3 ha, while the average area in the continental part is 3 ha). The prices are not constant but rising. According to compound interest, the price increase in the coastal area is 1.57% and 7.49% in the continental area. From the relationship between supply and demand or, more precisely, the relationship between price and the quantity, it was concluded that the market is not well developed and that the price is not affected by the supply/demand quantity of private forests. Furthermore, it was concluded that this market is developing in the direction of a typical real estate market in Croatia due to the fact that forest management and wood processing characteristics of forests do not define the price, but that the price is largely determined by a market with greater financial importance (the market in real estate near the Adriatic coast).</jats:p>",

It is noted that the emission of harmonic components of current by electronic loads can cause deviations in the quality of electricity up to the occurrence of emergency situations due to overloads of low (0.4 kV) and medium (6/10 kV) voltage networks. A non-linear electronic load (LED lamp), although equipped with a power factor corrector, causes the generation of a significant level of current harmonics, which significantly affect the operation of the transformer. As a result, the transformer, calculated taking into account the load factor of 0.7 – 0.8, can not be normally operated in the conditions of using electronic load devices. Mathematical modeling of the correction of the modes of the power supply system with nonlinear single-phase loads is performed, provided that the correction devices made on the basis of several condensers and reactors with nonlinear characteristics are used to balance the modes.</jats:p>"

Recent developments require significant capital investments, but these technologies are yet to be established in developing countries such as Sri Lanka, especially the labour-intensive industries such as the apparel industry. This study has investigated the extent to which Industry 4.0 has diffused into the Sri Lankan apparel industry and examined whether Industry 4.0 adoption affects the organizational and supply chain performance of apparel firms in Sri Lanka. The study follows a qualitative approach to identify the technologies adopted and their effect on organizational and supply chain performance. Data were collected from eight respondents from four major apparel firms. Content analysis was performed to identify the extent to which the technologies are adopted and their effect on organisation and supply chain performance. Content analysis reveals that Augmented and Virtual Reality, Big Data and Analytics, Cloud Computing, Cyber Security, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Robotics are adopted by apparel firms in the Sri Lankan apparel industry. However, the adoption of Cyber Security is at a lower level. Study findings also highlight the key benefits of Industry 4.0 technologies that drive the adoption of Industry 4.0 and the barriers the apparel firms face in adopting Industry 4.0 technologies face. Further, these technologies improve organisational performance in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and competitiveness. These technologies also improve the overall supply chain performance. Findings show that Industry 4.0 improves Supply Chain Performance through quality, efficiency, responsiveness, effectiveness, and flexibility. The study contributes to Industry 4.0 literature by highlighting the diffusion and effect of Industry 4.0 in the Sri Lankan apparel industry by providing empirical support for the impact on organisational and supply chain performance. The study offers managers insights into the potential of Industry 4.0 technologies.</jats:p>"

During this period, the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), which was adopted by the International Maritime Organization, expecting to significantly reduce CO2 from ships, has become an important key. It has triggered a change in use from steam turbine systems and dual fuel diesel electrics to high-efficiency main engines such as ME-GI engines to meet the EEDI requirements. However, since the ME-GI engines use 300 bar of fuel gas pressure, it is necessary to resolve problems of the pressure controllability and to prevent the reductions of the re-liquefaction amount caused by clogging of the lubricant mixed with the fuel gas during the compression. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel control strategy with a newly developed configuration for controlling the pressure so as not to trip the BOG compressors when the ME-GI engines are tripped, and for preventing a reduction on re-liquefaction amount. Unlike the typical configuration used in the current vessels, this proposal separately provides the fuel gas at 150 bar without lubricants to the re-liquefaction. In addition, three control strategies are proposed, depending upon the application of multi-controllers and the location of the pressure transmitters. A simulation was conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed method, focusing on the controllability of the pressure and the re-liquefaction amount, in comparison with the typical configuration. As results of the simulation, the proposal showed excellent controllability without trips of the BOG compressors even in abnormal conditions and confirmed the great re-liquefaction performance.</jats:p>"

One of the regulatory requirements for water utilities is customer engagement to increase water efficiency. This chapter aims to identify key barriers to delivering engagement activities promoting household water efficiency and opportunities for improving practices in Essex &amp; Suffolk Water (ESW) – a UK water utility operating in areas of serious water stress. A reflection is made on the water utility's Every Drop Counts (EDC) home visit campaign, an annual household water efficiency initiative, with particular focus on insights from its face-to-face delivery during Asset Management Plan 6 (AMP6, 2015−2020). The pilot of the EDC campaign's virtual initiative comprising of 66 virtual home visits is examined, with focus on drawing out lessons learned as Asset Management Plan 7 (AMP7, 2020−2025) begins during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Whilst the virtual home visit campaign was found to reach a broader customer base, save financial and environmental costs, and address the season and place constraints typically posed by the face-to-face campaign, fewer water saving devices were installed per property (4.4) compared to the face-to-face campaign (6.4), and calculating measured water savings was impossible due to customers failing to take water meter readings independently during the COVID-19 lockdown. Face-to-face home visits should therefore not mean an end to virtual home visits and vice versa, but rather serve as a twin-track strategy for delivering the campaign.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Key strategies that emerged as improving face-to-face home visits in ESW include increasing the use of customer insight; varying the frame for water efficiency communications; improving the face-to-face engagement strategy; enhancing knowledge training; and creating feedback mechanisms between water efficiency managers and plumbers on the frontline. To better maximise virtual home visits, it is recommended that the behavioural change aspect of water efficiency education is delivered as a key and complementary aspect of appointments, and customers are better supported to self-install a wider range of water saving devices.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This chapter bridges the gap between water management theory and practice by providing a better understanding of how practitioners are putting concepts into action on the ground and by so doing, contributes to building a learning culture in the global water sector.</jats:p>",

However, the rising risk was an inevitable consequence of the economy’s multinational firms, spreading the supply chain further away from their home base.

The US government’s focus on supply chains for selected strategic industries and the EU Commission’s renewed efforts to strengthen its supply chains using ‘sustainability standards’ coincides with the global trend in the shift towards digital and low-carbon economies. Furthermore, the rising tensions between the US and China, with no signs of reconciliation over key issues of contention, have emphasized the need for more credibility and trust in global supply chains. However, such policies also have the potential to serve as new barriers to participation in supply chains by less-developed economies which are not yet prepared to meet the high-level sustainability criteria which aim for higher protection of the environment and labor rights. There also seems to be an apparent shift in paradigm supporting the interventionist role of government that emphasize the need for more discretion for policy objectives that pursue societal and democratic values, not to mention national security interests. The current rules of international trade, however, do not sufficiently address these new issues and need to be realigned in order to meet the new demands. The current ‘rules of the game’ need to be reinforced in order to accommodate the rising need of countries for increased consideration of issues of sustainability and competitiveness.</jats:p>",

There are two steps: a photocatalyst technique for nutrient mobilization, succeeded by solids precipitating with two natural and one synthetic flocculants. The photocatalytic degradation of organonitrogen compounds in batch experiments started under the irradiation of sunlight. Following that, photocatalytic breakdown of organonitrogen compounds produces inorganic nitrogen constituents like NH4+, NO2−, and NO3−, which could be used as manure. It was found that, after 12 h of circulation, the concentration of inorganic nitrogen became NH4+ = 17.2 g/L, NO2− = 18.1 mg/L, and NO3− = 15.9 mg/L. The jar test was adopted to assess the capacity of two natural compounds (tamarind kernel polysaccharide (TKP) and tannin-based substance (TBS)) and synthetic water-soluble polymer cationic polyacrylamide (SWP) to reduce turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour. The findings revealed that with a dose of 20 mg/L of TBS, 20 mg/L of TKP, and 50 mg/L of SWP, the maximum turbidity reductions were 95, 93, and 94%, respectively. The TBS was slightly better than TKP and much better than SWP in terms of coagulation activities with TSS, COD and colour maximum removal efficiencies.</jats:p>",

Along with the intensified market globalization process, companies have become aware of the need to develop efficient supply chains. A supply chain includes a series of activities from planning and organizing to controlling the flow of material and services from suppliers to the final customer. The supply chain effectiveness depends to a large extent on relationships with suppliers. Thus, relationships with suppliers and supply chain performance management are important topics in academic research due to their impact on supply chain profitability. It is particularly evident in the trade industry. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to establish the relationship between supplier relationships and supply chain performance in the trade industry in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The empirical research is based on the primary data, collected by using a questionnaire. The respondents are 200 trade companies from the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Various statistical analysis methods have been applied to answer the research questions addressing the issues of a potential relationship between supplier relationships and supply chain performance. The results have shown that supplier relationships positively impact flexibility, costs, and supply chain quality. There is a statistically significant interdependence between partnership and information exchange, as supplier relationships dimensions, and flexibility, costs, and supply chain quality, as supply chain performance dimensions. There is, also, a statistically significant impact of some companies' characteristics on the information exchange, supplier partnership, flexibility, costs, and quality.</jats:p>",

Shortages of labor continue even now as economies begin to open up with progress on vaccinations. Investing in labor productivity is a possible mechanism in moderating shortfalls in labor. This paper constructs a supply chain network optimization model, whose solution yields optimal product path flows to demand markets, the optimal investments in link labor productivity, as well as labor hours needed, and the optimal wages of the workers in production, transportation, storage, and distribution. The model includes a budget constraint on the investments, along with maximum bounds on investments on the supply chain network links. The theoretical framework, which includes Lagrange analysis and the computational approach, are based on the theory of variational inequalities. Managerial insights are provided obtained via the Lagrange analysis and a series of numerical examples, which demonstrate that such investments can help both the firm and the consumers.</jats:p>",

The results suggest that there was significant association between respondents’ sex, occupation, education and their environmental attitudes. A greater percentage (87. 3%) of the respondents was slightly more likely to agree that emissions from cars and trucks have serious impact on air quality. Majority (57.5%) of the respondents who were civil servants appeared to possess positive (favourable) attitudes towards the influence of emissions on the environment. Logistic regression suggest that respondents’ sex, occupation, education and vehicle’s purpose, income, age and social group significantly predicted their environmental attitudes. The study concludes that most of the sample possessed positive (favourable) environmental attitude towards vehicle emissions. This suggests that the environmental attitude of drivers towards emissions is not responsible for poor air quality. The policy implications of the findings include the need for the adoption of the polluter-pay-principle to reduce the volume of vehicles on our road, the necessity of promoting mass public transportation (such as the BRT and LAGBUS) as a way of reducing vehicle emission. Finally, sensitization program through social groups and schools is imperative.</jats:p>",

This study analyses effective and sustainable energy transition pathways and supply and highlights the commitments of the 2015 Paris Agreement by the United States of America in combating the challenges of global warming. The transition pathways are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and advance worldwide temperature to a 1.5 °C average. Again, justifiable transition pathways mostly include energy savings on the demand side, generation efficiency, and fossil fuel substitution by various renewable energy sources and low-carbon nuclear. Renewable energy conversion approach to constantly remain precise strategic and beneficial, policy initiatives are necessary to steer the global electricity transition toward a sustainable energy and electricity scheme. In furtherance, the estimation of electricity output in emerging and industrialized economies, output, and demand projections affect economic planning and decision-making. Electricity generation and consumption impact the rate of technological advancement, GDP growth, industrialization, and infrastructural development. Most macroeconomic variables are reliant on sustainable electricity, including GDP, population, gross capital formation, and CO2 emissions. The electricity market therefore influences these macroeconomic variables. The relationship between the consumption of electricity and the emission of CO2 depends on the sources of electric energy generation. Electricity produced from renewable and sustainable sources emits virtually zero greenhouse gases. In terms of GDP and the formation of total capital, increasing the use of electricity leads to a positive effect. In addition, population growth requires the production of more electricity to satisfy the marginal demand resulting from population expansion. </jats:p>"

We devised a bidirectional dynamic game model consisting of competing suppliers in a developing economy and an overseas buyer in a developed economy for innovation decision process in a suppliers cluster. Our research shows that global supply chain relationship is the primary factor to influence local cluster innovation and profit. Total innovation of the cluster is proved to be greater in global supply relationship with a powerful buyer than a non-powerful buyer. However, suppliers in a powerful buyer chain are not able to capture the value they created from innovation. Local competition structure plays its secondary role on cluster innovation through interaction with vertical chain relationship. Based on prior innovation research on either vertical supply chain power dynamics or horizontal competition intenseness, our study contributes as the first to employ a theoretical suppliers’ innovation model for an integrative analysis encompassing both global and local power dynamics.</jats:p>",

The VES production function is used to describe the production function of the domestic water supply. Combined with system dynamics, the supply and demand management model of urban domestic water in Jiangsu province, China, is developed. The process of water supply investment and labor input in the urban domestic water system is studied with two depreciation methods: the straight-line depreciation method and the sum of years digits method. In the case that the water consumption population is expected to decline, four water demand scenarios composed of different per capita disposable income and the growth rate of water-saving consciousness are investigated. Investment and labor input are taken as control variables to conduct water supply and demand simulations for the four scenarios. The results show that the control schemes in all four scenarios reach a balance between water supply and demand. Moreover, the investment of the sum of years digits method is larger than that of the straight-line depreciation method in 2005–2019 but less than that of the straight-line depreciation method in 2020–2034. The sum of years digits method has the characteristics of more depreciation in the early stage and less depreciation in the later stage, which is conducive to timely compensation for the large loss of fixed assets in the early stage.</jats:p>"

The pandemic has broken all borders (political, legal, state) and overcoming the transboundary global crisis has necessitated the participation of all levels of government and the private sector. The pandemic, along with human health, attacks the socio-economic sphere and poses obvious threats of economic depression, rising unemployment and poverty, limited social contacts, and many other negative events. This threat affects the\nstate and municipal management and, consequently, the public services provided by them. Unfortunately, unlike trade and education, these types of services are largely impossible to digitize. In the current situation, the attention of citizens and business representatives is drawn to the actions of the state, as its activities and management skills have acquired much more function. Meeting the needs of citizens in a pandemic requires the use of approaches based on new technologies, new forms of interaction and innovative methods of work. The economic sustainability of public administration occupies an important place in public policy as a determinant of public sector modernization, support, optimization of functioning, and improvement of public services. This acquired a special load during the crisis caused by the coronapandemic.\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic dictates that it is necessary to develop new approaches to state intervention and public service delivery systems in all areas of public life in times of crisis in order to respond optimally to the needs of citizens</jats:p>",

Membrane bioreactor systems provide high efficiency in the treatment of textile wastewater and dyestuff removal. Removal of dyestuffs and turbidity in real textile wastewater by using a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor system was studied. Chemical precipitation was not applied before the biological treatment for the removal of color and other pollutant parameters. A hollow fiber microfiltration membrane module was used in the system. Then a combination with an active carbon filter was created to take the color removal to a higher level. The development of the microorganism composition adapted to the textile industry was observed in the biological reactor. The system was operated with an endless sludge age and a hydraulic retention time of 24 hours. Color measurement transparency index parameter DFZ (DurchsichtsFarbZahl) was measured in a spectrophotometer at wavelengths of 436, 525, and 620 nm (nanometers) according to EN ISO 7887 standards. In the microfiltration permeate water, the color removal were found in 436 nm: 91-95%, 525 nm: 94-98%, 620 nm: 96-99%, and in activated carbon permeate water, the color removal in 436 nm: 96-99% at 525 nm: 95-99%, 620 nm: 96-99%, respectively. Due to the physical separation of the membrane, which is the simplest definition, high efficiencies in color removal have been achieved in the system. The activated carbon system combined with the membrane was found higher efficiency in color removal than the microfiltration output.</jats:p>"

Production of cereal crops, especially maize, is very responsive to changes in rainfall and temperature, as climatic parameters influencing productivity. This paper analyzes how climatic and other variables affect the supply of maize in Ethiopia. The data were obtained from secondary sources and cover the period 1981–2018. Data were analyzed using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC), and Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion (HQ) were used to select the optimum number of lags. In order to detect whether unit root is present in the series, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Philips-Perron (PP) tests were carried out. The presence of long-run equilibrium was found between maize output and temperature, rainfall, and other included variables. The results show that, in both the long and shortrun, all included climatic variables had a negative relationship with maize output supply, although temperature showed statistical insignificance (P&gt;0.10). The result showed that maize crops are highly sensitive to extremes of rainfall – both shortage in the initial growing period and excessin the vegetative and fruiting stages. It was concluded that farmers face climate-related risk due to variations, particularly in rainfall. Therefore, farmers should adapt by using short-duration and climate-tolerant varieties of maize, along with engagement with eco-friendly production systems.</jats:p>"

The transport of carbon and nutrients are dominated by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its rich mesoscale eddy field; however, the current generation of Earth System Models (ESMs) lack the resolution to resolve eddies. Here we show that a computational model that explicitly represents mesoscale eddies can reproduce observed phases and amplitudes of seasonal biological productivity and partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Our sensitivity study demonstrates that when eddies are suppressed or parameterized, the model cannot reproduce these seasonal cycles. Experiments with suppressed eddy activity show that the lack of eddies significantly changes the iron supply and phenology of phytoplankton blooms. The mismatch in the timing and intensity of the bloom causes significant biases in the seasonal carbon cycle of the region with implications to the enigmatic biases in partial pressure of carbon dioxide among the state‐of‐the‐art ESMs.</jats:p>",

Para tanto, as empresas têm adotado o Supply Chain Finance (SCF), que visa diminuir o risco de financiamento por meio da melhoria do capital de giro. Contudo, a adoção de práticas de SCF é normalmente negligenciada por pequenas e médias empresas (PME’s), que enfrentam dificuldades para obter financiamento junto a instituições financeiras. Logo, o objetivo deste estudo é identificar as principais barreiras ao financiamento de PME’s do setor de panificação brasileiro e o seu grau de maturidade em relação às práticas de SCF. Nesse sentido, desenvolveu-se um questionário estruturado que foi enviado por e-mail a organizações deste segmento. Os resultados demonstraram que as principais barreiras enfrentadas são o elevado custo de crédito e a burocracia excessiva, associadas ao risco de endividamento. Identificou-se, também, que há pouca maturidade acerca de práticas de SCF no setor, justificada pelo raro acompanhamento de qualquer indicador de desempenho financeiro associado às cadeias de suprimentos em que as empresas estão inseridas.</jats:p>"

An analysis of previous research has concluded that the important categories of relationship quality (RQ) are the following: appropriate inter-organisational collaboration, effective communication, mutual exchange of information, resource sharing (physical, financial, human, and organisational), willingness to share risks, transparency between partners, relationship quality and commitment, and the presence of trust between partners in the SC. An empirical study based on in-depth interviews was conducted on a sample of six organic food producers in Croatia. The results indicated that the producers’ perceptions of the impact of collaboration and trust on overall performance differs depending on the length of the collaboration with retailers, the types of products, and the percentage of overall sales they sell through retailers. The results of this research can serve as an information base for all stakeholders in the SCs of organic products by encouraging them to participate in activities that will strengthen trust and collaboration as a prerequisite for increasing SC organic food performance.</jats:p>"

Farmers have to deal with this issue and may be forced to irrigate their crops with less water than required, however reduction in productivity is anticipated. Thus, two–year field trials were conducted to assess the impact of irrigation regimes (60, 80 and 100% of crop evapotranspiration, denoted ET60, ET80, and ET100, respectively) and benzyladenine rates (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg L−1, symbolized as BA0, BA50, BA100, BA150, BA200, respectively) on soybean. Findings clarified that the maximum increases in plant height and net assimilation rate were obtained with the interactions of ET100 or ET80 x BA200 or BA150 in both seasons. ET80 x BA200 (in both seasons) and ET100 x BA150 (in the first season) were as similar as ET100 x BA200 for enhancing pods number plant−1. Irrigation water use efficiency progressively increased with decreasing irrigation water amount and increasing benzyladenine rate. In conclusion, the reduction in seed yield due to lowering water supply up to 80% of crop evapotranspiration (with saving 20% of irrigation water) could be compensated using benzyladenine, 150 mg L−1, thus it should be involved in soybean irrigation programs.</jats:p>"

Engineering the formwork system using aluminum is one of the technological innovations to accelerate development and adopt the 3R (Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle) concept. To support the use of aluminum formwork, an environmentally friendly supply chain activity management model is needed. The Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) approach is one method that can reduce waste. This study analyzes the driving and inhibiting factors of GSCM using aluminum formwork in an apartment project in Semarang. The method of compiling this research used a qualitative method, where interviews were conducted which were then made into complete transcripts and grouped each opinion with a SWOT matrix approach. Based on the results of the SWOT analysis, 4 factors have a significant effect. Among these 4 factors, there are 2 driving factors, namely government regulations regarding environmental protection and commitment to protecting the environment, and 2 inhibiting factors, namely the availability of suppliers who implement GSCM practices in construction areas and require careful planning. The use of aluminum formwork can save costs up to 5.44% with a construction time of 6 days faster than conventional methods.</jats:p>"

The cases of installation of the longitudinal and transverse capacitive compensation devices at traction substation and sectiolizing post are considered in this paper. Based on experimental data their effectiveness has been analysed by comparing the main parameters of the traction power supply system before and after the installation of the compensating devices. The main effect in terms of power consumption reduction is achieved through application of reactive power cross-compensation devices. The results of the analysis show that the total electricity consumption in the researched area decreased by 23 % and the proportion of higher harmonic elements of voltage decreased by 15 %.</jats:p>",

In this regard, many researchers have been engaged in the various artificial intelligence applied soft computing techniques to predict actual process outcomes. Inspired by the significance of such techniques, an optimized Particle Swarm Optimization based Artificial Neural Network (PSO-ANN) technique has been proposed herewith to predict an accurate performance of the reverse osmosis (RO) based water treatment desalination plants. Literature suggests that the improvements of the soft computing models depend on their modeling parameters. Therefore, we have included an extended list of nine modeling parameters with a systematic indepth investigation to explore their optimal values. Finally, the model's simulations results (R2 = 99.1%, Error = 0.006) were found superior to the existing ANN models (R2 = 98.8%, Error = 0.060), with the same experimental datasets. Additionally, the simulation results recommend that among many parameters considered, the number of hidden layer nodes (n), swarm sizes (SS), and the weight of inertia (ω) play a major role in the model optimization. This study for a more accurate prediction of the plant's performance shall pave the way for the process design and control engineers to improve the plant efficiency further.</jats:p>",

This paper reviews the literature surrounding digitalization in FSCs. A bibliometric and key-route main path analysis was carried out to objectively and analytically uncover the knowledge development in digitalization within the context of sustainable FSCs. The research began with the selection of 2140 articles published over nearly five decades. Then, the articles were examined according to several bibliometric metrics such as year of publication, countries, institutions, sources, authors, and keywords frequency. A keyword co-occurrence network was generated to cluster the relevant literature. Findings of the review and bibliometric analysis indicate that research at the intersection of technology and the FSC has gained substantial interest from scholars. On the basis of keyword co-occurrence network, the literature is focused on the role of information communication technology for agriculture and food security, food waste and circular economy, and the merge of the Internet of Things and blockchain in the FSC. The analysis of the key-route main path uncovers three critical periods marking the development of technology-enabled FSCs. The study offers scholars a better understanding of digitalization within the agri-food industry and the current knowledge gaps for future research. Practitioners may find the review useful to remain ahead of the latest discussions of technology-enabled FSCs. To the authors’ best knowledge, the current study is one of the few endeavors to explore technology-enabled FSCs using a comprehensive sample of journal articles published during the past five decades.</jats:p>"

Since the Nash bargaining solution exactly characterizes endogenous power and the contribution of the GSC members, it is introduced as the loss-averse reference point for the GSC members. Based on this, a decision model of the two-echelon GSC with loss aversion is formulated. The optimal strategies of price and product green degree are derived in four scenarios: (a) the centralized decision scenario with rational GSC members, namely the CD scenario; (b) the decentralized decision scenario with rational GSC members, namely the DD scenario; (c) the decentralized decision scenario with the GSC members loss-averse, where the manufacturer’s share is below its own loss-averse reference point, namely the DD(∆m ≥ πm) scenario; (d) the decentralized decision scenario with the GSC members loss-averse, where the retailer’s share is below its own loss-averse reference point, namely the DD(∆r ≥ πr) scenario. Then, a comparative analysis of the optimal strategies and profits in these four scenarios is conducted, and the impacts of loss aversion and green efficiency coefficient of products (GECP) on the GSC are also performed. The results show that (i) GECP has a critical influence on the retail price and the wholesale price; (ii) the GSC with loss aversion provide green products with the lowest green degree; (iii) the retail price, the wholesale price and product green degree are decreasing monotonically with the loss aversion level of the GSC member without incurring loss; (iv) furthermore, the effect of the loss aversion level of the GSC member with incurring loss on the optimal strategies is related to GECP and the gap between the GSC members’ loss aversion levels.</jats:p>"

This study unravels the novel idea and potential of Random Forest (RF), M5P, and Random Tree (RT) approaches to evaluate and predict the coefficient of Manning's roughness for hydraulic designing. To achieve this purpose, 42 observations were collected for high-gradient streams in Colorado, USA. All the observations were from boulder-bed, cobble and high gradient (S &amp;gt; 0.002 m/m) streams within bank flows. In order to ascertain the best model, the above-mentioned approaches were evaluated and compared using performance evaluation indices such as mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of correlation (CC), and root mean square error (RMSE). Outcomes of performance evaluation indices revealed that the proposed pruned M5P approach outperformed other applied models for predicting the coefficient of Manning's roughness for hydraulic designing with CC = 0.7858, 0.7910, RMSE = 0.0195, 0.0195, and MAE = 0.0157, 0.0165 for model development and validation period, correspondingly. Furthermore, Taylor diagram and Box plot also suggest that the M5P based approach works better than RF and RT based approaches for predicting the coefficient of Manning's roughness for high-gradient streams using the given data set.</jats:p>",

The proposed framework integrates green supply chain management and circular economy within the sustainability perspective as drivers for improvements in sustainable development. Within the framework, the greening factor is introduced as a new concept that measures the required effort for a productive process to become sustainable. On one hand, the framework aims at computing the greening factor based on the impacts of resources exploitation and products generation. Additionally, the greening factor computation was designed based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of economic, social, and environmental mainstays. On the other hand, this paper presents a general application of the framework on the five biggest Chilean industries, i.e., mining, wine, forest, agriculture, and aquaculture. Based on the presented generalized application, it is possible to foresee the potentiality of Chile becoming a green country in spite of its productive matrix being mainly based on primary industries.</jats:p>"

Different aspects of real estate practices require collaboration of real estate practitioners who are professional estate surveyors and valuers, with the built environment professionals and other stakeholders at different levels in order to achieve the transaction objectives. This study, therefore, examined the practice with a view to uncovering the preparedness of the estate surveyors and valuers with respect to the knowledge and application of supply chain management in real estate practices. Empirical data were collected with the aide of questionnaires administered to respondents from the 373 estate firms in Lagos State, Nigeria of which 291 were duly completed and returned constituting 78% rate of response. The Readiness Assessment Model was adapted to determine the operational preparedness of the estate surveying and valuation firms to implement supply chain management with regards to management readiness, employee readiness, services/processes readiness and logistic/ICT readiness on a 5-point Likert scale and the corresponding mean score and relative importance was determined. The Kolmogorov Smirnov Test of Normality was performed and showed that the data was normally distributed. Hence, the Pearson Product Moment Correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between knowledge and application of supply chain management in real estate businesses. It was observed, among others, that the knowledge of supply chain management is generally low among estate valuers and does not necessarily translate to application in the property market transactions of real estate firms. The study further observed that management and employees of estate surveying and valuation firms do not have adequate knowledge of the principles and practices of supply chain management for productive engagement in property market transactions. This was further identified alongside others such as confidentiality, stiff rivalry and economic instability as critical factors resisting the adoption of supply chain management in the property market. The study therefore suggested capacity building programmes on supply chain management for the estate surveyors and valuers to improve the knowledge of the strategy and harness the benefits.</jats:p>"

Exceptional circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic when traditional face-to-face methodology suddenly changed to online paradigm, is also forcing us to strongly consider the m-learning approach. However, HLI may not have a general policy to implement m-learning into the traditional learning environment.

In the first step, the contents of the grim disaster situation and the information framework of ecohydrology with disasters were evaluated. Nest, the creation of ecohydrology and its work with related disasters were summarized. Three disasters including flood, drought, and geohazard were evaluated and three examples (Dujiangyan Irrigation Project, Karez, and Ecological slope) have been separately discussed for considering the concept of the problem. Depending on the characteristics and potential for an effect in different disasters, there needed to be some challenges and opportunities for ecohydrology facing related disasters in various fields, such as National Space Planning, Sponge City and the ‘One Belt And One Road’ Initiative. Finally, some valuable conclusions were drawn on the application of ecohydrology to disaster prevention and mitigation. Furthermore, the key systemic settings between water management, hydrology, and ecology were described, which is of the main importance for social disaster reduction, emergency management, and protection of accident prevention.</jats:p>",

To solve the problem of light wane caused by excessive current and overheating, LLC resonant converter with soft switching was chosen as the main topology, improving the power efficiency, and reducing the heat of the LED driver. Firstly, the soft-switching conditions of the LLC resonant converter are analyzed, and the constraint equation is obtained. Then, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the resonant parameters. The weight of particles is dynamically and adaptively changed to balance the global and local optimization performance of particles. Finally, the controller is designed to realize constant current. This design improves the efficiency of the LED driver. At the same time, the light wane is effectively suppressed by stable output current, and the rationality of the selected parameters is verified by simulation and experiment.</jats:p>",

For instance, Canadian railroads carried around 50 million tons of hazmat in 2018. Given the inherent danger of trains carrying hazmat, this study aimed at exploring a novel way towards mitigation of the associated risk. This study sought to investigate whether proper rail track infrastructure investment can mitigate the risk from hazmat shipments. To this end, a methodology was developed and then applied to the Canadian railroad network. The proposed three-step methodology captured the differing perspectives of rail carriers and regulatory agencies, and entailed (1) ascertaining the risk-level of various yards and links in the given railroad network, (2) specifying potential candidates for infrastructure investment, and (3) finding the optimum set of investment decisions. The proposed methodology was then applied to the Canadian railroad network to demonstrate that significant risk-reduction can be achieved by adding alternative rail-links around the riskiest locations (i.e. the network hot-spots), and also to show that risk-reduction function is non-linear with non-monotonous behavior. The study showed the possibility of significant hazmat risk reduction through alternative rail-links that could take traffic away from the network hot-spots. The methodology and the results from the Canadian case can be used by railroad companies and policy makers to estimate the value of potentially risk-reducing infrastructure investments.</jats:p>",

The first scenario presented 25% reduction in Nile flow, while the second scenario suggested adaptation measures to comply with flow reduction. The measures included leveling 100,000 feddans, serving 70,000 feddans with sprinkler irrigation, and lining 2,977 km of canals. The WB Model estimated WB components. The WSQI was a new index suitable for Egypt's conditions considering water quality. The water supply from High Aswan Dam (HAD) was predicted by the BlueM model for hydrological simulations of Nasser Lake. The study found that the current water shortage was fulfilled by drainage reuse and shallow groundwater, and the WQSI indicated a low water insecurity. The flow reduction increased the water shortage and reuse quantity. As a result, the WSQI indicated high water insecurity. The suggested measures improved agricultural water use efficiency from 51% to 63%, reduced water shortage, and improved the water insecurity level from high to medium. This study concluded that adaptation measures can improve the future water system and water security in the Qena Governorate. The study recommended upscaling WSQI use for the entire country.</jats:p>",

Innovation is a topic that is frequently studied by both markets and academics. However, the increase in the quantity of studies conducted is far from meeting the need in this field. As a result of the shortening of product life cycles in current market conditions, companies are obliged to continuously innovate in order to sustain their existence. Increasing raw material and resource diversification requirement due to the increasing need for innovation made it necessary to examine and understand the supply chain in the context of innovation. The importance of innovation, especially in the case of participation by suppliers in innovation for a competitive advantage, has resulted in many in-depth studies published in research papers in the field. In this study, articles published in the Web of Science database between 1996-2020 and covering the topics of  supply chain and innovation were analyzed in order to reveal the patterns of supply chain management and innovation research, identify relative deficiencies and provide some guidelines. For this purpose, a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis related has been made.

In addition, these currencies may also reduce consumers’ need for conventional demand deposits, which, in turn, increases banks’ loan provision costs because deposits require higher rates of return. We use a microeconomic banking model to investigate the effects of introducing an economy-wide, account-type CBDC on a bank’s loan supply and its failure risk. Given that a CBDC is expected to lower the cost of liquidity circulation and become a strong substitute for demand deposits, both the loan supply and the bank failure risk increase. These increases are countered by subsequent increases in the rates of return on term deposits and loans, which, in turn, reduce the loan supply and thus bank failure risk. These offsetting forces lead to no significant change in banking, as long as the rate of return on loans is below a certain threshold. However, once the rate is above the threshold, bank failure risk increases, thereby undermining banking stability. The problem is more pronounced when the degree of pass-through of funding costs to the loan rate is high and the profitability of a successful project is low. Our results imply that central banks wishing to introduce an economy-wide, account-type CBDC should first monitor yields on bank loans and consider policy measures that induce banks to maintain adequate liquidity reserve levels.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Anticorrosion protection of agricultural machinery working elements is provided through using pneumatic application of thickened preservatives with heating. For this purpose, a wire coil is inserted inside the preservative-supply hose and connected to a current source. It is known that the wire thickness and the coil pitch affect the hydraulic resistance to fluid flow. However, it has not been established how the diameter of the coil insert and its heating affect the flow capacity of the flexible hose channel. The purpose of the research is to increase the capacity of a flexible hose with an electrical-heater coil. For this purpose, it is necessary to determine its geometric parameters minimizing the hydraulic resistance to the thickened preservative flow and reducing the energy consumption for heating the material in the hose.\nMaterials and Methods. It is proposed to investigate two electrical-heater coils of the same length, but of different diameter, made of steel welding wire pieces of equal length. There was developed a stand to study the influence of the inserted coil parameters on the hose hydraulic resistance. The stand was used to determine pressure losses in hoses with coils and in smooth hoses when used engine oil and thickened preservative flow through them. The flow capacity of the hose with cold and heated coils was estimated.\nResults. The method of heating the preservative in the hose wall layer is justified. At the same time, its flow capacity increases one and a half times with less energy consumption (2.4 times) than when heating the preservative in the central part of the hose. Under laminar flow mode, the pressure loss in the hose is 2 times lower when the coil is equal to 0.85 of the hose channel diameter than when the coil is equal to 0.67 of the channel diameter.\nDiscussion and Conclusion. The research found the rational way of placing the electrical coil near the heated hose channel wall. At low air temperature, the reduction of the thickened preservative viscosity by heating in the hose helps to decrease the pressure loss up to 50% and increase its flow capacity by 1.4‒2.0 times. The use of a electrical-heater coil in the hose with thickened preservative will minimize energy consumption when preserving equipment on open storage sites.</jats:p>",

The results obtained by numerical simulation showed that Movila Verde -Independenta water supply duct might be subject of cavitation occurrence during hydraulic shock. Further investigations showed that the duct is adequately protected by a relatively short closing law of the check valve and three air valves mounted in the nodes where cavitation might occur. Minimal pressure increases from -10 mwc to -0.6 mwc because of these protection measures. Furthermore, the slight increase of maximal pressure does not require additional protection devices.</jats:p>",

To support provenancing, timber import patterns into Auckland between 1850 and 1889 CE were reconstructed, demonstrating that the archaeological assemblage is likely biased to west and east Auckland and the Coromandel Peninsula, particularly the east side.

In a world where resources are constantly decreasing, the concept of sustainability has become very crucial in every part of life. Digital technologies, on the other hand, have a direct relationship with sustainability. Sustainability has three main dimensions: economic, environmental, and social. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate digital supply chain on 3 basic dimensions of sustainability. For this purpose, Fuzzy Best Worst Method (F-BWM) was used to define the importance level of criteria. Findings reveal that the concept of sustainability in textile firms in Turkey is generally perceived within an economic and environmental area, rather than within a social dimension. This study is very important in putting forward digital technologies which utilizing in supply chain and the impact of the digital supply chain on sustainability.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, a parabolic trough collector has been used to preheat the saline water entering the solar still. Also, two flat external reflectors have been employed to increase the amount of solar energy received by the steps and the collector of the system. The findings of this research indicate that the use of two flat external reflectors is more effective than using the trough collector. Also, it is more efficient to apply both mechanisms simultaneously than to use them separately. According to the obtained results, the distilled water output of the solar still is 760, 1,560, 2,440 and 2,760 ml/m2, respectively, for operating the conventional solar still, using the trough collector, using the two flat external reflectors, and using the collector and reflectors simultaneously. The electrical conductivity due to the presence of salt and chemical substances dissolved in the distilled water discharged from the still is 255, 215, 62 and 38 micro Siemens per centimetre, respectively, for each of the four mentioned cases. These experiments show that by applying the proposed mechanisms, the amount of distilled water can be increased, and its purity can be enhanced.</jats:p>",

This research introduces a framework for a new type of Knowledge Base (KB), which refers to as a Software Service Supply Chain Knowledge Base CLOUD (SSSC KB CLOUD) framework. SSSC KB CLOUD framework provides and explores the infrastructure for manipulating knowledge during the developmental process of Software Service Supply Chain (SSSC). Also, it explores the main technical components of the SSSC KB CLOUD and shows how these components integrate and work together to achieve the main aims of SSSC KB CLOUD. The proposed framework shows the life cycle of knowledge in SSSC. It highlights the source of knowledge in SSSC and how it passes the SSSC KM process for sorting and refining. Then, it suggests a SSSC KB CLOUD framework to store and manipulate this knowledge. Finally, it provides the SSSC experts with an interface to access and retrieve knowledge from the SSSC KB CLOUD. The SSSC KB CLOUD consists of four components: Knowledge Cloud Management System (KCMS), Prior Projects Knowledge Marts (PPKM), Experts’ Base (EB), and SSSC Group Formation CLOUD. KCMS provides a management system of SSSC KB CLOUD, while, PPKM is considered a knowledge repository of the knowledge captured during the development of projects, it also stores and holds all the retained SSSC knowledge. Moreover, EB stores and holds the SSSC experts’ details, including the area of expertise, experience, education, etc. Thus, SSSC KB CLOUD holds the experts’ details and records in its EB.

The findings revealed that retailers controlled or monopolized the supply chain of broiler meat distribution, while producers were accomplices of several large corporations that controlled or monopolized the commodity of broiled chicken in Aceh Province. North Aceh Regency, Pidie Jaya Regency, and Pidie Regency are all sources of commodities coming from outside of Lhokseumawe City. To solve the problem of broiler meat supply, all competent parties, including the government, the commercial sector, relevant agencies/institutions, researchers, academics, scientists, and specialists, must work together to build a design model for the purebred broiler meat supply chain.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The flood control is one of the priority goal for successful economic activity on the areas that are periodically suffer from floods. Such areas are the mountainous regions of the Ukrainian Carpathian Mountains. Floods on the mountain rivers are repeated several times each year, and are characterized by the sudden water level rise with almost the same rapid decrease of the water level. Active flood protection measures include dry mountain flood control reservoirs, the principle of which is to transform part of the flood runoff and to accumulate water for the short time in the the artificial reservoir, with followed rapid emptying to the minimum level. The complex hydraulic regime is formed in the body of the dam which forms the flood control reservoir during the flood, that is different from the operation of the water permanent reservoir. The design of the flood control structures is car-ried out in accordance with Ukrainian building codes for the construction of the water reservoirs with constant water level, and require testing the stability of the downstream slope for the maximum water levels under steady state seepage conditions and assessment the upstream slope stability during the water level decreasing  from the maximum level calculated in the steady state condition, these calculations do not correspond to the real seepage processes in the body of the dam of the dry flood control reservoir. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to determine the necessary boundary conditions of the flood control reservoir operation and upstream slope stability assessment by the limit equilibrium method. In the article the operation of the dry mountain flood control reservoir was analysed and found that the dam was characterized by two states: dry reservoir with water minimum water level and variable position of the seepage curve in the core and the upstream prism during the flood. The main factors influencing the upstream slope stability are the physical and mechanical properties of the soil, the laying of the slope, the period of time when the high-water level is maintained and the intensity of water level dropping. The upstream slope stability was evaluated by the Morgenstern &amp; Price and Ordinary methods on the Slope/w software package. After the first 25 hours of the flood (period of high-water levels and the next water level dropping) the Safety Factor evaluated by limit equilibrium methods began to decrease, and reached the minimum value during the greatest seepage curve gradients at the time between 45 and 50 hours. Slope stability calculations by the limit equilibrium method were compared with the results of calculations performed by the SRM method, the values ​​of the Safety Factor and the way of their change during the flood evaluated by Ordinary and SRM methods almost coincide, which indicates the reliability of the results obtained by different methods of slope stability analysis</jats:p>"

We call these development‐aid supply chains (DASC) distinct from commercial or humanitarian supply chains. With little available formally on DASCs in the literature, we carried out a field study across five solar lantern supply chains in Haiti set up for recovery following the massive 2010 earthquake. Stakeholder resource‐based view allowed us to use stakeholder theory, utility theory, and the resource‐based view in analyzing how these supply chains work. We observed how donor cash in these supply chains brings together global original equipment manufacturers; national‐level distributors; impact investors; microfinance institutions; retailers; and micro‐entrepreneurs. Many of these entities are social enterprises that bridge development‐minded donors with commercially oriented retailers and micro‐entrepreneurs. The result of these bridging efforts is the flow of goods, cash, and social impact data. Our conceptual model flags the problem that donor funding, while crucial for reducing deprivation in the short term, may increase the dependence on aid rather than reduce it. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analyzes the impact of foreign currency reserve and economic growth on money supply using panel data from five West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) member states from 2001-2019. The study employed the dynamic technique, fully modified ordinary least squares and dynamic ordinary least squares (FMOLS and DOLS), and the static method (fixed effect model) for the robustness check. The long run results showed that foreign currency reserves (FCR) have a positive impact on money supply, implying that a one percent increase in FCR augments money supply (M2) by 2.87%, 0.44% and 0.08%, respectively, in the long run. Similarly, economic growth is associated with an increase in money supply in both models. Furthermore, the Dumitrescu &amp; Hurlin (2012) estimation revealed a feedback association between foreign currency reserve and money supply. This means that foreign reserves and money supply are complementary. Conversely, a unidirectional causality moving from economic growth to M2 is observed, demonstrating that economic growth causes M2. This outcome is explained by the quantity theory of money (QTM) in which the velocity of money is a positive function of total money supply. As money circulates in the economy as a result of a surge in investments, this consequently increases money stock. Similarly, investment opportunities that are being exploited day-by-day explains the growing money stock (WAMI, 2018). Central banks should endeavor to monitor the expansionary influence of net foreign assets (NFA) on money supply growth in the WAMZ by establishing suitable methods to sterilize foreign exchange infusions into the economy.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the investment of value-added service and pricing strategies for an e-commerce platform with competing sellers. Specifically, this paper considers a two-sided platform that is composed of an e-commerce platform, buyers and sellers. Sellers with high performance requirement and with low performance requirement compete for the buyers in the platform. This paper assumes that each buyer will choose the sellers’ type immediately after entering the platform and buy a unit of product in the platform. Through theoretical analysis the authors show that, the platform will gain more profits by investing in value-added services for type-A sellers and it will obtain the optimal profit when the transaction fee is moderate.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Fear of escalating input prices in response to retail success is a commonly discussed phenomenon affecting supply chains. Such a ratchet effect arises when a retailer feels compelled to modify its investments to better serve the end customers in order to hide positive prospects and restrain future wholesale price hikes. In a two-period model of supply chain interactions, the authors demonstrate that such an endogenous ratchet effect can have multifaceted reverberations. A retailer fearing price hikes may be tempted to curtail near-term profits to ensure favorable long-term pricing. In response, the supplier can use deep discounts in its initial wholesale prices to convince the retailer to focus on its short-term profits rather than long-term pricing concerns. These deep discounts not only encourage mutually beneficial investments but also alleviate double marginalization inefficiencies along the supply chain. In light of these results, the authors show that a mandatory information disclosure policy to reduce the ratchet effect decreases total channel efficiency compared with no information disclosure, precisely because mandatory disclosure interrupts the healthy tension among supply chain partners. Thus, the model presents a scenario in which ratcheting concerns can create a degree of self-enforcing cooperation that results in socially beneficial responses in supply chains. </jats:p>",

Logistics service is a key influence factor to online marketplace. We present four service channels: (1) E‐channel, the e‐tailer offers the service; (2) E3P‐channel, the e‐tailer outsources the service to a 3PL; (3) M‐channel, the manufacture offers the service; and (4) M3P‐channel, the manufacture outsources the service to a 3PL. This study investigates the optimal decisions and profits for e‐tailer and manufacturer among different service channels, respectively, equilibrium choice of service channel and examines the consistency on choosing the service channel between them. We find that whether the market demand is a log‐separable function form or a linear function form, when the fraction of supply chain revenue sharing is large, E‐channel is the equilibrium choice, otherwise M‐channel is the equilibrium one. Further, we use the sharing fraction threshold gap between e‐tailer and manufacturer to describe the extent of the consistency on choosing the service channel. We find increasing demand sensitivity to service level or decreasing cost sensitivity to service level would enhance the consistency. Moreover, we extend to analysis with linear demand function and different service costs for firms. Finally, the e‐tailer or the manufacturer switches to outsource service to a 3PL when the service cost of the 3PL is not large. Specifically, the 3PL also benefits from the consistent service channel choice under certain condition.</jats:p>",

In this study, we conduct a preliminary assessment of the ability of the ForestView® algorithm created by Northwest Management Incorporated to detect individual trees, classify tree species, live/dead status, canopy position, and estimate height and diameter at breast height (DBH) in a mixed coniferous forest with an average tree density of 543 (s.d. ±387) trees/hectare. ITD accuracy was high in stands with lower canopy cover (recall: 0.67, precision: 0.8) and lower in stands with higher canopy cover (recall: 0.36, precision: 0.67), mainly owing to omission of suppressed trees that were not detected under the dominant tree canopy. Tree species that were well-represented within the study area had high classification accuracies (producer’s/user’s accuracies &gt; ~60%). The similarity between the ALS estimated and observed tree attributes was high, with no statistical difference in the ALS estimated height and DBH distributions and the field observed height and DBH distributions. RMSEs for tree-level height and DBH were 0.69 m and 7.2 cm, respectively. Overall, this algorithm appears comparable to other ITD and measurement algorithms, but quantitative analyses using benchmark datasets in other forest types and cross-comparisons with other ITD algorithms are needed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain finance (SCF) has attracted considerable attention being an innovative business model that allows firms, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to convert illiquid assets into cash without incurring additional liabilities. However, its effects on SME performance and risk have been insufficiently studied. The competitiveness of SMEs depends on performance enhancement and risk mitigation. Thus, this study constructs a scaled-decile rank transformation of account receivable turnover to gauge the degree to which a supplier implements SCF, thereby examining the relationship between SCF, performance, and risk. We collect data on 4,679 SMEs from the Chinese manufacturing sector. Thereafter, hierarchical linear regression, a complex form of multiple linear regression analysis, is employed to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that an SME’s SCF adoption positively impacts its performance but negatively impacts its risk. To further explore cross-sectional variability, we investigated the buyer-supplier relationship’s moderating role. Results show that an increase in customer concentration strengthens both the positive effects of SCF on performance and the negative effects of SCF on risk. Overall, our study contributes to the literature on the interface of operations and finance in supply chains by exploring the multiple facets of SCF adoption and highlighting the moderating role of buyer-supplier relationship in SCF and SME competitiveness. Finally, we provide managerial implications for SMEs and financial service providers by validating the value of SCF implementation and the buyer-supplier relationship management in forging competitive advantages.</jats:p>",

In this study, the potential for deploying machine learning algorithms, including principal component regression (PCR), support vector regression (SVR) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, are tested to build predictive models. These tools were used to estimate chemical dosage at a daily time-scale. Influent water quality such as pH, color, turbidity, and alkalinity, as well as chemical dosage including sulfuric acid, ferric sulfate and liquid oxygen were used to build and test these models. An 80/20 percent data split was used for training and testing model performance using correlation coefficients, relative mean square error, relative root mean square error and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency. Results indicate, compared with PCR, both SVR and LSTM were able to capture the nonlinear relationship between chemical dose and source water quality changes and displayed higher predictive skills. These types of models have application in real-time operational support without requiring computationally expensive physics-based models.</jats:p>",

The system consists of one supplier, one leader retailer 1, one follower retailer 2, and the government. In this system, the government subsidizes each retailer based on the selling price of the product. The supplier is subject to a yield uncertainty process. The suppler decides whether to leak leader retailer 1′s order quantity to follower retailer 2 or not. In this study, we first built a Stackelberg game to address the equilibrium green operation decisions, when the supplier has and has not information leakage behavior, respectively. Subsequently, we identify the supplier’s information leakage equilibrium and how such behavior affects retailers’ ex ante profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare through a numerical study. Interestingly, we obtained the following results: (1) Supplier leaks are the unique equilibrium of the supplier. The product’s green degree and wholesale price at supplier’s equilibrium are higher under information leakage than under no information leakage. (2) The supplier’s information leakage behavior is good for leader retailer 1 and bad for follower retailer 2. (3) Information leakage behavior increases both consumer surplus and social welfare under certain conditions. (4) In general, key system parameters (e.g., the subsidy rate, supply uncertainty, supply correlation, and forecast accuracies) positively correlate with consumer surplus and social welfare in the same direction, while they affect retailer 1′s and retailer 2′s ex ante profit in the opposite direction. These findings provide useful insights for businesses to manage demand forecast information and make decisions on the green level of the product in green supply chain management.</jats:p>"

The research data comprises survey data and financial reporting data from 508 manufacturing and trading firms operating in Finland, divided among four supply chain tiers. The economic dimension dominates the decision making on all tiers, followed by social and environmental considerations, resembling the shape of Mickey Mouse. Unabsorbed organisational slack is negatively related to the importance of economic considerations and positively related to environmental considerations. The results help firms in evaluating their position in terms of sustainability and in their redesigning efforts accordingly.

These halogenated hydrocarbons infiltrate into the soil matrices and form pools at the bottoms of the aquifers thus contaminating the groundwater sources. Thermally enhanced soil vapour extraction (TSVE) using steam–air injection has gained popularity as an alternative technique to remediate the saturated and vadose source zones contaminated with CHC. This technique has been successfully applied in the remediation of contaminated sites (brownfields, industrial sites) and groundwater. However, the presence of organic carbon (OC) contents within the soil matrices has not been intensively studied. This paper, therefore, intends to contribute toward increasing the understanding of the effects of OC on the remediation time using TSVE. A 2-D flume experimental model was conducted in VEGAS laboratory using coarse sand, fine sand and silty soil with 0, 1 and 2% addition of the activated carbon as OC to investigate the desorption time of PCE and TCE as CHC during TSVE extraction using steam–air injection. 100 kg of soil mixed with the activated carbon was treated with 50 g TCE and 50 g PCE and then remediated using TSVE. The remediation times were recorded and recovered CHC was documented. It was discovered that the presence of OC enhanced the adsorption of the CHC onto the soil matrices thereby increasing the time required for the complete remediation of the contaminant from the soil. An increase of OC by 1% resulted in desorption time by a factor of 4–7.</jats:p>",

Yet some work under very daunting conditions. The civil war in Sierra Leone resulted in the destruction of much water supply infrastructure. It also had a devastating impact on the performance of water companies. Since the war ended in 2002 other changes continue, such as: population growth, unplanned urbanisation, environmental destruction and climate change, plus the Ebola outbreak. These pressures all have a massive impact on the natural environment and on demands for water. It is against this background that Guma Valley Water Company is trying to rebuild water infrastructure and strengthen utility arrangements for providing a reliable and affordable service on which people depend. This article describes ongoing efforts to improve water supply in Freetown. The case study highlights the multi-faceted nature of resilience building and the processes that must be undertaken if water companies are to become resilient. Long-term technical and financial support is required, however, programmes should be realistic in their expectations.</jats:p>",

Findings show that relative advantage, cost,  complexity, and competitive pressure significantly affect implementing blockchain in the supply chains. As SMEs frequently have limited capital to invest in technology but meets the same obligations to streamline business operations to optimize profits, blockchain provides a feasible choice for the firms’ sustainability with its characteristics of security, transparency, and immutability that are prospective to develop SMEs’ performance.

The main components of the business model are given, which determine the problems of formation and implementation of the selected business model of a logistics company. The author's approach to the concepts of \"asset-light business model\" and \"asset-based business model\" is proposed. The characteristic features of each business model, potential problems from their use, and the advantages that the implementation of the \"asset-light business model\" gives are determined. The evolution of business models and its modifications, which are determined by the stages of the life cycle of a logistics company and are determined by the influence of the main components of the business model, have been investigated. The structuring of logistics providers by types of business models has been carried out, which makes it possible to clearly determine the potential for logistics company`s success and the content of the main components, in accordance with the chosen business model. Based on the theoretical developments of the authors, an analysis of logistics companies that use the \"asset-light business model\" and \"asset-based business model\" was carried out. The resource provision of each business model is analyzed. It has been substantiated that, despite the type of business model, the main problem is how, using own, leased or resources of other participants in the logistics services market, namely subcontractors, to form an optimal business model or adapt the existing one to the changing conditions of the external environment. To reach this goal, different strategic management tools are used, which include the canvas of the business model. The advantage of using this tool for visualizing the main components that determine the influence of external and internal spheres on the business model of a logistics company has been substantiated. A business model canvas was formed for each logistics company, with different types of business models, which made it possible to determine the competitive advantages of each company. The analysis of indicators (metrics) that are used to assess the effectiveness of business models made it possible to choose the DuPont model based on the return on investment capital. As a result, the influence of the main elements of the model on the final ROIC result was determined, which was confirmed by carrying out the corresponding calculations.</jats:p>"

One hundred and twenty food crop farmers random sampling procedure. Information was obtained from the respondents using a well-structured questionnaire. Data collected were analyzed with both descriptive statistics and budgeting technique. Findings revealed that 88.3% and 86.7% of the PF and NPF, respectively were males. About 50.0% of PF and 56.7% of NPF were between 41 and 50 years of age. The net farm income of the PF was greater than the NPF and benefit cost ratio for PF was more sustainable and viable than that of NPF. The major constraint faced by the OSAISA’ PF was inadequate capital to purchase the desired inputs. Based on the results, the study concludes that OSAISA contributes tremendously to the profitability of patronizing farmers in the study area. It is, therefore, recommended that farmers should be given easy access to acquire loan to meet their input demand and farming business in general; including adequate and timely supply of inputs for effective and efficient productivity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply management is increasingly becoming a focus in this 21st century. For an organisation to compete and successfully operate in the current risky supply management atmosphere, it must apply control measures that are effective within its internal supply management. The supply management environment today is characterised by many risk factors that may have a negative impact on the inventory control operations of an enterprise. However, there is an outcry in the universities procurement sector for inadequate stock control. The paper aims to establish the relationship between inventory audit and supply management in public and private universities in Nakuru County. The study was guided by stock diffusion. The study adopted a correlation research design. The target population of this study was 115 employees drawn from the procurement department from Egerton and Kabarak University since their headquarters are found in Nakuru County. Multistage sampling procedure was used to select the respondents of the study from the two Universities. Taro Yamane’s formula was used to obtain a sample size of 89 respondents. The data were analysed using both quantitative and inferential statistics. Findings revealed that inventory audits were efficiently done. This was improved by ensuring accuracy in recording. The universities also ensure that costs are well controlled to reduce waste and mismanagement of resources in the universities. The inventory audit was also done periodically to ensure all university property and resources were secured. Hence, there existed a significant relationship between inventory audit and supply management (R = 0.836, P&lt;0.05). The study concluded that inventory auditing had a significant influence on supply management. The study recommended that the universities had room for the elimination of shortages, losses and wastage through periodic inventory audits. The universities should also adopt an electronic inventory management system that can make tracking easy</jats:p>"

Especially for metallic minerals, this growth in demand increases the supply risk; therefore, its evaluation is essential to keep the resource supply stable. Supply risk assessment has a long history in both academic and practical studies, but there is no existing study using internet news as its main information source. In this study, we obtained related news articles from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence (SPG) and used them for the supply risk analysis. Using already topic-labeled articles and a gradient boosting framework, non-labeled articles are also labeled and categorized by topic. The articles were assigned to metallic minerals by SPG. We also scored each article using simple sentiment analysis. In short, we found significant potential in internet news articles as information for complementary assessments to existing methods, by providing in-depth information on regulatory or corporate financial activities, which are difficult to cover using the existing numerical indices. While it is useful, it should be noted that the volume of news articles depends on the interests of their readers, and many articles capture changes rather than states. As long as they are used with these caveats in mind, news articles can be very useful as a complementary source of information to existing analytical methods, especially for short-term supply risk assessment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RELEVANCE. Bronchial asthma, along with cardiovascular and oncological diseases, is one of the three most common chronic non- communicable diseases. For the most part, anti-asthmatic drugs (LP) are presented in the form of aerosols, powders, solutions for inhalation and other dosage forms intended for administration directly into the human respiratory tract. It is obvious that misunderstanding of the method of application and / or insufficient effectiveness of LP due to improper use can lead to a decrease in patients’ adherence to the prescribed therapy. In this regard, the availability of pharmaceutical information in the instructions becomes important, i.e. the more accessible the information in the instructions is to the patient, the higher the probability of proper use of the drug, maintaining patient compliance and preserving the patient’s quality of life. PURPOSE. The aim of the study was to analyze the completeness of pharmaceutical information provided in the instructions for the medical use of anti-asthmatic drugs (LP) and on the websites of manufacturing companies, from the standpoint of patients’ compliance with the rules for the use of LP. The main objectives of the analysis were: identification of the proportion of anti- asthmatic drugs that have a detailed scheme of use in the instructions; analysis of the instructions of anti-asthmatic drugs from the position of having indications of additional features of the use / use of drugs; analysis of instructions for anti-asthmatic drugs, the use of which is possible for groups of patients with physical or cognitive disabilities; identification of the share of companies producing anti-asthmatic drugs that support patients by conducting a specialized consulting service on the use of drugs. METHODS. The assessment of the quality of pharmaceutical information for patients was carried out on the basis of an analysis of 165 instructions for the medical use of pharmacotherapeutic groups of drugs designated in GINA-2021 (Global Initiative for Asthma-2021) and Federal Clinical Guidelines for the Treatment of Bronchial Asthma of the Russian Respiratory Society (2019) as anti-asthmatic drugs. The analysis was also carried out in relation to the information content of the websites of anti-asthmatic LP manufacturers, additionally, by creating a direct search query, the presence of a private page on the Internet for specific LP was determined. In the course of the research, methods of logical, comparative analysis, as well as generalization and grouping were used. To process the results obtained, the Excel computer program of the Microsoft Office 10 package was used. RESULTS. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that the vast majority of anti-asthmatic drugs of all the studied pharmacotherapeutic groups are intended for administration directly into the respiratory tract, the article presents the results of a study on the ratio of inhaled and non-inhaled dosage forms in the context of the analyzed pharmacotherapeutic groups. The article presents data on the proportion of anti-asthmatic drugs that have a detailed description in the instructions in addition to the standard method of application (figure, diagram, pictogram) the method of introduction / use of LP. The fact of the absence of a detailed method of application in the instructions of various pharmacotherapeutic groups has been established. The results of the analysis of the number of instructions with the additional properties of LP indicated in them, allowing the use of LP data in patients with physical or cognitive characteristics (limitations), are presented. The number of companies producing anti-asthmatic drugs that have posted detailed information for consumers regarding the use of these drugs on their websites, as well as the number of drugs that have their own website, has been revealed. CONCLUSION. The information in the instructions for the medical use of anti-asthmatic drugs and on the official websites of the manufacturing companies (holders of registration certificates) of the studied drugs is not always exhaustive in terms of the use of inhaled dosage forms, which does not fully ensure the safe and effective receipt of anti-asthmatic pharmacotherapy. According to the authors, improving the quality of information for patients about the rules of using drugs for the treatment of bronchial asthma will simplify the use of dosage forms specific for its therapy, increase patients’ adherence to prescribed pharmacotherapy, reduce the risks from insufficient effectiveness of anti-asthmatic pharmacotherapy and preserve the quality of life of patients associated with the disease.</jats:p>",

İktisat teorisinde, para arzının enflasyon üzerindeki etkisine yönelik farklı görüşler bulunmaktadır. Klasik ve Monetarist iktisatçılar, para arzı artışının –tam istihdam varsayımıyla- uzun vadede sadece enflasyon yarattığını savunmaktadır. Fakat Keynesyen yaklaşım para arzı artışının –eksik istihdam varsayımıyla- enflasyon yaratmadan hâsılayı arttırdığını savunmaktadır. Ampirik literatürde, çalışmaların önemli bir kısmında para arzı artışlarının enflasyon üzerinde pozitif bir etkisi olduğu sonucuna varılmıştır. Ancak literatürde para arzı artışlarının enflasyon üzerindeki etkisinin olmadığı ya da negatif etkisi olduğu şeklinde sonuçlar da mevcuttur.&#x0D;\nGünümüzde yüksek enflasyon birçok gelişmekte olan ekonomi için halen önemli bir sorundur. Örneğin, çalışmanın örneklemi kapsamında ele alınan Türkiye, Hindistan ve Brezilya’nın 2010-2017 yılları arasındaki yıllık ortalama enflasyon oranları sırasıyla %8,4, %7,6 ve %6,4’dür.&#x0D;\nBu bilgiler ışığında yapılan araştırmada, 1995-2017 dönemi arasında seçilmiş 5 gelişmekte olan ekonomi açısından para arzının enflasyon üzerindeki etkisi reel gelir kontrol değişkeninin eklenmesiyle panel veri analizi ile incelenmiştir. Ulaşılan bulgular, seçilmiş 5 gelişmekte olan ekonomi için para arzı büyüme hızındaki bir artışın, enflasyonu arttırmakla birlikte, bu ülkelerde enflasyonun parasal faktörlerden ziyade reel (GSYİH’daki şoklar) bir olgu olduğunu göstermektedir. Bulgular ilgili literatürde daha önce yapılan çalışmaları destekler niteliktedir. Elde edilen bulgular, ülkelerin enflasyonu düşürebilmeleri için üretim (arz) ve para politikalarını koordineli bir şekilde yürütmesi gerektiğini göstermektedir.</jats:p>"

Numerical results show that the existence of fixed assets will increase the expected profit of the farmer, redistributing the risk and profit between the purchaser and the farmer. At the same time, the purchaser and the government are encouraged to provide more funds to the farmer with low value of its fixed assets, which will aid the overall return of the supply chain and the development of supply chain finance. In addition, under the framework of this model, the increase of agricultural production is beneficial to the farmer, not the purchaser. In the case of the same output level, we can alleviate this problem by selecting high-end agricultural products with high price elasticity of demand and high choking price so as to improve the profits of both purchaser and farmer.</jats:p>"

This research study analyzes the challenges faced by the automotive industry in its supply chain operations. Further, the traceability issues and waiting time at different nodes of the supply chain are considered to be priority issues that affect the overall supply chain efficiency in the automotive supply chain. After studying the existing blockchain architectures and their implementation methodology, this study proposes a new blockchain-based architecture to improve traceability and reduce waiting time for the automotive supply chain. A hyper ledger fabric-based blockchain architecture is developed to track the ownership transfers in inbound and outbound logistics. The simulation results of the proposed hyper ledger fabric-based blockchain architecture show that there is an improvement in the traceability of items at different nodes of the supply chain that enhances the Inventory Quality Ratio (IQR) and the mean waiting time is reduced at the factory, wholesaler, and retailer, which thereby improves the overall supply chain efficiency. The blockchain embedded supply chain is more capable to eliminate the risks and uncertainties associated with the automotive supply chain. The benefits of adopting blockchain technology in the automotive supply chain are also described. The developed blockchain-based framework is capable to get more visibility into goods movement and inventory status in automotive supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The energy and power industries are one of the most important economic sectors, essential in creating value-added economic growth in any society. The waste of energy resources and environmental issues in the energy and power plant sectors have created various challenges for the power industry. Managing existing capacities and reducing environmentally harmful effects result in system efficiency enhancement and wasted energy returns to the natural cycle in electricity supply chain divisions. This study aims to determine divisions of an electricity supply chain as resource allocation handling, providing harmful emissions abatement (e.g., carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases) and waste energy mitigation. The proposed intermediate approach measures the unified inefficiency score of each production factor and determines the level of total unified inefficiency from the average of the sum of these inefficiency scores. Indeed, the proposed intermediate approach distinguishes influential supply chain divisions from the uninfluential ones to sources utilization management for abatement of significant flare and greenhouse gases and wasted energy in energy and power plant sectors, as well as transmission and distribution lines. The current paper introduces intermediate approaches for sustainability evaluation of the electricity supply chain based on data envelopment analysis models. The proposed approach evaluates the potential of supply chain divisions to reduce undesirable outputs. The intermediate approach, under managerial disposability, enables us to determine regions of the supply chain with the necessary preparation to confront harmful emissions and wasted energy. One empirical implication has been obtained from model performance in the electricity supply chain. Findings suggested that the oil field, power plant, and transmission line divisions, as well as industrial consumers, have adequate potential for pollution emissions abatement and energy loss prevention as the increase of inputs provides more outputs. Moreover, these divisions are efficient in 10 supply chains. The implications of the results, including the fact that the increase of inputs provides desirable output increments and productivity enhancement in the oil field, power plant sections, and industrial consumers, have been considered.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s globalized economy, all the links of supply chain are interlinked. Most of the upstream raw material manufacturers or producers in the said chain are small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that provide the basis for the efficient operation of the whole supply chain. However, SMEs in China, especially those playing a pivotal role in China’s export-oriented economy at this stage, do not have access to the corresponding financial treatment. Supply chain finance provides a new perspective to solve this contradiction. Henceforth, this paper introduces modern financial engineering risk measurement tools to measure the financial risk in supply chain finance, specifically while evaluating the single financing business. Moreover, the chief objective of this paper will be the analysis of the characteristics and connotations of order financing business model. In addition, the focus will be to analyze the risk of order financing from the perspective of banks and other financial institutions. Additionally, this paper will use the CreditRisk + model based on insurance actuarial principles to manage credit risk in order financing business based on foreign currency settlement, in conjunction with the characteristics of supply chain finance and multinational supply chain. Furthermore, a risk measurement method for the application of order financing in multinational supply chains will be provided. Ultimately, the experiments show that the solution of this paper defines and analyzes the financial risks brought by order financing business to bank financing.</jats:p>",

We used the PRISMA guideline for systematic review to collate relevant information from both published and unpublished literature. Out of 622 screened records, 38 were included in the review. Major impacts were innovation, collaboration, increased technology, research and development, increased prices and shortage of health products, depletion of supply chain personnel. Challenges were lack of visibility, coordination, resilience and strategy for pandemics, potential substandard medicines epidemic, travel restrictions and inadequate scientific knowledge. The studies recommended increased local production and resilience of supply chains. The pandemic disrupted national and international supply chain systems of medical devices, essential medicines and pharmaceutical products due to border closures, transportation and international trade restrictions. It however exposed hidden potentials in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The proposed model is a bi-objective mixed integer linear programming which considers several constraints and aims to minimize the total costs including the procurement, production, storage and distribution costs as well as to maximize on-time deliveries (OTD). To bring the model closer to real-world planning problems, the objective function coefficients (e.g. procurement cost, production cost, inventory holding and transport costs) and other parameters (e.g., demand, production capacity and safety stock level), are all considered triangular fuzzy numbers. Besides, a hybrid mathematical model-based on credibility approach is constructed for the problem, i.e., expected value and chance constrained models. Moreover, to build the crisp equivalent model, we use different property of the credibility measure. The resulted crisp equivalent model is a bi-objective mixed integer linear programs (BOMILP). To transform this crisp BOMILP into a single objective mixed integer linear programs (MILP) model, we apply three different aggregation functions. Finally, numerical results are reported for a real case study to demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed model.</jats:p>",

Its supply networks, which encompass multiple stakeholders, are complex and nontransparent. Blockchain is a trust technology, and some coffee firms have embraced this technology to provide trust attributes to consumers while making their supply chain more transparent. For businesses to gain the expected productivity advantages, a technology must be adopted and used. As theoretical and empirical research on blockchain technology adoption is scarce, this article attempts to identify behavioral intentions of stakeholders in the supply network toward its adoption. Based on exploratory interviews, this article develops a blockchain technology adoption model based on factors relevant to individuals’ use behavior. The results provide evidence that a normative stakeholder management approach positively impacts use behavior. Managers can use the model to benchmark and improve their corporate social responsibility strategy to obtain better returns on blockchain investments. This study closes a research gap as, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no research has been conducted so far on the impact of an instrumental stakeholder management approach on blockchain technology adoption behavior. Understanding how stakeholder management can compensate for the lack of consensus mechanisms in private and consortium blockchains, as well as understanding the factors influencing behavioral intentions toward the use of a technology, can provide for managerial guidance toward the development of an effective stakeholder management strategy, which eventually can result in a competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

Results show that the difference of elevation was sufficient to assure the water transport by gravity from the surrounding water sources to the ornamental fountains, cascades and lakes and to provide 8-12 m water jets. Several scenarios are analysed showing that the fountains and cascades water consumption are in the range of 12.4 to 42.2 L/s, available water sources are enough to satisfy these demands for several hours per day and the two existing tanks, Curro and Miradouro, have sufficient capacity to store water to be used in the ornamental fountains and cascades and in the irrigation of the botanical garden and the horticultural area.</jats:p>",

Genetic resistance to FCR is poorly understood and major gene resistance is not available in adapted cultivars. Chemical control is ineffective and crop rotations, which disrupt cycles of the disease, are not feasible in the region’s precipitation-limited climate. Cultural control methods are the only realistic option for farmers who struggle to minimize the impact of this disease. It is well established that FCR is favored by moisture-limited environments and an oversupply of plant-available nitrogen in soil. Effects of the supply of phosphorus in soil have not been clearly delineated. We conducted a 2-year FCR experiment at two locations in the low-precipitation zone (&lt;30 cm) of north-central Oregon. Phosphorus fertilizer was applied in-furrow with phosphorus (P) at rates of 0, 5, and 15 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, to plots planted with either a hard red or soft white winter wheat cultivar. The P at 15 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> application rate increased tissue phosphorus concentration, early-season dry matter, and phosphorus uptake at both locations and both years of this study. Phosphorus treatment had no effect on grain yield, protein, or test weight. Phosphorus had no effect on the severity of FCR.

The Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) approach was used in this research to find the risks in the banana supply chain of Sri Lanka. According to the literature survey and data analysis, several risks such as human and personal, production, financial, land prices, biological and environmental, information, political, weather-related, management and operational, agricultural policy, logistics and infrastructure, country’s economic cycle, price or market and input risks can be encountered in the banana supply chain. These risks were categorized into different levels according to the influence they provide to the supply chain. Identifying these risks on a hierarchical model was significant to the administrators, managers and farmers to minimize them effectively to manage the supply chain. The analysis in this study further indicated that production, financial, biological and environmental, weather-related events, political situations, and logistics and infrastructure were the most significant risks. Dealing with these risks can minimize the effect of other risks, improve the income of the farmers and maximize consumer choice.Keywords: Agriculture, Banana, Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), Risks, Sri Lanka, Supply Chain.</jats:p>"

However, in the developing countries, particularly in Iraq, these projects experience a lack of a large number of these necessities, which shows the need to identify the critical success factors (CSFs). Accordingly, the objectives of this research are to investigate the CSFs for WSP and their significance among the construction (public and private) and education sectors. To achieve this, first we have carried out a comprehensive literature review of the CSFs for WSP. Second, we administrated a questionnaire survey to 260 construction experts working in the construction and education sectors. It was found that the top five important success factors for water supply projects in Iraq were a stable political environment; sustainable construction legislation and regulation; effective risk management practices; well-organized and committed project teams; and government decisions through the project life cycle. The survey results did not indicate major differences in the perception of the experts. The findings are focused to assist construction practitioners’ gain better understanding on the important areas to achieve project set objectives.</jats:p>",

These include lack of visibility of the upstream party (Provider) to the downstream party (Client); lack of flexibility in the face of sudden variations in demand and control of operating costs; lack of reliance on safety stakeholders; ineffective management of supply chain risks. Blockchain (BC) is used in the supply chain to overcome the growing demands for items. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a profoundly encouraging innovation that can help companies observe, track, and monitor products, activities, and processes within their respective value chain networks. Research establishments and logical gatherings are ceaselessly attempting to answer IoT gadgets in supply chain management. This paper presents orderly writing on and reviewing of Blockchain-based IoT advances and their current usage. We discuss the smart devices used in this system and which device is the most appropriate in the supply chain. This paper also looks at future examination themes in blockchain-based IoT, referred to as the executive’s framework production network. The essential deliberate writing audit has been consolidated by surveying research articles circulated in highly reputable publications between 2016 and 2021.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The huge amount of biomass waste and palm oil mill effluent (POME) generated during oil extraction has prompted the need for a more sustainable framework in waste management. Since oil palm biomass waste is rich in lignocellulosic content, it can be potential to be converted into green energy such as bioelectricity via different pathway of processes such as the thermal conversion pathway and biochemical conversion pathway. This study proposes a mathematical approach to synthesise a sustainable supply chain of biomass to electricity by implementing the combined heat and power (CHP) system in palm oil mill. The optimum pathway of supply chain based on the technical, economical, and environmental aspects is generated. The purpose of this approach is to assists the industry players or owners to make decision in choosing the location of the pre-treatment technology, transportation method, location of power plant and configuration of CHP. A generic superstructure is first developed to achieve the objective. Then, a series of generic mathematical equations will then be formulated based on the pathways demonstrated in the generic superstructure. The mathematical equations involve general mass and energy balance, cost computation and carbon emission. The fuzzy optimisation concept will be adopted in this research to trade-off the conflicting objectives (maximize profit and minimize carbon footprint) in order to generate the optimum pathway. A palm oil-based bioelectricity supply chain case study in Selangor, Malaysia is solved to illustrate the presented approach. According to the optimised result in this case study, a total of 3,753.36 MW of bioelectricity can be generated per year. The result proved that the optimum pathway is feasible by comparing with the existing oil palm biomass-based power plant in Sarawak, where only 375 MW of electricity is generated by oil palm biomass. On the other hand, RM 7.25 million per year of net profit is estimated with a payback period of 2.81 years. Moreover, the CHP system is able to achieve 570 million kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> per year.</jats:p>",

The flow over a compound labyrinth weir is a complex problem because the flow behavior is three-dimensional. The present study aims to simulate the flow over the compound labyrinth weir into the critical regions that cannot be observed when using an experimental test. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) programme was utilised to implement a sensitive analysis for this purpose and under different flow conditions. The MAPE and RMSE indices were utilised to verify the CFD results with experimental work. The statistical indices of the maximum error ME, RMSE and MAPE were 4.7%, 0.033 and 3.9 respectively. Therefore, the findings showed that there is a good matching between the experimental and CFD results. The CFD results demonstrated that the hydraulics behaviour of the compound labyrinth weir was similar to the oblique and linear weirs in high discharges. The results also confirmed that air cavities and bubbles existed behind the nappe flow in addition to the negative pressure that may occur beneath the nappe when the flow is aerated. Furthermore, the flow was divided into two parts and most streamlines were concentrated over the notches. Moreover, the flow velocity passing through the notches was greater than the flow velocity over the high crest of the compound labyrinth weir.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Loss of foundation reef-corals is eroding the viability of reef communities and ecosystem function in many regions globally. Coral populations are naturally resilient but when breeding corals decline, larval supply becomes limiting and natural recruitment is insufficient for maintaining or restoring depleted populations. Passive management approaches are important but in some regions they are proving inadequate for protecting reefs, therefore active additional intervention and effective coral restoration techniques are needed. Coral spawning events produce trillions of embryos that can be used for mass larval rearing and settlement on degraded but recoverable reef areas. We supplied 4.6 million <jats:italic>Acropora tenuis</jats:italic> larvae contained in fine mesh enclosures <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> on three degraded reef plots in the northwestern Philippines during a five day settlement period to initiate restoration. Initial mean larval settlement was very high (210.2 ± 86.4 spat per tile) on natural coral skeleton settlement tiles in the larval-enhanced plots, whereas no larvae settled on tiles in control plots. High mortality occurred during early post-settlement life stages as expected, however, juvenile coral survivorship stabilised once colonies had grown into visible-sized recruits on the reef by 10 months. Most recruits survived and grew rapidly, resulting in significantly increased rates of coral recruitment and density in larval-enhanced plots. After two years growth, mean colony size reached 11.1 ± 0.61 cm mean diameter, and colonies larger than 13 cm mean diameter were gravid and spawned, the fastest growth to reproductive size recorded for broadcast spawning corals. After three years, mean colony size reached 17 ± 1.7 cm mean diameter, with a mean density of 5.7 ± 1.25 colonies per m<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup>, and most colonies were sexually reproductive. Coral cover increased significantly in larval plots compared with control plots, primarily from <jats:italic>A. tenuis</jats:italic> recruitment and growth. Total production cost for each of the 220 colonies within the restored breeding population after three years was United States $17.80 per colony. A small but significant increase in fish abundance occurred in larval plots in 2018, with higher abundance of pomacentrids and corallivore chaetodontids coinciding with growth of <jats:italic>A. tenuis</jats:italic> colonies. In addition, innovative techniques for capturing coral spawn slicks and larval culture in pools <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> were successfully developed that can be scaled-up for mass production of larvae on reefs in future. These results confirm that enhancing larval supply significantly increases settlement and coral recruitment on reefs, enabling rapid re-establishment of breeding coral populations and enhancing fish abundance, even on degraded reef areas.</jats:p>"

However, the effects of N forms on N metabolism and major N assimilation enzymes in different plants, especially vegetables, are largely neglected. This study was conducted on two plants with distinct NH4+ tolerances to compare the responses of two popular leafy vegetables, Korean cabbage (Brassica campestris L.) ‘Ssamchu’ and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) ‘Caesar green’, to the N source. To this end, plant growth and quality, photosynthesis, carbohydrate, N contents (in the forms of NO3−, NO2−, NH4+, total protein), and key N assimilation-related enzyme (NR, NIR, GS, GDH) activities were investigated. When plants were subjected to one of three NH4+:NO3− regimes, 0:100, 50:50, or 100:0, lettuce was relatively more tolerant while cabbage was extremely sensitive to high NH4+. Both plants benefited more from being grown with 50:50 NH4+:NO3−, as evidenced by the best growth performance, ameliorated photosynthesis, and enriched carbohydrate (C) stock content. In addition, as compared to cabbage, the GS and GDH activities were reinforced in lettuce in response to an increasing external NH4+ level, resulting in low NH4+ accumulation. Our findings suggested that boosting or maintaining high GS and GDH activities is an important strategy for the ammonium tolerance in vegetables.</jats:p>"

For many organizations, achieving the goals of their Supply Chain (SC) is constantly threatened by increased competition and disruption. In this study, the aim is to identify, and rank, SC threats in a developing country using Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) with Fuzzy Logic (FL). FMEA parameters were derived for 44 supply chain threats (SCT1 – SCT44) and their Risk Priority Number (RPN) determined. Subsequently, the Mamdani Fuzzy Inference system was utilized to arrive at a Fuzzy-RPN with 125 rules using severity as a determining factor. The rules were ranked to prioritize SC threats. From the conventional FMEA, demand variation (SCT42) and long-distance sourcing (SCT27) had the highest and lowest RPN, respectively. After fuzzification and defuzzification, Fuzzy-RPN identified raw material delay (SCT1), government policy (SCT11), poor transport infrastructure (SCT18) and political instability (SCT19) as threats with the highest Fuzzy-RPN (210) and product recalls (SCT28) with the lowest Fuzzy-RPN (99). Based on these results, it is concluded that a Fuzzy-FMEA approach can identify and rank SC threats with the use of an RPN devoid of sentiments and inaccuracies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article develops economic models for a cow-calf ranching operation and an alfalfa hay operation in the Humboldt River Region (HRR) that use surface water for irrigation. The models were built and parameterized through consultation with ranchers and farmers in the HRR in order to represent typical agricultural operations in the region. The models were used to calculate the economic value to an operation of an acre-foot of water not received due to an unanticipated supply reduction. This analysis was conducted to support the conjunctive management of surface and groundwater in the HRR by providing estimates of the economic value of the water that surface water users expect but do not receive due to interference from upstream groundwater pumping.  For the cow-calf ranch model, reduced water deliveries impact ranch profits by reducing the amount of low-cost feed grown on the ranch. The increase in average feed costs forces the ranch to reduce its herd size, which lowers the number of new calf births and, as a result, lowers future profits from livestock sales. The cow-calf ranching model predicts an economic value of an acre-foot of water for the cow-calf ranch in the range of $215 per acre-foot for unanticipated supply interruptions that occur in normal water years, and upwards of $290 per acre-foot for supply interruptions that occur during drought. Model results do not provide evidence that the economic value of an acre-foot of water increases with the length of the unanticipated supply reduction.  For the alfalfa hay farm model, results indicate that unanticipated reduced water deliveries impact farm profits by first preventing the farm from planting a cover crop during fallow years and then, for more significant interruptions, reducing its acreage of alfalfa hay. The alfalfa hay model predicts that the economic value of an acre-foot of water increases with both the volume of water not received and the length of the unanticipated supply reduction. The economic value of water per-acre-foot predicted by the alfalfa hay model ranges from less than $10 per acre-foot for unanticipated supply interruptions that occur in normal water years, in the range of $100-$200 per acre-foot for single-year supply interruptions that occur during a below average water year, and over $300 per-acre-foot for supply interruptions that occur in successive below average water years.</jats:p>"

Iron and steel industrial parks have a huge demand for water resources and complex production technologies. Therefore, it is very important to study the distribution, transfer and loss of water resources in industrial parks in order to improve the ability to refine water resources management. The purpose of this study was to reveal the water flow in industrial parks by using the principle of water balance and to provide a method for quantification and characteristic recognition of water resources in industrial production processes. In this research, an iron and steel industrial park in North China was chosen as the case study. In order to calculate the water balance of the whole steel production processes, the industrial park was divided into four levels and 110 water units according to the pipe network system and production processes. Based on the results of multi-level and multi-node water balance, this paper analyzed the water intake structure and water consumption structure of industrial parks, and provided the methods to optimize the allocation of water resources and reduce the consumption of fresh water in industrial production processes. The results of the study showed that the energy department accounted for 60.8% of the total water withdrawal of the industrial park. There were 6,249 m3/day of fresh water in the industrial park, which could be replaced by reclaimed water from urban sewage. Evaporation and pipe network leakage were the main water consumption factors in the steel park, which contributed 91.3% of the water consumption. Under the guidance of the research results, the evaporation water consumption of the industrial park was reduced by 8,412 m3/day, and pipe leakage was reduced by 600 m3/day. This article demonstrates the application of the water balance principle in complex water use systems, which is helpful for water resources management based on water use processes.</jats:p>",

The present study investigates the supply chain network and related problems of the biodiesel industry in Cuba. The Jatropha based biodiesel supply chain includes stages like seeds production, feedstock logistics such as harvesting, storage, and transportation, biodiesel production, distribution and final use in diesel engines. The critical factor is the seed production at the level needed for a stable supply of oil to the biodiesel plant. Consumables that are imported are another risk factor in the Jatropha value chain in Cuban local production. The settling of a local bioenergy market is another task for the Jatropha industry but also for the by-products generated (glycerol, Jatropha cake and husk) are also crucial for the sustainability of the industry.</jats:p>"

Aluminium and sulphates salts are the widely used coagulants, such as aluminium sulphate (Alum) and ferric chloride. However, several researches have linked Alzheimer's disease to the use of aluminium sulphate. Hence, scholars have conducted several researches on the possibility to reduce the amount of aluminium sulphate by using natural material/plants base as coagulant aids. In this study, Mallow's Leaves Extracts (MLE) and Carob's Pods Extracts (CPE) were used as an alternative coagulant aid. Couples of coagulation tests were implemented to find the optimal dosage of aluminium sulphates used as coagulants. The results displayed that the maximum turbidity removal efficiency by adding 100% of each coagulant, i.e. alum, MLE and CPE, were 61.16, 51.175 and 37.12%, respectively. In addition, the minimum residual turbidity and maximum turbidity removal efficiency were 4.56 NTU and 97.72% by adding 22.5 alum and 7.5 MLE presenting 30 mg/L dosing. Further, the minimum residual turbidity and maximum turbidity removal efficiency were 15.4 NTU and 92.3% by adding 22.5 alum and 7.5 CPE presenting 30 mg/L dosing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is devoted to the problems of studying the quality of drinking water from decentralized water supply sources of rural settlements. The preparatory stage of the study included: creation of a cartographic basis of the settlement; field reconnaissance routes; express analysis of drinking water quality; creation of situational plans of wells locations, and the basis for the ecological passport of the source of decentralized individual water supply (well). The relevance of the study is due to the deterioration of the quality of water as a source of domestic water supply. This is especially true for the rural population. There is a need to conduct an inventory and certification of wells in accordance with European standards and requirements, as well as modern technical and information capabilities. The ecological passport of a natural object is a system of diagnostic characteristics that allow one to get an idea of its condition and develop ways to improve it. In the process of researching the issue of certification of drinking water sources, we analyzed the accounting systems of these facilities in Canada and Germany. Our sample environmental passport was developed based on a study of groundwater in the village of Poromiv, Volyn region of Ukraine. The quality of drinking water is influenced by both the natural factors – geological structure and climate, and the intensive economic development of the surrounding area. The sample consisted of 40 wells. We used theoretical research methods: analysis, synthesis, abstraction and idealization. Such approaches implied the search for relationships between topological, hydrological and chemical parameters of individual observation points, as well as the ability to build idealized regression models to delineate areas for certification and detailed research. The formation of the information database was carried out using the methods of empirical knowledge. In particular, visual observations have identified potential sources of contamination (private farms – livestock sites, latrine pits, farmland, and infrastructure). They can affect the condition and quality of water in wells. With the help of a level meter, pH-meter, TDS meter and rapid tests for nitrates, the measurements of qualitative indicators that determine the overall hydrochemical state of groundwater were carried out. The general observations revealed non-compliance with the norms of placement of these objects. In particular, in many cases the norms of distance from sheds (more than 20 m) and cesspools (more than 50 m) relative to wells were violated. In addition, there is a general tendency to neglect the rules of formation of cesspools and manures, which contributes to the ingress of pollutants into the soil and subsequently into groundwater. In general, the accounting of wells and their diagnostic characteristics was developed in the form of a database in the ArcGIS environment and a passport of a separate source of water supply. It is proposed to add a situational plan with the location of the water supply source for the main polluting objects to the general technical characteristics. The number of indicators in the passport table can be adjusted depending on the potential sources of pollution and the abilities to monitor the water quality of a particular water user. The purpose of forming documentation of this type is to account and record the problems arising in the arrangement, location and operation of the well for their further solution. This will be the basis for identifying areas vulnerable to nitrate contamination. We identified a number of violations in the location of water supply sources in relation to economic facilities and structures within the study area, which was reflected in the increase of general hydrochemical indicators. Relationships between building density and quantitative values of pH, mineralization and nitrate content were recorded.&#x0D;\nThe final step of the research is to identify problematic sources of decentralized water supply from the viewpoint of population ecological well-being, as well as to develop proposals for the community and individual owners to improve the quality of drinking water.&#x0D;\nKeywords: well, water supply, ecological passport, sources of pollution.</jats:p>"

Evaluating the performance of supply chain network designs can help decision-makers to select the network configuration that meets the business specifications while operating at a reasonable cost. In this study, Social Network Analysis (SNA) metrics are used to evaluate the performance of closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) Network designs in terms of resilience when exposed to disruptions and the balance of flows. CLSC Networks accommodate the flow of returned products from the customers for recycling, remanufacturing, or disposal, increasing the design complexity compared to traditional supply chain networks. The proposed approach involves custom-designed network-level SNA metrics and random forest (RF) feature selection which are computationally low-cost approaches. The proposed metrics are implemented in an R package titled NetworkSNA and shared on GitHub, and RF feature selection method is performed in python. The optimal and near-optimal network designs from a CLSC Network based on real data are used as a case study. The metric values are interpreted into practical recommendations to compare the alternative CLSC Networks.</jats:p>"

Auxin distribution and transport at various Al and B ratios were analyzed using the range of molecular and imaging techniques. Al stress resulted in increased auxin accumulation in root apical meristem (MZ) and transition zones (TZ) while reducing its content in elongation zone (EZ). This phenomenon was explained by reduction in basipetal auxin transport caused by Al blockage of PIN2 endocytosis, regulated at posttranscriptional level. This inhibition of PIN2 endocytosis was dependent on actin filaments and microtubules. B supply facilitated the endocytosis and exocytosis of PIN2 carriers via recycling endosomes conjugated with IAA to modify Al-induced auxin depletion in the EZ. However, disruption of auxin signaling with auxinole did not alleviate Al-induced inhibition of root growth. B supply alleviates Al-induced inhibition of root growth via restoring the endocytic recycling of PIN2 proteins involved in the basipetal (shootward) auxin transport, restoring Al-induced auxin depletion in the elongation zone.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Short summary</jats:title><jats:p>Aluminum-intensified PIN2 abundance, nontranscriptional, via repressing PIN2 endocytosis to block polar auxin transport, and this adverse effect could be alleviated by boron supply.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

A total of 150 groundwater samples have been collected from dig wells, hand pumps, tube wells, etc. for the pre and post-monsoon seasons. A Quantalase Uranium analyzer was used to measure the uranium concentration. The distribution of pH, TDS, DO, nitrate, sulfate, uranium, along with the radiation, has been determined. It was found that the uranium concentration in groundwater varies from 0.10 to 11.30ppb in pre-monsoon and 0.15–6.50ppb in the post-monsoon, which is well below the normal tolerance limit (i.e.30 μg/l WHO). This low availability of Uranium has been attributed to the existence of a lesser number of rocks containing uranium as a source in that area. An attempt has been made to correlate the uranium concentration with the water quality parameters for both seasons. The correlation data reveals that ORP, nitrate, phosphate, calcium, and magnesium show a positive correlation with uranium concentration for both seasons; on the other hand TDS, EC, temperature, DO, fluoride, and chloride show negative correlation. The positive correlation implies that uranium may be present in groundwater as a dissolved salt of these parameters. Comparative studies for the parameters have been done for both the seasons and various factors have been discussed for the occurrence of the same. The annual effective dose associated with the ingestion of uranium by the population of the region has been estimated using USEPA equations.</jats:p>",

Protected soil enterprises are the most energy-intensive industries, since all technological processes are more related to energy consumption: maintaining a microclimate (heating in the cold season, air cooling in the hot season), lighting, irradiation, watering. The quality and cost of manufactured products largely depends on the share of electricity costs. Therefore, the quality of energy supply is one of the pressing issues affecting the efficiency of the enterprise. (Research purpose)  The research purpose is to analyze the impact of the quality of electricity supply on the technological equipment of greenhouses, to compile a list of technological equipment most affected by the quality of electricity supply. (Materials and methods) The article presents an overview analysis of the effect of electric power deviations on the efficiency of technological equipment in greenhouses. (Results and discussion) The averaged dependences of equipment power consumption depends on climatic conditions and daylight duration. (Conclusions) It is necessary to conduct detailed studies in order to develop recommendations to reduce the risks of poor-quality power supply of greenhouse plants. The use of renewable energy sources for alternative and combined energy supply is promising.</jats:p>",

One of the ideal candidates is the utilization of hydrogen as a primary fuel in lieu of fossil fuels. It can be safely stored in liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) materials and recovered on demand. A uniform supply of hydrogen is essential for power production systems for their smooth operation. This study was conducted to determine the operating conditions of the dehydrogenation of perhydro-dibenzyltoluene (H18-DBT) to ensure that hydrogen supply in a continuous flow reactor remains stable over a wide range of temperatures. The hydrogen flow rate from the dehydrogenation reaction was measured and correlated with the degree of dehydrogenation (DoD) evaluated from the refractive index of reactant liquid samples at various temperatures, WHSV and the initial reactant concentrations. Moreover, a kinetic model is presented holding validity up to a WHSV of 67 h−1. The results acquired present a range for an order of reaction from 2.3 to 2.4 with the required activation energy of 171 kJ/mol.</jats:p>"

This study strategically analyzes the economic and structural effects of disruption on a global supply chain network with customs duty and the trans-pacific partnership (TPP) agreement. Methods: We present a cost minimization model which helps in understanding the difficulty of supplying materials or products to factories or customers if the supplier’s cities are facing disruption. This enables us to model and evaluate simultaneous considerations of supplier disruption, customs duty, and TPP in redesigning a global supply chain network. This network is modeled and formulated using integer programming, disruption scenarios, and a sensitivity analysis for customs duty. Results: Regarding the impact of disruptions on suppliers, two patterns emerge in the reconfigured network: direct changes due to supplier disruptions and indirect changes due to factory relocation. The sensitivity analysis for customs duty shows that the TPP has a positive impact on cost maintained, even in the presence of disruptions. Conclusions: Suppliers should be switched depending on the scale of disruption; when many distant suppliers need to be switched, the factory should be relocated to the country where these suppliers are located.</jats:p>"

A hydroponic sand culture experiment was conducted to know the effect of N:P supply ratio at two N and P supply levels on kalonji. N:P ratios maintained in nutrient solution ranged from 2 to 18 at two levels of N and P designated as high and low. The plants produced more biomass and seeds with higher antioxidant activity, total phenolics and flavonoids at high N and P supply levels. Biological weight, seed weight, antioxidant activity and total phenolics were not affected by N:P supply ratio. However, high N:P supply ratios i.e. 15 and 18 reduced total flavonoids in kalonji seeds. N uptake by the plant was not influenced by N:P supply ratio however, P uptake was found maximum at ratios 6 to 9. It is concluded from the results that kalonji plants with better quality seeds can be more successfully grown if N:P supply ratio is maintained at or near 7 in the growth medium</jats:p>"

Suboptimal labor conditions and low payments have led to significant outflow of medical professionals from public to private health sector resulting in insufficient number of doctors and nurses, but the impact of this lack of personnel has not been assessed. Aim: To study associations between staffing in medical organizations and population morbidity in 2009-2018 in Ryazan region. Methods: Secondary data on population morbidity and staffing of medical organizations for the period from 2009 to 2018 were used for all analyses. Results: Total morbidity in the Ryazan region decreased from 7 400.3 to 7 214.9 per 10 thousand. Significant urban-rural differences were observed. In 2018, urban morbidity exceeded rural morbidity by 80 %. Staffing of healthcare system has been decreasing over the study period which is in line with the national trend. The number of doctors has been decreasing more rapidly than the number of nurses. Conclusions: Staffing of medical organizations is associated with population morbidity. Further research should concentrate on the factors that could explain the observed associations.</jats:p>"

Use of the near-resonant mode of operation is proposed with a view to reach maximum output capacity. With that end in view, it is proposed to use the transformer with higher inductance. Oscillograph charts of two modes of operation of the ozone generator are analysed. Current waveform factors are determined by the harmonic analysis method. Experiments proved that current waveform factor increase in value for the account of continuous discharge is conductive to increase of ozone output by 25-30 % and power loss reduction by 10-15 %.</jats:p>",

The proposed solution reflects the mechanical dynamics of vehicles as well as the distribution and losses of electric supply. Moreover, energy conversion losses between the mechanical and electrical subsystems and their bilateral influences are included. Such a complete model makes it possible to replicate, e.g., the impact of voltage drops on vehicle acceleration or the necessity of partial disposal of regenerative braking energy due to temporary lack of power transmission capability. The modeling methodology uses a flexible twin data-bus structure, which poses no limitation on the number of vehicles and enables modeling complex traction power supply structures. The proposed solution is suitable for various electrified transportation systems including suburban and urban systems. The modeling methodology is applicable i.a. to Matlab/Simulink, which makes it broadly available and customizable, and provides short computation time. The applicability and accuracy of the method were verified by comparing simulation and measurement results on an exemplary trolleybus system operating in Pilsen, Czech Republic. Simulation of daily operation of an area including four supply sections and maximal simultaneous number of nine vehicles showed a good conformance with the measured data, with the difference in the total consumed energy not exceeding 5%.</jats:p>"

Analyzing the spatiotemporal soil moisture dynamics in the area will inform agricultural drought and flood disaster assessment and early warning studies. Therefore, we evaluated the quality of European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Soil moisture (ESA CCI_SM) data in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA. Then, we used ensemble empirical modal decomposition, Mann-Kendall tests, and regression analysis to study the spatiotemporal variation in soil moisture for the past 29 years. The CCI _SM data showed a high correlation with local soil measurements at nine sites. We then analyzed the CCI_SM data from three pumping stations (the Gaogang, Hongze, and Liushan stations) in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA. These stations had similar periodic characteristics of soil moisture, with significant periodic fluctuations around 3.1 d. The overall soil moisture at the three typical pumping stations showed an increasing trend. We then investigated whether there were abrupt soil moisture changes at each station. The spatial distribution of soil moisture in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA was characterized by &amp;ldquo;dry north and wet south&amp;rdquo;, with higher soil moisture in winter, followed by autumn, and low soil moisture in spring and summer. Although the linear trend of soil moisture in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA varied in significance, the overall soil moisture in the JWSA has increased over the past 29 years. The areas with significantly enhanced soil moisture are mainly distributed in the Yangzhou and Huai'an areas in the southeastern part of the study area. The areas with significantly decreased soil moisture are small in size and mainly located in northern Xuzhou.</jats:p>"

Accordingly, the benchmark organization is identified and its strategy is explored for GSCM performance improvement.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The research develops an innovative GSCM performance evaluation framework using six parameters, namely, investment in corporate social responsibility, investment in research and development, utilization of renewable energy, total energy consumption, total carbon-di-oxide emissions and total waste generation. An integrated multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed in which the entropy method calculates criteria weights. The Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) and the Grey relational analysis (GRA) methods are used to rank supplier organizations based on their performance scores. A real-world case of green supplier selection (GSS) is considered in which five leading India-based automobile manufacturing organizations (Supplier 1, Supplier 2, Supplier 3, Supplier 4 and Supplier 5) are selected. Surveys with industry experts at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels are carried out to collect relevant data.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The results reveal that total carbon dioxide emission is the most influential parameter, as it gains the highest weight. On the contrary, investment in research and development, and total waste generation have no significant impact on GSCM performance. Results show that Supplier 5 secures the top rank.

The entropy weight-based COPRAS and GRA methods offer an error-free channel of decision-making and can be proficiently used to outrank various industrial sectors based on their GSCM performances.

Hence, the research findings are practically feasible. The less significant parameters identified in this study would enable managers to impart more attention to vulnerable areas for improvement. This research may help policymakers identify the influential parameters for effective GSCM implementation. As this research considers all aspects of sustainability, the strategies of the benchmark supplier have a direct impact on organizations' overall sustainability. The study would enable practitioners to make various strategies for GSCM performance improvement and to develop a cleaner production system.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The originality of this research lies in the consideration of both economic, social, environmental and operational aspects of sustainability for assessing the GSCM performance of supplier organizations.

This research paper aims to determine challenges in SSCM adoption and to address related complexity using the system dynamics (SD) approach utilizing modeling and simulation techniques. This research identified challenges from the literature using content analysis. Causality among these identified challenges was determined using interviews and questionnaire surveys that led to the development of a causal loop diagram (CLD), which was used in the development of the SD model. Among the 19 shortlisted variables, CLD had IV reinforcing and II balancing loops. Moreover, CLD was used to build an SD model with two stocks, and a new stock named ‘project performance’ was added to envisage the cumulative impact of all stocks. The model was simulated for five years, and the results predict that the lack of top management commitment and corporate social responsibility adversely affects project performance. This implies that there is a need to improve numerous factors, in particular corporate social responsibility and top management commitment, which would lead to the adoption of SSCM, thus leading to a performance improvement for the construction industry (CI). The model was validated using boundary adequacy, structure, and parametric verification tests, which showed that the developed model is logical and approximately replicates the industry’s actual system. The research findings will help the CI practitioners to adopt sustainability principles in terms of the supply chain and will not only enhance productivity and performance but will also help in the minimization of delays, promote long-term relations, and reduce communication gaps and project complexities.</jats:p>"

Since this study is undertaken using the Nepalese sample, the knowledge and skills prioritized by employers, it can be of value to educators while designing their LSCM course content. Desk-based research involving content analyses was done to understand the supply side information i.e. relative coverage of LSCM topics in business-related courses and degrees offered at selected five Nepalese Universities and for the demand side information i.e. analysis of job description of the LSCM related vacancies in the Nepalese job market over eighteen weeks. The study reveals that the inclusion of LSCM courses in the business programs at Nepalese Universities is currently negligible as none of them offered a separate program dedicated to LSCM. Besides, the LSCM courses were limited to just one course per program weighing not more than three credit hours. Instead, there seems to be an unprecedented number of business schools and colleges leaning towards more sellable traditional business degrees related to finance, marketing, human resource management, IT, and hospitality. Finally, when comparing the relative coverage of LSCM topics in the curriculum to the relative demand for such knowledge by the employers, there seems to be an over-emphasis or under-emphasis of courses related to LSCM both at the bachelors and masters level indicating a mismatch between the expectations of employers and education offered by the universities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The demand for water is continuing to increase as population and industry grow. The Natural Resources Defense Council indicated that Texas is at “extreme risk” for implementation of sustainable water management practices especially since groundwater is the supplier of much of the state’s freshwater. This study is designed to assess groundwater conservation practices in association with oil and gas production from the surrounding areas of the Carrizo-Wilcox formation in Texas. The results of this study reveal that the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC), the governing agency for Texas oil and gas development, permits produced water to be discharged into surface waters if the discharged water quality meets Texas Surface Water Quality Standards (TSWQS) set by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) for the specific receiving water body.  After careful evaluation of data provided by the Railroad Commission of Texas, it is believed that nearly 5,331,975 m3 (4,321 ac⋅ft) of produced water per year, with an average TDS of 960 mg L-1, is being removed from the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer through discharge permits designated as “agricultural”. The RRC is not legally required to share the discharge information with local Groundwater Conservation Districts. Based on an evaluation of the reported Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) test data, 69 discharges amount to total suspended solid (TDS) levels of less than 1,000 mg L-1, 35 are between 1,000-1,500 mg L-1, and 20 between 1,500 - 4,000 mg L-1.  Although 69% of discharges exceed the secondary drinking water standard for TDS (500 mg L-1), the average of all discharges, 960 mg L-1, is in line with the arbitrary upper limit for freshwater based on the suitability for human consumption. In addition, the water quality of surface discharges complies with requirements for several water reuses associated with agricultural and industrial practices. The lack of communication between groundwater users leads to conflicting groundwater practices that have negative impacts such as contribution to aquifer over-exploitation and alteration of hydraulic gradients, in turn negatively impacting existing groundwater conservation efforts.</jats:p>"

These materials are often processed by remote laser beam welding where short welds (e.g., up to 40 mm seam length) are commonly used. Such setups prevent gas nozzles from being carried along on the optics due to the scanner application and a small area needs to be served locally with inert gas. The article provides systematic investigations into the interaction of laser beam processes and parameters of inert gas supply based on a modular flat jet nozzle. Based on the characterization of the developed nozzle by means of high-speed Schlieren imaging and constant temperature anemometry, investigations with heat conduction welding and deep penetration welding were performed. Bead-on-plate welds were carried out on stainless steel AISI 304 for this purpose using a disc laser and a remote welding system. Argon was used as shielding gas. The interaction between Reynolds number, geometrical parameters and welding/flow direction was considered. The findings were proved by transferring the results to a complex weld seam geometry (C-shape).</jats:p>"

The aluminium concentration in PAC and its hydrolysis mechanism varied with the basicity of PAC. Incremental addition of PAC changes various physico-chemical properties and turbidity removal mechanisms in water. Water treatment plants use the PAC concentration beyond its optimum dose without considering other aspects, including residual aluminium concentration. In the present work, the effect of high and medium basicity of PAC on different physico-chemical properties like pH, zeta potential, and residual aluminium concentration of water was investigated. The pH of treated water decreases with the incremental addition of PAC, and an increase in zeta potential and residual aluminium concentration in treated water was evidenced. The change in pH after PAC addition is responsible for deciding the coagulation mechanism and efficiency of the coagulation process. pH reduction is comparatively more in high basicity PAC than medium basicity. PAC hydrolysis mechanism is controlled by the zeta potential of water and can be used as an alternative method to decide the optimum coagulant dose. The performance of clariflocculator and pulsator-based WTP was also evaluated for raw water from the same source. To reduce down the turbidity below the acceptable level, the coagulant requirement for clariflocculator based WTP is comparatively less than pulsator based WTP. The floc blanket in the pulsator gets disturbed with a slight change in the coagulant chemistry and quantity.</jats:p>",

Secondly, for the station-based with reservation one-way car-sharing problem (SROC), this article establishes a dynamic scheduling model under the principle of customer priority. The model introduces balance coefficients to predict the balance mode, and systematically rebalance the fleet networks in each period. In the case of meeting customer needs, the model objective function is to maximize the total profit and minimize the scheduling and loss costs. Then, in view of the diversity and uncertainty of scheduling schemes, a scheme information matrix is constructed. In the iterative process of genetic algorithm, individuals are selected and constructed according to the pheromone matrix, and evolution probability is proposed to control the balance between global search and local search of genetic algorithm. Finally, the data of Haikou City is used for simulation experiment. </jats:p>",

The study developed a ‘pipe health scorecard’ based on historical failure data which could be used for operation, maintenance, refurbishment, or replacement decisions by a water utility. This scorecard model was developed by using 160,413 pipe-condition data sets from the South Australian Water Corporation over ten years. Measures such as the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic, Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), and Population Stability Index (PSI) showed the model is strong enough to predict the health status of water mains. The study found the factors influencing water mains failure to be in the order of importance: length, material, age, location (road vs verge), diameter, and operating parameters. The development of a simple but reliable model for the assessment of the health status of water mains will have major benefits to the water utility with the ability to identify and potentially replace water pipes prior to failure. Additional benefits of flexible scheduling of maintenance and replacement programs would contribute to cost savings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The energy sector faces increasing pressure to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of its supply chains. Smart warehousing solutions have emerged as a key innovation to address these challenges, offering advanced technologies and systems that optimize storage, inventory management, and distribution processes. This paper explores the latest developments in smart warehousing and their application in the energy sector, focusing on how these solutions contribute to optimizing energy supply chains. Smart warehousing leverages technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), automation, robotics, and data analytics to streamline operations. IoT devices provide real-time tracking and monitoring of inventory, ensuring accurate stock levels and reducing the risk of overstocking or stockouts. Automation systems, including robotic arms and automated guided vehicles (AGVs), enhance the speed and accuracy of goods handling, reducing labor costs and improving operational efficiency. Furthermore, advanced data analytics enables predictive maintenance, helping to identify potential equipment failures before they occur, thus minimizing downtime and maintaining continuous operations. In the energy sector, smart warehousing solutions are particularly valuable in managing the complex logistics of equipment, spare parts, and raw materials. By integrating these systems into energy supply chains, companies can improve resource allocation, reduce waste, and ensure timely delivery of critical components. Additionally, smart warehouses can support sustainability goals by optimizing energy use within the facility through energy-efficient lighting, climate control systems, and energy consumption monitoring. This paper highlights the benefits of smart warehousing, including cost savings, enhanced operational visibility, and reduced environmental impact. It also discusses the challenges of adopting these technologies, such as high upfront costs, integration complexity, and workforce training. However, with continued technological advancements and strategic investments, smart warehousing solutions present a significant opportunity for optimizing energy sector supply chains.</jats:p>"

The objective was to produce a comprehensive timeline on the global evolution and progress of water reuse. This was achieved through the analysis of the state of the art on the subject. The present study is a qualitative research, where three aspects have been considered to highlight the global evolution of water reuse: i) Regulations, Standards, Criteria or Guidelines (RSCG); ii) Indirect Potable Reuse Projects (IPR); and iii) Direct Potable Reuse Projects (DPR). The study focused on both legal and practical aspects of water reuse and considered three timelines in the context of RSCG, IPR and DPR: 29 RSCG instruments, institutionalized from 1918 to 2020, where only four instruments were solely dedicated to drinking water reuse; 10 IPR projects; five DPR projects. To achieve good, effective results, the regulatory framework must support the objectives of a structured water reuse policy in addition to guaranteeing legitimacy and maintaining public confidence. Integrated water and wastewater management, based on technological and scientific advances, has become a relevant aspect for implementation of more adequate measures by decision makers to address future global water challenges.</jats:p>",

Based on this plan, and under the condition of satisfying the scheduling constraints of cascade reservoirs, the minimum total water supply shortage in the watershed was taken as the main goal coupled with the cascade reservoir runoff optimization control coefficient. An optimized dispatch model of the reservoir group was established accordingly. The large system coordination decomposition algorithm was called to solve the model and obtain the water scheduling scheme of each reservoir. After the optimal regulation of runoff, the water demand of the three major irrigation areas of Changma, Shuangta, and Huahai in the planned year is greater than the available water resources of the Shule River and the Petroleum River. The total surface runoff water shortage is 66.01 million m3, which cannot be satisfied. Among the reservoirs, Shuangta has the highest water shortage quota of 43.503 million m3, followed by Chijinxia with a water deficit quota of 22.18 million m3, and finally by Changma with a minimum water shortage quota of 0.3277 million m3. The results of this work may provide technical support for water resource allocation and regulations, as well as for the efficient usage of the Shule River Basin.</jats:p>",

The year-round supply of quality green fodder is challenging to livestock farmers; however, it is possible by adopting perennial grass-legume intercropping systems. Methods: A field experiment with eight treatments consisting of two perennial grasses (Napier- bajra hybrid grass and guinea grass) alone or in combination with three fodder legumes (Lucerne, Hedge Lucerne and Sesbania) was conducted for 3 years (2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19) in a sandy loam soil at the Agricultural Research Institute, Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University, Hyderabad. The treatments were replicated thrice in a randomized block design. Perennial grasses were raised in paired row method (row to row 120cm and plant to plant 60 cm. The legume intercrops were grown with their respective spacing within 120 cm row. Sesbania inter crop was allowed to grow for 6 months and later trimmed to a height of 1 meter in the establishment year. Growth parameters were measured only for grasses at each harvesting and green fodder, dry matter and crude protein yields were recorded for both grasses and legumes at each cut and accumulated annually (total 6 cuts/year) for statistical analyses. Result: The results indicated that among the grasses, Napier-bajra hybrid recorded significantly higher green fodder, dry matter and crude protein yields; in case of leguminous inter crops, Sesbania recorded highest green fodder, dry matter and crude protein yields followed by Hedge Lucerne. About total productivity of the system, Napier-bajra hybrid + Sesbania (2:1) cropping system recorded highest green fodder, dry matter and crude protein yields. Highest net returns and B:C ratio was also noted with Napier bajra hybrid +Sesbania (2:1) cropping system and proved to be the best perennial fodder system for year-round supply fodder to the livestock.\n</jats:p>"

Three variables consisting of information sharing, long term relationship, and cooperation, is considered to have an influence on the performance of the company's supply chain management. The results showed that information sharing and cooperation significantly influence the performance of the company's supply chain management, while long term relationship has no significant effect.

There are clarity and trust in information sharing and cooperation between breeders, farmers, and collectors, so the quality of the information sharing and cooperation are obtained allows farmers to run the business well. Therefore, to improve the performance of enterprise supply chain management, the catfish farming community need to optimize long-term relationship. This is due to the lack of trust that exists between the breeders, farmers, and collectors due to prices that often change; this causes farmers to often look for new breeders or collectors in the hope of not harming the farmers.Â </jats:p>"

The problem is formulated as a problem with non-linearity object and consists in its phase (temperature, humidity and CO2 gas content) coordinates stabilizing by the premises heating capacity and its air exchange intensity controlling. A mathematical model of control object’s dynamics parameters based on material flows and energy balance equations is developed. A cyclic algorithm for this problem solving has been developed, it consists of two successive stages: the control search this problem solving, and the found control establishment until any of the coordinates’ phase go beyond the established limits due to disturbances.The search for the control vector consists in periodic relay switching of its coordinates from specified maximum to minimum values so that the phase coordinates remain in the region of permissible variation. It is shown that the control vector corresponding coordinates as their average values for the switching cycle are defined. A block diagram of the control system implementing the developed algorithm is presented. The calculation data are given for a pigsty for 1300 animals.</jats:p>",

Global challenges such as climate change, intensive agriculture and urbanisation put a high pressure on our water resources. Due to recent innovations in measuring both water quantity and quality, river systems can now be monitored in real time at an unprecedented spatial and temporal scale. To interpret the sensor measurements and remote sensing observations additional data, for example on the location of the measurement, and upstream and downstream catchment characteristics, are required. In this paper, we present a data management system to support flow-path-related functionality for decision making and prediction modelling. Adding meta-datasets and facilitating (near) real-time processing of sensor data questions are key concepts for the systems. The potential of the database framework for hydrological applications is demonstrated using different applications for the river system of Flanders. In one, the database framework is used to simulate the daily discharge for each segment within a catchment using a simple data-driven approach. The presented system is useful for numerous applications including pollution tracking, alerting and inter-sensor validation in river systems, or related networks.</jats:p>",

The COVID-19 outbreak has exposed the global vulnerability of the supply chain network. The current pandemic has severely affected almost every SC network because its members are situated at the international level. One of the reasons for SC network failure is the deterministic assumptions of different parameters. A realistic SC network model requires the use of the uncertain value of the parameters, which can be further captured by fuzzy numbers. This paper discusses the possibilistic moment of several nonlinear types of fuzzy numbers that are important for SC network modeling. We give closed-form possibilistic moments’ expression for various types of fuzzy numbers that are very similar to the moment’s properties in probability theory and stochastic process. We then illustrate the application of proposed fuzzy numbers by solving an inventory model. This paper also provides results related to the EPQ inventory model in a fuzzy possibilistic setup.</jats:p>",

This paper focuses on the execution of such transformation activities within a heavily regulated financial services organisation that faced several internal and external gaps. Gaps included a heavy reliance on suppliers to maintain critical operations, increased regulatory oversight and a lack of standardisation and organisational integration within the procurement function needed to service internal customers. A successful transformation for such an organisation required a focus on three primary pillars (workstreams): procurement, supplier diversity and supplier risk. Each workstream addressed a unique set of challenges and, as such, were carried out independently; however, the interrelated nature of these challenges called for strong planning, shared resources and parallel efforts. The results of the initial gap assessments showed a need for procurement team right-sizing (in terms of resources and role definitions), a revision of core policy and standard operating procedures, and a re-evaluation of the technologies that supported both procurement operations and regulatory reporting/compliance. The transformation, embodied by the three pillars above, addressed each of these gaps. This transformation began the reimagining of the procurement function but work in this space is ongoing. Requirements around third-party risk management, supplier diversity and the regulatory landscape will continue to shift and evolve. Regular monitoring of the effectiveness of this transformation must be conducted, and strategic pivots and change management efforts must be undertaken to ensure long-term success.</jats:p>"

The value of salmon fish, and in particular rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792) available for breeding, is largely determined by the high content of biologically active essential and polyunsaturated fatty acids of the group ω-6 and ω-3, necessary for vital activity and not synthesized by the human body. Since the natural stocks of many popular fatty fish have decreased, farmed fish can help meet consumer demand for this product. Based on this, the assessment of the content of the main ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acids in the fat of rainbow trout grown in closed-loop water supply installations (USV) was made. The fat was extracted from the fish by thermal method with further distillation by supercritical fluid extraction on the SFT-150 unit. The ratio of fatty acids in the fish oil sample was determined using the Chromatek-Kristall-5000 M hardware and software complex. The results obtained were compared with the standard for salmon fish oil “Aquaculture products” and “Wild fish”. It is established that trout cultivated in the UZV in the Penza region, in terms of the content of the main essential fatty acids, is not inferior to the quality indicators of the standard in terms of the requirements for salmon fish of “Aquaculture products”. In fish, all essential fatty acids are present in sufficient quantities, the ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 is 2.6:1, which indicates a high nutritional value of the product and allows it to be used in human food to provide the body with essential fatty acids, as well as a raw material for obtaining therapeutic and preventive products.</jats:p>",

To determine the vessel density of the superior (SCP) and deep retinal capillary plexuses (DCP) in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods. This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 25 eyes of 25 healthy volunteers and 30 eyes of 17 patients with RP were evaluated in this study. The integrity of the ellipsoid zone in the macular fovea was evaluated as an intact or defect using a spectral-domain OCT. Commercial spectral domain coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was used to scan the macular region of approximately 3 × 3 mm2. The vessel density in the SCP and DCP were calculated after appropriate layer segmentation and removal of projection artifacts. The central retinal thickness (CRT) was measured with automated software. The vessel densities in the SCP and DCP were compared between different groups using SPSS. Results. A total of 25 eyes of 25 healthy subjects and 30 eyes of 17 patients with RP were evaluated in the study. There was no significant difference in ages between the two groups (F = 0.065 and <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <mi>P</mi>\n                        <mo>=</mo>\n                        <mn>0.937</mn>\n                     </math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>).

In a nation like India, blockchain application in the supply chain is still new; therefore, supply chain players need a better understanding and awareness of blockchain through valuable insights. This article aims to study the mediating role of blockchain technology adoption (BLCT) for sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP). This study investigates the influence of numerous factors such as green and lean practices, supply chain integration, supply chain risk, performance expectancy, top management support, cost, internal and external environmental conditions, regulatory support, and innovation capability on BLCT adoption. A sample of 316 respondents from Indian ASC industries was collected, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used. This study's outcomes show that green and lean practices, supply chain integration, supply chain risks, internal and external conditions, regulatory support, innovation capability, and cost positively influence BLCT adoption. Moreover, BLCT positively influences sustainable agriculture supply chain performance. This article is valuable for policymakers, managers, service providers, researchers, and academicians to understand the role of factors in influencing BLCT and BLCT's role in improving sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP).</jats:p>",

The dynamic nature of energy supply chains, driven by fluctuating demand, geopolitical factors, and environmental concerns, necessitates innovative strategies to maintain resilience and adapt to emerging challenges. This study explores advanced methodologies for optimizing supply chain management within the energy sector, focusing on enhancing efficiency and promoting sustainability. Key strategies identified include the integration of digital technologies, such as blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI), which enable real-time data monitoring, predictive analytics, and improved decision-making. Additionally, adopting circular economy principles, such as resource recovery and recycling, fosters environmental sustainability while reducing costs. The research emphasizes the importance of supplier collaboration and diversification to mitigate risks associated with market volatility and geopolitical uncertainties. Furthermore, implementing energy-efficient logistics, such as green transportation and warehousing solutions, significantly minimizes carbon footprints. The study also highlights the critical role of regulatory compliance and policy alignment in achieving long-term sustainability goals. It underscores the necessity of incorporating renewable energy sources into supply chain operations to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and align with global decarbonization efforts. Stakeholder engagement, including partnerships with local communities and non-governmental organizations, is identified as a key factor in fostering transparency and trust. Case studies from leading energy companies demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in reducing operational bottlenecks, enhancing resource utilization, and improving overall supply chain performance. The findings contribute to a holistic framework for energy companies aiming to balance economic growth with environmental stewardship.</jats:p>"

Exogenous factors included the constructs of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) practices and the single-item construct voluntary adoption of SSCM practices, while endogenous variables included the three aspects of firm performance. The relationship between sustainable management practices and organizational performance was ascertained using Structural Equation Modeling. A few significant results are presented as follows; (1) Environmental Management Practices (EMP) results in enhanced Sustainable Environmental Performance (SENP) and Sustainable Economic Performance (SECP); (2) Organizational Performance has a strong correlation with SECP and COMP; (3) SECP has a substantial and favorable relationship with both competitiveness and sustainable environmental performance, as well as sustainable economic performance. The positive relationship between SSCM practices and firm performance demonstrates that continual sustainable management principles eventually improve community capacity. This ultimately results in an organization’s competitiveness. Additionally, the managerial implications of the results are addressed.\n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The process of carbonization of concrete with different ratio of water to cement (W/C) was studied, and the influence of the environment on corrosion damage of reinforced concrete reinforcement was studied. The results of the study of carbonization of concrete on specially prepared model samples of concrete with a size of 250x250x250 mm with an exposure period in NACE solution for 500 days without external load are presented. Measurements of corrosion damage of reinforcing rods, which were placed inside concrete cubes, were performed. The method of estimating the amount of carbonization of concrete and corrosion of reinforcement is described in detail in known scientific papers. The obtained data testify to the active carbonization of concrete during the whole exposure period of the samples in NACE solution, however, concrete prepared at the ratio W/C = 0.5 and 0.6 is particularly significant in terms of carbonization intensity. Concrete with a ratio of W/C = 0.7 is less susceptible to damage. Moreover, a similar trend is observed for corrosion of fittings. This is due to the fact that the increase of the aqueous medium in the concrete mass facilitates diffusion processes of delivery to the reactive zone of chemically aggressive ingredients such as carbon dioxide, chloride ions, hydrogen, sulfur, sulfate ions, various types of bacteria and the like. The kinetics of concrete carbonization and corrosion of reinforcing bars in chemically aggressive NACE medium depending on the exposure period of the samples in the model solution was experimentally studied. It is established that with the increase of the water-cement ratio W/C from 0.5 to 0.7, the depth of carbonization and the layer thickness of corrosion products increase sharply. The flooding of the surface layers of the reinforcement and their strong embrittlement in the process of long-term operation of the reinforcement in the structure of reinforced concrete, which causes a decrease in crack resistance in general of reinforced concrete structures. The degradation of reinforcing steel during long-term operation in aggressive environments, which leads to premature corrosion damage to the reinforcement with subsequent destruction of the structure, was investigated experimentally with the involvement of high-precision metallographic equipment.</jats:p>"

The aviation industry plays a crucial role in the development of economy of the country and international economic relations, as it generates incomes, job places, and opportunities for growth. Every country has both primary and secondary airports, regional (secondary) airports are a vital part of the aviation infrastructure. They are engines of local development and allow accessibility to certain locations, in particular those that are remote or not well served by other forms of transportation. They are enablers of free movement of people, goods and services, as well as of social and territorial cohesion. Furthermore, regional airports stimulate incoming tourism and employment, as well as facilitate access to essential services. They can also help to reduce congestion at major hub airports. Unfortunately, in Ukraine secondary airports are not cultivated enough, thus the air transportation is the neck place in most cases, but this situation may be solved with renewal of secondary airports' work, the importance of which is described in this article.</jats:p>"

The Central Bank of Nigeria, Bank of Ghana and World Bank, World Development Indicator of 2018 furnished us with the data used for analysis. This study explored three different monetary policy transmission channels: interest rate, credit and asset pricing transmission channels and these variables were regressed on money supply in both countries using Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model estimation technique. The study also employed other diagnostic tests such as: Normality, Auto correlation test, Heteroskedasticity test and Breusch-Godfrey Serial Correlation LM test and they confirmed the validity and reliability of the model employed. The inferential results revealed that credit to private sector transmission channels in both Nigeria and Ghana had positive and significant impact on money supply but lending rate transmission paths in the two countries impacted insignificantly on money supply. This study concludes that monetary policy transmission channels in Nigeria were more robust in impacting on money supply than in Ghana. As such, the study recommends that monetary authorities of both countries need to formulate stringent monetary policies that will reduce the circulation of money outside the financial systems and there should be a synergy between monetary and fiscal policies in both economies so as to aid the instruments of macroeconomic policies achieve their objectives.</jats:p>"

The farmers are responsible for caring for the newborn items until they reach their ready-to-eat weight. The processors perform two roles, namely processing and screening. In the processing role, the processors process the grown items by a slaughtering and packaging process. Afterward, they inspected the processed items and categorized the items into good and poor quality. Finally, they shipped the end products to retailers. The retailers are responsible for selling good-quality items to the final consumers.  This research considers two kinds of poor quality. First is the poor quality of growing items in terms of mortality rate. The second is the poor quality of final products on the processor side. The processed items with poor quality are then sold to the secondary market at lower prices in one batch at the end of the period. This model also considers the incremental discounts offered by vendors to farmers and retailers to consumers for specific amounts of purchases. The model's objective function is to maximize the total supply chain profit, with the number of orders quantity, cycle time, and the number of batches delivery set as the decision variables. The sensitivity analysis results show that the most sensitive parameter in the model is the probability that the live items survive throughout the growth period.</jats:p>"

The author's approach to solving this issue is to determine the impact of individual macro- and microeconomic factors on them. The subject of the study is a set of criteria and environmental conditions, in which the food supply system for the population is formed and developed. The goal is to justify the dynamics of its main segments and identify the reasons that restrain their effective functioning. The following methods were applied in the work - general logical, comparison, synthesis, scientific approach. The results of the article are of a scientific and theoretical nature and can be taken as a basis for more in-depth research. The scientific contribution consists in the systematization of indicators affecting the sustainability of food supply chains aimed at maintaining healthy diets. The practical significance of the research lies in the use by government bodies of the proposed recommendations on modernization of the agro-industrial complex aimed to increase the sustainability of food supply. In the future, this direction can be considered as an opportunity to conduct empirical developments on the influence of the factors indicated in the article on the stability of provision of food products. Conclusions – food systems should be based on the principles of sufficient food availability, affordability of high-quality and safe products, and their consumption in accordance with physiological science-based norms.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current understanding of critical health infrastructure resilience is still dominated by a technical perspective. Reality however is different, as past events including the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed: emergency situations are only rarely exclusively technical in nature. Instead they are a product of prior circumstances, often linked to natural hazards, technical mishaps, and insufficient social and organizational preparedness structures. However, experiences and lessons learned from past events are still largely overlooked and have not sufficiently found their way into conceptual understandings of critical health infrastructure resilience. This paper addresses this gap by challenging the one-sided and technically oriented understanding of resilience in the context of critical health infrastructure. Based on a systematic literature review, it assesses real-world cases of water supply failures in healthcare facilities, a serious threat largely overlooked in research and policy. The results underscore the need for targeted organizational strategies to deal with cascading impacts. The overall findings show that addressing technical aspects alone is not sufficient to increase the overall resilience of healthcare facilities. Broadening the dominant resilience understanding is hence an important foundation for healthcare infrastructures to improve risk management and emergency preparedness strategies to increase their resilience towards future disruptions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable food supply has gained considerable consumer concern due to the high percentage of spoilage microorganisms. Food industries need to expand advanced technologies that can maintain the nutritive content of foods, enhance the bio-availability of bioactive compounds, provide environmental and economic sustainability, and fulfill consumers’ requirements of sensory characteristics. Heat treatment negatively affects food samples’ nutritional and sensory properties as bioactives are sensitive to high-temperature processing. The need arises for non-thermal processes to reduce food losses, and sustainable developments in preservation, nutritional security, and food safety are crucial parameters for the upcoming era. Non-thermal processes have been successfully approved because they increase food quality, reduce water utilization, decrease emissions, improve energy efficiency, assure clean labeling, and utilize by-products from waste food. These processes include pulsed electric field (PEF), sonication, high-pressure processing (HPP), cold plasma, and pulsed light. This review describes the use of HPP in various processes for sustainable food processing. The influence of this technique on microbial, physicochemical, and nutritional properties of foods for sustainable food supply is discussed. This approach also emphasizes the limitations of this emerging technique. HPP has been successfully analyzed to meet the global requirements. A limited global food source must have a balanced approach to the raw content, water, energy, and nutrient content. HPP showed positive results in reducing microbial spoilage and, at the same time, retains the nutritional value. HPP technology meets the essential requirements for sustainable and clean labeled food production. It requires limited resources to produce nutritionally suitable foods for consumers’ health.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the wake of the Crimean War, the upper military circles in Russia changed their thinking with regard to firearms. General Milyutin became Minister of War. It was the time when Alexander II reigned over Russia. In 1856, the calibre of Russian firearms was reduced to 6 inches, or 15.24 mm. The process of re-equipping the Russian army with M1856 rifles using expanding Minié bullets was launched. These rifles demonstrated that the percussion systems had reached the limit of their capacity for improvement. Nothing else could be improved in terms of their firing speed. Despite the resistance of the conservative military circles, Milyutin encouraged new inventions, and the 1860s became a period of experimentation with firearms. Some new cartridge systems were introduced. The high-quality M1856 percussion rifle was not destined to take part in war times, but the Russian army had been fully equipped with it for a short period of time. Almost all systems of the 1860s were based on this rifle. Over 10 systems of firearms with an internal needle fuse were proposed to the weapons commission. In 1866, the Englishman Karle proposed his own system with an internal needle fuse. Krnka, Berdan I, and Berdan II came next. After 1866, the Terry-Norman, Karle, and Krnka rifles entered the Russian army. These systems were developed on the basis of the 6-line M1856/58 rifle. The latter was converted into a rear-loading rifle. In 1869, the Krnka rifle was chosen as the main system, which became the main weapon of the Russian army in the following years. At the beginning of 1877, there were 613,297 Krnka rifles, 150,868 Karle rifles, 17,810 Berdan I and 325,254 Berdan II rifles in the Russian army.</jats:p>",

The investigated control algorithm is based on the combination of a nonlinear controller with approximating control (CAC), whose parameters are corrected using fuzzy logic. The algorithm for correcting the CAC parameters for transient and steady state modes is based on the application of two simple rulebases (RB) with three and five linguistic terms, respectively. As a result, the required speed in the transient mode and accuracy in the steady state mode are provided. It is proved that switching the RB according to the logic of the multi-mode system is less demanding on the number of rules, structure and setting parameters of the membership function than using the extended RB. The differences between the proposed ACS with different BP for the main operating modes of the system are shown. These include: improvement of quality indicators due to the implementation of different BP in different modes; more rigorous justification of the mechanism for ensuring insensitivity to the switching moments of BP when changing modes due to the CAC of the direct circuit of the ACS. Effective implementation of the stages of ACS modeling and fuzzy controller design is possible using the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox system of the Simulink MATLAB modeling environment.</jats:p>",

The primary objectives of this study are to examine the underlying dimensions of halal logistics practices, investigate the level of halal logistics practices, investigate the extent of stakeholders' influence on halal logistics practices, and explore the relationship of halal logistics practices towards supply chain performance. Based on the data collected through a questionnaires survey from 270 managers from halal-certified manufacturers, SPSS and SmartPLS were used to test the hypotheses. The findings of the study indicated that operational dimensions are the most practiced dimensions of halal logistics amongst firms. Meanwhile, competitors, government, NGOs, community media and society, and customers significantly influence the adoption of halal logistics practices. Importantly, halal logistics practices are positively related to supply chain performance. This study has extended the feasibility of stakeholder theory in the sense of halal logistics to the scope and comprehensiveness of stakeholders.

However, the development of new effective antianemic drugs is still relevant today. We have previously proposed a scheme for the prevention of iron deficiency anemia, based on intramuscular parallel administration of solutions of iron (IV) clatrochelate and cyanocobalaminе to pregnant sows 14 and 7 days before the expected farrowing. This scheme was effective in the absence of stillbirth and clinical signs of anemia in piglets. The aim of our next study was to investigate the content of iron in the milk of sows using iron (IV) clatrochelate during pregnancy. To achieve this goal, 2 groups of sows (hybrids of Landrace and Great White breeds) were formed during their pregnancy and kept with suckling piglets - control and experimental, 5 animals in each. Sows in the experimental group were injected twice (14 and 7 days before expected farrowing) with 10 ml of 10% iron (IV) clatrochelate solution and cyanocobalaminе solution (at the dose recommended by official instructions) twice during pregnancy. Sows of the control group were injected with isotonic sodium chloride solution in conventional doses. During the experiment, the sows of the experimental group during pregnancy (after drug administration) and during the feeding of piglets did not differ in behavior and general condition from the sows of the control group. The study of the dynamics of hemoglobin and morphological parameters of the blood of sows in the control and experimental groups did not reveal significant differences. The content of iron in colostrum / milk of sows of the experimental group during the first seven days after administration was significantly higher compared to the control: 1 day 1.5 times, 4 days 2.1 times and 7 days 2.8 times. Therefore, the proposed scheme for the prevention of iron deficiency anemia in piglets is highly efficientand based on the intake of iron with colostrum/milk of sows.\nKey words: anemia, injection, macrobicyclic complex, prophylaxis, pigs, cyanocobalaminе.</jats:p>",

In this regard, environmental quantification in monetary units can be an asset but, on this, not enough information exists about their application in supply chain. This work intends to develop a decision support tool for the design and planning of closed‐loop supply chains accounting for the monetization of environmental impacts, exploring the most used monetization methods. As main contributions, this paper supports the understanding of the methodological basis of the main monetization methods. This is then embedded into an optimization‐based decision supporting tool that defines the design and planning of supply chain allowing to conclude on the most appropriate methods to used when considering supply chain environmental performance. From the results is also demonstrated how the different monetization methods can influence the supply chain design and planning.

For this, the ThingSpeak platform of MathWorks is used. The results demonstrate that ground water after desalination has practically the same chemical parameter values as mineral water (Nestle) and ordinary home drinking water. It has also been confirmed that by adding a solar preheater, the process of evaporation of saline water has been accelerated, which permits improvement of the efficiency of the proposed prototype.</jats:p>",

This research investigated changing the cuvette pathlength (10-, 50-, and 100-mm) to improve the detection of cyanobacteria using UV-Vis spectrophotometry with subsequent application of derivative spectrophotometry and Savitzky-Golay (S-G) transformation. A non-toxigenic strain of blue-green cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa (CPCC 632), and a green algae strain for comparison, Chlorella vulgaris (CPCC 90), were studied in a wide range of concentrations (955,000 to 1855 cells/mL). In each concentration range, method detection limits were established with absorbance measurements and S-G first derivative of absorbance using 10-, 50-, and 100-mm cuvette pathlengths. Increasing the cuvette pathlength from 10 to 100 mm resulted in a 15-fold improvement in sensitivity with absorbance and a 13-fold improvement with S-G first derivative of absorbance for M. aeruginosa. Overall, adoption of 100 mm pathlength and application of S-G derivative spectra improved the method detection limit for M. aeruginosa from 337,398 to 4916 cells/mL, which is below the WHO guideline for low probability of adverse health effects (&amp;lt;20,000 cells/mL). Similarly, the detection limit for C. vulgaris was improved from 650,414 to 11,661 cells/mL. The results also showed that spectrophotometry could differentiate M. aeruginosa from C. vulgaris based on the variations in their pigment absorbance peaks.</jats:p>",

The research results show that the three parties can realize the balance and stability of interests (the water source area supplies good water, the project management department supplies sufficient water, users take water according to the supply), which means that the water market transactions are feasible. Meanwhile, it also gives clear restrictions on the water price of the three parties transaction: the project management department water price for purchase is less than on the premise of lower than + , the sale water price is not higher than .

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this work, floating photovoltaic systems were experimentally studied under Jordan’s weather conditions to determine their effects on energy output, water quality and supply. A limited number of studies have addressed the effect of floating photovoltaic systems on water quality and evaporation reduction especially in a semi-arid region like Jordan. Energy measurements were taken from August 2020 to January 2021 using an Arduino board with data logging sensors. Water quality parameters were tested for collected samples on a monthly basis from August 2020 to February 2021 using a spectrophotometer. Results revealed that the floating panel temperature was lower than the ground-mounted counterpart. An average increase of 1.68% in voltage and 4.40% in current were observed for the floating panel compared to the ground-mounted panel which translates to an average increase of 5.33% in power generation over the ground-mounted panel. Furthermore, efficiency and fill factor increased by 4.89% and 5.51%, respectively. Evaporation results showed that covering water bodies with panels can save a considerable amount of water. Over a period of 30 days, the 30% coverage pan saved 31.2% (36 mm) of water while the 50% coverage pan saved 54.5% (63 mm) of water in the same period compared to the uncovered pan. Moreover, this study involved examining the effect of shading caused by the floating structure on water quality. Results showed a reduction in pH, improvement in transparency, and an increase in total organic carbon indicating water quality enhancement and algal biomass reduction. However, due to the respiration of algae, the dissolved oxygen declined significantly, accompanied by the release of phosphate due to algae decomposition. Overall, findings of this research provided better understanding of floating photovoltaic systems and their applicability in Jordan to provide a safe and reliable supply of water and energy. Additionally, such systems can help to diversify the energy mix and help Jordan to alleviate some of the problems associated with limited energy and water resources.</jats:p>"

Penelitian ini bertujuan mengidentifikasi karakteristik industri dan merancang upaya perbaikan rantai pasok bahan baku keripik kentang industri rumah tangga di Jawa Barat. Penelitian dilaksanakan di Garut dan Pangalengan, Jawa Barat pada bulan Agustus 2016. Pengumpulan data dilakukan melalui metode survey dan focus group discussion (FGD). Survey dilaksanakan melalui wawancara 19 responden prosesor keripik kentang skala rumah tangga. Focus group discussion diarahkan untuk mengelaborasi kondisi aktual dan potensi perbaikan rantai pasok bahan baku keripik kentang. Alat analisis yang digunakan adalah statistika deskriptif, analisis strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT,) matriks strategic position and action evaluation matrix (SPACE), dan analisis quantitative strategis planning matrix (QSPM). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa rata-rata pasokan bahan baku per industri adalah 2,8 ton per bulan. Sistem pembelian bahan baku adalah spot market. Kapasitas produksi keripik kentang per bulan berkisar antara 15–540 kg (84,2%). Spesifikasi bahan baku masih belum terstandarisasi dan bersifat ekstrinsik kualitatif. Analisis SWOT dan pemetaan faktor-faktor eksternal-internal menunjukkan bahwa perbaikan rantai pasok dapat ditempuh dengan menggunakan strategi agresif. Penyusunan prioritas strategi melalui analisis QSPM menyarankan agar strategi promosi masif varietas alternatif kentang prosesing non-Atlantik (termasuk Median) dan kemudahan akses petani terhadap benihnya, serta strategi perbaikan sistem pembelian bahan baku dapat diimplementasikan secara simultan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keripik kentang; Industri rumah tangga; Rantai pasok bahan baku; Analisis kekuatan-kelemahan-peluang-ancaman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important factor that could maintain production sustainability of agro-processing industry is the availability of raw material. The study was aimed at examining potato chips household industry characteristics and designing strategies to improve the raw material supply chain in West Java. The study was conducted in Garut and Pangalengan in August 2016. Data collection was carried out through survey of 19 household industries. Meanwhile, FGD involving relevant participants was conducted to elaborate household industries’ existing conditions and potentials for improvements. The analytical tools used were descriptive statistics, analysis strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT),  strategic position and action evaluation (SPACE) matrix, and quantitative strategic planning matrix (QSPM) analysis. The results showed that the industry was characterized by average raw material demand of 2.8 tons/firm/month, spot market purchasing system, and production capacity of 15–540 kg/month. SWOT analysis and mapping in SPACE demonstrate that the improvement of raw material supply chain is best pursued by employing aggressive strategy.  Priority setting by QSPM suggests that the strategy of promoting massively non-Atlantic potato processing varieties (included Median) by also increasing farmers’ seed access, and improving potato chips raw material procurement systems should be implemented simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The goal of this research is to determine the value of the innovative value chain as well as the role of integrated supply chain technology in improving the efficiency of enterprises' supply chains. Standardized questionnaires were provided to local business owners in three major divisions of Sabah, namely Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, and Tawau in order to achieve this purpose. The survey got 125 usable replies from large, medium, and small enterprises that have been in existence for more than ten years. The main findings of three variables, namely idea generation, concept conversion, and diffusion of innovation, encouraged SCT adoption among Sabah's small businesses. The interaction effect revealed that Integrated SCT does, in fact, act as a mediating component in the financial performance relationship.

However, not everything is convenient per se. The subcontracting by large companies might provide some financial criticalities that need to be faced and properly managed by SMEs to exploit supply chain benefits without affecting financial stability and losing competitiveness. In this direction, the literature on supply chain finance has recently focused on financial issues related to working capital optimization in terms of accounts payable, receivable, and inventories.

Eighty heifer calves (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 20 calves per group) were assigned to four treatments based on their dam diet; basal diet (CON), a basal diet with lysine [RPL, 0.33% of dry matter (DM)], a basal diet with methionine (RPM, 0.16% DM), or with the combination (RPML). Calves were fed colostrum from their dams within 2 h of birth. Calves were then fed milk only (d 2–22), a combination of milk and milk replacer (d 23–25), and milk replacer (d 25–60). Starter feed was fed to the calves twice daily after liquid feeding. Calves blood samples were collected after calving on 0, 12, 24, and 48 h and 5 and 7 d after birth. Data were analyzed by SAS software v9.4. Providing ruminally-protected amino acids (RPAA) to transition cows improved colostrum quality compared to the CON (Brix;<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&amp;lt; 0.01). Serum total protein concentrations were higher in calves from supplemented cows than in calves from unsupplemented cows (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&amp;lt; 0.01). Calves born to dams in the RPM, RPL, and RPML groups had higher plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations 0, 12, 24, and 48 h and 7 d after birth than those born to dams in the CON group (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&amp;lt; 0.05). The percentage of calves with adequate passive immunity transfer was increased with RPM and RPL or the two in combination (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&amp;lt; 0.01). However, there was no difference in the percentage of calves with adequate passive immunity transfer between the RPM and RPL groups (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>= 0.21). Calves from cows that receive supplemental RPAA have a greater average daily gain (ADG) than those born to cows in the CON group (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&amp;lt; 0.01). These results indicate that maternal supplementation with RPM or RPL or the two in combination during the periparturient period could be an alternative strategy to improve the performance of calves, especially in accelerated growth programs in calves.</jats:p>"

To deal with the sustainability issues linked to their supply chains, we propose in this study a mathematical model to design a sustainable supply chain of highly perishable agricultural product (strawberry). The model is a multiperiod, multiproduct multiobjective MINLP mathematical program that takes into consideration economic, social and environmental objectives to cover all aspects of sustainability. In addition, a G/M/S/M queuing system is developed for the transportation of harvested products between facilities for the first time. Since real‐world problems related to industries such as food and agriculture are inherently uncertain, in this model, the important parameters of the problem are considered uncertain using fuzzy sets theory and a hybrid robust possibilistic programming model is developed. In addition, the Epsilon constraint approach converts the multiobjective mathematical model into a single‐objective one and the Lagrangian relaxation method is used to effectively solve the model on a large scale. A case study in Iran is provided to investigate the results and discuss the solutions. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the impacts of important parameters on the solution. According to the analysis, equipping greenhouses with drip irrigation system and using solar panels in greenhouses, respectively, have the greatest impact on improving all target functions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Recommendations for Resource Managers</jats:bold>\n<jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Multiobjective optimization shows trade‐offs among conflicting objective function and assists decision‐making to enhance sustainable agriculture industry.</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p><jats:p>\n<jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Focus on transportation system in fresh product will lead to less waste.</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p><jats:p>\n<jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>The use of solar panels and drip irrigation helps to minimize water and energy consumption and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission.</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p>",

A proposal of a computerized knowledge sharing framework for the SC will impact the SC’s performance and productivity. This paper aims to review and analyze the literature on knowledge sharing strategies and then suggest an automated knowledge sharing framework for the SC. First, to develop the proposed framework, we thoroughly reviewed the literature on SC knowledge sharing processes. This review helps us identify how organizations share and manage knowledge during the development process of their SCs. Then, we proposed a computerized knowledge sharing framework for the SC. Accordingly, we suggested that the proposed knowledge sharing framework is unique among the literature strategies, because it automates the knowledge sharing process in the SC, adds value to existing research, and could be adopted by SC decision-making as a knowledge framework to increase the efficiency of sharing, and managing knowledge in the SC phase.</jats:p>"

Through interviews with farmers, government officials, and NGO workers in 2020 and 2021, our research identifies three sets of experiences with distinct implications for agroecological transitions. First, some agroecological circuits could no longer function due to regulations on food circulation that favored the corporate food sector. Second, some circuits temporarily expanded to reach more urban middle‐class consumers, using online platforms and government infrastructures. Third, urban collectives and neighborhood organizations re‐appropriated urban spaces – from cultural centers to city streets – to facilitate the circulation of agroecological foods in low‐income sectors. We highlight the spatial and social ‘re‐localization’ practices of these urban groups that challenge the hegemony of conventional food circuits, as they drive agroecological food consumption beyond the middle‐class.</jats:p>",

The concept is based on the definition of risk as the probability of occurrence of events in a complex of hazards of different nature, manifestations of safety vulnerabilities, consequences of past negative phenomena and explains the danger of the threat due to determination \"maximum potential energy\". Its remaining part is subsequently converted into kinetic energy, which affects the safety management system of air transport and has a negative impact on the sustainable development of the national economy as a whole. At the same time, priority attention is paid to the list of hazards by the criterion of deviation from the point of sustainable development, the importance of the impact of threats on the coefficient of elasticity, which allows more adequate assessment of hazards and respond to them. The classification of the main risks in the functioning of Ukrainian air transport has been developed, which includes the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduction of export-import operations in the economic downturn, number of flights and air passenger traffic, low congestion of airports and air infrastructure. Risks are identified in the following areas of operation and development of air transport in Ukraine: export-import operations, aviation infrastructure, air cargo, airports, air navigation service providers and general aviation, which allows early detection of risks and response to them. The concept was implemented by the State Aviation Regulation Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the State Civil Aviation Agency of Azerbaijan, Almaty International Airport (Kazakhstan), Ukraine-Air Alliance, ICAO NAU Institute, Georgian Aviation Training Center (Georgia).</jats:p>"

The aim of the research is a comparative structural analysis of rice samples under conditions of soil and air drought and under normal flooding with water. The formation of quantitative traits in plants under normal watering conditions and with a moisture deficit occurred in different ways. Under drought conditions, compared with the norm, the yield decreased (67.9% of the norm), the number of plants to be harvested per 1 m2, the mass of the panicle, the mass of 1000 grains; increased bushiness, the number of spikelets on the panicle and its density, the growing season “flooding with water – flowering”. The number of empty spikelets on a panicle and the percentage of empty grain increased especially strongly. The values of the remaining studied characteristics were at the same level in both variants of the experiment. The maximum yield in dry conditions was formed by the varieties Boyarin (4.43 t/ha), Contact (4.53 t/ha), Zolotye vshody (4.60 t/ha) and Sukhodol (4.60 t/ha). Drought-resistant forms that can be used to create dry-land rice varieties have been identified.</jats:p>",

In recent years, the problem of groundwater over-exploitation has become increasingly prominent in the Basin due to the expansion of agriculture. This paper developed adaptive management initiatives of the local groundwater resources using Tongliao, located in the east part of the WLR Basin, as a case study. Groundwater management zones were divided based on hydrogeology, precipitation, land use, the groundwater over-exploitation areas, groundwater depth, and the administrative units (Banners/Counties/Districts). The Tongliao Basin was divided into 21 management zones. Subsequently, assessment rules for determining groundwater level thresholds in each groundwater management zone were developed based on groundwater observation conditions and the current groundwater depth. Based on the assessment rules, in 2020 the management threshold of groundwater level for each zone were determined. The results provided a scientific basis for the ‘Water Availability Based Local Development Initiative’ in the Tongliao Plain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The manufacturing sector occupies a critical position in the South African economy. However, in recent decades, this sector has experienced significant changes due to the country’s economic fluctuations. The sector’s challenges include electricity distribution, growing inflation rate and commodities price instability. This study assessed the effects of electricity supply, inflation and fuel prices on food and beverage production and sales in the manufacturing sector. To this end, it applied different econometric approaches — the Johansen test for cointegration, vector error correction model (VECM) and Granger causality test — on monthly time series data ranging from January 2002 to December 2019. The study’s findings suggest the existence of a joint long-run relationship between electricity distribution, inflation rate, fuel price, production and sales of both food and beverages within the manufacturing sector. The result also indicated that both electricity supply and inflation highly impact food and beverage sales production compared to the effect of petrol price. Furthermore, Granger causality results have shown that inflation rate can predict short-term production and sales of food and beverages in the manufacturing sector. Given the aforementioned findings, the study suggested a reduction in petrol prices and the introduction of new policies to control the inflation rate. Additionally, besides the government support for electricity production in Eskom, more effort and resources (financial) should be allocated to generate and improve other sources of energy such as solar, wind, gas and biogas.</jats:p>",

The Russian government faced the need to supply not only the army, but also the provinces with consuming bread, and the civilians were hostages of the transport crisis. The fixed prices for bread introduced in September 1916 led to the restriction of market trade. An important step in the state regulation of the bread market was the unfolding of bread. The article provides an analysis of food policy before the introduction of the unfolding. The food distribution of the tsarist government was an attempt to mobilise grain resources for the needs of the army and the civilians. The peculiarity of the reform was the combination of the principle of duty and payment of the product at a fixed price. The expansion is considered both from the all-Russia positions, taking into account the experience of grain-producing provinces, and in terms of Kostroma Province, which had lack of developed agriculture. The article pays special attention to the measures of local authorities. The governor, the zemstvo, the volost peasant gatherings were not ready to complete the tasks in full. The article concludes that the food distribution in the bread-consuming province, experiencing a crisis of planned supply, could not end successfully.</jats:p>",

The latter has environmental impacts caused mainly by the expansion of urban areas and inadequate practice of land use, occupation, and management, which affects the population’s supply, particularly on days with high levels of rainfall. The study area involved the creation of two municipal EPAs in the hydrographic basin of the Ligeiro River, located in the municipalities of Araruna and Cianorte, with areas of 209.76 km² and 219.82 km², respectively. It is believed that the creation of Environmental Protection Areas in the Ligeiro River hydrographic basin will also present challenges, but it will enable the conservation of natural resources and, especially, of water resources, given the quality of the water. It is expected that these actions will help to minimize or even prevent, in the future, the Ligeiro river hydrographic basin from being as or more impacted as the Bolivar stream basin.</jats:p>"

The giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii is gradually becoming an aquaculture species of great commercial value, since it is the largest representative of its genus. In experiment for the prawn containing 3 tanks of the same size were used. The shrimps in the first tank were fed mainly plant food, but with a small proportion of animal food. In the second tank, animal feed was used. In the third tank, the shrimp diet consisted of 80% balanced artificial feed. The percentage of losses was 30, 20 and 7%, respectively. From the experiment, it became clear that main problems characteristic of all decapods, including the giant freshwater prawn, are the lack of high-quality and balanced artificial feeds, as well as problems associated with a decrease in the genetic diversity of artificial populations, which makes it more difficult and expensive to obtain seeding material. Cultivation of giant freshwater prawn in Russia can be quite cost-effective when using closed water supply installations, however, in order to achieve maximum benefits, it is necessary to develop artificial, optimized feeds designed specifically for crustaceans.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ukraine remains a country dependent on nuclear energy for both heat supply and satellite supply. In cities close to nuclear power plants, electric heating from the electricity they produce is appropriate. On the other hand, Ukraine is the only country in the world where the worst accident at a nuclear power plant occurred at the Chernobyl NPP Unit 4 on the night of April 26, 1986. Another characteristic feature of Ukraine's nuclear energy is the significant number of power units with exhausted project resources - the so-called \"old\" power units. Their wear is associated with the influence of heat and mass transfer processes, which lead to periodic thermal deformation of the elements, which causes cyclic damage. An example of expert rapid assessment of the residual life of a specific reactor vessel WWER-1000 is given taking into account the combined action of non-stationary heat and mass transfer and mechanical processes. A detailed express calculation of cyclic (tired) damage to the metal of the WWER-1000 reactor vessel due to the dangerous emergency mode has been performed. The WWER-1000 reactor is the last most widespread and most powerful water-water nuclear reactor of the former USSR, operated on 13 of the 15 operating power units of Ukrainian nuclear power plants (NPPs) - Zaporizhia, Rivne, Khmelnytsky and South Ukraine (SUNPP). The reactor is the most important indispensable element of a nuclear power plant, which determines its safety and resource. Given the design resource and the dates of commissioning of Ukrainian NPP units, the issue of rapid expert assessment of the technical condition of WWER-1000 hulls is quite relevant. Of course, modern engineering has the full range of tools needed to perform such estimates, from powerful computers to advanced computing software. But the known and inevitable costs of modern engineering - complex and time-consuming modeling and calculations. Experience has shown that a certain \"reasonable\" combination of the use of relatively simplified \"light\" calculation methods allows us to assess the safety, strength and service life of WWER-1000 reactors very quickly and with the necessary accuracy acceptable for expert opinion. The publication considers as an example the real emergency situation of October 22, 1985 and the WWER-1000 reactor of SUNPP Unit 1. Since this emergency situation led to rapid cooling of this reactor, the calculation of the effect of cyclic damage of reactor steel on the strength and reliability of the reactor vessel is shown. This example and the consideration of the real emergency situation demonstrates the effectiveness and acceptability of the use of estimated expert rapid assessments to accurately determine the reliability and safety of such critical elements of nuclear power plants as nuclear reactor buildings. </jats:p>"

The research focuses on the publishing sector and, mainly, on one of the largest publishing groups in Portugal and focuses on the strategic decision, due to the covid-19 pandemic situation, to adopt a Warehouse Management System to increase productivity, competitiveness, and sustainability of the company under study. Due to the need for confinement, publishers saw their sales drop drastically and the option of e-commerce implied the need for adjustments in the organizational dynamics associated with the distribution of products. The research/paper goal is to show the viability of investments in the digital transformation of companies in order to enlarge their efficiency and effectiveness.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Design / Methodology / Approach.</jats:bold> As a methodology adopted in the first phase, the authors developed a framework of current challenges through the focus group technique. In the second phase, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with the different managers of the group’s various companies and their departments. These methodological options aim to obtain more specific information on facts, the degree of relevance, validity, and reliability that is analyzed from the perspective of collecting information. Both methods provide elasticity in the approach and depth of the intended analysis, favoring spontaneous responses and the creation of openness to the approach of more complex and delicate topics.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Findings.</jats:bold> Information technology investments do not automatically bring competitive advantages. It is essential to carry out careful management of the project and carefully analyze the economic and financial viability of the investment. The disruptive changes do not allow errors in investment.

Quantifying China’s coal supply sustainability is essential to track China’s efforts towards sustainable development and achieve carbon neutrality goals. In this research, in addition to availability, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability and technological sustainability, we specially considered health and security, and transport sustainability of China’s coal supply. We select 19 indicators from the above six dimensions to build a coal supply sustainability index and construct a novel optimized comprehensive evaluation model with level difference maximization to evaluate China’s coal supply sustainability. The results showed that the policies issued by the Chinese government have effectively improved coal supply sustainability. China’s coal supply sustainability level has improved significantly, with the figure nearly doubling from 0.338 in 2000 to 0.7004 in 2019. To improve the sustainability of China’s coal supply further fundamentally, it is still necessary to improve energy diversification. Since phasing out China’s coal reliance requires considerable time, the Chinese government needs to introduce more positive and effective policies to such as increase the research and development support for carbon capture, utilization and storage technology, etc. to improve the sustainability of coal supply. The results of this research presented in this paper will have reference value for both promoting the sustainable development of China and other coal-consuming countries in the world.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The necessity for food traceability has been increased over the years with the expansion of food supply chains globally over these years due to stringent of food safety regulations. Enhancing the access to quality food safely is one of the essential requirements of food supply chain traceability. Conversely, significant percentages of postharvest losses available especially in developing countries due to poor supply chain and logistics practices thereby threatening food security. Unless there is a possibility to trace the Supply chain, it is difficult to take remedial actions. When it comes to Sri Lanka, currently it is harder to have the traceability in most of the foods supply chains commonly on most of the elementary supply chains such as fruits and vegetables. This has led to postharvest losses since it is harder to identify when and where damages occur, who are accountable, harvested and transient times, supply demand mismatch too. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the feasibility of tracing of fruit and vegetable supply chain in Sri Lanka and contribute theoretically to facilitate authorities and decision makers for future traceability improvement. Availability of secondary information on fruits and vegetables traceability was examined referring to government agencies. Basic structure of supply chain was identified based on secondary data and a case study was conducted based on supply chains linked to Thambuththegama and Keppetipola Dedicated Economic Centers to gather primary data. To quantify the feasibility of tracing, a feasibility index was developed. Developed index was used to assess the feasibility towards improved traceability of selected chains where it can be applied for other food and non-food supply chains as well. The feasibility index can be used for other fruits and vegetables supply chains too to assess the feasibility prior to implementation of a traceability system. Furthermore, it can be used for non-food supply chains with some modifications. Analysis revealed that poor feasibility of wholesalers compared to farmers and retailers. Product identification technologies, awareness and willingness for traceability improvement were ranged low to fair for all the entity categories. Hence, enhancement of record-keeping and information sharing, adopting product identification and quality measurement technologies, and strengthening of legislation were identified as key improvements for enhanced fruits and vegetable traceability and efficient postharvest management of studied supply chains</jats:p>",

CST can be an alternative to the conventional interorganizational information technology (IOIT) that relies on collaboration between supply chain firms. This paper develops a theoretical model to examine the value of CST to learn supply chain (demand) information and the impact of CST on IOIT. Using an extensive simulation analysis based on real-world data from a manufacturer that has implemented a CST program, we show that the value of CST to a manufacturer can be substantial and provide insights into how market conditions affect the value. </jats:p>",

Given the constant growth in the volume of construction space, the length will constantly increase. Consequently, there is a request to increase the level of reliability of heat supply networks. It is possible to satisfy the request only by increasing the volume and quality of comprehensive diagnostics of heat supply networks with simultaneous reduction of time costs. This is possible only if a new generation of measurement and computing complex (MCC) is developed for the diagnosis of heat supply networks. The team of authors examines the features of the information environment in heat supply networks, separately noting the possibility of switching the flow from single-phase to multi-phase and back. The paper proposes to consider a solution to a problem that arises when trying to visualize physical and mathematical models of thermodynamic processes of single-phase flows using MATLAB. It consists in the fact that the desired physical and mathematical model should describe the thermodynamic processes of a single-phase flow, but taking into account that this flow moves in the external heat supply network. The possibility of using the MATLAB functional environment for developing a model based on visually oriented programming is considered in detail, which allows us to lay the foundations for further forecasting the development of the heat supply system.</jats:p>",

It is shown that each of supplementary components of the total loss power is proportional to the minimum possible loss power and to the square of the RMS value of the power, which is caused by its occurrence in three-phase four-wire power supply system, and it is inversely proportional to the mean square of the net power loss. The synthesized Matlab-model for verification of the four-component structure of power losses showed a high degree of its adequacy. The proposed model allows us to rethink the description of power losses in three-phase AC circuits and can be used in specialized measuring instruments for electrical networks monitoring.

According to the hydrograph boundary layer (HBL) concept, upstream riverbed changes caused by the imbalance between sediment supply and the capacity can propagate only a limited length and have a negligible effect on the riverbed beyond such a short length. We performed a two-dimensional morphodynamic calculation to test the concept of HBL, which was proposed under a one-dimensional simulation, meaning that the concept of HBL is still valid for plane changes in river morphology. We employed an unsteady flow with equilibrium or constant sediment supply in a straight, modeled gravel-bedded channel with an unerodible bank to simulate alternate bar morphodynamics. The results show that regardless of the sediment supply condition, the alternate bar features formed downstream of the HBL are considerably similar. This suggests that sediment disturbance at the upstream end has a negligible effect on the mobile-bed dynamic processes, including alternate bar formation and development downstream of the HBL.</jats:p>"

Various types of models are considered (in tabular form, in the form of an electrical replacement circuit or in the form of a finite-state machine), as well as a logical-probabilistic approach to the representation of the power supply system. The use of automation systems in power supply systems of industrial enterprises can reduce the total number of accidents, prevent their development, reduce the time of disconnections of electrical installations and downtime of mechanisms, and also allows to transfer to work without constant maintenance a significant number of electrical installations of substations, which, in turn, leads to a reduction in the number of service personnel, increase labor productivity and reduce maintenance costs. One of the main tasks on the way to automating the power supply system of enterprises is to present it in the form of a model. The list of replacement models and schemes that can be used to represent the power supply system of enterprises is quite large, and choosing the appropriate model, for that best meets the requirements of the final goal is quite a complex scientific task. The purpose of this article is to analyze the most common and promising models and schemes for replacing the power supply system and provide recommendations on their application in practice for power supply to sewage treatment plants of a chemical enterprise. Presenting the power supply system in the form of a table allows you to simplify and visually perform certification of electrical equipment, identify problem and weak points in the power supply system of industrial enterprises. Such a table proves that a large amount of electrical equipment at lower levels depends on a single electrical device at higher levels. The representation of the power supply system in the form of a three-phase symmetric replacement circuit can be used to calculate short-circuit currents in symmetric and unbalanced modes in the MatLab program and similar. Using the model of the power supply system in the form of a finite-state machine allows you to visually check the reliability of power supply to consumers, simplify the design of the power supply system of an industrial enterprise, select the state of switching devices in the power supply system and take into account the advantages and disadvantages of each state. It is advisable to use the methods discussed in this article to represent the power supply system (in tabular form, in the form of a finite-state machine or a three-phase symmetric replacement scheme) and their further application and use in automated power supply systems of industrial enterprises. The logical-probabilistic method allows us to consider the issue of power supply reliability based on the theory of logical algebra.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Switched-mode power supply (SMPS) has been of vital importance majorly in power management of industrial equipment with much-improved efficiency and reliability. Given the diverse range on loading and operating conditions of SMPS, several anomalies can occur in the device resulting to over-voltage, overloading, erratic atmospheric conditions, etc. Electrical over-stress (EOS) is one of the commonly used causes of failure among power electronic devices. Since there is a limitation for the SMPS in terms of input voltage and current (two methods of controlling an SMPS), the device has been subjected to an accelerated aging test using EOS. This study presents a two-fold approach to evaluate the overall state of health of SMPS using an integration of extended Kalman filter (EKF) and deep neural network. Firstly, the EKF algorithm would assist in fusing fault features to acquire an comprehensive degradation trend. Secondly, the degradation pattern of the SMPS has been monitored for four different electrical loadings, and a bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) deep neural network is trained for future predictions. The proposed model provides a unique approach and accuracy in SMPS fault indication with the aid of electrical parameters.</jats:p>"

The polluted river water sample was collected from Kalyani river, Uttarakhand, India and characterized by high concentration of COD (1010 mg/l), BOD (230 mg/l), NO3−-N (30 mg/l), PO43−-P (48.9 mg/l), and Pb (1.028 mg/l). This water sample was treated on a lab scale with immobilized bacterial cells and Epipremnum aureum in various treatment setups. The treatment system 3 using a combination of immobilized bacterial cells and Epipremnum aureum had the highest pollutant removal efficiency of all the treatment setups tested. At 96 hours, the total COD, BOD, NO3−-N, PO43−-P and Pb contents of polluted river water sample were reduced to 60 mg/l, 20 mg/l, 2.4 mg/l, 11.7 mg/l, and 0.065 mg/l, respectively. Based on the findings, it is possible to conclude that utilizing plant-immobilized bacterial cell synergism is an environmentally friendly and cost-effective approach for enhanced remediation and rejuvenation of polluted river water. Furthermore, a field-scale application of plant-immobilized bacterial cell synergism via floating wetland construction for on-site treatment of contaminated water on the Kalyani river is recommended.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last years, distributed consensus tracking control has received a lot of attention due to its benefits, such as low operational costs, high resilience, flexible scalability, and so on. However, control methods that do not consider faults in actuators and control agents are impractical in most systems. There is no research in the literature investigating the consensus tracking of supply chain networks subject to disturbances and faults in control input. Motivated by this, the current research studies the fault-tolerant, finite-time, and smooth consensus tracking problems for chaotic multi-agent supply chain networks subject to disturbances, uncertainties, and faults in actuators. The chaotic attractors of a supply chain network are shown, and its corresponding multi-agent system is presented. A new control technique is then proposed, which is suitable for distributed consensus tracking of nonlinear uncertain systems. In the proposed scheme, the effects of faults in control actuators and robustness against unknown time-varying disturbances are taken into account. The proposed technique also uses a finite-time super-twisting algorithm that avoids chattering in the system’s response and control input. Lastly, the multi-agent system is considered in the presence of disturbances and actuator faults, and the proposed scheme’s excellent performance is displayed through numerical simulations.</jats:p>"

Design for durability (DfD) simultaneously expands the retailer's sales and stimulates offline collecting via buyback price reimbursement. DfD outperforms DfM in achieving more profitable win‐win encroachments.</jats:p>",

An experiment was conducted by implementing surface laser cleaning of the butt and fillet weldment specimens according to process parameters. Conditions of process parameters were identified for facilitating laser cleaning and used in prototype production. The prototypes were processed through laser and chemical cleaning, and the quality of the end products was compared. The results indicated that the proposed method satisfactorily cleans the prototype surface without generating a toxic work environment and environmental pollution problems. Moreover, the roughness of approximately 5 μm was achieved on the laser cleaned surface. This is considered to be able to increase the adhesion of the paint compared to the smooth chemical cleaned surface during the painting for anticorrosion of the product.</jats:p>"

Recent studies conclude that this kind of analysis makes it possible to optimally design the sizes of the elements of the generation system. However, in isolated communities or rural areas, it is common to find groups of dwellings in which micro-renewable sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, can be installed. In this situation, the generation and storage of several houses can be considered as an interconnected system forming a cooperative microgrid (CoMG). This work analyses the benefits that sharing two autonomous installations can bring to each one, from the point of view of reliability. The method consists of the application of a random sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) simulation to the CoMG to evaluate the impact of a simple cooperative strategy on the reliability of the set. The study considers random failures in the generation systems. The results show that the reliability of the system increases when cooperation is allowed. Additionally, at the design stage, this allows more cost-effective solutions than single sizing with a similar level of reliability.</jats:p>"

While research clearly illustrates the importance of dietary transitions, impacts of potential supply-side measures are not well understood in relation to competitiveness concerns and leakage effects. This study assesses trade and GHG emission impacts of two supply-side mitigation strategies (intensification vs. extensification) in the EU, UK and Switzerland (EU + 2), against a 2050 baseline featuring healthy/sustainable diets adopted by European consumers. To capture potential leakage effects arising from changing external trade flows, the two supply-side strategies are assessed against three trade policy regimes (i.e. status quo, regional trade liberalization with <jats:italic>and</jats:italic> without border carbon adjustment), resulting in six scenarios formulated with detailed inputs from the EUCalc model and other literature and simulated with a purported-designed CGE model. Results show that intensification, while improving the EU + 2’s external trade balance, does not reduce emissions in the EU + 2, compared to the baseline. In contrast, extensification leads to a substantial emission abatement that augments reductions from the assumed dietary transition in the baseline, resulting in a combined 31% agricultural emission reduction in EU + 2 during 2014–2050. However, this is at the expense of reduced net agrifood exports by US$25 billion compared to the baseline and significant carbon leakage at a rate of 48% (i.e. nearly half of agricultural emission reduction in the EU + 2 ‘leaked’ to elsewhere). Furthermore, implementing the EU + 2’s prospective regional trade agreements results in increased territorial emissions. Although a border carbon adjustment by the EU + 2 can improve its trade balance and partially shift mitigation burdens to other countries, the associated reductions in global emissions (and carbon leakage) would be marginal. Finally, different trade and emission effects are identified between the crop and livestock sectors, pointing to the desirability of a mixed agriculture system with intensified livestock sector and extensified crop agriculture in the EU + 2 that balances emission reduction goals and competitiveness concerns.</jats:p>",

Based on 2008–2017 panel data on 289 cities in China, this paper analyzes the impact of environmental regulation on the supply efficiency of environmental public services and explores whether environmental decentralization changes the effect of environmental regulation. The results show that environmental regulation can significantly improve the supply efficiency of environmental public services, and this finding still holds after a series of robustness tests. The main reason is the improvement in green technology innovation capabilities caused by environmental regulation. Environmental regulation has a more significant positive effect on the supply efficiency of environmental public services in regions with a higher local government governance capacity, lower levels of fiscal decentralization, and a higher pollutant emission intensity. A moderate level of environmental decentralization helps to better promote the supply efficiency of environmental public services through environmental regulation. When the level of environmental decentralization lies between 0.362 and 1.353, environmental regulation effectively improves the supply efficiency of environmental public services.</jats:p>",

To make a proper evaluation of the ecological status of watercourses, it is necessary to harmonize class boundaries for chemical and biological quality elements (BQEs). This paper aims to explore the linkages between physicochemical parameters and BQEs and set river nutrient threshold concentrations that support good ecological status. Regression and mismatch methods were applied to find the relationship between phytoplankton (PP) and phytobenthos (PB) ecological quality ratio and mean total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations. Nutrient thresholds have been suggested for several water types, which are varied in the case of highland rivers 1.8–6.2 mg TN/l, 180–400 μg TP/l; in the case of lowland rivers 1.4–5.0 mg TN/l, and 100–350 μg TP/l. These values are similar to what other studies found, but the relationship between biology and nutrients was weaker. Besides nutrients, additional data of measured dissolved organic carbon, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand with potassium permanganate method, and information about hydromorphological features were involved in the analysis. The research demonstrates that random forest can be used as a nonlinear, multiparametric model for predicting biological class from five variables with 35–81% error for PP and with 18–47% error for PB.</jats:p>",

With supply chains broken, the only opportunity for hospitals was to turn to unconventional solutions to overcome medical equipment shortages in the shortest possible time. This paper describes the methodology that allows the preparation of medical equipment to be additionally manufactured in keeping with medical requirements. The proposed method focuses on cytotoxicity tests against HaCaT, L929, A549 cell lines, and the assessment of potential antimicrobial properties of materials. The application of the proposed method is shown by the example of an adapter that connects a full mask with widely available DAR filters. The prototyping and fabrication of adapters were conducted with the fused deposition modelling (FDM) and selective laser sintering (SLS) technologies. The adapters increased the number of masks available to medical personnel, and by the same token, ensured the continuity of their work.</jats:p>"

In this study, a convenient method for treating the friction term is proposed based on the Moody diagram. The attenuation process of water hammer pressure can be accurately reflected by reading the relationship curve between Reynolds number and the Darcy friction factor in the pipeline transient process. Combined with the classical water hammer experiment and the long pipe valve closing experiment in our laboratory, the accuracy of this model is verified, and the influence of absolute roughness (e) and Reynolds number (Re) on the model was analyzed as well. The results show that the pressure attenuation using the Method of Characteristics (MOC) and the proposed friction model has a good agreement with the experimental data. The absolute roughness has little influence on the results in hydraulically smooth pipe, while the minimum Reynolds number has a significant influence. When selecting the minimum Reynolds number, 2% ∼ 5% of the initial flow rate is recommended for calculation.</jats:p>",

However, rice farmers and supply chain actors in rice agribusiness have experienced high challenges, such as production, transportation, price, product quality, and the environment. This research aimed to understand actors involved in the supply chain, their perception of occurring risks, and evaluation and risk mitigation in the supply chain. This was a quantitative descriptive study done purposively in Watugede Village, Singosari Sub-District, Malang Regency. Non-probability sampling was taken to gather primary data. The respondent of this research was 16 involved actors, from on-farm actors to consumers. The data were analyzed using the Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to provide descriptive risk mitigation strategies. The results show that six involved actors are suppliers, farmers, grinders, traders, and buyers. Each actor faces different risks, and thus, the recommended mitigation strategies are adjusted to their risks. Sharing information, optimizing the level of supply availability, measuring supply chain performance, and building more coordination with the government are the best strategies to mitigate risks.</jats:p>"

Based on the analysis of the regional conditions of the Odessa water area of the Black Sea, the initial parameters have been substantiated and rational modes of operation of an improved HPHS with central, decentralized or local heating of the subscriber energy carrier have been determined. As indicators for evaluating the efficiency of the HPHS operation, the conversion factor of energy flows and the specific consumption of external energy for the drive of the compressor and the circulating pump of cooled water in the operation of heat pump units were considered. For seawater in the Odessa water area of the Black Sea during the entire heating period, the following temperatures were considered as initial data for analysis: water at the inlet to the evaporator (5–10) ° C, at the outlet (1 °C); calculated temperature difference of the coolant in the heating system (50–40) °C, indoor air (20 °C); estimated outdoor temperature (–18 °C). The characteristic correspondence between the flow rates of the cooled sea water and the heated energy carrier of the heat supply system was taken into account. The prerequisites of high efficiency of the heat pump heat supply system in which the actual conversion coefficient exceeds the seasonal normalized calculated and minimum value at an outdoor temperature of (–10) °C under the limiting conditions of the monoenergy regime for both new and reconstructed buildings were substantiated.

However, only limited information and no systematic administrative reporting of the extent are available for Germany yet. Therefore, a systematic analysis of newspaper articles as a promising source of information was conducted for the extraordinarily hot summers of 2018, 2019 and 2020. The results of the database searches were analysed with respect to frequency and local and regional hotspots, relations to climatic data, extent of the reported dry-fallings and emergency water supply. The analysis indicates hotspots particularly for the federal states of Saxony, where a subsidy programme for connecting to the public water supply was reissued in 2019, for Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia. Emergency supply was realised through various approaches. It was partly required until the winter months and did not always have drinking-water quality. As private wells are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, their operators should be involved as a stakeholder group in future discussions about allocating water resources to increasingly competing uses in periods of scarcity.</jats:p>",

This study explored how water footprint of tourism influenced water resources based on inbound tourists to China from 2001 to 2018. The total water footprint of inbound tourists (ITWF) was 7273.15*106 m3, and showed an upward trend. The spatial pattern was agglomerated, being mainly concentrated in North China, East China, and South China. The standard deviation ellipse showed that the horizontal axis was first east, and then west. According to the background water footprint, the ‘contribution’ of ITWF to the background water surplus differed in each province. According to the background water stress, the impact roughly separated into large, medium, and small using overlay analysis. Based on ITWF and water stress levels, the 31 administrative regions of mainland China were separated into four types and put forward suggestions: double-high pressure type, cautious development type, double-low potential type and optimised development type. This study provided a theoretical reference for governments, and is conducive to promoting the coordinated and sustainable development of tourism and water resources.</jats:p>",

So it is necessary to evaluate and develop plans for the existing clean water supply system to increase service coverage. The evaluation of the water supply system includes an analysis of the availability and demand of clean water based on the population, with a projection for the next 25 years. Analysis of the clean water supply system development plan considers the availability of water resources potential. The evaluation results show that the existing system has not met the water demands in the service area. The development plan carried out to fulfill the demand for clean water is by optimizing the discharge of the Sanih Fountain by 125 liters/second and the construction of the Bungkulan 2 well.</jats:p>",

The article is based on the principles of historicism, integrity, objectivity, and comprehensiveness; general scientific and traditional methods, such as systemic, historical-comparative, problem-historical. The scientific novelty lies in introduction of the new unpublished archival documents reflecting the role of merchantry in supplying bread to the region during bad crops. The source base is comprised of archival documents of the State Budget Archive of the Tyumen Region in Tobolsk. The statistical and clerical sources, as well as periodicals are also used in the article. The author is first to thoroughly examine the role of the merchant V. D. Zharnikov, who offered the provincial authorities to sell bread to the population at a lower price. Namely his initiative allowed the poor population to purchase bread at affordable prices during the period of bad crops, which mostly affected the residents of northern Tobolsk Governorate. Timely delivery of flour by inland transport to the north of the region has played a significant role. This prevented the rise in bread prices and its shortage. The initiative Vasily Dmitrievich Zharnikov to purchase, deliver and sell bread to northern Tobolsk Governorate at affordable made a crucial difference for the region.\n\t</jats:p>"

The research aims to assess the availability of organic food in the local food supply chain. The research found that the production of organic food is driven by the growing consumer interest in healthy and high-quality food. Consumers prefer short food supply chains to buy organic food from local producers. The range of available organic foods is affected by various micro and macro environmental factors every year. An analysis of organic foods by degree of processing revealed that there were available mostly unprocessed foods (fresh fruit and vegetables) or minimally/basically processed foods (milk, dairy products, pastries); therefore, the products have low levels of saturated sugars, salt and trans fats.</jats:p>",

Here, we utilize retrosynthetic software to arrive at alternate chemical supply chains for the antiviral drug umifenovir, as well as eleven other antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs. We have experimentally validated four routes to umifenovir and one route to bromhexine. In one route to umifenovir the software invokes conversion of six C–H bonds into C–C bonds or functional groups. The strategy we apply of excluding known starting materials from search results can be used to identify distinct starting materials, for instance to relieve stress on existing supply chains.</jats:p>"

The main purpose of using automated systems of commercial and technical electricity metering is to reduce power consumption. But it is noted that the efficiency of using data of the automated commercial electricity metering system, efficiency and proper management of energy consumption depends on the operators of automated workstations. Considering the rapid improvement of both technical means and mathematical methods that can be applied to address energy efficiency issues, there is a need to transform remote data collection systems from electricity meters, taking into account quality, into a measuring and information structure capable of not only collecting data from meters, electrical energy, but also analyse them. The main method for detecting undercounts is given - the balance method. On the basis of the balance method, it is proposed to automatically calculate the unbalance for each section of the 6, 10 or 110 kV line of the main step-down substations and distribution points, taking into account the number and accuracy classes of commercial metering and technical metering devices. It is proposed to balance the load on the results of calculations performed by automated commercial electricity metering system in order to reduce energy losses and reduce payment for electricity. It is proposed in the work that the automated commercial electricity metering system should calculate the coefficients of form, maximum, load, as well as other morphometric characteristics of the graphs of electrical loads. The work drew attention to a number of problems arising in the calculation of these parameters: electronic meters measure the data necessary for calculations but not with the specified discreteness and, most importantly, their measurement of these parameters of the quality of electrical energy is not metrologically certified, therefore, such data can only be relied on as background information.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of food supply in garbage dumps on the reproductive fitness of Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis and offspring losses. A total of 236 nests were monitored during two distinct periods of 2 years for each: 146 nests during a period without food supply in dumps (1998–1999) and 90 with food supply in dumps (2007–2008). The study was carried out in the colony of El-Kseur in the Lower Soummam Valley (northeast Algeria). For the entire study period, the mean of clutch size, average number of hatched chicks, productivity, and breeding success varied significantly between years (Kruskal–Wallis test: p &lt; .05). Also, the average calculated losses for eggs, chicks, and total offspring vary significantly (Chi2 test: p &gt; .0001). The clutch size and the number of hatched chicks per nest were highest during the period with food supply in garbage dump (respectively: 3.46 ± 0.86; 2.85 ± 1.11), compared to the period when cattle egrets feed in natural or agricultural habitats (3.04 ± 0.87; 2.54 ± 1.03). However, productivity and breeding success were highest during the period without food supply (respectively: 2.11 ± 1.16 fledging’s/nest; 0.70 ± 0.35) than in the period with food supply (1.14 ± 0.91; 0.35 ± 0.30). While egg losses were substantially similar between the two study periods, chick’s mortality (59.9%) and total offspring losses (36.7%) were higher during the period with food supply. The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) analysis indicated a large negative effect of food supply in dumps on the productivity, on the chick’s losses; and a positive effect on the total offspring losses ( p &lt; .001). Also, feed in dump garbage revealed a significant negative effect on the breeding success linear mixed model (LMM, p = .01). However, no significant effects (GLMM, p &gt; .05) of food supply in dumps were noted on average clutch size, the mean number of hatched chicks per nest, and egg losses. </jats:p>",

Incorporating with carbon credits, SAF could lower GHG emissions by about 65% in total from displacing CJF and generate additional welfare gains ranging between $12 and $51 million annually compared to the case without carbon credits. In addition, sensitivity analysis suggests advancing SAF conversion rate from biomass could lower the SAF break-even considerably and enhance the competitiveness of SAF over CJF.</jats:p>"

However, the accessibility of the tests is not optimal in these settings. This scoping review mapped evidence on supply chain management (SCM) systems for POC diagnostic services to reveal evidence that can help guide future research and inform the improved implementation of SARS-CoV-2 POC diagnostics in resource-limited settings. Methodology: This scoping review was guided by an adapted version of the Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework. We searched the following electronic databases: Medline Ovid, Medline EBSCO, Scopus, PubMed, PsychInfo, Web of Science and EBSCOHost. We also searched grey literature in the form of dissertations/theses, conference proceedings, websites of international organisations such as the World Health Organisation and government reports. A search summary table was used to test the efficacy of the search strategy. The quality of the included studies was appraised using the mixed method appraisal tool (MMAT) version 2018. Results: We retrieved 1206 articles (databases n = 1192, grey literature n = 14). Of these, 31 articles were included following abstract and full-text screening. Fifteen were primary studies conducted in LMICs, and 16 were reviews. The following themes emerged from the included articles: availability and accessibility of POC diagnostic services; reasons for stockouts of POC diagnostic tests (procurement, storage, distribution, inventory management and quality assurance) and human resources capacity in POC diagnostic services. Of the 31 eligible articles, 15 underwent methodological quality appraisal with scores between 90% and 100%. Conclusions: Our findings revealed limited published research on SCM systems for POC diagnostic services globally. We recommend primary studies aimed at investigating the barriers and enablers of SCM systems for POC diagnostic services for highly infectious pathogens such SARS-CoV-2 in high disease-burdened settings with limited laboratory infrastructures.</jats:p>"

Timely detection of the foreign objects and acquiring relevant information (e.g., quantities, geometry, and types) is a premise to enforce proactive measures to control potential loss. Large-scale water channels usually span a long distance and hence are difficult to be efficiently covered by manual inspection. Applying unmanned aerial vehicles for inspection can provide time-sensitive aerial images, from which intrusion incidents can be visually pinpointed. To automate the processing of such aerial images, this paper aims to propose a method based on computer vision to detect, extract, and classify foreign objects in water channels. The proposed approach includes four steps, i.e., aerial image preprocessing, abnormal region detection, instance extraction, and foreign object classification. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, which can recognize three typical foreign objects (i.e., livestock, rafting, and vehicle) with a robust performance. The proposed approach can raise early awareness of intrusion incidents in water channels for water quality assurance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Refined bio-crude production from hydrothermal liquefaction of algae holds the potential to replace fossil-based conventional liquid fuels. The microalgae act as natural carbon sequestrators by consuming CO2. However, this absorbed CO2 is released to the atmosphere during the combustion of the bio-crude. Thus, the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of refined bio-crude are linked to the production and supply of the materials involved and the process energy demands. One prominent raw material is CO2, which is the main source of carbon for algae and the subsequent products. The emissions associated with the supply of CO2 can have a considerable impact on the sustainability of the algae-based refined bio-crude production process. Furthermore, the diurnal algae growth cycle complicates the CO2 supply scenarios. Traditionally, studies have relied on CO2 supplied from existing power plants. However, there is potential for building natural gas or biomass-based power plants with the primary aim of supplying CO2 to the biorefinery. Alternately, a direct air capture (DAC) process can extract CO2 directly from the air. The life-cycle GHG emissions associated with the production of refined bio-crude through hydrothermal liquefaction of algae are presented in this study. Different CO2 supply scenarios, including existing fossil fuel power plants and purpose-built CO2 sources, are compared. The integration of the CO2 sources with the algal biorefinery is also presented. The CO2 supply from biomass-based power plants has the highest potential for GHG reduction, with a GHG footprint of −57 g CO2 eq./MJ refined bio-crude. The CO2 supply from the DAC process has a GHG footprint of 49 CO2 eq./MJ refined bio-crude, which is very similar to the scenario that considers the supply of CO2 from an existing conventional natural gas-based plant and takes credit for the carbon utilization.</jats:p>"

These springs, fed by the western Aurunci Mountains system are known as Mazzoccolo and Capodacqua having an average flow rates of 1100 l/s and 1300 l/s, respectively. Although these sources have been used since ancient Roman times and the quality of their water is excellent, variations in the precipitation regime, possibly related to worldwide climate changes, has exacerbated the following problems: a decrease in the flow rates of the springs caused by the reduction in winter rainfall, and an increase of turbidity due to concentrated rainfall events. In order to mitigate these problems, which affect a resident population of about 150,000 inhabitants, Acqualatina S.p.A. - the water utility company - promoted a series of geological and hydrogeological surveys. These studies aim at increasing the knowledge on the geological setting and to find additional sources to improve the existing supply. Within the framework of these activities, we studied a strategy aimed at diversifying the water supply by identifying new exploitable aquifers in the area, to reduce the aforementioned problems. This paper presents the results of research carried out before and during the construction of the water well field “25 Ponti” located in the coastal area of the plain of Formia. The research consisted in laboratory analyses of 130 groundwater samples and in monitoring of piezometric trends. The data show a seasonal variation in groundwater chemical composition caused also by aquifer exploitation, which in some periods of the year affects the regulated reserves. This seasonal phenomenon was however present in absence of pumping.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The formation of cold-water coral (CWC) mounds is commonly seen as being the result of the sustained growth of framework-forming CWCs and the concurrent supply and deposition of terrigenous sediments under energetic hydrodynamic conditions. Yet only a limited number of studies investigated the complex interplay of the various hydrodynamic, sedimentological and biological processes involved in mound formation, which, however, focused on the environmental conditions promoting coral growth. Therefore, we are still lacking an in-depth understanding of the processes allowing the on-mound deposition of hemipelagic sediments, which contribute to two thirds of coral mound deposits. To investigate these processes over geological time and to evaluate their contribution to coral mound formation, we reconstructed changes in sediment transport and deposition by comparing sedimentological parameters (grain-size distribution, sediment composition, accumulation rates) of two sediment cores collected from a Mediterranean coral mound and the adjacent seafloor (off-mound). Our results showed that under a turbulent hydrodynamic regime promoting coral growth during the Early Holocene, the deposition of fine siliciclastic sediments shifted from the open seafloor to the coral mounds. This led to a high average mound aggradation rate of &amp;gt;130 cm kyr<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>, while sedimentation rates in the adjacent off-mound area at the same time did not exceed 10 cm kyr<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. Thereby, the baffling of suspended sediments by the coral framework and their deposition within the ecological accommodation space provided by the corals seem to be key processes for mound formation. Although, it is commonly accepted that these processes play important roles in various sedimentary environments, our study provided for the first time, core-based empirical data proving the efficiency of these processes in coral mound environment. In addition, our approach to compare the grain-size distribution of the siliciclastic sediments deposited concurrently on a coral mound and on the adjacent seafloor allowed us to investigate the integrated influence of coral mound morphology and coral framework on the mound formation process. Based on these results, this study provides the first conceptual model for coral mound formation by applying sequence stratigraphic concepts, which highlights the interplay of the coral-framework baffling capacity, coral-derived ecological accommodation space and sediment supply.</jats:p>"

However, some research gaps still exist that need to be explored to improve the sustainability of supply chains. Specifically, there is a critical research need to look at the conceptual background of SCF and its potential applicability in various phases of supply chains. Therefore, this article aims to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive State‐of‐the‐Art literature review based on 367 papers published from 2006 to 2020. Furthermore, this article is one of the first attempts to present current and past studies in the domain of SCF in a holistic manner. The analysis highlights the most influential authors, keywords, organisations, leading publications and clusters in existing research areas. This article also sets out a proposed research framework based on the triangulation approach perspective, that is, financial perspective, buyer perspective and supply chain‐oriented perspective. The most important and unique contribution of the article is the identification of new and emerging research areas where the application of SCF is still in the nascent stage. These findings can guide stakeholders at every stage of the value chain to appropriately use techniques that model policies to better inform investment and operational decisions in line with Sustainable Development Goals.</jats:p>",

In order to obtain information about the current status of these schools, a questionnaire was prepared and distributed to post-secondary vocational school employees and 167 industrial sector representatives. The answers of these respondents were analyzed by using factor analysis, and some indexes were generated. The results of this study suggest that the main problems of the post-secondary vocational schools are stated as the limited collaboration between the post-secondary vocational schools and the private sector firms, selection of inappropriate locations to open post-secondary vocational schools, limited social facilities, and the lack of job opportunities for some graduates of associate degree programs. Some institutional and educational recommendations are suggested by the participants for solving these problems. For example, to improve the institutional status of the post-secondary vocational schools, the duration of workplace training should be increased, machinery and equipment used in these schools should be enhanced, and employment demand projections should be taken into consideration while determining the student admission quotas. In terms of education and training, they propose that the education period should be extended for the students to gain professional skills and competences, and a preparatory class should be placed to improve the basic professional skills of the general high school graduates who enrolled in these schools.</jats:p>",

The concentrations of major pollutants were assessed in the sanitary sewer system at different rainfall intensities. Then, a solution to mitigate the problem was proposed using low impact development (LID) technology. The results of sensitivity analysis indicated that maximum build-up possible was the most sensitive parameter for model calibration. The model was calibrated using actual rainfall events, and statistical validation coefficients of R (0.81–0.82) and NMSE (0.0173–0.022) proved that the model is valid. The sewage quality assessment results showed that pollutants concentration increased to its maximum level at 20 min and gradually decreased to a slightly constant minimum value after 2 h. The proposed solution of LID reduced the pollutants concentrations by 82–88, 75–77, 52–55, and 7–10% for all pollutants at return periods of 2, 5, 10, and 25 years, respectively. To conclude, SWMM simulation successfully predicted the concentration of the pollutants, and leaking of stormwater surface runoff has changed the sewage quality.</jats:p>",

Multi – stage sampling method was employed to obtain 125 household consumers of local Rice. The sampling of respondents cut across Agricultural zones 1, 2 and 3 of Niger State. Primary and Secondary data were used. Descriptive statistics like mean, frequency tables and percentages were employed to describe the socio – economic characteristics of the respondents. Vector Autoregressive model (VAR) was used to estimate production variables that granger caused local Rice supply. . Hedonic model was used to determine the effect of local Rice characteristics on the preference and willingness to pay by consumers. The result indicated the mean age of 45 for Niger. The household size has mean of 6 and years spent in school stood at 17 for Niger. The annual income mean were 414 thousand naira for Niger State. The granger causality equations show that, all variables granger caused production of local, Rice in Niger States except dlnarea. The dlnarea in Niger State was not significant. This means that it does not granger caused local Rice production. The result of hedonic model revealed that free from stone, whiteness, aroma, cohesion and taste were all significant. This means that all these attributes have great effect on price, preference and willingness to pay higher price for local Rice. These will encourage the producers to produce more and will lead to higher supply in the market.</jats:p>",

Based on the game and chaos theories, this paper analyzes the preference of the capacity provider, the capacity requestor, and the capacity platform operator on different trading strategies from the aspects of profitability and stability. It finds that the platform operator values stability much more than profitability, although the latter may reach higher optimal expected profits. The preference of each supply chain member is influenced by the production cost, potential market size, and the limited capacity of the capacity requestor. A stable system can result in higher long-run profits than a profitable system. We further propose the all-win situation for the capacity provider, capacity requestor, and platform operator.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global spread of the recent coronavirus outbreak has disrupted supply chains in both unanticipated and unprecedented ways. In the wake of such numerous catastrophic incidents, the core notion of supply chain resilience has sparked the attention of countless researchers and practitioners. However, the supply chain resilience of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) remains rather underresearched to date. In such turbulent times, it is important to investigate the role of relationships in achieving supply chain resilience in the context of SMEs. Thus, the overall intention of this study is to explore the influence of supply chain relationships on the resilience of SME supply chains by exploring the impacts of both outsourcing and collaboration. A well-structured online questionnaire was administered by selecting respondents using stratified random sampling techniques. In order to measure all the variables, a 5-point Likert scale was used. The survey was administered to a total of 160 SMEs and 114 valid responses were returned (response rate of 71.25%). Quantitative data was analyzed using correlation and regression analysis with the help of SPSS tool. The results of the study revealed that both outsourcing, and collaboration positively influences supply chain resilience. Therefore, the study recommends SMEs to engage in outsourcing and collaborative processes to foster resilience in supply chains during turbulent times. To the best of the author’s knowledge the present study is one of the first study done regarding SME supply chain resilience in Sri Lanka. The study recommends SMEs to focus better on outsourcing techniques and collaborative procedures in order to nurture supply chain resilience. Therefore, the guidance of this study will provide future scholars and practitioners to pursue an effective study in the field. The present study was limited to quantitative methods to achieve the objectives of the study. Hence, the authors recommend future researchers to focus on qualitative methods that can aid in the advancement of knowledge.

To analyze the effect of suppliers’ eco-design on the economic benefits of up-downstream supply chain and the mechanisms, this study constructed a master–slave game theory model for a supplier and a manufacturer. Based on this game theory model, this study comparatively analyzes the effects on raw material/part prices, retail product prices, sale volume, revenue, and eco-design effort level under three conditions (no eco-design, decentralized decision-making with eco-design, centralized decision-making with eco-design). And to further analyze the effect of eco-design costs on the optimal solution, this article takes the supply chain of tire production as an example. This analysis could provide suggestions for the suppliers and manufacturers to develop and improve their eco-design. The main results are as follows: the supplier eco-design is beneficial to improving the overall economic benefits for suppliers and manufacturers under certain conditions, and the range in which a supplier is willing to implement eco-design in a decentralized decision-making situation is wider than that in a centralized decision-making situation; when a supplier implements an eco-design, it will transfer part of the cost to the manufacturer by raising the unit raw material/parts prices. Meanwhile, the manufacturer can reduce the production cost when the benefit of eco-design is more than the increased purchasing price, and they can decrease the retail price to expand the sales volume. Hence, consumers will benefit from lower prices. Thus, it is a multi-win situation among the suppliers, manufacturers, and consumers.</jats:p>"

The relative importance of diapycnal mixing, diapycnal advection, and isopycnal stirring by mesoscale eddies in providing this nutrient supply is explored using a field campaign in oligotrophic waters in the subtropical North Atlantic, consisting of transects over and off the mid‐Atlantic ridge. Eddy stirring rates are estimated from the excess temperature variance dissipation relative to the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation, and using eddy statistics from satellite observations combined with 9‐month‐long mooring data. The vertical nutrient fluxes by diapycnal mixing, diapycnal advection, and isopycnal mesoscale eddy stirring are assessed using nitrate measurements from observations or a climatology. Diapycnal mixing and advection provide a nutrient supply within the euphotic zone, but a loss of nutrients within the upper thermocline. Eddy stirring augments, and is comparable to, the diapycnal transfer of nutrients within the summertime upper thermocline, while also acting to replenish nutrients within the deeper parts of the thermocline. The eddy supply of nitrate is relatively small in the center of the subtropical gyre, reaching up to 0.06 mol N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, but is likely to be enhanced on the flanks of the gyre due to larger isopycnal slopes and lateral nitrate gradients. The nutrient supply to the euphotic zone is achieved via a multistage mechanism: a diapycnal transfer of nutrients by small‐scale turbulence to the euphotic zone, and an isopycnal stirring of nutrients by mesoscale eddies replenishing nutrients in the upper thermocline.</jats:p>",

During pandemics, it is difficult to handle the demands of consumers, to overcome food production problems due to lockdowns, work with minimum manpower, follow import and export trade policies, and avoid transportation disruptions. This study aims to analyze the behavior of food imports in Saudi Arabia and how this pandemic and its resulting precautionary measures have affected the food supply chain. We performed a statistical analysis and extracted descriptive measures prior to applying hybrid statistical hypothesis tests to study the behavior of the food chain. The paired samples t-test was used to study differences while the independent samples t-test was used to study differences in means at the level of each item and country, followed by the comparison of means test in order to determine the difference and whether it is increasing or decreasing. According to the results, Saudi Arabia experienced significant effects on the number of items shipped and the countries that supplied these items. The paired samples t-test showed a change in the behavior of importing activities by—47% for items and countries. The independent t-test revealed that 24 item groups and 86 countries reflected significant differences in the mean between the two periods. However, the impact on 41 other countries was almost negligible. In addition, the comparison of means test found that 68% of item groups were significantly reduced and 24% were increased, while only 4% of the items remained the same. From a country perspective, 65% of countries showed a noticeable decrease and 16% a significant increase, while 19% remained the same.</jats:p>"

On the other hand, new possibilities and technologies contribute to the overall efficiency of construction projects. The progress of information and communication technologies is one of the most extensive opportunities that can significantly streamline designing sustainable buildings. The big data concept is increasingly being implemented in all areas of industry. The design of buildings and the entire civil engineering industry is where these processes are becoming automated with the help of information technology. Supply chain management based on information systems represents a great potential in the design of buildings and planning of construction projects in materials procurement. These facts lead to the assumption that the concept of big data and supply chain management systems can effectively influence the sustainable design of buildings. These technologies are expected to improve economic sustainability by reducing costs and shortening materials’ delivery time and construction time. The research is carried out on a sample of construction projects. The level of use of the concept of big data and SCM systems and their impact on economic sustainability in the form of parameters such as construction project costs, delivery time of materials and building construction were examined. Data collection took place through a questionnaire survey. Within the used methods, this research worked data-free but also scaled to the Likert scale. Data processing was performed using Pearson dependence and the use of a correlation coefficient. The main goal of the research was to analyze the impact of using the concept of big data and supply chain management on the cost of the building, the time of delivery of materials and the construction of the building. It was found that the use of SCM and BD has an impact on the monitored parameters, and the correlation rate is high.</jats:p>"

In Polinema, the TEFA deals with the bottled mineral drinking water, and its supply chain starts from the water purifying until the marketing. A key aspect of achieving an economically and technically feasible production is the selection of wellspring as the source of raw material. The potential water sources are located at Wringinsongo, Ampeldento, Prigen, and Ngijo in Malang area. A decision support system is required to select the suitable source by integrating weighted tangible and intangible criteria, namely water quality, distance, and willingness to pay. Multicriteria decision-making by analytical hierarchy process is applied to assign criteria weight and select the source. The results demonstrate that Ngijo wellspring is recommended, followed by Wringinsongo, Ampeldento, and Prigen according to the performance value. The system could serve as a tool for the selection, instead of intuitive judgment with a better compromise for improving the TEFA productivity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The international aviation industry has the goal to gradually reduce carbon emissions mainly by using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). However, currently SAF cannot be produced at competitive prices relative to petroleum-based jet fuel. Pennycress is a crop whose oilseed could be used as a relatively low-cost feedstock to produce SAF, potentially benefiting farmers and the environment. This stochastic techno-economic analysis (TEA) studies an enterprise buying pennycress oilseed from farmers, extracting the bio-oil and selling it to a biorefinery that converts bio-oil into SAF. Maximum buying prices (MBP)—prices that yield a zero net present value—the crushing enterprise could pay farmers for pennycress oilseed are estimated. To conduct the analysis, discount rates are estimated based on financial data of biofuel firms, thus providing a realistic benchmark to evaluate profitability and feedstock buying prices. Estimated risk-adjusted discount rates vary between 12 and 17%, above rates typically used in similar valuations. Estimated stochastic MBP range between 10.18 and 11.73 ¢ pound<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, which is below the price at which farmers are willing to plant pennycress, according to recent research. By considering the crushing facility’s inherent cash flow structure and risk, the distributions of stochastic modified internal rate of return suggest the crushing enterprise could be economically attractive at a 14% discount rate, our most likely estimate. However, between 11 and 17% times the cash flow model is simulated, the firm falls under financial distress. Overall, the findings suggest potential barriers for deployment of a SAF supply chain without governmental incentives or related policies.</jats:p>"

However, as a dynamic game process, the collaboration between manufacturer, provider, and seller in the supply chain is influenced by a range of elements. This paper is set out to investigate the collaborative innovation strategy adopted by manufacturer, supplier, and distributor (the “three players”). To meet this end, an analytical framework was built to study the evolutionary game of collaborative innovation in supply chain enterprises. Based on the analysis, this research further studied the dynamic evolutionary mechanism and influencing elements through four different simulation cases. The research showed the following. (1) When the three players have equal innovative capability, they are more willing to contribute to innovation if the projected revenue is higher reflecting an increasing coefficient of collaborative innovation gains. As a result, the three players are more likely to agree on their cooperation approach. (2) When the three players have different independent and innovative capabilities, they are more willing to innovate if the collaborative innovation gain coefficient increases, but supply chain players with stronger capability are more active to innovate than their peers. In other words, strong innovators attach particular attention to innovation. (3) When any collaborative innovation could generate profits for all players in the supply chain, the player who enjoys the benefit but lacks innovative capability will be unwilling to cooperate with others if additional gains rise. Thus, better maintenance of the stability of the collaborative innovation system requires a strictly implemented coordination mechanism.</jats:p>",

Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology’s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems. We also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT infrastructure and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms. Finally, we discussed the features of the proposed supply chain architecture, followed by a conclusion and future work.</jats:p>"

In order to show the efficiency of the fourfold slope solar still, comparative experiments are conducted under the winter climate conditions in Hangzhou for testing the operational performance of a double slope type solar still (DOSS) and the fourfold slope still (FOSS), so as to make a comparative analysis between them. Results show that the productivity of the fourfold slope still is 19.51% higher than that of the double slope still, and the fourfold slope solar still enhances the average hourly energy efficiency by 31.11%. According to the energy method, the energy payback time values of the fourfold slope solar still and double slope solar still are 64.88 months and 75.42 months respectively. According to the environmental parameter method, FOSS and DOSS reduce 5.47 tons and 4.58 tons of CO2 respectively. The corresponding values based on the exergy environment parameters are 0.21 and 0.18 tons of CO2, respectively. The fourfold slope solar still has a more obvious emission reduction function than the double slope solar still. The cost of the distilled water of the fourfold slope solar still is 0.28 RMB/kg, and the cost of the double slope solar still is 0.30 RMB/kg. In addition, the environmental and economic parameters of the fourfold slope still and double slope still are 79.29$ (561.37RMB) and 66.35$ (469.76RMB), respectively. While, the corresponding values based on the exergoenvironmental parameter are 3.05$ (21.59RMB) and 2.56$ (18.12RMB), respectively. From the analysis of exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental parameters, the fourfold slope single basin solar still appears to be more effective.</jats:p>",

The rapid urbanization process has intensified the demand for limited natural resources, leading to a series of problems in coastal zones such as land use conflicts and the degradation of ecosystem services. Taking Quanzhou, a bay city in a metropolitan region, as an example, this paper established an accounting model of ecosystem services supply and consumption demand based on multisource data (meteorological site data, land use data and statistical data). We estimated the supply capacity and consumption demand of provisioning services, regulating services, and cultural services in Quanzhou from 2005 to 2015. In addition, the supply and demand of ecosystem services were simulated for 2030 under different scenarios. The results showed that the supply capacity of ecosystem services in Quanzhou was greater than the demand in general, but the supply-demand difference showed a gradual decrease. The high-value areas of supply capacity were concentrated in the upstream basin in the non-bay area, while the high-value areas of consumption demand were located downstream of the river basin in the bay area. The supply-demand difference in the bay area was negative, indicating that it was in a state of supply-demand imbalance and that the ecological security was under threat. Among the three simulated scenarios in 2030, the balance between supply and demand declined compared with the results of 2015, with the most serious decline in the natural scenario. The method to quantify the evolution of spatial and temporal patterns in supply and demand of ecosystem services could provide a decision-making reference for natural resource management in Quanzhou. This is conducive to the improvement and establishment of urban ecological security research systems, especially in bay areas that are lacking research.</jats:p>"

Bu bilinç tüketicileri de etkilemiş olup, yeşil ürünlere olan talep gün geçtikçe artmaktadır. Endüstri 4.0 teknolojilerinin de çevreye olumlu etkilerinin olduğu öngörülmektedir. Bu çalışma, Endüstri 4.0 teknolojileri uygulayan ve çevreye duyarlı bir pazara hizmet eden, iki aşamalı yeşil bir tedarik zincirinin koordinasyonunu ele almaktadır. Üreticinin Endüstri 4.0 yatırım miktarı, maliyetini ve yeşillik seviyesini etkilemektedir. Perakendeci de yeşillik seviyesini arttırmak için yatırım yapmaktadır. Tedarik zincirindeki her bir üyenin sadece kendi sistemini optimize etmeyi amaçladığı merkezkaç sistemde, üreticinin ve perakendecinin yeşillik seviyeleri optimal çözüme oranla daha düşük çıkmaktadır. Ayrıca, üreticinin Endüstri 4.0 yatırım seviyesi, talep ve tedarik zincirinin toplam karı da merkezkaç çözümde daha düşüktür. Bu sonuçlar, tedarik zincirinin koordine edilmesi gerektiğini göstermektedir. Bu amaçla, iki kısımlı tarife (İKT) kontratı geliştirilmiştir. İKT kontratında, üretici ürünleri maliyetine satmakta, perakendeci ise daha sonra üreticiye toplu bir ödeme yapmaktadır. Kontrat sonrasında hem üretici hem de perakendeci rasyonel olarak merkezi çözüm doğrultusunda karar vermektedir. Dolayısıyla, İKT kontratı tedarik zincirinin koordinasyonunu sağlamaktadır. Buna ek olarak, Pareto iyileştiren olmasının yanı sıra, bu kontrat sayesinde üyeler adil bir kar artışından da faydalanabilmektedir. Kontrat öncesi ve sonrası tedarik zincirleri analiz edildiğinde, koordinasyonun tedarik zincirinin ekonomik ve çevresel sürdürülebilirliğini arttırdığı ortaya çıkmaktadır. Ayrıca, tedarik zinciri üyelerinin etkileşim içinde olduğu; üreticinin yeşillik seviyesindeki artışın, perakendecinin de daha fazla yeşillik yatırımı yapmasını sağladığı görülmektedir.</jats:p>"

The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it analyzes how the pandemic has negatively disrupted lobster supply chains and their sustainability. Second, it demonstrates how a simulation-based methodology based on the software AnyLogistix can be applied to examine the effects of a pandemic on food supply chains. We show the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic from four perspectives: production-inventory dynamics, customer performance, financial performance, and lead-time performance. Our findings include the following. First, the pandemic has created a backlog problem for the live lobster industry. Second, it has significantly increased the lead time of the lobster supply chain. Overall, this research can help the government and trade organizations to devise appropriate policies to reduce the negative impacts of the pandemic on food supply chains and their sustainability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Spare parts are one of the important components of the equipment comprehensive support system. Spare parts management plays a decisive role in achieving the desired availability with the minimum cost. With the equipment complexity increasing, the price of spare parts has risen sharply. The traditional spare parts management makes the contradiction between fund shortage and spare parts shortage increasingly prominent. Based on the analysis of the multi-echelon and multi-indenture spare parts support model VARI-METRIC (vary multi-echelon technology for recoverable item control, VARI-METRIC), which is widely used by troops and enterprises in various countries, the model is mainly used in high system availability scenarios. However, in the case of low equipment system availability, the accuracy and cost of model inventory prediction are not ideal. This paper proposed the multi-level spare parts optimization model, which is based on the demand-supply steady-state process. It is an analytical model, which is used to solve the low accuracy problem of the VARI-METRIC model in the low equipment system availability. The analytical model is based on the multi-level spare parts support process. The article deduces methods for solving demand rate, demand–supply rate, equipment system availability, and support system availability. The marginal analysis method is used in the model to analyze the spare parts inventory allocation strategy’s current based cost and availability optimal value. Finally, a simulation model is established to evaluate and verify the model. Then, the simulation results show that, when the low availability of equipment systems are 0.4, 0.6, the relative errors of the analytical model are 3.54%, 3.86%, and its costs are 0.52, 1.795 million ¥ RMB. The experiment proves that the inventory prediction accuracy of the analytical model is significantly higher than that of the VARI-METRIC model in low equipment system availability. Finally, the conclusion and future research directions are discussed.</jats:p>"

In the proposed scheme, the cooperative control of air compressor and back pressure valve in the fuel cell air supply system is realized by MPC. When the system is in steady state under the MPC, PID is introduced, so that the steady‐state error, which is caused by the mismatch between the control model in MPC and the controlled system during MPC control, can be eliminated. To reduce the mismatch between the control model and the controlled air supply system, back propagation neural network and look‐up table method based on bilinear interpolation are used to calculate the output air flow rate and efficiency of the air compressor in the air supply system. Simulation results show that the proposed control scheme has a better performance compared with proportional integral control, active disturbance rejection control, and single MPC. In addition, the proposed control scheme also shows good fault tolerance in the case of air supply system failure.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The experiments are conducted in regular head seas on a Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) and a Supply Vessel (SV) in intermediate water depth. The SV is shorter than the LHD by approximately 17%, but due to its larger block coefficient, it displaces almost 16% more than the LHD. Generally, the motions of the SV were larger than the LHD.

The kinetic, equilibrium, and thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process were evaluated. Adsorbents were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Zeta Potential techniques. The FeNPs were obtained by a simple and low-cost method and they were successfully encapsulated and uniformly dispersed over the microspheres' surface. Significantly fast adsorption kinetic rates were observed due to microspheres' particle size and FeNPs encapsulation. The chemisorption mechanism was recognized in both adsorbate-adsorbent systems. The As(V) isotherms data suggested that the process is associated with heterogeneous adsorption. Available sorption sites with different adsorption energies were related to the functional groups involved in removing As(V), such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Significantly high adsorption capacities were obtained for both materials, suggesting they can be competitive compared to conventional adsorbents, even at low FeNPs concentrations. Besides FeNPs encapsulation enhancing arsenate removal, higher adsorption was obtained at slightly acidic pH values and, together with their small particle size, suggests that the microspheres have a great potential to be used as arsenate adsorbents in the water treatment for human consumption.</jats:p>",

Taking into account the progressive electrification of the transport and heating sector, it is necessary to assess the required grid optimization or expansion measures from a conventional, as well as an innovative point of view. This is necessary in order to be able to contain the enormous investment volumes needed for transforming the energy system and aligning the infrastructures to their future requirements in time. Therefore, this article first explains the methodological approach of allocating scenarios of the development of electric mobility and heat pumps to analyzed grids. The article continues with describing which power values need to be applied and which conventional and innovative planning measures are available for avoiding voltage band violations and equipment overloads within the framework of strategic grid planning. Subsequently, the results of grid planning studies are outlined and evaluated with an assessment model that evaluates capital as well as operational costs. On this basis, planning and operation guidelines for urban low-voltage grids are derived. The main result is that low-voltage grids can accommodate charging infrastructure for electric mobility, as well as heat pumps to a certain degree. In addition, it is concluded that conventional planning measures are not completely avoidable, but can be partially avoided or deferred through dynamic load management.</jats:p>"

However, to achieve this potential, DAC systems must be coupled to suitable locally available energy sources and sited near geological storage. This study explores the potential of low‐carbon energy sources to supply power and heat to the DAC process in a dedicated, self‐sufficient system tailored for each energy source. Solar, geothermal, woody biomass, wind, and nuclear energy sources are assessed for their global energy supply potential and possible land use requirements. While the options differ in area requirement and regional efficacy, we estimate that all the regionally specific technologies considered can supply energy to achieve significant removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere globally. The amount of energy physically available from solar, offshore wind, and woody biomass converts to a removal potential of 160–971, 45–150, and 2–5 Gt CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/year, respectively. Thus, negative emission targets can be reached by utilizing a moderate fraction of the overall potential of several different low‐carbon energy sources for DAC while the magnitude of the potential changes significantly according to the source of energy. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The organoleptic risk associated with drinking water quality was assessed according to Method Recommendations MR 2.1.4.0032–11. Population health risk assessment was carried out in compliance with conditions and requirements of Guidelines R 2.1.10.1920–04.\nResults: We established that chemical and microbiological quality indices of drinking water in street water pumps in 2016–2018 were below the permissible limits for all samples. Both organoleptic and non-carcinogenic risk estimates were within the\nacceptable range. The carcinogenic risk for the population was less than a case. Yet, the presence of trihalomethanes and herbicides in tap water sampled in Olimpiyskaya Street posed unacceptable total carcinogenic health risk.\nConclusion: The study results were used to develop recommendations for appropriate preventive measures aimed to reduce chemical exposure of the population of Ufa through drinking water.</jats:p>",

Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an effective tool proposed for the single-layer feedforward neural network in regression and classification problems. However, the standard ELM model falls into a local minimum with a high probability in hydrological prediction problems since the randomly assigned parameters (like input-hidden weights and hidden biases) often remain unchanged in the learning process. For effectively improving the prediction accuracy, this paper develops a hybrid hydrological forecasting model where the emerging sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is firstly used to determine the satisfying parameter combinations of the ELM model, and then the Moore–Penrose generalized inverse method is chosen to analytically obtain the weight matrix between the hidden layer and output layer. The proposed method is used to forecast the long-term daily runoff series collected from three real-world hydrological stations in China. Based on several performance evaluation indexes, the results show that the proposed method outperforms several ELM variants optimized by other evolutionary algorithms in both training and testing phases. Hence, an effective evolutionary machine-learning tool is developed for accurate hydrological time series forecasting.</jats:p>",

A DBD-PA controls fluid motion and offers quick response without the need for moving parts. Previous studies have proposed methods for generating various flow patterns with a DBD-PA for fluid control. This paper presents a method for generating multiple flow patterns using a multi-electrode DBD-PA that is driven by a single-channel high-voltage power supply with a relay circuit. In contrast, conventional methods of realizing multiple flow patterns involve the use of a multi-channel power supply. Hence, they have the disadvantage of requiring a complicated power supply system. The proposed method succeeded in realizing several induced-flow modes involving the generation of a directionally controllable wall jet, various sizes of vortices, and an upward jet by altering the switching frequency and switching ratio. In addition, our experimental results indicate that the proposed method can control the flow pattern with a significantly short response time. The direction of the wall jet can be switched within tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Therefore, the proposed method combines simplicity and versatility and is expected to facilitate the realization of multifunctional active flow control in various flow fields, such as flow turbulent boundary layer control, thermal diffusion control, gas mixing, and flame-stability enhancement.</jats:p>",

This study provides rare evidence quantifying how water supply reservoirs alter water temperature regimes and its effects on macroinvertebrate and diatom communities over a 4‐year period. We obtained near‐continuous water temperature measurements upstream and downstream of three reservoirs and analysed thermal variables in association with macroinvertebrate and diatom community indices (including taxonomic richness, proportion of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa [<jats:italic>%EPT</jats:italic>] and diatom ecological guilds). Reservoirs typically decreased downstream thermal variability, with reduced summer temperatures and increased winter temperatures, and a delayed timing of annual temperature extremes. Marked differences in thermal regime modifications between reservoirs were observed, including evidence of inter‐annual variation associated with inter‐basin water transfers downstream of one reservoir. Biomonitoring indices showed associations with thermal indices that differed between site types (regulated versus non‐regulated) and seasons (spring vs. autumn). Various macroinvertebrate and diatom indices capturing community diversity elements and sensitivities to different environmental pressures were associated with higher maximum summer temperatures and lower minimum winter temperatures, suggesting ecological effects of reduced thermal variation downstream of reservoirs. Different ecological responses to thermal indices were observed between seasons, likely due to organism life‐cycle effects and intra‐annual thermal variations. Contrasting macroinvertebrate and diatom communities were observed between regulated and non‐regulated sites, which may be driven by differences in the thermal regime and other abiotic factors at regulated sites, including nutrient, sediment and flow regimes. Long‐term continuous water temperature monitoring of both multiple regulated and non‐regulated river systems is necessary to better understand the environmental and ecological effects of river impoundments. Given the extent to which river impoundment has modified stream temperatures globally, the inclusion of thermal regime data in environmental flow studies alongside hydrological information may guide the implementation of mitigation measures on impounded waterbodies.</jats:p>",

The Penman-Monteith (FAO-56(PM)) equation was demonstrated to be the most reliable and adaptive to a wide range of humid to semi-arid climates. However, it requires several environmental parameters (e.g., wind speed, solar radiation), rarely available in developing countries. Therefore, numerous temperature-based formulas have been designed to address this issue for various environments. Their calibration and validation against the local climate frequently lead to increases in performance. We revised the Hargreaves exponent (EH) and substituted a value of (0.16) for the original value (0.5). The modified Hargreaves formula enhances the ETo predictions with a mean absolute error ranging from (0.791) mm per day for Balakot to (2.36) mm per day in Risalpur, averaging (3.797) mm per day, as compared to the Hargreaves-Samani (16.827) mm per day. In general, all the selected models showed high accuracy. However, the modified Hargreaves equation appeared to give the most promising results. It ranked first in (50%) of the whole area based on the standard error of estimate for estimating ETo in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The studies were carried out for steps with an average diameter of 250 mm. The range of variation of the factors was the ratio of the pressures in front of the nozzles to the pressure behind the stage from 2.0 to 5.0; rotation speed of the shaft with the impeller from 0 to 14000 rpm. The efficiency of using the kinetic energy is given in the form of the coefficients of the speed of the nozzle apparatus and the impeller. The coefficients represent the ratio of the actual flow rate at the outlet of the nozzle apparatus (impeller) to the theoretically possible gas velocity in the outlet section of the stage element under consideration. It was found that the speed coefficients of the nozzle apparatus and impellers change not only when changing operating parameters, such as the rotor speed and the pressure ratio per stage, but also when changing the degree of stage partiality.</jats:p>",

The main purpose of our work is to develop a method of rational control of dynamic operation modes of electrochemical energy storage devices to increase the efficiency of their operation as part of the energy supply systems of vehicles. Methodology. The authors reviewed the world literature on the topic of the work. The existing control methods of electrochemical energy storage devices were systematized and classified. Peculiarities and possibilities of their application taking into account the specifics of operation on vehicles, which are characterized by dynamic modes with unpredictable changes in the energy balance due to uncontrolled undercharges and overcharges were taken into account. The analysis of existing control methods showed that their common disadvantage is the use as information parameters to control and manage the operation modes of storage device, such as voltage and operating current, the values of which do not correspond to the current energy state of the device due to the fleeting nature of transient electrochemical processes in the device during operation in dynamic modes. The conclusion is made about the need to take into account the energy parameters of storage devices in the process of managing dynamic modes, which most fully and objectively reflect their performance. The advantage of pulse control methods of storage devices in dynamic modes of operation over DC methods is shown. Findings. The authors substantiated and experimentally confirmed the versatility of the developed galvanostatic method, which allows simultaneous control of the current energy state of the storage device and operational management of dynamic modes of its operation using a common criterion of control and management – the utilization factor of active materials, the information equivalent of which is the value of the area under the depolarization curve on the response signal of the device to the test pulse. Originality. For the first time it is proposed to combine the functions of control of the current energy state of the storage device and operational management of the dynamic modes of its operation with the use of the utilization factor of active materials.

This research adopted a quantitative approach. A total of 289 datasets were collected from the procurement officers of Malaysian local authorities and analysed using the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling technique. The empirical findings showed that work experience, prior knowledge, and accountability correlate directly with procedural rationality in procurement decision-making, which would impact the procurement outcome.

However, as a lithium-ion battery-powered device, drones’ social and environmental merits can be overturned by battery recycling and disposal. To maintain economic performance, yet minimise environmental negatives, fleet sharing is widely applied in the transportation field, with the aim of creating synergies within industry and increasing overall fleet use. However, if a sharing platform’s transparency is doubted, the sharing ability of the platform will be discounted. Known for its transparent and secure merits, blockchain technology provides new opportunities to improve existing sharing solutions. In particular, the decentralised structure and data encryption algorithm offered by blockchain allow every participant equal access to shared resources without undermining security issues. Therefore, this study explores the implementation of a blockchain-enabled fleet sharing solution to optimise drone operations, with consideration of battery wear and disposal effects. Unlike classical vehicle routing with fleet sharing problems, this research is more challenging, with multiple objectives (i.e., shortest path and fewest charging times), and considers different levels of sharing abilities. In this study, we propose a mixed-integer programming model to formulate the intended problem and solve the problem with a tailored branch-and-price algorithm. Through extensive experiments, the computational performance of our proposed solution is first articulated, and then the effectiveness of using blockchain to improve overall optimisation is reflected, and a series of critical influential factors with managerial significance are demonstrated.</jats:p>",

Groundwater is predominantly used in these productive agricultural fields. Saline water intrusion in fresh groundwater aquifers, which is mainly due to the excess withdrawal of groundwater, was recorded in the study area. A total of 80 groundwater samples were analyzed for physical and chemical parameters using standard chemical procedures. The groundwater mainly represents Na+–Cl− type, which shows the mixing of fresh water with saline water. The high correlation between Na+–Cl− and Mg2+–HCO3− explained that the intermixing of aquifer waters and the leaching of secondary salts influenced the region. Evaporation-fractional crystallizations are the main processes in the groundwater of the study area. The irrigation water quality index was calculated using different quality indices including Na%, sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium bicarbonate (RSBC), permeability index (PI), magnesium hazard (MH), Kelly's ratio (KR), and potential salinity (PS), Cl−:HCO3−, Mg2+:Ca2+ and Na+:Ca2+ to estimate the suitability of groundwater quality for irrigation. Spatial distribution maps were prepared using raster interpolation in GIS. The assessment revealed that the areas covering 67.6% of electrical conductivity, 100% of total dissolved solids, 57.5% of Na%, 21.3% of RSBC, 66.3% of PI, 16.3% of MH, 65% of KR, and, 100% of PS required severe to moderate restrictions. Overall, the groundwater in the study region showed potential salinity due to geogenic and anthropogenic activities, and thus it must be monitored for sustainable agriculture.</jats:p>",

Transformations—political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal-in synergy have always been a catalyst for reactions in society. The field of energy supply, like many others, is extremely susceptible to the external influence of such factors. To a large extent, this applies to remote (especially from the position of energy supply) regions. The authors outline an approach to justifying the development of the Arctic energy infrastructure through an analysis of the demand for the amount of energy consumed and energy sources, taking into account global trends. The methodology is based on scenario modeling of technological demand. It is based on a study of the specific needs of consumers, available technologies, and identified risks. The paper proposes development scenarios and presents a model that takes them into account. Modeling results show that in all scenarios, up to 50% of the energy balance in 2035 will take gas, but the role of carbon-free energy sources will increase. The mathematical model allowed forecasting the demand for energy types by certain types of consumers, which makes it possible to determine the vector of development and stimulation of certain types of resources for energy production in the Arctic. The model enables considering not only the growth but also the decline in demand for certain types of consumers under different scenarios. In addition, authors’ forecasts, through further modernization of the energy sector in the Arctic region, can contribute to the creation of prerequisites that will be stimulating and profitable for the growth of investment in sustainable energy sources to supply consumers. The scientific significance of the work lies in the application of a consistent hybrid modeling approach to forecasting demand for energy resources in the Arctic region. The results of the study are useful in drafting a scenario of regional development, taking into account the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as identifying areas of technology and energy infrastructure stimulation.</jats:p>"

During excessively humid weather, nestlings spent more time under the entrance hole when small food was delivered. However, nestlings supplied with large prey more often remained hidden in the distant area, despite the adverse weather situation. In all three aspects and temporal scales, our analysis confirmed that prey was the most important factor influencing offspring nest-space use, suggesting a crucial role of large insects for hoopoes. Finally, we found that long-term effects of weather affect overall food provisioned to nestlings and thus offspring behaviour. We provide evidence that parental feeding location and prey size, which are in turn influenced by weather conditions, are the most influential factors for nest-space use. This study expands our knowledge of parent–offspring communication and how environmental factors may lead to differential nest-space use, which may be regarded as the earliest form of habitat preference in birds.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance statement</jats:title><jats:p>Nests are usually constrained in space but designed to protect offspring from the environment while giving them limited possibilities to express behavioural diversity. This is particularly true for bird nests, where nestlings are usually packed in close contact with one another and without much space for movement, except begging. Here we demonstrate that nest features, such as available nest space together with environmental conditions surrounding a nest, influence nestling strategies and behaviours, including social interactions between nest mates, which further leads to fitness consequences. Our results seem to be of great importance for habitat selection theory in birds, in particular regarding the early development of habitat preferences (imprinting) and use. On the other hand, the result may also have important implications for conservation issues given that nestling behaviour may be used as a determinant of environmental quality.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The article describes the influence of voltage dips in the networks of industrial enterprises and their influence on the equipment of industrial enterprises. It is the technological processes that are very dependent on the impact of voltage dips. For which short-term stops, breaks and changes in the speed of technological cycles lead to irreversible losses and a long time for repeated starts. The reasons for voltage dips are given, usually due to faults in public networks or electrical installations of consumers. Voltage dips are the most common power quality indicators that affect the performance of industrial equipment. Power semiconductors equipped with microprocessors, such as inverters, battery chargers and power supplies, which are also vulnerable to voltage sags, cannot tolerate short-term (50-200 ms) sags and power failure followed by voltage reconnection. To make it possible to study the impact, the equipment was grouped according to its sensitivity to voltage dips. The types of equipment are shown according to the maximum allowable duration of the dip. Based on the results of the research, measures were proposed to minimize the consequences of voltage dips in the networks of industrial enterprises. Separately, it was determined that voltage dips lead to inrush current surges, which also negatively affects the supply network, leading to even larger voltage dips, which affects the stability of the operation of other consumers. And as a recommendation for mechanisms of electric motors with light starting conditions, it is recommended to use a pulse-phase control system that allows you to adjust the current limiting settings, and for actuators of drives with severe starting conditions, it is recommended to use a frequency start of synchronous electric motors that can automatically maintain the required torque on the motor shaft and current consumption.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, water utilities have been under pressure to increase the efficiency of their processes, mainly due to the decrease in water availability and the need to increase environmental sustainability in their processes. Leak reduction is clearly an important part of sustainable management in the water industry, and its impacts should be assessed with a broader environmental protection objective. This study aimed to present an environmental and energy assessment of the water supply system (WSS) in Caruaru City, northeast of Brazil, for different levels of water loss. This research is one of the first to assess the environmental impacts of a WSS in Latin America. Primary data adopted for preparing the inventory were provided by the water utility, and modeling and analysis were performed with the SimaPro 8.0® program. Cumulative energy demand (CED) was used to track the energy consumption of the system’s life cycle. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were calculated through the IPCC GWP 100a method with emissions expressed as CO2-Eq. The data sets from life-cycle inventories were used from the Ecoinvent 3.1 database. Four scenarios with different levels of water loss were analyzed. Scenario S0 was represented with the real conditions of the system, whereas the others considered hypothetical indices. The percentages proposed for Scenarios S1, S2, and S3 were based on indices that indicate good loss rate in the distribution network for the Brazilian reality (25%), reduction by half of loss rates, and excellent loss rates for the water pipeline system (5%) and distribution network (10%). The analysis of the processes’ contributions showed that the electricity consumption  of the pumping systems of water mains represented the greatest environmental impact in all scenarios. The most efficient scenario would result in a 52% reduction in the emission of GHGs, demonstrating that the increase in the hydraulic efficiency of the distribution networks represents a significant opportunity to reduce the environmental impacts of the processes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The labor market is a complex socio-economic phenomenon that requires constant monitoring and regulation. There are a significant number of definitions of this concept, which are significantly different and quite harmoniously complement each other. At the same time, scientists use complex, systemic and dialectical approaches. Scientists consider typical models of the labor market: American, Japanese, Swedish and Chinese, which differ in a number of key features and principles of operation. The labor market in the process of formation and functioning performs a number of functions: social division of labor; informational; mediational; professional counseling; regulatory; pricing; proportionality of the distribution of labor in accordance with the structure of social needs and the development of scientific and technological progress; reserve. Herewith, as a separate element of a market economy, it interacts with markets: capital, raw materials, information, educational and scientific services, health care, cultural and spiritual services, household and social services, housing, innovation, etc. The demand and supply of labor, its cost and price are the main elements of the labor market. Labor exists in the labor market as a specific commodity, which is characterized by a number of features different from other products of a market economy. In the process of buying and selling labor, a number of relations arise  between the subjects of the labor market, which constitute a certain system. The ratio of supply and demand of labor, in other words conjuncture of market, are formed under the influence of internal and external factors of the labor market, as well as the level of employment and unemployment. There are three types of conjuncture of labor market: equilibrium, redundant labor and insufficient labor. Labor market conditions are changing due to the natural and mechanical movement of labor and jobs. In Ukraine, the labor market situation is characterized by structural disparities between labor supply and demand, which have become a chronic problem of the national economy. PEST-analysis as a marketing tool should be used to determine the importance of the influence of various factors on the formation conjuncture of labor market. It includes political, legal, economic, socio-cultural and technological factors of the external environment. Market instruments and partly means of active and passive state policy of employment regulation should be used to regulate the labor market. The main regulators will be to remain: the country's legislation, economic laws, the trade union movement and the media, national traditions, mentality, climatic and historical conditions of the country.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The COVID‐19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in upstream pharmaceutical supply chains (PSC). One is that the global supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is overly dependent on few locations and large‐scale batch manufacturing. Regulators hope to enable more dependable location decisions and improved processing quality with the adoption of advanced technologies such as process intensification through continuous manufacturing (CM). Conceptual work suggests that the benefits of shifting from batch to CM accrue end‐to‐end across the PSC. Yet detailed quantitative information about CM is limited at an early stage of evaluation, and too specialised to inform managerial decisions about PSC reconfiguration. Supply chain and engineering criteria are rarely combined in the early‐stage evaluation of alternative CM technologies. Extant CM research typically overlooks implications for supply chain managers. To address the current gap, this article evaluates, at an early stage of adoption, alternative CM reactor technologies for the synthesis of APIs in selected therapeutic areas. With evidence from secondary data, relevant technologies and criteria are identified, and their relative importance is evaluated in a semi‐quantitative fashion following analytical hierarchy process (AHP) principles, ensuring that findings are intelligible to both engineers and managers. The proposed empirical work enriches previous conceptual frameworks predicated on volume‐variety considerations. Specifically, findings suggest that, all things considered, microreactor technologies outperform alternatives. However, PSC managerial considerations introduce nuances in specific therapeutic areas, for example, antivirals where a tension between complex chemistry and the need for flexibility in unit operations may favour batch manufacturing. For analgesics the need to exploit the existing manufacturing base whilst addressing inventory reduction favours technologies that incorporate elements of batch and CM. The proposed analysis is in line with real‐world decisions that global medicines manufacturers are increasingly facing, as governments seek to develop local health countermeasures to the COVID‐19 pandemic in the absence of detailed information.</jats:p>",

It was revealed that phytoplankton becomes one of the main factors influencing the formation of water quality in reservoirs in the warm period from June to November, especially during the period of reservoirs “blooming”. Mostly these processes are triggered by the explosive development of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria). The factors accompanying this phenomenon are shown. The characteristic of the influence of global climate change and new composition of wastewater on water quality in surface water supply sources is given. If earlier the sewage contained significant volumes of heavy metals, oil products, phenols, etc., now they are observed to decrease at several times and vice versa - an increase in the volume of biogenic compounds, especially phosphates is observed. The emergence of phosphates is caused both by the ingress of phosphate fertilizers into water bodies, and by household reasons - the massive distribution of phosphate-based detergents and the inability of existing sewage treatment plants to efficiently process them.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>. During the work [1] it was shown how, thanks to the developed algorithm, it is possible to disconnect consumers in the distributed generation network, with insufficient power at the output of the photovoltaic plant and reconnect them when the power value is sufficient. However, the paper did not pay much attention to switching consumers to the centralized grid and the issue of charging and discharging the battery station. Therefore, when writing this paper, the aim was to study the above issues on the installation of \"Photovoltaic Station\", as well as on the relevant mathematical model. As a result of the study, the process of electricity transmission from the generation facility - the solar station, to the consumption facility - the electric drive was improved. To successfully solve the problem, the following goals were set and solved: to analyze possible ways to switch the consumer to backup power sources; to develop an algorithm for controlling the charge / discharge of batteries; to improve the mathematical model developed earlier in [1]; thanks to the STM32F46NG DISCOVERY board to perform the practical implementation of the accepted theoretical provisions regarding switching algorithms. The purpose of this research is to develop a control system for consumer power supply in the power system. The control of the photovoltaic power plant due to the use of the STM32 board is considered in [2] and [3], the result of these experiments was the practical implementation of automated data collection and subsequent control in the photovoltaic power plant.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The e-commerce platforms have facilitated the information flow of cross-border supply chain (CBSC) and attracted a wide range of companies and individuals to participate in cross-border businesses. The tax costs associated with cross-border commodity flow have received unprecedented attention. However, there is a lack of common platforms between international tax planners and CBSC optimizers, and the impact of various tax policies on CBSC operations is still unclear. To fill this gap, this study presents a literature review to elaborate on the interface between taxes and CBSC operations. First, a literature collection approach is constructed, and 71 pertinent publications are identified. Then, a four-dimensional categorization consisting of supply chain themes, research methodologies, tax types, and illustration types was designed to classify and summarize the research content of the selected articles. The results show that (1) there are six main supply chain-related themes, i.e., the supply chain network, the distribution channel structure, product quantity and quality, production outsourcing, the procurement mode, and supply chain emissions, that are significantly affected by taxes. (2) Four types of taxes, including the corporate income tax (CIT), tariffs, environmental taxes and the value-added tax (VAT), have obvious impacts on CBSC operations. (3) Four mainstream methodologies, i.e., mathematical models, empirical models, conceptual models and simulation models, have been applied to explore the tax effects in CBSC modeling. (4) The tax-saving opportunities in CBSC operations mainly come from the following five areas: CIT rate gaps in different regions, special tax regulations such as the tax cross-credit principle and arm’s length principle, regional trade agreements (RTAs), preferential tax policies and export VAT rebate policy. Finally, this research provides a framework to analyze the trade-offs between taxes and traditional CBSC modeling factors. The results can support enterprises in CBSC in dealing with the complex international tax policies.</jats:p>"

Today instead of the temporary measures aimed at overcoming the effects of pollution, the long-term measures are being taken more and more often at the design and construction stages to nullify the causes of pollution in advance rather than to have its effects in the future. The processes and devices that have been previously used to collect and dispose the industrial waste are now considered a passive approach to environmental protection. The matter is that the amount of waste generated during the production process remains almost unchanged, and this does not meet the new environmental requirements. The active approach involves creating the modern low-waste and non-waste technologies that can efficiently use raw materials in production processes, as well as converting the waste into easily recyclable components that are least harmful to the environment. The article considers the conceptual principles that show the essence of the active approach to improving the industrial technologies in order to protect the environment. It is mainly focused on studying the features of recycled water supply and water purification.</jats:p>",

As a result, they endeavor to transform themselves into intelligent manufacturing. To help with their transformation, this paper proposes a decision support model for managers to improve the business performance under different configurations of supply chain concentration and staff structure. Through the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, the membership degree is given to the variables, and then the configuration analysis is carried out. We find that, to facilitate intelligent manufacturing, the concentration degree of supply chain or the structure of employee education should be adjusted according to the results from the qualitative comparative analysis of fuzzy sets. Two configuration paths to improve business performance are found. When the supply chain concentration degree is relatively decentralized, manufacturing enterprises should expand the proportion of sales personnel and production personnel. In other words, when the sales personnel and production personnel reach the saturation state, low concentration of suppliers and customers is more conducive to the improvement of business performance. The configuration of high proportion of production personnel and low customer concentration tends to lock enterprises in the lower end of the value chain. Therefore, it is critical for enterprises to improve the education level of employees to transform into intelligent manufacturing and improve their business performance.</jats:p>",

We hypothesize that selected genotypes with distinct phosphorous (P) use efficiency covering the breeding history of European Flint heterotic pool provide a tool to reveal general and genotype‐specific molecular responses to P limitation. We reconstructed protein and gene co‐expression networks by weighted correlation network analysis and related these to phosphate deficiency‐induced traits. In roots, low phosphate supply resulted in a decreasing abundance of proteins in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and a negative correlation with root and shoot phosphate content. We observed an increase in abundance and positive correlation with root and shoot phosphate content for proteins in sucrose biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, respiration and RNA processing. Purple acid phosphatases, superoxide dismutase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase were identified as being upregulated under low phosphate in all genotypes. Overall, correlations between protein and mRNA abundance changes were limited, with ribosomal proteins and the ubiquitin protein degradation pathway exclusively responding with protein abundance changes. Carbohydrate, phospho‐ and sulfo‐lipid metabolism showed abundance changes at the protein and mRNA levels. These partially non‐overlapping proteomic and transcriptomic adjustments to low phosphate suggest sugar and lipid metabolism as metabolic processes associated with improved P use efficiency specifically in Founder Flint lines. We identified a mitogen‐activated protein kinase‐kinase as a potential genotype‐specific regulator of sucrose metabolism at low phosphate in Founder Flint line EP1. We conclude that, during breedingt of Elite Flint lines, regulation of primary metabolism has changed to result in a distinct low phosphate response in Founder lines.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the modelling of significant Logistics Service Supply Chain (LSSC) factors affecting oil and gas industry performance in the UAE. Data collection involved the projects of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). The model consisted of six independent constructs, one mediator’s construct and one dependent construct. The six independent constructs are Transport Management; Inventory Management; Order Process Management; Information Flow Management; Agility of logistics service and Integration capabilities of logistics. The mediator construct is logistic information, and the dependent construct is organization performance. The modelling used the AMOS-SEM approach, which indicates the graphical interaction of the factors toward the company performance. The data used to develop the model was gathered through the structured questionnaire survey amongst the selected respondents from the ADNOC oil and gas company in UAE, with a response rate of 90%, indicating strong participation from the population. Total 379 questionnaire forms were collected and used for analysis. The model was constructed according to the conceptual model and assessed at the measurement and structural level of the model. All the individual measurement models achieved the threshold criteria while the structural model reached the required fitness index. Then the model was run for hypothesis testing and found that four of the paths which are Transport Management; Inventory Management; Order Process Management; Information Flow Management have achieved a significant level.

However, the phenomenon of population semi-urbanization is becoming an issue of ever-increasing concern in China. More and more immigrants from rural areas work and live in the city, but their roots remain in the rural area. This paper aims to analyze the influence mechanism of government competition on population semi-urbanization through land supply structure. The study’s theoretical analysis and empirical analysis results are based on the panel data of 105 key prefecture-level cities in China from 2007 to 2017. The results demonstrate that: (1) land finance and land-motivated investment engendered by government competition lead to an imbalance in the land price structure, further increasing the rate of population semi-urbanization; (2) land finance does not lead to population semi-urbanization through the land area structure; and (3) land-motivated investment aggravates the imbalance in the land area structure, further leading to population semi-urbanization. It is found that government competition in terms of achieving performance indicators affects population semi-urbanization by adjusting the land supply structure. Efforts should be made to achieve the coordinated development of urbanization, given that the increasing rate of population semi-urbanization will almost certainly aggravate social instability.</jats:p>"

During operation, however, the boiler may experience an uneven air supply between corners; this deforms the fireball, raising various issues concerning performance and structural safety. This study investigated the characteristic boiler performance and the role of burner tilting in a 500 MWe boiler with secondary air (SA) in two corners that are up to 1.9 times larger than those in the other corners. Computational fluid dynamics simulations with advanced coal combustion sub-models were employed with the following two sets of cases: (i) six cases of actual operation to validate the modeling and (ii) sixteen cases for the parametric study of SA flow ratio and burner tilt between −15° and +26°. The results showed that the uneven SA supply deteriorated the boiler performance in various aspects and the burner tilt can be used to alleviate its impact. With a larger SA supply from the left wind box, the mass flow, heat absorption, and O2 concentration were larger in the right half of the heat exchanger sections owing to the rotating flow. The corresponding imbalance in the reaction stoichiometry increased the peak temperature entering the tube bundles by up to 60 °C and NO emissions by 6.7% as compared with normal operations. The wall heat absorption was up to 19% larger on the right and front walls. The high burner tilt of +26° helped alleviate the impact of uneven SA supply on the heat distribution and uniformity of the flow pattern and temperature, whereas a +15° burner tilt was the least favorable.</jats:p>"

SDBD is driven by sine AC and pulse dual-power supply voltage. The filamentary discharge and glow-like discharge are enhanced by superimposing positive pulse on sine trough and negative pulse on sine crest, respectively. The interval of enhanced discharge is adjusted by pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The formation and decay of surface charges are analyzed at low PRF, and the accumulation effect is analyzed at high PRF. The results showed that the decay rates of charges decrease with increasing distance from the exposed electrode. When a positive pulse is superimposed on sine trough, the traces of positive charges are filaments with long extending lengths, which are the footprints of discharge channels. The lifetime of positive charges is hundreds of AC cycles (tens of milliseconds). Under certain conditions, subsequent glow-like discharge evolves as ‘flying’ above the dielectric surface (three-dimensional (3D) propagation). Most of the negative charges are neutralized in subsequent filamentary discharge. Some negative charges accumulate downstream and exist longer than positive charges. In the case of negative pulses superimposed on sine crest, the enhanced glow-like discharge appears 3D propagation. The propagation distance is much smaller than that of positive pulse. Most of the negative charges are uniformly distributed near the exposed electrodes with a short lifetime (a few hundred microseconds) and are quickly neutralized in subsequent discharges. The occurrence of 3D propagation requires certain conditions and the mechanism needs further research.</jats:p>",

Methods: We analyzed claims data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (January 2014–December 2018). We sampled 20% of 8,379,419 patients aged ≥50 years who were prescribed statins. Among them, we analyzed the data of those who were administered two or more prescriptions for 14 days or longer within 6 months of the initial date of statin prescription. Data on comorbidities and drugs that can potentially reduce BMD were obtained. Osteoporosis-related diagnoses were obtained as an outcome measure. The relationship between statins and BMD-reducing drugs was analyzed using logistic regression.Results: Among the 4,138 statin users aged 50 years or older, 552 were diagnosed with osteoporosis. The most common comorbidity in statin users was hypertension, followed by ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and stroke. The most frequently administered BMD-reducing drugs were proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The osteoporosis diagnosis rate was higher in patients who were prescribed both statins and PPIs or both statins and levothyroxine than in those using only a statin. Conclusion: PPIs and levothyroxine should be prescribed cautiously in statin users and bone densitometry should be proactively performed considering the increased risk of osteoporosis. </jats:p>",

Emphasis is laid on the institutional actors and factors that influence these processes, namely the Three Interrelated Analytic Dimensions and Types of Anchoring. Methodologically, personal interviews were conducted with 34 farmers who either are carrying out SFSC initiatives, or have dropped out, or even have never considered participating in them. A process of anchoring the innovation to the local socio-technical regime has been identified, characterised by a low buy-in from institutions and stakeholders. The anchoring that has been found has the peculiarity of occurring only in some points of the intersection between niche and regime, in a process in which it survives bordering this threshold, thanks to the mobilisation of multiple innovations. This type of anchoring, not yet described in the literature, draws attention to a possible pathway that innovations can follow, and brings implications for projects and for policy proposals to support the agroecological transition.</jats:p>"

Additionally, mixed-N supply promoted the greatest root DW, total root length, and total root surface area and synchronously improved the root absorption capacity of N, iron, copper, manganese, magnesium, and calcium. However, the above nutrient uptake and the growth of maize seedlings supplied with NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> were superior to either NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> or mixed-N nutrition under Zn-deficient conditions. These results suggested that combined applications of mixed-N nutrition and Zn fertilizer can maximize plant growth. This information may be useful for enabling integrated N management of Zn-deficient and Zn-sufficient soils and increasing plant and grain production in the future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Retaining and replacing skilled professionals can be problematic within high-performance construction teams. The onus cascades upon fledgling, inexperienced individuals to embrace these high-stress responsibilities. Previous studies have highlighted the influential role that stress plays as an antecedent to burnout. Emotional fatigue, depersonalisation and a lack of personal achievement all sprout from the burnout syndrome. This project was undertaken as an inductive approach to theory development and employed a cross-sectional survey using a questionnaire.    The study population comprised of construction professionals within the New Zealand construction industry. Convenience sampling was used to collect data from 266 New Zealand Site Safe members and their industry partners utilising a survey software called Qualtrics to address the research question. Through the use of a Likert scale, the mean values of the data were used to construct a table that incorporated combined stressors and their stress reduction strategies. “What stresses do construction professionals experience and what recommendations can be concluded to change workplace behaviour to reduce burnout?”  The data was then used to construct a table that incorporated combined stressors and their stress reduction strategies. This research identified the contributing stress factors and their respective remedies to make changes in the New Zealand construction environment. The findings noted that various factors within the different clusters were indicative of high workplace stress, the strongest cluster being individual job demands. Other clusters highlighted factors such as managerial behaviour, organisational leadership and the economy as significant contributors. Transparent and clear communications between all staff levels proved to be the strongest moderating factor as a stress reduction remedy. The respondents indicated that a change in their sleeping patterns also created fatigue that leads to burnout. The contribution of this paper and contribution of this research lies in presenting the most significant current stressors in the New Zealand construction industry and aligning them with stress reductions strategies.</jats:p>"

To optimize the effectiveness of government crisis communication, this paper puts forward an analytical perspective of supply–demand matching based on the interaction between the government and the public. We investigate the stage characteristics and the topic evolutions of both government information supply and public information demand through combined statistical analysis, text mining, text coding and cluster analysis, using empirical data from the National Health Commission’s WeChat in China. A quantitative measure reflecting the public demand for government information supply is proposed. Result indicates that the government has provided a large amount of high-intensity epidemic-related information, with six major topics being the medical team, government actions, scientific protection knowledge, epidemic situation, high-level deployment and global cooperation. The public’s greatest information needs present different characteristics at different stages, with “scientific protection knowledge”, “government actions” and “medical teams” being the most needed in the outbreak stage, the control stage and the stable stage, respectively. The subject of oversupply is “medical team”, and the subject of short supply is “epidemic dynamics” and “science knowledge”. This paper provides important theoretical and practical value for improving the effectiveness of government communication in public health crises.</jats:p>"

Mexico’s planning, like that of other countries, includes flexible mechanisms such as offsets. Offsets allow market participants to compensate for their emissions through mitigation projects. Offsetting via participation in the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation was fundamental to the Kyoto Protocol. In contrast, the Paris Agreement is ambiguous about its use. Other national or regional offset programs, such as the EU, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, or Korea, work within emission trading systems. Subnationally, the California-Quebec program has been in effect since 2014. As Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) are global, offsetting allows market participants to compensate for their emissions through mitigation projects, whether domestically or abroad. Given their global scope, such programs present a wide variability in quality. This chapter presents an overview of offset programs worldwide and argues that non-additionality, overestimated supply, and double counting are their three most pressing quality problems. This analysis sheds light upon the nascent Mexican system and its offset program.</jats:p>"

To achieve project objectives, team competency and skills are required, which are viewed as attitude, aptitude, versatility, and knowledge. Based on organisation control theory, current research (quantitative in nature) discusses the influence of team competency and skills on construction risk management with the moderation role of government Acts, laws, and policies among 303 large-size contractors working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using PLS-SEM technique. PLS-SEM is a composite-based approach that provides high efficiency parameter estimation with increased statistical power for analyzing complex models. Results depict that government Acts, laws and policies and team competency and skills positively influence construction risk management. In addition, moderation of government Acts, laws, and policies has positive relation among team competency and skills and construction risk management. Organisational management can reduce risk occurrence within a project by building conditions for enhancing team competency and skills.</jats:p>"

One important task is to timely detect and localize anomaly events, which may include, but not be limited to, pipe bursts and unauthorized water usages. In this paper, a comprehensive solution framework has been developed for anomaly detection and localization by formulating and integrating data-driven analytics with hydraulic model calibration. Data analysis for anomaly detection proceeds in multiple steps including the following: (1) data pre-processing to eliminate and correct erroneous data records, (2) outlier detection by statistical process control methods and deep machine learning, and (3) system anomaly classification by correlation analysis of multiple sensor events. Classified system anomaly events are subsequently localized via hydraulic model calibration. The integrated solution framework is developed as a user-friendly and effective software tool, tested, and validated on the selected target areas in Singapore.</jats:p>",

The research paper elucidates that post-shock of Covid- 19, understanding religious tourism enablers will provide opportunities to all the stakeholders of this chain. Eleven enablers for the religious tourism supply chain were identified. The modelling of these enablers using ISM (Interpretive Structural Modelling), provides insight into their hierarchy and interdependence upon each other. The ISM model also illustrates that the enabler Pilgrims belief and value, a mandatory obligation is the most crucial enabler and influence all other enablers.

As an immediate impact of COVID-19, farmers around the globe have had difficulties with sales, resulting in large amounts of overstocked agricultural products and food loss. This further threatens the livelihood of rural, poor farmers and impacts sustainable production. To provide a better understanding of the overstocking situation after the outbreak of the pandemic, this study depicts the distribution characteristics of overstocked agricultural products in China. After analyzing a nationwide data set collected from 3482 individuals/organizations by the Chinese Agri-products Marketing Association after the outbreak of the pandemic, we found that some of the initial prevention and control measures disrupted sales channels, and in turn, caused the farmers to suffer losses. The impact was more severe in perishable products and their production areas, as well as in poverty-stricken regions. Then, we identified China’s quick and effective actions to match the supply and demand. These findings suggest that emergency responses should coordinate the relationship between emergency actions and the necessary logistics of agricultural production. To prepare for the possibility of such shock in the future, the government should take actions to clear logistics obstacles for necessary transportation, keep enhancing the fundamental infrastructure and effective mechanism of the food supply chain, and actively include innovative techniques to build a more resilient food system.</jats:p>"

Branch joint shunting generates vortices in the fluid, which excite the pipe wall to produce a type of branch noise. The branch noise is coupled with the leak source signal through the pipe. Here, a novel leak location protocol based on the complex-valued FastICA method (C-FastICA) is proposed to address the leak location problem under the branch noise interference. The C-FastICA, a complex-value domain blind deconvolution algorithm, effectively extended the cost function, constraint function, and iteration rules of the instantaneous linear FastICA into the complex-valued domain. The C-FastICA method was used to realize the separation of branch noise and leak source signal. The experimental results showed that the separation efficiency of the C-FastICA was higher than that of time-domain blind convolution separation (T-BCS). Furthermore, the relative location error of the C-FastICA method to the leak point was less than 14.238%, which was significantly lower than in traditional T-BCS and direct cross-correlation (DCC) technology.</jats:p>",

A mean-variance framework and a network equilibrium analysis are integrated to provide a modeling framework. The model allows for the investigation of how bank credit financing (BCF) and trade credit financing (TCF) affect the payment strategy and financial flow of interconnected firms in supply chain networks and how they are affected by interest rate risks. The optimal behavior of manufacturers and retailers is described through variational inequality. We construct a supply chain network equilibrium model and derive qualitative properties of the solution and the function that becomes assimilated to the variational inequality problem. Additionally, variational inequality is solved using the modified projection method. This study extends the research on the impact of interest rate risk on the decision in supply chain network of firms. While other studies focus on the game between banks and firms, only a few authors have made attempts to examine the game between one manufacturer and one retailer in supply chain. An effective trade credit strategy is obtained by balancing cash and credit transactions. Through the case study, we learn how to balance the capital flow effectively to improve the negative impact of interest rate risk on supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of the surface treatment of wood products is not only to protect them, but also to make them attractive in relation to the visual aspect through their colour modification. It is therefore important that manufacturers of wood and furniture products pay particular attention to the supply of colour tones of wood. According to colours, wood is divided into groups: red woods (oak, cherry, pine, alder, etc.), brown woods (elm, ash, walnut, etc.), pale woods (hornbeam, spruce, fir, etc.) and green woods (acacia, etc.). The main objective of this paper is to identify the supply of colour tones of wood and furniture products of Slovak micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. An empirical survey was used to map the researched issue in the form of a questionnaire. The results show that Slovak micro, small and medium-sized woodworking and furniture enterprises prefer the quality of wood raw material to its price. At the same time, they mostly manufacture products made of solid wood. Where it is necessary to modify the colour of the wood, enterprises use a process of staining, which enhances the natural colour and grain of the wood. On the other hand, due to the lack of investment capital, they cannot use hydrothermal treatment of wood steaming, which is considered a modern way of modifying the colour tone of the wood. It is essential that Slovak micro, small and medium-sized woodworking and furniture enterprises constantly adapt their production supply in the changing market environment, where they must respond immediately to current trends. In this way, they can sustain and increase their turnover, which will help them overcome the current crisis.</jats:p>"

However, many of its natural sources are impacted by anthropogenic activities, such as mining. Water is intimately linked to public health and is essential to achieving sustainable development. It is necessary to preserve water resources by designing and validating monitoring programs that help control the quality of the sources that supply important population centers. The study area in this research is the upper part of the Milluni micro-basin, whose lagoon system supplies water for two large cities. Milluni is close to illegal and abandoned mining areas, making the region highly vulnerable to heavy metal contamination. This study aimed to optimize the resources available for monitoring Milluni. The frequency of monitoring was statistically determined, and the correlation between parameters measured in situ (pH and conductivity) and metal ion concentrations to determine low-cost indicators to monitor the presence of heavy metals. A multivariate analysis of friction of the results of the pilot year of the monitoring program designed for Milluni, considering the characteristics and economic limitations, is presented. An approximation of the quality of the surface water resources of Milluni is presented as a result of the monitoring operations.</jats:p>"

On this basis, we compared the average household electrical energy consumption of urban and rural residents based on the data from CGSS-2015 from a micro perspective. The results show the positive correlation between carbon emissions per capita and the human development index and China’s regional imbalance characteristics between household electricity consumption and renewable energy distribution. Therefore, the distributed energy supply system is proposed as an effective complement to centralized power generation systems and is the key to synergizing human development and carbon emissions in China. Moreover, we analyzed the characteristics of distributed energy supply systems in the context of existing energy supply systems, pointing out the need to fully use solar energy and natural gas. Finally, two types of typical distributed energy supply systems are proposed for satisfying the household energy requirements in remote or rural areas of western and the eastern or coastal areas of China, respectively. Two typical distributed energy systems integrate high-efficiency energy conversion, storage, and transfer devices such as electric heat pumps, photovoltaic thermal, heat and electricity storage, and fuel cells.</jats:p>"

As groundwater has slow seepage, directly observing the seepage velocity and recharge path of groundwater in the aquifer is difficult. Environmental isotope technology has become an important means to clarify the mechanism of groundwater movement and the mechanism by which groundwater recharges from the micro and macro perspectives. The Changwu area of Jiangsu Province was taken as an example to identify the recharge sources of groundwater and the recharge paths of groundwater and surface water by using the measured data of isotopes D, 18O, 34S, and T. The results indicated that the shallow aquifer and the I confined aquifer in the Changwu area are mainly recharged by precipitation and surface lake water. The II confined aquifer along the Yangtze River is recharged by modern precipitation. Moreover, the II confined aquifer in the Henglin area was recharged by the ancient Yangtze River before 4,000 years ago, and no recharge relationship exists now. the recharge condition of the II confined aquifer around the northwest of Gehu Lake is in the climate environment of 8,000 years ago and was caused by the surface depression lake water at that time. Additionally, the concealed limestone aquifer is primarily supplied by the II confined aquifer, while the concealed sandstone aquifer supplies the II confined aquifer. Hence, to find out the recharge conditions of groundwater aquifers based on the environmental isotope is conducive to scientific and reasonable evaluation of groundwater resources and to ensure the sustainable development and utilization of groundwater resources.</jats:p>",

Several strains of FLA are known to be pathogenic. As of date, there is inadequate data on the geographical distribution of FLA in northeastern and northern Iran. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and genotype distribution of Acanthamoeba and Naegleria in drinking water and surface water samples in northern and northeastern Iran. A total of 60 water samples were collected and filtered from various sources for the presence of amoebae. DNA extraction was performed, and PCR confirmed the presence of FLA. PCR products were sequenced to identify the species/genotype. Phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic status constructed using MEGA X software. The findings on growth media showed 35% (21/60) and 26% (16/60) were positive for Acanthamoeba and Naegleria, respectively, while PCR analysis also obtained similar results. All isolates of Acanthamoeba were identified as T4 genotype. Poor water quality, as well as insufficient preservation and treatment, might indicate that chlorine disinfection is ineffective in removing contamination of amoebas in treated water samples. Therefore, regular water quality monitoring is essential to control amoeba's growth, reducing the risk of human infections with FLA.</jats:p>",

Specifically, the effects of the calcined serpentine (Csrp) dose, reaction time, pH, and temperature on the removal performance of F−, Fe2+ and Mn2+ on Csrp were analysed. An isothermal adsorption model and adsorption kinetic equation were established and confirmed through SEM, EDS, XRD and FTIR spectroscopy to analyse the mechanism of removing F−, Fe2+ and Mn2+ by Csrp. The results show that when 3 g/L Csrp was used to treat water samples with 5 mg/L F−, 20 mg/L Fe2+, and 5 mg/L Mn2+ (pH of 6, reaction temperature of 35 °C, and time of 150 min), the removal rates of F−, Fe2+, and Mn2+ were 94.3%, 99.0%, 98.9%, respectively. The adsorption of F−, Fe2+ and Mn2+ on Csrp follows the quasi-second-order kinetic equation and Langmuir isotherm adsorption model. After five cycles of regeneration of Csrp, Csrp can still maintain good properties of fluoride, iron and manganese removal.</jats:p>",

The concentrations of nutrients (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total organic matter) and heavy metals (As, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Ni, Hg, Cd) were investigated. Spatial distribution, correlation analysis and source identification were facilitated to indicate nutrient and heavy metal pollution characteristics. Evaluations of heavy metals’ contamination degree were achieved by comprehensive ecological risk indexes including Igeo, Iin, Cf, pollution load index and risk index. The results showed that nutrients accumulated in the middle region and were mainly from embryophyte, zooplankton and phytoplankton or algae, based on C/N values. Large spatial variabilities existed in heavy metal distribution patterns; source identification for heavy metals revealed they were from natural sources and anthropogenic activities based on a principal component analysis model. Results of different ecological risk indexes showed that pollution associated with Hg was rated as a moderate ecological risk but was significant contamination, higher ecological risks mainly existed in the middle region.</jats:p>",

Hydrodynamic characteristics of intake are crucial to safe and stable operation. In this study, a 3-D numerical volume of fluid model was established and validated through experimental tests. Hydrodynamic characteristics and secondary flow were investigated under scenarios with the vertical slope and different slope ratios. The helix-shaped recirculation and surface vortex are generated, and the secondary flow near the surface layer is more serious. Adding a slope ratio is beneficial to improve the flow patterns and recirculation, while the surface vortex width increases. Additionally, with the decrease in the slope ratio, recirculation width and the ratio of recirculation to the width of the layer decrease, and the minimum values are 9.19 cm and 22.97%, respectively. However, the lower the slope ratio is, the greater the recirculation inhibition effects, and the more serious the surface vortex. With the decrease in the slope ratio, the widest surface vortex width and the ratio of the widest surface vortex to the width of the layer increase from 6.1 to 12 cm and from 7.82 to 17.14%, respectively. This research represents an advance in lateral withdrawal and provides support for further designs.</jats:p>",

In the dynamic batch mode water supply system, cyanobacterial EPS accelerated the decay rate of residual chlorine, resulting in a 21–26 times increase of the total viable bacteria count within 72 h. The water turbidity exceeded upper limit of the standards for drinking water quality within 4 h, with an increase of 306–332% within 72 h. The biological stability was reduced with BDOC and AOC increased by 41.4–43.8% and 331–396%, respectively. The main cause is that cyanobacterial EPS act as nutrients and metabolic energy for microorganisms, promoting their metabolic activity and secretion of extracellular organic components. This leads to the metabolic accumulation of tryptophan, fulvic acids and humic acids in the pipeline, thus further promoting the regeneration of bacteria. Compared with the influence of biofilm on pipe wall caused by long-term use of water supply network, the contribution of cyanobacterial EPS to the water contamination of pipe network is increased several times. Therefore, even in the presence of residual chlorine, the secondary contamination caused by cyanobacterial EPS in the water supply system could not be neglected.</jats:p>"

Films were prepared using the solvent casting technique from ethanol solution. Their physicochemical properties were investigated using structural, morphological, and thermal techniques. Polar and dispersive components were analyzed using two models to evaluate the effects on the surface free energy values. The antimicrobial activity was proven using a disk diffusion method and the suppression of bacterial growth was confirmed via a growth kinetics study with the Gompertz function. The films’ morphological characteristics led to systems with uniform distribution of essential oils or eugenol droplets combined with a flat-plated structure of monolaurin. A unique combination of polyphenolic eugenol and amphiphilic monoglyceride provided highly stretchable films with enhanced barrier properties and efficiency against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and molds.

There is little information available in the literature regarding information preference from an individual’s need perspective, and there is a lack of differentiation in evaluation between information need and supply. Under the guidance of the crisis stage analysis theory, using multiple response analysis and weighted analysis methods, this study explores earthquake disaster information content and communication channel preferences, and develops an information deviation index (IDI) to evaluate the efficiency of risk communication before, during, and after an earthquake. A questionnaire-based survey of 918 valid respondents in Songyuan, China, which had been hit by a small earthquake swarm, was conducted to provide practical evidence for this study. The results indicated the following. Firstly, the information needs of individuals are highly differentiated in the different stages of an earthquake. From pre-disaster to post-disaster, individuals show a shift in information need from “preparedness and response knowledge” to “disaster information”, then to “disaster information and disaster relief information” in parallel, to “reconstruction and reflection information”. Based on the above analysis, a composition of the main earthquake disaster information is proposed for different stages. Secondly, by measuring the values of the IDI, we found that most individuals’ information needs were met for the earthquake. Thirdly, the TV and the internet were the two preferred commutation channels for acquiring disaster information from among all the effective channels in all the stages.</jats:p>"

We develop and solve six games to consider the scenarios (games) where prices and marketing efforts (ME) are decided simultaneously, and when they are not (i.e., ME is set either before or after prices). We examine these three scenarios for the benchmark case of a bilateral monopolistic channel, then extend the analysis to a supply chain with competing manufacturers. We identify the optimal decision timing by comparing equilibrium profits and strategies across games in each supply chain setup. We find that a monopolistic manufacturer always prefers that prices and ME be decided simultaneously. However, this result does not hold when product competition is taken into account. The optimal decision timing for competing manufacturers depends on the retailer's and manufacturers' ME effectiveness levels as well as on competition intensity. Specifically, when ME are not very effective, a simultaneous decision scenario is preferred because it provides the advantage of higher profit margins or sales. However, for highly effective ME, manufacturers prefer to decouple ME and pricing decisions. The retailer's optimal scenario is either to make all decisions simultaneously or to choose prices prior to ME. This means that supply chain firms can face conflict due to the decision timing for prices and ME.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The projection of the hot water thermal load of the district heating system’s consumers is developed. It is shown that the total heat load of centralized hot water supply systems in Ukraine today is about 3.0 GW. It determines the full potential of maneuvering power of electric heat generators to provide ancillary services to a power system. Moreover, due to the decline of the Ukrainian population and the decrease of demand for thermal energy, it is expected to decline in the future and will reach 1.9 GW in 2050 (down 36.6% compared to 2020). During the non-heating period, under market conditions, it is expected that heat-generating technologies will compete with each other for the ability to supply heat water to the district systems. The solar collectors will be excluded from the market competition as they do not require a fuel, and therefore their use during the non-heating period is the most profitable. Another technology that will be in use is biomass boilers, their minimum reduced weighted average lossless price of thermal energy (Marginal Levelized Price of Energy - MLPOE) is 102 UAH / Gcal. Gas cogeneration technologies also have a great chance to use their thermal capacity (MLPOE - 258 UAH / Gcal), heat pumps (MLPOE - 155 UAH / Gcal), electric boilers (MLPOE - 633 UAH / Gcal) and gas boilers (MLPOE - 964 UAH / Gcal) will also be used. The analysis of different options for providing ancillary services to the power system showed that considering the competition among technologies, the most feasible option is to involve CHP equipped with electric heat generators. This option allows performing both daily regulation of power and load of power system and also regulation during the system’s night minimum load. At the same time, the balancing power for the current situation is about 1.3 GW for daily control and 1.4 GW for regulation during the night minimum load Keywords: structure of heat generation, heat-generating technologies, heat load, power system, schedule of electric loads, night failure, power, heat pumps, electric boilers, CHP</jats:p>",

This study assessed the critical factor influencing the choice of sustainable building materials (SBM) selection on construction projects in the Southeast geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Data were collected using a well-structured questionnaire, non-probability (purposive and snowball) sampling techniques, and an internet-mediated survey. Data analyses were carried out using the appropriate descriptive and inferential statistical tools and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The study revealed recycled plastic, natural clay and mud, stone, bricks and tile, cellulose, stray bales, grasses, limestone, and wood timber, are the commonly used sustainable building materials. Also, their level of awareness is high while their adoption is moderate. EFA revealed that the major clusters of determinants of the choice of green building materials are: emissions minimisation, low running cost and reusability, low thermal and energy consumption efficiency, low cost and high health and safety consideration and waste minimisation. The key factors influencing the choice of sustainable building materials selection in construction are: reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, materially embodied energy cost, operating and maintenance costs, non-toxic or low toxic emissions generated by the products/materials, recyclability of the building materials, availability of the technical skills, renewable (reusable) properties, inhibiting the impact of buildings on the environment, safety and health of the occupants, and appearance and aesthetic. It is recommended that consideration be given to these factors in selecting sustainable/green building materials in the designs and specifications of construction projects.</jats:p>"

Materiales y métodos: Siete puntos de abastecimiento de agua se analizaron durante la temporada de lluvias de 2019. Se determinaron los parámetros fisicoquímicos siguientes: pH, sólidos disueltos totales, conductividad eléctrica, dureza, sólidos totales, cloruros y demanda química de oxígeno (DQO). La escorrentía superficial se estimó con los métodos Raws y Prevert. Resultados y discusión. Las aguas se encuentran dentro de los límites permisibles para uso humano. El agua del manantial de Chacalapilla se clasificó como moderadamente dura (85 mg CaCO3∙L-1), mientras que la de los siete cuerpos acuíferos excedió el límite permisible de DQO (40 a 200 mg∙L-1); por tanto, el agua se encuentra en un rango de clasificación contaminada y no es apta para consumo humano. Los valores de escorrentía superficial sugieren un estado medio de conservación de la cobertura vegetal; las áreas con mayor cobertura registraron coeficientes menores de escorrentía. Conclusiones.

This study adopts the technology-organization-environment model to provide a holistic framework to examine the key factors contributing to the success of business analytics projects. Method. The paper develops a survey questionnaire consisting of thirty items on eight constructs, based on previous studies from cognitive-experiential self-efficacy, information technology mindfulness, technology-organization-environment, and information systems success theories. A total of 236 actual users in twenty organizations participated in the study. Analysis. We employed structural equation modelling with partial least squares to test the proposed hypotheses. Results. Our analysis shows that openness to novelty, the rational cognitive thinking style, organizational compatibility, organizational readiness, and data connectivity have a positive effect on the active use of big data analytics systems. Data compatibility does not emerge as a strong antecedent for frequency or duration. The active use of these types of applications is a mediating factor that can significantly improve individual job performance. Our findings provide insights into the user’s relative value, as well as organizational and data factors that can be used to promote big data analytics systems in an organization. Conclusions. Our findings strongly suggest that such an integrative approach can help an organization understand the challenges of promoting big data analytics to use and improve employees' job performance.</jats:p>"

We analyze two green technology investment structures in such supply chains: one where the manufacturer determines the optimal carbon emission abatement level (MI-structure) and one where the retailer determines the optimal carbon emission abatement level (RI-structure). As the leader (the powerful participant or the first mover in a supply chain), the manufacturer may choose the investment structure that is most favorable to them. Our major findings are as follows: (1) carbon subsidies can improve the performance of a centralized green supply chain; (2) there exists a threshold value of carbon subsidy that determines the manufacturer’s choice of the best carbon emission abatement investment structure, but the retailer always benefits from RI-structure; and (3) the traditional cost-sharing contract fails to achieve green supply chain coordination. However, as an orchestrator, the carbon subsidy plays a crucial role in achieving quantity coordination when implemented alongside traditional cost-sharing contracts. Furthermore, using a parameter of side-payment, we propose a new contract design that facilitates win-win coordination.</jats:p>",

But a massive bone defect remains a dilemma for modern reconstructive surgery. Present methods used have a high level of morbidity and complication. Literature indicates the absence of an optimal solution in massive bone defects healing. The aim of this study: to perform an in vivo preliminary study of vascularization of the hind limb in the rabbit model, for obtaining a graft able for further inclusion in the host blood circulation, without immunosuppression by decellularization. Material and methods: The study was performed on the 12 laboratory rabbits. After euthanasia of the rabbit, the femoral and tibiofibular bone was collected without soft tissue, only with the vascular pedicle, and keeping the passage through the vessels. In the abdominal aorta was injected contrast material, with the subsequent preparation of the arterial vessels, succeeded by anatomical, morphological, radiography, and microangiography study of this vascularized bone segment. Results: The principal nutrient artery of the rabbit femur springs from the lateral circumflex femoral artery. The optimal segment for vascularized allografting (the rabbit model) was determined the upper third of the femur with the up to the level of the internal iliac artery. So, it could be used as a bone graft for further conservation and decellularization. Conclusions: The vascularized allogeneic bone without immunosuppression would be a perfect alternative in the treatment of the massive bone defects.</jats:p>"

The emissions reduction in the supply chain operation has become a hot issue in supply chain management. Thus, this paper studies the optimal cap setting and pricing in chain-to-chain system under carbon emissions trading mechanism. Based on the double decentralized scenario, the five different cooperation models are established by introducing the structural cooperation and the contractual cooperation (the wholesale price contract) of supply chains. The optimal solutions of these models are obtained through the Stackelberg game and Nash game. The results show that the bargaining power of the supply chains is changed by the asymmetric competition structure.

The quality requirements that must be followed by suppliers require permanent monitoring of processes of design, development, production, installation and service of products through audits qualified based on supply chain management. This paper presents an analysis of the supplier qualification process including the main phases as follows: evaluation, monitoring and auditing of suppliers in supply chain management. Internal quality audits and/or suppliers are one of the key instruments for ensuring sustainability and performance in supply chain management. Auditing of suppliers is a core component of the modern management of suppliers, with the help of which the customer can analyze precisely relevant processes to existing or potential suppliers. Supplier audits help both commercial partners to increase the transparency of the supply chain and also simplify supplier selection, evaluation, monitoring and development. The suppliers must meet the highest quality standards for products and processes. The main purpose of this paper is to give a general view of the supplier qualification process which involves the steps from initial identification until the inclusion of the supplier in the Approved Supplier List (LST). This list should be managed in such way that a complete traceability is assured. Following the proposed qualification diagram the customer can obtain an image about the status of one supplier, can also identify the weak points considering the evaluation, monitoring and audit class.</jats:p>",

Methods The measurement of SAF has become a non-invasive method of assessing the accumulation of AGEs as a marker of the long-term impact of glycemic and oxidative stress in humans. In contrast to blood glucose and to hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), which reflect a short period of glucose levels, the AGE is a marker of the metabolic legacy effect and reflect a long period of glucose levels. AGEs play a pivotal role in the development and progression of diabetic complications. SAF has been validated as a simple, non-invasive method for assessment of AGEs accumulation in the body. Results In this study 100 diabetic patients were participated. We non-invasively measured SAF, in all the participants using the AGE Reader (DiagnOptics Technologies BV, Groningen, The Netherlands). We also measured the body mass index (BMI), the blood pressure and the patients underwent arterial duplex sonogram (Doppler examination) in the legs at the level of the ankle and calculated the ankle-branchial index (ABI), which is an important index for diagnosing peripheral artery disease, which is a severe complication of diabetes. The SAF was positive correlated with age, duration of diabetes and systolic blood pressure (BP) and was negative correlated with ABI. Conclusion The measurement of SAF has become a non-invasive and reliable method of assessing the accumulation of AGEs in humans. In contrast to blood glucose and to HbA1c, which reflect a short period of glucose levels, the AGEs reflect a long period of glucose levels, correlate with certain metabolic parameters and with peripheral artery disease.</jats:p>"

Mean square error (MSE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were applied for model evaluation. The results indicated that ZSG could better optimize the parameter adjustment process of models, and improved generalization ability of models. The generalization ability of the bidirectional model was superior to that of the unidirectional model.

Tree species diversity of Pegunungan Bintang, Papua, Indonesia as potency of wood supply. Biodiversitas 22: 5645-5655. The tropical rainforest is a primary global concern in many aspects. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the tree diversity in Pegunungan Bintang Forest, Papua, Indonesia. There are 10 dominant species from seedlings, saplings, poles, and trees, indicating the timber production potency. This study set systematic plots in Murkim and Teiraplu Sub-districts to collect taxonomic information, diameter, and clear bole height samples. The results showed that the forest was categorized as a tropical mixed due to diverse tree species. The leading plant families included Moraceae, Myrtaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, and Anacardiaceae, with various seedlings, saplings, poles, and trees. The potency of timber was reflected through sample distribution using the reverse J-shaped curve, identifying the merchantable trees with larger and smaller diameters as re-established. However, timber utilization management requires silvicultural treatments using selective logging by diameter limit and logging cycle for forest sustainability.</jats:p>"

It is particularly important to make a scientific assessment of the comprehensive capabilities of the port and to provide a reference for the long-term development of the port. From the perspective of the supply chain, this article first selects the evaluation indicators that affect the port’s capabilities from four aspects of port resource ownership, control management, comprehensive services, and innovation-driven aspect. Secondly, we use the expert scoring method to judge the importance of the evaluation indicators and build a scientific and independent port capacity evaluation system from the perspective of the supply chain. Then, this paper uses the analytic hierarchy process to determine the weight coefficients of each evaluation index and uses the gray cluster analysis method of the triangular whitening weight function based on the center point to establish a qualitative and quantitative port capacity evaluation model from the perspective of the supply chain. Finally, we take a port in Northeast Asia as an example to conduct an empirical analysis to verify the feasibility of the port capacity evaluation system and model from the perspective of the supply chain constructed in this paper. The research results of this article can well analyze the port’s resource ownership, control and management capabilities, comprehensive service capabilities, and innovation-driven capabilities and provide a practical and effective theoretical basis for the port’s key development directions.</jats:p>",

These have been mainly based on polymer constructs, which may be non‐biodegradable or biodegradable. The former typically fails due to lack of device integration and the latter demands a complex balance between biodegradability and tissue ingrowth, often failing due to insufficient mechanical properties. This work presents the development of hybrid braids based on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polylactic acid (PLA) yarns. A textile technique was used to fabricate braids based on 16 multifilament yarns of varying PLA/PET composition. The composition was varied to maximize biodegradability while ensuring mechanical performance. The braids' morphology, physical and mechanical properties were characterized. As production parameters and architecture were maintained, the braids exhibited similar porosity and wicking ability. The breaking force and stiffness decreased significantly as the number of PLA yarns increased, although strain levels remained constant. Braids containing 10 and 12 PET yarns (out of the total 16 yarns) demonstrated good creep and force‐relaxation behavior, as well as resistance to cyclic loading. These compositions were selected for future work, to be assembled into more elaborate structures to mimic the fibrous organization and tensile properties of different tendons/ligaments.</jats:p>",

However, in order to be efficient, these are often limited to water quality and require it to not exceed a certain threshold of physicochemical and microbiological contamination. Additionally, some popular HWTs, such as chlorination, are related to by-product formation. Preoxidation may improve source water quality, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an oxidant that has not been deeply explored in this specific application, so it could be an innovative approach to HWTs. We investigated effects of H2O2 preoxidation in two natural source waters (surface and groundwater), spiked with a high level of microorganisms. Clarification results suggested this pretreatment may improve life of HWTs. Reduction in microbial load of groundwater was considered ineffective, but 5-min H2O2 preoxidation at 15 mg L−1 led to &amp;gt;4.0 log10 inactivation of Phi X174 coliphage and &amp;gt;3.0 of Escherichia coli in surface water. We believe this performance was increased due to the presence of catalysts in the river water. This raised the point that water quality may be not only impairing, but potentially beneficial to the main HWT and characterization is crucial prior to the implementation of any technologies.</jats:p>",

Seven samples from SA and seventeen samples from CA were analyzed to depict the hydrochemical characteristics, categorize the hydrochemical facies, evaluate the hydraulic connectivity, and appraise the drinking water and irrigation water quality. The abundance of cations is Na+ &amp;gt; Ca2+ &amp;gt; Mg2+ &amp;gt; K+ and the anions is HCO3− &amp;gt; SO42− &amp;gt; Cl− in both aquifers, respectively. Groundwater chemistry is controlled by water-rock interactions such as halite dissolution, ion exchange, reverse ion exchange, silicate weathering, and followed by the dissolution of Glauber's salt. The low connectivity and moderate connectivity between these two aquifers has engendered. The majority of the ion concentrations are within the limit for drinking, only one sample from the shallow aquifer was greater than the limit of 250 mg/L, a total of 29% from the shallow unconfined aquifer and 14% from the confined aquifer are not within the limit of 250 mg/L. The sodium absorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC) and soluble sodium percentage (%Na) values reveal that all the samples are appropriate for irrigation uses. The the US salinity laboratory (USSL) diagram shows that sixteen CA samples and all the SA samples fall in the C3S1 zone, implying high salinity hazard and low alkalinity hazard.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of the article is to describe a method for developing pedotransfer models for predicting soil moisture supply within an agricultural landscape on sloping, eroded lands (in Luhansk region) during different stages of the growing season of agricultural crops. The models are based on calculating the coefficient of moisture deficit in the soil or the coefficient of moisture content (for April) — predictors. The following factors were used as predictors in pedotransfer models: the amount of precipitation during the growing season; soil moisture coefficient in April; Hydrothermal coefficient; coefficient of normalized atmospheric precipitation for the cold period; humus content in the layer 0-20 cm; soil washout coefficient; the bulk density of the soil in the layer 0-20 cm; height on the profile; coefficient of protective action of forest belts; coefficient of agrobackground. The initial information is a systematized set of data — hydrological characteristics of agricultural landscapes and soil properties, partially published by the authors earlier in the guidelines. The method of pedotransfer modeling of soil moisture supply on slope lands includes sequential mathematical and statistical analysis (using GIS technologies) according to the following thematic stages: (i) selection of factors affecting soil moisture supply as predictors of pedotransfer models; (ii) cluster analysis of the efficiency of soil moisture supply factors in the catchments of the agricultural landscape; (iii) development of pedotransfer models of soil moisture supply based on fragments of the growing season of crops by constructing regression equations and assessing the adequacy of the models by statistical criteria. The models are developed taking into account the phases (periods) of organogenesis of crops and the sequence of agrotechnical measures in the soil protection system of agriculture. It was found that among the studied factors, the most influential factor in predicting the soil moisture supply in any period is the agrophone factor, the share of which in different models ranges from 46 to 89 %. At the same time, the share of the influence of the natural factor of humidification — the Hydrothermal coefficient, is limited to the range of 10–17 %. It is shown that according to the results of predicting the moisture deficit in the soil, the territory of the agricultural landscape can be conditionally divided into working areas for the development of a differentiated system of practical agrotechnical measures to correct the supply of plants with productive moisture.</jats:p>",

Digital water networks provide a means of technical support, and their application is becoming more extensive. Based on the traditional study of water resource allocation combined with the development of modern information technology, this paper proposes a new operational application model of multi-objective water resource allocation based on a digital water network and applies this model to allocate water resources in the Heihe River basin in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. First, a topological digital water network is constructed based on the connectivity criterion of water systems, and a cooperative configuration model with social, economic and ecological objectives is established. Second, the model and its solution method are componentized, and the water resource allocation business system is constructed based on the comprehensive integration platform to integrate the digital water network and the water resource multi-objective allocation business. Finally, to verify the scientificity and feasibility of the new model, the new model was applied to allocate water resources in the Heihe River basin of Xi'an city, Shaanxi Province.</jats:p>",

Supplementary pricing strategy and competitive pricing strategy are simulated in our model, and we find that the former one is the better choice for the manufacturer when the retailer suffers capital constraints. In our analysis, the capital constraint on retailer could mitigate the price competition between two channels, and it may be beneficial to the manufacturer under certain conditions. Our findings show that the manufacturer should strategically provide trade credit to retailers rather than unconditionally provide it. We present two trade-credit strategies (trade credit with positive interest rate and trade credit with zero interest rate) and suggest that the manufacturer should choose an appropriate trade-credit strategy according to the initial capital of the retailer. To guide the manufacturer when and how to provide trade credit, we conduct several numerical simulations based on our results and further plot out a graph to direct the manufacturer to an appropriate strategy of trade credit.</jats:p>",

However, the current water resources allocation theory is immature, and there are few objective and quantitative allocation methods, which leads to the relatively backward allocation practice. Moreover, the amounts of allocable water resources change dynamically, which makes the static and single traditional allocation scheme difficult to adapt to changes. To address the above issues, this research comprehensively integrated multiple types of allocation models to build a multi-method integrated simulation system for water resources allocation. The results show that the system supports visually generated schemes and dynamically simulates water resources allocation. The application of the simulation system enhances the reliability of results. And the dynamic adaptability of allocation results supports allocation decisions.</jats:p>",

After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi's policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Courts were required to adopt new methods, techniques and devices obtained through advancement of science without affecting the original intention of law. Because of modern technology, a benefit could be taken from said technology to preserve evidences and to assist proceedings of the Court in the dispensation of justice in modern times. Owing to the scientific and technological advancements the admissibility of audio and visual proofs has grown doubtful. No doubt modern evidence assist the court in reaching out to the just decision but at the same time certain criteria need to be laid down which must be satisfied to consider such evidence admissible. Different Case laws are discussed here to show how the cases were resolved on the basis of technological evidence and when and why such evidence have been rejected by the court, if it did. Moreover, legal practices developed in various countries allow our Courts to record evidence through video conferencing. The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases statement of juvenile rape victims and other cases of sensitive nature must be recorded through video conferencing to avoid inconvenience for them to come to the Court. Nevertheless, it has some problems. The most important among them is the identification of the witness and an assurance that he is not being prompted when his statement is recorded.

Qualitative content analysis was used as a methodology to carry out the study. To collect the data, a checklist based on Revised Bloom’s taxonomy was used as an instrument. A total of 260 reading comprehension questions from both the textbooks were evaluated. The findings of the study revealed that reading comprehension questions in English textbook for grade 10 were solely based on remembering level (100%) whereas the questions in Oxford Progressive English 10 were mainly based on understanding level (75.5%) with a small percentage of remembering (12.5%), analyzing (11.1%) and evaluating level (0.74%). This suggests that the reading comprehension questions in both the textbooks are dominantly based on lower-order thinking skills.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

Malthusian view postulated as dependency ratio adversely affects economic growth while Julian Simon's view is quite different, highlighted the long-run benefits of the population in the range of 5 to15 years on economic growth. This study can be a valuable addition in research to analyzing the association of dependency ratio and economic growth of the five most populated Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, India, and Pakistan). Empirical findings of the study indicated that a total dependency and younger dependency ratio has a positive and significant influence on economic growth in both short-run and long-run scenarios while the old dependency ratio shows a negative influence on economic growth in the long run while short-run results are unpredictable. There is a need for state-based proper policy measures in focusing the higher financing in human capital development specifically in education and health.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of power but in reality Pakistan’s army is the most powerful institution in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources is the key variable in creating dichotomy. The structure of domestic politics is based upon the principles of hostility to India, use of Islam for national unity and strategic alliances with major powers to finance defense against the neighboring countries.

In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

Althusser believes that ideology is a belief system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning. These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture and society.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Daughters became curses and liability for parents causing serious consequences. For control, there are legal ban/restrictions (Dowry and Wedding Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976; Amendment in Act, 1993) on its practice in Pakistan. Despite the legal cover, the custom has been extended. Dowry amount seems to be increasing due to changing lifestyle and trends of society. To understand males’ and females’ perceptions about dowry; impacts of dowry; why dowry is essential; and how it is affecting women’s rights and eventually affecting women’s autonomy. A qualitative study was conducted.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities' powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.
