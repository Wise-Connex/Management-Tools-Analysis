These embraced a broad commitment to economic planning, especially focused on a National Investment Board, and a major expansion of the nationalized sector. By these means Labour aimed at providing greater economic and social security on the basis of full employment, greater industrial efficiency, and the creation of a welfare state. The 1945 manifesto Let us Face the Future broadly followed the ideas of the 1930s, but also reflected the legacy of war. On the one hand the war gave new urgency to some objectives, e.g. housing; on the other it had created a comprehensive system of economic controls which seemed to fit Labour ‘s commitment to planning.</jats:p>",

In the past, allocation of storage capacity to municipal and industrial water supply and associated sponsorship arrangements have been an integral part of the process of planning and constructing new federal reservoir projects. More recently, cities and other municipal and industrial water suppliers are increasingly viewing storage reallocations and related operational modifications of completed federal reservoir projects as potential sources of supply for meeting growing water needs. Demands on existing facilities will continue to intensify in the future.

Historical fire report data are used to develop statistical summaries of fire regimes in terms of annual fire occurrence and area burned by administrative district and region. A simple hypothetical jack pine forest is used to illustrate how forest level timber harvest scheduling models can be employed to assess the timber supply implications of fire management regimes. Although fire may have had a significant detrimental impact on timber supply in some parts of the Northwestern region during the 1976-88 period, the effectiveness of Ontario's forest fire management system is such that timber supply in most districts has not been significantly diminished by fire. The results of our timber supply analysis, and the fact that fire management also benefits public safety and reduces property loss, suggest forest fire management is profitable in Ontario.

The exception is for higher‐income market economies, where supply‐driven and demand‐driven determinants of urban growth are shown to alternate with long‐wave periodicity: During epochs of structural transformation following stagflation crises, supply‐driven determinants dominate; during periods of technological diffusion following deflationary depressions, demand factors come to the fore. But for middle‐ and low‐income nations, whatever the cross‐section and timespan, Tolley's hypothesis is not supported: Coefficients have the wrong sign, suggesting that urban growth is greatest when there are the greatest relative gains in rural productivity, but are statistically insignificant. The need is demonstrated for an urban growth theory that is substantially broader than normally has been modeled, with dynamics that are firmly grounded in an understanding of the periodic structure of economic macrohistory.</jats:p>",

Numerous hypotheses have been generated to explain hatching asynchrony, but most experiments have focused on the nestling stage to determine some post—hatch benefit such as increased reproductive success. We concentrated on proximate causes in the prelaying period, which have largely been ignored. In northern Saskatchewan, we censused prey species (small mammals) in early spring and measured the asynchrony of 273 clutches of the American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) over 4 yr. Hatching asynchrony was quantified in two ways: time for all the eggs within a clutch to hatch and mass hierarchies among nestlings. In good food years, the hatchling spans of clutches were more synchronous than in poor years. Similarly, parents on good territories or females in good physical condition had more synchronous broods than parents under food stress. In an experiment, we supplemented food to kestrels during the prelaying period. Parents that were supplemented laid larger eggs and hatched those eggs more synchronously, but control pairs were more successful at raising young to the fledging stage. Synchronous hatching when food is abundant is consistent with the hypothesis of facultative manipulation of hatching spans in relation to nestling food supply, but not with the energy constraint hypothesis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, Hakim (1991) has argued that women's choices and decisions are a key determinant of labour market behaviour and patterns of gender segregation. Drawing on a case study of women scientists and engineers, this paper examines the extent to which horizontal segregation is the product of preference and planning. The evidence suggests that the women's choices were a significant factor in entering the technical professions. However, from predominantly middle‐class families, coming from single‐sex schools, the women were able to specialize in technical subjects and to withstand pressure to change their decisions. Their subsequent occupational positions were the product of these educational choices rather than well‐formulated career plans. Their involvement in their employers' schools/industry liaison policies highlighted that the majority of young women do not consider professional science and engineering as an appropriate job for them. The findings of the study illustrate that preferences and plans are made in ‘gendered’ social contexts in which women face different opportunities and constraints in exercising their decisions. While the study of women's attitudes and behaviour should not be neglected, sociologists should be wary of voluntaristic accounts of gender segregation which rely on rationalistic notions of labour market behaviour.</jats:p>",

Among the most important are research experience, “good match” factors, and writing skills. Among the least important are ability to speak a language other than English, geographical origins of applicants, and “legacy.” Few differences were found between selection committee members from clinical/counseling programs and experimental programs, underscoring the importance of undergraduate research opportunities and adequate faculty advising. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>This article takes as its starting point the overwhelming concentration of Bangladeshi women in the homeworking sector of the clothing industry in London. This pattern forms a contrast to the large numbers of male Bangladeshi workers also concentrated in the garment industry but who are to be found mainly in the factories and sweatshops. The article uses the accounts given by the Bangladeshi homeworkers themselves for their concentration in this form of work to explore different theoretical explanations of female labour supply behaviour, focusing in particular on questions of choice and constraint, culture and economy.</jats:p><jats:p>The study suggests that the ‘preferences' revealed by the labour market behaviour of Bangladeshi women cannot be attributed solely to them, but must be seen in terms of bargaining and negotiation with other, more powerful members of the family. Furthermore, the intra‐household decision‐making process is itself embedded within a broader institutional environment which determines the access enjoyed by different groups to socially‐valued resources. For Bangladeshis, a key factor in this broader environment is the operation of racially‐based forms of exclusion from the mainstream opportunities. Consequently, community solidarity and networks represent important symbolic and material resources for members. However, these resources are distributed in highly gender‐specific ways, with very clear implications for women's place within the community. The article argues therefore that any attempt to explain Bangladeshi women's concentration in homework has to move beyond a focus on either individual circumstances or cultural norms to an exploration of the interaction of racism, community identity and gender relations in shaping women's labour market options.</jats:p>",

They foraged preferentialiy on muddy rather than sandy substrata, but their distribution could not be explained on the basis of substratum penetrability. The density of visually foraging Grey Plovers was correlated with the biomass, rather than abundance, of the larger of the two common nereids on the estuary. The favoured foraging area of Grey Plovers had a high vegetation cover, but their foraging dispersion was not influenced by substratum type.</jats:p><jats:p>The energy intake rates of Curlew Sandpipers were broadly inversely related to their foraging density, although the rate of prey capture was maximal at high prey density.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To evaluate the impact of internal mammary artery harvesting on sternal blood supply after open heart surgery, a conventional bone scan was performed 7 days after operation in 30 patients. After administration of 370 MBq of technetium 99 m-medronic acid complex, imaging was carried out at the level of the sternum and including the humerus as a reference. A quantitative analysis of uptake (sternum/humerus uptake index) was performed and compared in three different groups of patients: group A, ten patients who had only vein grafts or valve surgery; group B, ten patients with single internal mammary artery harvesting; and group C, ten patients with bilateral internal mammary artery harvesting. These results were compared with 24 non-surgical subjects as a control (group D). Although intervention had a significant influence in raising the uptake index of the surgical groups (A = 3.34; B = 3.09 and C = 3.48) when compared with normal subjects (D = 2.45) ( P&lt;0.01), there was not a statistically significant difference among the three surgical groups ( P&gt;0.05). It was concluded that the vascular supply of the sternum is not entirely dependent upon the internal mammary arteries and that mobilization of both vessels does not cause per se additional serious impact to the bone vascularization after midline sternotomy, at least beyond day 7 after operation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Paired, serial blood samples were collected for a minimum of 6 hr to a maximum of 15 days from cannulae chronically placed in the internal carotid artery (A) to the brain and the anterior cardinal sinus (V) from the brain of the spiny dogfish shark (<jats:italic>Squalus acanthias</jats:italic>). Previously fed animals were fasted for either 3 to 8 days (short‐fasted) or 20 to 29 days (long‐fasted) before the surgery to implant the cannulae and during the subsequent sampling periods. Plasma β‐hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, glucose, lactate, and alanine levels were measured by standard enzymatic procedures. The internal carotid artery plasma β‐hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate levels were in the approximate ratio of 4 to 6:1, were greater in the long‐fasted than in the short‐fasted animals, and both ketones increased throughout the observation periods. In contrast, plasma lactate and alanine levels declined by postoperative day 2 to levels that, like glucose, remained relatively stable and were characteristic of the individual animal. The A‐V metabolite differences between the short‐ and long‐fasted animals were not significantly different and the data from the two groups of animals were combined for purpose of analysis. β‐Hydroxybutyrate was extracted from the plasma by the brain during both the surgery and recovery period (⩽ 2 days) and the “normal” <jats:italic>under the observational conditions</jats:italic> period (&gt; 2 days). The small negative A‐V differences in acetoacetate during both periods, and in glucose during the &gt; 2 day period, were not statistically significant. There were no evident A‐V differences in plasma alanine. Lactate was released by the brain during both the ⩽ 2 days and &gt; 2 day periods. The uptake of β‐hydroxybutyrate and the release of lactate indicate that the spiny dogfish brain used both β‐hydroxybutyrate and glucose during the observation periods. The data suggest that the plasma was the immediate source of β‐hydroxybutyrate, but, as proposed by previous authors, the proximate glucose source may have been provided by the mobilization of endogenous brain glycogen stores. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",
