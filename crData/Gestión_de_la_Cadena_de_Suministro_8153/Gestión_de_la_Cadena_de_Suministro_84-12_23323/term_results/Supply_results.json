The price and quantity adjustments predicted by the model are found to be well supported by the historical experience with one important exception. Immigration played a far greater role in the Australian case than has been suggested in the theoretical literature. The model does, however, allow for a compact description of the confusing decade in Australian history and explains a number of previously unconnected phenomena.</jats:p>",

The present experiments show evidence of an additional manifold higher oxygen supply due to a gas transport in leaved as well as leafless trees of Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertner. This gas transport is directed from the stems to the roots. It is driven by a thermo-osmotic pressurisation within the air space system of the stems, resulting from temperature gradients up to 3.6 K between the stem and the ambient air following the absorption of light energy by the brownish pigments of the bark. This gas phase phenomena appears to enable the alder-trees to survive and grow in wet soil resulting from a high water table or in waterlogged soil.</jats:p>",

Water supply is identified for effective field water, which sets the upper bound on water available for plant use. Georgescu-Roegen process analysis concepts are merged with the neoclassical theory of cost as the underlying framework. The approach is illustrated for a permanent overhead system used in a Florida citrus grove. The marginal cost for the 2.54 centimeters application depth dominates all other depths for the higher water levels. Process analysis is an important analytical tool for increasing understanding of the features of irrigation water supply.</jats:p>",

The model is cast explicitly in terms of theory of consumer behavior, allowing the estimation of price subsidy rates under the demand‐side strategy, that would yield the same welfare improvement as the Section 8 program. The results indicate that neither the latter strategy nor the former clearly dominates in terms of traditional goals of low‐income housing policy. The increases in housing consumption induced by the demand‐side strategy, while less than those from the supply‐side strategy, are significant, and are accompanied by substantial reductions in housing affordability problems (rent burdens). It is shown that anywhere from .63 to 2.16 additional households could have been served for each household served under the Section 8 program, with the demand‐side strategy, at no additional cost to the taxpayer.</jats:p>",

Many of the dominant trends in the development of improved equipment and processes during the last decade have been associated with the control and treatment of this essential resource. Typical examples include the strong links between water conservation and most of the effective ways of saving energy, improvements in effluent treatment plants to minimise the impact of water‐borne contaminants on the environment, exploitation of the possibilities for reuse of process water or treated effluent in further processing, as well as the direct objective of holding in check the rising contribution of water supply and effluent treatment to limit overall costs. This broad expanse of water, pure and impure, is surveyed from the viewpoint of the textile dye user, since, by virtue of the physical and chemical properties of textile dyes, he is also invariably a continual user of water.</jats:p>",
