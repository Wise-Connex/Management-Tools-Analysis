Before developing the theoretical model, some evidence about government reaction functions for selected OECD countries is presented. The main theoretical results can be summed up as follows. A fiscal policy based on a tax‐financed increase in government transfers to firms makes the country more competitive internationally, but reduces employment. Only when the increase in government transfers to firms is financed by the public debt is the fiscal policy able to achieve its two‐fold aim of greater competitiveness and a higher level of employment.</jats:p>",

We use a two-stage estimation procedure and a specification that models individual and familial factors that influence the labor supply of all women and those unique to immigrants. The analysis, based on a sample of Hispanic immigrant wives obtained from the 1980 U.S. Census, examines immigrant wives of Mexican, Puerto Rican and Other Hispanic origin and compares their labor supply with that of their native-born counterparts and U.S.- born white wives. Results indicate that the labor force behavior of Hispanic immigrant wives is highly responsive to their earning potential and, unlike that of U.S.-born white wives, is less constrained by their familial role as mothers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The importance of integrating policies concerned with the demand and supply of labour within growing regions has long been recognized. However, there are important theoretical deficiencies associated with orthodox methods. In the traditional approach to operational urban and regional models it is claimed that the relationship between labour demand and labour supply is functional and one sided, that is, the growth of labour demand causes population growth and leads to an assured level of labour supply. However it is argued that in the development of regional labour-force policies aimed at recognized objectives, estimates of the number and characteristics of persons available to the labour force are at least as important as estimates of the structure of labour demand. A change in the traditional theoretical framework is therefore necessary to allow for the influence of a particular population structure upon the supply of labour—in aggregate as well as to different occupational submarkets. Presentation of a more independent treatment of methods aimed at estimating the ‘availability’ (and the ‘requirements’) of labour also allows for the possibility, and consequences, of imbalance in the labour market to be recognized. </jats:p>",

Life‐history parameters were measured in cohorts from hatching to senescence in a range of constant food treatments (0.2–7 <jats:italic>µg</jats:italic> Chl <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> liter<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and in two pulsed treatments that cycled between 0.5 and 2.0 <jats:italic>µ</jats:italic>g Chl <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> liter<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at periods of ~0.5 and 1.0 d. A flow‐through culture system minimized biochemical and grazing‐induced changes in food supply and allowed automated measurement of food levels (fluorescence). Particulate carbon, nitrogen, lipid, carbohydrate, and protein were measured also. Results show that even the “food‐sensitive” copepod, <jats:italic>C. typicus,</jats:italic> can integrate daily fluctuations in food supply at amplitudes comparable to patchiness levels observed in the field. This finding has important implications for field and laboratory studies that relate zooplankton growth and fertility to ambient food supply. Additional new findings include exponential growth in body length, sustained high fertility with age, ingestion of large algal and animal prey, and low contribution of carnivory to the diet. Comparisons with field data suggest that <jats:italic>C. typicus</jats:italic> is restricted to shelf regions due to food limitation, but that on the shelf it is a major contributor to total copepod production in the fall.</jats:p>",

Special attention was given to differences in labor force participation, labor supply, and quantities of labor supplied and demanded across rural and urban areas. Once state effects were accounted for, decisions to change participation were found not to vary by urban-rural designation. Differences in demand were fully captured by an intercept shifter and the variations in hours supplied by married females between urban and rural areas. Labor supply varied greatly with the effects of key determinants (number of children, work force experience, family income) being strongly different in rural areas. Different policies are needed to promote female labor supply in rural areas as opposed to urban areas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this work on vascularization of digital nerves, we have studied the anatomy of the deep network of venae comitantes of digital arteries, and the system of superficial palmar venules. 22 specimens of nerve and artery were dissected as one unit and were infused with Microfil prior to study under the microscope. The deep venous network, a satellite of the digital artery, can be classified into four types. A true network of deep venae comitantes exists in three of these four types, drained by deep veins arising from the transverse anastomotic arches between the palmar digital pedicles. Vascularization of the digital nerve is supplied by numerous anastomotic vessels connecting epineurial vessels, digital artery and the periarterial network (venae comitantes and vasa vasorum). This anatomical configuration lends itself to vascularized nerve grafting; for example, it is possible to use a nerve/artery graft taken as a unit from an amputated finger unsuitable for replantation. Two types of valves in this superficial venous network have been identified and their function is discussed. </jats:p>",

The theoretical part of the paper uses the two‐period consumption harvesting model to introduce nonlinear income taxes into the forest management problem and presents a simple method to determine the optimal supply of roundwood in this case. In the empirical part of the paper, the model is specified in a way suitable for econometric analysis. The estimation method is the maximum likelihood method, and the estimation results seem to support the theoretical model. Finally, some results from model simulation imply that income taxation may have a nonnegligible impact on the supply of roundwood.</jats:p>",

Two experiments are reported in which white clover (<jats:italic>Trifolium repens</jats:italic> L.) was used to supply the nitrogen requirements of the cereal. Spring barley, spring oats and winter barley were direct drilled into an established clover crop and grown with the legume as an understorey. The yield of whole crop cereal, for ensilage, and yield of cereal grain were similar to those grown by traditional methods. In the first experiment, clover survived adequately to be used again, but in the second experiment it was killed by a very high slug population. A method of slug control by mob stocking with sheep is discussed. Where clover survived, no weed, insect or disease problems were encountered. The technique offers a possible method of reducing the environmental problems arising from the use of nitrogen fertilizers.</jats:p>",

Total diet intakes were 710, 873, 1054, 843 and 1021 g dry matter per day for control, SBP20, SBP40, B20 and B40 respectively. The intake of straw was depressed significantly with SBP40 and B40 (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05). Rumen pH and ammonia concentration decreased, and total volatile fatty acid concentrations increased (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) with increasing level of supplementation for both supplements. Rumen liquid outflow rate was affected little by the supplementation although this measurement for B40 was significantly higher than that for the other treatments. Microbial protein supply, estimated from urinary excretion of purine derivatives, increased significantly with the increasing amounts of supplements (4·5, 6·7, 8·5, 7·1 and 9·0 (s.e.d. 0·73) g N per day for control, SBP20, SBP40, B20 and B40 respectively) (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05). The calculated efficiency of microbial protein production was 12·8, 14·2, 14·3, 15·7 and 14·5 (s.e.d. 1·45) g N per kg digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) for the five treatments. Although this value was lowest with the control, differences between treatments were not significant (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0·05). It seems that microbial protein yield per unit DOMI for a diet based on ammonia-treated straw could not be improved substantially by supplementation with sugar-beet pulp or barley.</jats:p>",
