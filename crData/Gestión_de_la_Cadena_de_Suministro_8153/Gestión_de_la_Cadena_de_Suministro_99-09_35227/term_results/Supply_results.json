In this article, the authors explore the approaches of sample firms in the chemical and automotive industries to the outsourcing of manufacturing. Based on clinical research done with companies participating in IMD's Manufacturing 2000 project, the authors conclude that the outsourcing of manufacturing is not a panacea, but rather a strategic choice, which is business dependent. In the cases where it is pursued, the need for firms to focus on the managerial challenges of selecting appropriate partners for the long term and building and nurturing a mutually rewarding relationship is stressed. Setting and realizing an aggressive improvement agenda is required by each partner to make the necessary transformations to sustain the relationship in the long term.</jats:p>",

This study focused on assessing the effectiveness of the company's minority supplier development program, in terms of the outcomes of the program for minority suppliers, and examining potential barriers to success. Data were collected using a survey questionnaire mailed to minority‐owned suppliers. The suppliers’ responses were grouped on the basis of three variables: (1) sales volume, (2) percentage of the supplier's sales to the firm, and (3) length of the supplier's business relationship with the firm. Responses were analyzed to determine whether supplier size, sales percentage, or relationship length were significantly related to the perceived quality of the relationship.</jats:p>",

Two hundred seventy‐one senior managers responded to a mail questionnaire regarding purchasing and supplier involvement in process development/improvement in anufacturing, service, not‐for‐profit, and government organizations. Factor scores of the research variables were analyzed using t‐tests to assess the effects of process as a source of competitive advantage, purchasing involvement, and supplier involvement on process development/improvement practice and strategy. Contingency table analysis with the chi‐square statistic was used to assess the effects of industry category. It was found that processes contribute to competitive advantage, purchasing plays a major role in process development/improvement, and that purchasing and supplier involvement contributes to process development/improvement in all industry categories. These contributions are greatest in manufacturing. The implications of this research to purchasing professionals, researchers, and academicians are discussed.</jats:p>",

The data collected were factor analysed and the results suggest that purchasing objectives are affected by the firm's corporate competitive strategy. More important, purchasing can yield better business performance through greater integration with other functions, closer partnership with suppliers, and greater involvement in team decisionmaking.</jats:p>",

Many experts agree that concurrent product development (CPD) across the supply chain is the next significant challenge in design for manufacturability. Effective management of this process is a key to achieve superior time-to-market and life cycle quality. Drawing on a recent Global Supply Chain Seminar at Stanford, the paper first surveys the challenges faced by various companies ranging from electronics and automotive to aircraft engines. From the survey emerges some key and common issues that these, companies face: cultural barriers, product definition and joint product development practices. The paper then identifies the need for a systematic tool to achieve robust development strategies under uncertainties associated with global partnerships. A proposed robust development approach includes strategies such as key tuning parameters and functional redundancies. The paper concludes by presenting an idealized CPD process and future research agenda.</jats:p>",

In a pilot project at Texas A&amp;M University, faculty and graduate students in the Agricultural Economics Department used ArticleFirst, PapersFirst, and EBSCOdoc as a substitute for traditional interlibrary loan. Participants could order materials not owned by the three university libraries. Four document suppliers, the British Library Document Supply Centre, EBSCOdoc, ISI’s Genuine Article and UMI were used. Users were allowed to select the vendor and method of delivery which included fax, mail, Ariel, and express mail. Data gathered included the usage patterns for the different delivery methods and document suppliers, the costs of items, problems encountered by users, and general information on user satisfaction.</jats:p>",

If concurrent engineering (CE) in tiered supply chains is to be fully implemented, a practical CE strategy needs to recognise that successful, concurrent designs are built on rich relationships amongst all parties. Virtual teaming is the most appropriate framework and mechanism in which to examine how such relationships can be created across a distributed supply chain, with members separated geographically. In principle, virtual teaming could allow joint commitment, feelings of mutuality, trust and creativity, and rapid decision making to operate within a supply chain. For this to be possible, a virtual team needs to be built by concentrating on process, teaming and technology factors. However, experience from other IT‐based initiatives is that technology will be concentrated on to the exclusion of other factors. Data from the two sources support this contention.</jats:p>",

These policies seem to be able to support both the changing demands for qualifications of IT professionals and the growth needs of these specialists. The changing demands concern, amongst others, the ability to deal with information technology, business processes and business strategy issues in an integral way. Actually, however, most IT companies mainly focus on solving, in the short term, their demand for human resources in a quantitative sense. It is argued that addressing the qualitative problem by means of a strategic training policy, will, in the long term, also solve the quantitative side of the match. This training policy, which stresses the learning processes of young IT professionals and “learning from each other”, is related to the concept of the “learning organization”.</jats:p>",

The capabilities of CFAR exceed those of the traditional EDI because CFAR allows exchange of complex decision support models and manufacturer/retailer strategies. The proponents of CFAR claim that the fastest way for retailers and manufacturers to slash inventory costs and product shortages is by coordinating their decisions. The impact of CFAR on the supply chain using a model consisting of a manufacturer selling its product through two independent identical retailers is analyzed. The model assumes that the manufacturer doesn't face capacity constraints, the demand is stationary, and retailer prices are constant over time; the shortages are backordered at the manufacturer and retailers to isolate the effects of information sharing in CFAR. The most significant findings relate to the increase in the cost incurred by the nonparticipant in CFAR, the increase in the manufacturer's cost of serving the nonparticipant if the participant can obtain delivery guarantees in return for demand information sharing, and the incentives of the players to move towards universal retailer participation in CFAR. The findings are explained using the risk structure faced by the players in the supply chain. The managerial implications of the impact of CFAR on the supply chain structure are also discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There are three possible outcomes following the undertaking of BPR projects. First, a BPR programme may fail in the short or long term either because it is improperly implemented or because there is no effective follow‐up. Second, a BPR programme may be deemed satisfactory in outcome yet still does not appear to significantly improve bottom‐line performance. Finally, there is the BPR programme which is highly successful and significantly improves the bottom‐line performance. It is identifying the last category which is the subject of this paper. In our view, to maximise the probability of making a major impact on the supply chain bottom line, BPR programmes should be planned to have adequate SCOPE. This is a three‐dimensional model of the change process with breadth, depth and width axes. Our approach to evaluating BPR impact is illustrated by application to the product delivery process of an electronics products supply chain. The prediction of improved performance is demonstrated via a dynamic simulation model of a real‐world supply chain as a function of the particular implementation phase of the BPR programme. The eventual improvement in performance obtained after a number of years progress is very significant. Indeed, in material flow terms, it is now a structurally much improved, robust and internationally competitive supply chain.</jats:p>",

The case study describes supply chain scenarios that involve prime with contractors, subcontractors and consulting entities. The core activity within these scenarios is an engineering analysis of Printed Wiring Boards (PWB) with a focus on modeling product analysis data. Analysis of PWB can involve an iterative process that translates to changes to the product data. Application protocol 208 [STEP, Part 208/CD] is an underdeveloped part of the STEP standard and deals with product life cycle and change management. These changes are incorporated into the case study scenarios and the capability of AP 208 to capture them is evaluated.</jats:p>",

The model was demonstrated for a typical case of industrial pollution: 10,000 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> airstream contaminated with 1.5 g m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> toluene. The effects of nitrogen (as nitrate) loading on the pollutant elimination capacity and on the rate of biomass growth were considered. Using model simulations, the influence of the nitrate loading on the overall treatment cost was quantified and an optimum nitrate loading was determined. The results suggest that biotrickling filtration is very competitive compared to conventional treatment technologies. For the case studied, a treatment cost optimum was obtained at a nutrient loading of 8 g N‐nitrate per cubic meter bed volume per day. This represents a relatively severe nutrient limitation. The range of nutrient loading for cost effective treatment was about 4 to 30 g N‐nitrate m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Overall, the approach presented herein is widely applicable for the determination of the best reactor design and the optimum reactor operating conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Agent-based technologies can be applied to many aspects of supply chain management. The need for responsive, flexible agents is pervasive in this environment due to its complex, dynamic nature. Two critical aspects of agent capabilities are the ability to (1) classify agent behaviors according to autonomy level and (2) adapt problem-solving roles to various problem-solving situations during system operation. Sensible Agents, capable of Dynamic Adaptive Autonomy, have been developed to address these issues. A Sensible Agent’s “autonomy level” constitutes a description of the agent’s problem-solving role with respect to a particular goal. Problem-solving roles are defined along a spectrum of autonomy ranging from command-driven, to consensus, to locally autonomous/master. Dynamic Adaptive Autonomy is a capability that allows Sensible Agents to change autonomy levels during system operation to meet the needs of a particular problem-solving situation. This paper provides an overview of the Sensible Agent Testbed and introduces an example supply chain management domain with a scenario showing how this testbed could be used to simulate agent-based problem solving.</jats:p>",

Self-limiting growth, in which the growth rate is independent of the injection time and the pressure of TEI and TBP, was achieved at a growth temperature as low as 320 °C. The growth rate of around 0.75 ML per cycle in self-limiting growth was assumed to be due to stable surface reconstruction of (2×4)-β. A specular surface morphology was obtained in the self-limiting growth condition. By analyzing the limitation of the growth rate as well as the surface morphology of the layer, self-limiting mechanisms were proposed with respect to suppression of the TEI decomposition on the indium surface during TEI injection, suppression of the phosphorus dissociation from the InP surface during TBP evacuation, and complete reaction between TEI and TBP during TBP injection. The growth condition range for self-limiting growth was expanded with the increase in TBP dosage which was defined as the multiplication of injection time and injection pressure.</jats:p>",

The blood flow increase (antidromic vasodilatation) elicited by inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) stimulation was not affected by ongoing repetitive CST stimulation over the frequency range examined (0.2–10 Hz), although reflex parasympathetic vasodilatation was attenuated. The vasoconstrictor responses elicited by IAN stimulation in some preparations were reduced in a frequency-dependent manner (at 0.2–1 Hz) during ongoing CST stimulation (and replaced by vasodilator responses). The vasoconstrictor response evoked directly by brief CST stimulation was attenuated, but not transformed to a vasodilator response, by ongoing CST stimulation. Thus in the cat lower lip 1) sympathetic stimulation attenuated one type of vasodilator response (parasympathetic-mediated vasodilatation), but not another (antidromic vasodilatation), and 2) ongoing sympathetic (CST) stimulation at low frequencies (&lt;1 Hz) prevented further sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction. </jats:p>",

The concentrations of nitrogen in plants generally decreased as the supply of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> increased.

Tissue blood volume changes in the nasal mucosa, induced by xylometazoline hydro‐chloride nasal spray, were evaluated with this method. It was found that quantitative imaging provides sensitive, reproducible, and reliable means for the monitoring and mapping of tissue blood supply and is easy to use routinely. The results showed that saturation decreases with time, being the most sensitive color parameter to the vasocon‐striction procedure. It appears that objective indexes for optical tissue characterization and analysis may be promising in the understanding of the pathophysiology of tissue changes and in the objective evaluation of their response to different therapeutic schemes.</jats:p>",
