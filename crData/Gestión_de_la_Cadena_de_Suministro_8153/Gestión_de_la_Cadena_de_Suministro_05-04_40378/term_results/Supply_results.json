      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Deployment of interorganizational information technology (IT) throughout supply chain networks has usually been championed by supply chain network leaders — large firms that typically dominate a supply chain network. In order to participate in a particular network, supplier firms must acquire the requisite IT enabling them to be technologically aligned with the network leader. This is an important decision for supplier firms that are typically smaller in size and must allocate larger portions of their budgets to acquire the necessary IT. This study evaluates the benefits gained by suppliers when investing in interorganizational IT that is aligned with their primary buyer or network leader. The findings show that IT alignment between supplier and buyer has a direct positive impact on both strategic and operational performance measures of the supplier. In addition, IT alignment impacts these performance measures indirectly as it encourages integration between firms.</jats:p>",

This calls for greater strategic and operational cooperation between buyer and supplier firms, often involving some degree of collaborative planning. Advances in information technology are making it possible for firms to share planning information more quickly and easily. This study surveyed purchasing executives whose firms are involved in collaborative planning with suppliers to examine several factors that support effective planning and the impact that effective collaborative planning has on performance in the buying firm. The results show that effective collaborative planning is dependent on the level of trust and the quality of information shared between firms.</jats:p>",

However, supply chains to indirect material suppliers were not usually included due to low transaction volumes, low product values and low strategic importance of these goods. Dedicated information systems for streamlining indirect goods supply chains have emerged since the late 1990s and subsequently have faced a broad diffusion in practice. The concept of these e‐procurement solutions has also been described broadly in the literature. However, studies on how companies use these e‐procurement solutions and what factors are critical to their implementation are only emerging. This research aims to explore the introduction of e‐procurement systems and their contribution to the management of indirect goods supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Chooses a two‐part qualitative approach.

IL-23, a cytokine produced by dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (Mфs), stimulates T cells to produce interleukin-17 (IL-17), which stimulates neutrophil production. Noting that strains of mouse that lack adhesion molecules (which have defects in neutrophil trafficking) exhibit neutrophilia, Stark\n            <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>\n            hypothesized that DCs and Mфs--which phagocytose apoptotic neutrophils--monitor the numbers of neutrophils reaching peripheral tissues and provide a feedback mechanism to regulate production. Fluorescent labeling revealed that wild-type neutrophils were more likely to undergo phagocytosis than were those from CD18\n            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>\n            mice when injected into the same recipient mice. In mice that lacked CD18 or the endothelial selectins (which were neutrophilic), IL-17 mRNA abundance in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), spleen, and elsewhere was increased, as was the percentage of total T cells that produced IL-17. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (BMDC)-conditioned medium stimulated production of IL-17 by CD18\n            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>\n            splenocytes, as did Mф-conditioned medium, an effect that was blocked by an antibody to the p40 subunit of IL-23 and attenuated by coculturing the BMDCs or Mфs with apoptotic neutrophils. Adoptive transfer of wild-type but not CD18\n            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>\n            neutrophils into CD18\n            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>\n            mice reduced the enhanced expression of IL-23 in MLN, as well as the numbers of circulating neutrophils and the serum IL-17 concentration; moreover, antibody to the p40 subunit of IL-23 reduced the numbers of circulating neutrophils. Thus, the authors propose that neutrophil phagocytosis--and a consequent decrease in IL-23 production--acts as a negative feedback mechanism to regulate neutrophil production.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            M.

This paper tries to describe the development path of Haiti, and advances some hypotheses explaining its reasons. Since the traditional explanations proposed by Marxists and neoclassical economists seem to be insufficient, this paper offers an Institutional approach to improve our understanding of the causes of poverty in Haiti and to visualize policy solutions. The claim is that the supply and demand of enforceable institutions had been low, due to suboptimal strategies played by the dictators and the public/army. The suboptimal equilibrium has been predate/disobey the law, and predate/organize a cue. This hypothesis reinforces Douglass North's idea of 'path dependence', and suggests that more education and/or the reduction of the scope of government could be longterm solutions for the repeated political economy problems that Haiti has experienced during the past 200 years.</jats:p>"

This study shows that INGO installed projects are moving forward to sustainability in terms of performance compared to NGOs and GOs. One of the prime reasons of failure to maintain sustainability is poor involvement of women from the projects' early stages. A systematic random household survey was conducted of selected projects in the study area and this showed that most of the rural DWS projects need to improve management practices and gender equality during planning as well as operation and maintenance phases. Rural people are satisfied with DWS project water availability in their communities. Results indicate that water accessibility fails to have significant impacts on rural livelihood especially for the rural poor.</jats:p>",

WSP-AF will focus on utilities that are engaged in reform or planning to do so. This program builds on support developed for Water Utility Partnership (WUP#5).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper discusses the leakage of hydrocarbons up a fault into an overlying sand that is cut by the fault. The supply of hydrocarbons is continuous until exhaustion of the main source below the sand. At the same time that hydrocarbons can be filling the sand, production is also allowed from the sand components. Hydrocarbons may also bypass either or both components of the cut sand if their respective capacities have been reached, so that there can be a time dependent loss from the lower sand component or the upper sand component or both, as they are filled and drained by production. Numerical illustrations show how the start time of production for each sand influences the bypass and “topping-up” of the sands, as well as the influence of the fractions of the hydrocarbon flow that can be diverted to each of the sand components of the hydrocarbon flow are allowed to vary. In short, an Excel program built upon such ideas has many of the capabilities needed to describe the broad features of leakage, production, topping up, and loss from such sands, as occur specifically in the Eugene Island 335 field as well as in many other fields. </jats:p>",

We consider call (put) options that provide the retailer with the right to reorder (return) goods at a fixed price. We show that the introduction of option contracts causes the wholesale price to increase and the volatility of the retail price to decrease. In general, options are not zero-sum games. Conditions are derived under which the manufacturer prefers to use options. When this happens the retailer is also better off, if the uncertainty in the demand curve is low. However, if the uncertainty is sufficiently high, then the introduction of option contracts alters the equilibrium prices in a way that hurts the retailer. </jats:p>",

Analysis of the system indicates exploitation of all possible water resources using management techniques that balance reservoir storage capacity with continuous flow pipeline systems to maintain a constant water supply throughout the year. Nabataean Petra was founded <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic> 300 <jats:sc>bc</jats:sc>; urban development progressed with later Roman administration of the city starting at <jats:sc>ad</jats:sc> 106; Byzantine occupation continued to the seventh century <jats:sc>ad</jats:sc>. Trade networks that extended throughout much of the ancient Near East and Mediterranean world intersected at Petra, and brought not only strategic and economic prominence, but also impetus to develop water resources fully to sustain demands of increasing population and city elaboration. City development was influenced by artistic, cultural and technological borrowings from Seleucid, Syro-Phoenician, Greek and Roman civilizations; the Petra water-distribution system included hydraulic technologies derived from these contacts as well as original technical innovations that helped to maintain the high living standard of city dwellers throughout the centuries. Analysis of the Nabataean water network indicates design criteria that promote stable flows and use sequential particle-settling basins to purify potable water supplies. They also promote open channel flows within piping at critical (maximum) flow rates that avoid leakage associated with pressurized systems and have the design function to match the spring supply rate to the maximum carrying capacity of a pipeline. This demonstration of engineering capability indicates a high degree of cognitive skill in solving complex hydraulic problems to ensure a stable water supply and may be posited as a key reason behind the many centuries of flourishing city life.</jats:p>",

Establishment limitation was the primary cause of recruitment failure for the three most common species: Acer saccharum Marsh., Betula alleghaniensis Britt., and Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrière. The main barrier to establishment (including germination and seedling emergence) was a lack of suitable substrates, rather than a lack of light. Supply limitation, on the other hand, was the primary cause of recruitment failure for two less common species, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. and Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. The cause of supply limitation was a lack of parent trees, in the case of A. balsamea, and low fecundity, in the case of F. grandifolia. Our results suggest that niche differences (i.e., germination requirements) are more important than dispersal in structuring temperate forest communities. Our results also suggest that availability of suitable substrates is the primary factor limiting seedling recruitment following logging.</jats:p>",

However, extending the construction project control system to job sites is not considered efficient because using notebooks in a harsh environment like a construction site is not particularly a conventional practice. Meanwhile, paper‐based documents of the site processes are ineffective and cannot get the quick response from the office and project control center. Integrating promising information technologies such as personal digital assistants (PDA), bar code scanning, and data entry mechanisms, can be extremely useful in improving the effectiveness and convenience of information flow in construction supply chain control systems. Bar code scanning is appropriate for several construction applications, providing cost savings through increased speed and accuracy of data entry. This article demonstrates the effectiveness of a bar‐code‐enabled PDA application, called the mobile construction supply chain management (M‐ConSCM) System, that responds efficiently and enhances the information flow between offices and sites in a construction supply chain environment. The advantage of the M‐ConSCM system lies not only in improving the efficiency of work for on‐site engineers, but also providing the Kanban‐like visual control system for project participants to control the whole project. Moreover, this article presents a generic system architecture and its implementation.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

In this paper, we develop a simulation-based methodology for quantifying the effect of transportation options (i.e., truckload shipping, less-than-truckload shipping, transshipments, and express air shipping) on shipping costs, customer wait times, abort rates, and operational availability. Simulation was used to develop a multi-echelon (depots, bases) model of regional supply chain support for aircraft spare part maintenance activities. The resulting model was used for experimentation and to develop response surface equations for the behavior of the system. The logistics implications of the results are discussed as well as managerial insights into the behavior of such systems. Our analysis indicates that focusing more on local inventory and local repair can have a significant impact on the operational availability of the system. This shift should be looked at in terms of the cost of local repair resources compared to transportation costs. </jats:p>",

All experiments were performed in stream‐water filled, aerated aquaria under controlled temperature and light conditions.

The SS scenario displayed the most unfavourable condition for larval growth indicated by the lowest adult dry masses (males = 3.12 ± 0.15 mg, females = 4.69 ± 0.25 mg) and a high mortality rate (81.7%). The limestone supplemented with leaf litter (ii) offered the most balanced nutrients to complete larval development and enough shelter to avoid excessive encounter rates of larvae within the aquaria, indicated by the lowest mortality rate (43.6%).

The results implied that cannibalism among larvae can lead to higher adult biomasses and therefore to increased fitness, if cannibalism supplements larval feeding requirements. Larvae developing under insufficient food availability can not compensate for this by cannibalism. Additionally, leaf litter not only provided a complementary food source for developing larvae, but also provided shelter, which reduced encounter rates.</jats:p><jats:p>4. Increased stress induced by high larval encounter rates (resulting in enhanced cannibalism) in the LS scenario and low food availability in the SS scenario could be indicated by premature emergence times compared with the LS + L scenario.</jats:p>",

Thereby, a steady supply of glutamate was imposed at the expense of glutamine, and the stress intensity was manipulated by changing the glutaminase concentration. Glutamate supply rates in the range 8–23 nmol/min/mg protein were examined for periods of up to 48 h. When the glutamate supply rate exceeded the uptake rate of this amino acid, a transient increase in the extracellular concentration of glutamate was observed. In response to this stress, the fluxes through the glutamate transporter and glutamine synthetase were increased considerably, and the extracellular concentration of glutamate was eventually restored to a low level. The increased levels of glutamine synthetase were demonstrated by immunoblotting analysis. The effect on glutamate metabolism of the transaminase inhibitor, aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), and of NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>Cl was also investigated. The supply of glutamate caused a concomitant reduction in the levels of phosphocreatine, phosphoethanolamine, and phosphocholine without affecting the ATP pool. Glutamine synthetase was shown to be is a key element in the control of glutamate metabolism in astrocytic cultures. The metabolic fate of glutamate depends greatly on the time of endurance to the challenge: in naive cells, glutamate was primarily metabolized through the transaminase pathway, while in well‐adapted cells glutamate was converted almost exclusively through glutamine synthetase. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",
