In a very real sense, man's industrial progress can be traced by charting his utilization of the water resources of the earth. Our future industrial progress will depend in large measure on our rational use of water. A reliable water supply is a basic consideration in the selection of a site for any industrial plant. This chapter will discuss the sources and distribution of water available for industrial use in the United States. For the purpose of discussion, the total water supply may be subdivided into precipitation, runoff, groundwater, and saline water.</jats:p>",

Five were radiographed after filling their arterial bed with a radio-opaque substance. The remaining five specimens were used to prepare plastic casts of the arterial bed. The superior rectal artery is the chief rectal artery. It forms a recto-sigmoid branch, an upper rectal branch and then divides into right and left terminal branches. Terminal branches extend downwards and forwards around the lower two thirds of the rectum to the level of the levator ani. The middle rectal artery, of appreciable diameter, on one or both sides of the rectum, is found supplying a limited part of the rectum in 12% of the specimens. Its presence can be anticipated by observing the diameter of the superior rectal artery and its two terminal branches. The inferior rectal artery supplies the anal canal below the levator ani. Rectal twigs of other pelvic arteries terminate at the pararectal tissues occasionally reaching the wall of the rectum. Extramural anastomoses were not observed between the main rectal arteries, but intramural ones were present, mainly between the superior and the inferior rectal arteries.</jats:p>"

The perfusate citrate concentrations rose steadily to values higher than in fetal plasma. This rise was not influenced by intravenous administration of citrate to the ewe. Concentration and electropotential gradients indicate that transplacental passage is unlikely and the rise is probably due to placental synthesis. However, the quantity of citrate supplied to the fetus was calculated to be small compared with the fetal metabolic rate. Comparison with the guinea pig shows close similarity in fetal plasma concentrations and the amount of citrate formed per unit weight of fetus.</jats:p>"

However, the ratio of total sulfur to total nitrogen in the seed is greatly decreased under sulfur deficiency. This large change in sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio is accompanied by suppression of the synthesis of conglutins α and γ, which contain a significant amount of cyst(e)ine and methionine. The level of protein is maintained by increased synthesis of conglutin β, which normally contains no methionine and a low proportion of cyst(e)ine. These changes in the proportions of the proteins are reflected in the amino acid analyses for the globulin extracts. \n    The changes in protein subunit composition which accompany the differences in the proportions of the proteins have been studied using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results emphasize the differences in subunit composition between lupin species in terms of the number of components, their molecular weights and the importance of disulfide bonding. Two-dimensional electrophoresis, using cellulose acetate and SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels, has been used to compare the subunit composition of the individual globulins for Lupinus angustifolius and L. elegans at both sulfur levels. </jats:p>"

Lucas's management, watching the rise and fall of firms that were, as Professor Church says, “young, inventive, and financially weak,” might have agreed with Andrew Carnegie that “pioneering don't pay.” But Lucas's, like Carnegie, pioneered with great success where increased productivity, lower prices, and growth were the rewards.</jats:p>"

A 9–10 month pre-sowing fallow increased mean water storage (0–120 cm depth) at sowing by 28 mm, compared with a non-fallow soil preparation (2 month period of cultivation). Variation in additional storage ranged from nil to 125 mm. These amounts depended on soil type and season: in coarse-textured soils, fallowing conserved little additional water, but in fine-textured soils much additional water could be stored. Storage was not related to the summer rainfall (November-March) before sowing but was related to rainfall during July and August in the previous winter—just before or at the start of the fallow period. A combination of these two factors, fine-textured soil and good July–August rainfall, gave considerable storage. Fallowing also increased the nitrate nitrogen content in the surface 60 cm at sowing; the mean additional nitrogen amounted to 19 kg/ha in the coarse-textured soils and 30 kg/ha in the fine-textured soils. The largest increases due to fallowing were recorded in soils following medic leys and with ample rains on the fallow in spring. Comparison is made between these findings and those obtained with fallowing in other parts of Australia.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The retranslocation of copper and nitrogen was studied in four cultivars of wheat grown in pots of a copper-deficient sand from Lancelin, W.A. Plants were grown at two levels of nitrogen and three levels of copper, and harvested three times during growth and at maturity. Plants grown at low copper were severely copper-deficient and yielded no grain. At low nitrogen, plants at marginal copper gave similar grain yields to plants at high copper. Application of high nitrogen at marginal copper either had little effect or depressed grain yield. Application of high nitrogen at high copper gave a strong positive interaction producing maximal grain yield in each cultivar. Low copper supply delayed yellowing and the decline in copper and nitrogen content of the oldest leaf of each cultivar. Application of high nitrogen further delayed yellowing of the oldest leaf and loss of its copper and nitrogen. Probably the copper content of the oldest leaf does not decline until the leaf begins to senesce. Senesced leaves retain low concentrations of copper and nitrogen. It is suggested that at marginal copper, copper retention by senesced vegetation limits the retranslocation of copper from vegetation to grain. Susceptibility to copper deficiency differed markedly with stage of growth and with cultivar. At marginal copper and high nitrogen, copper deficiency almost eliminated the grain yield of Argentine IX, but had relatively small effects on Gamenya, Olympic, and Petit Rojo. The higher susceptibility of grain production in Argentine IX to copper deficiency was not related to its copper content in whole tops or to its grain protein concentration. The susceptibility may have resulted from the ability of this cultivar to form large numbers of tillers which competed with the developing grain for retranslocated copper.</jats:p>"

Estimation of growth potential was attempted by observing the effects of systematic patterns of grain removal on the mature weights of grains remaining, these being compared with weights of matched grains from intact ears. Resistance to transport of assimilate was inferred from the apparent order of priority between grains for the supply of assimilate, as revealed by comparing their weights when assimilate supply was either normal, or reduced by plant shading. \n    When neighbouring grains were removed, those remaining usually grew larger to an extent that indicated growth potential appreciably in excess of that utilized in intact ears under the most favourable conditions. Although grains within a spikelet of an intact ear attain quite different weights, the experiments suggested that their differing potentials for growth seemed to play only a minor role in this, and that the major influence was the relative ease with which assimilate could reach the grains; this depended largely on the distance of the grains from the spike rachis. Comparing between spikelets, the difference found in intact ears between grains in the same spikelet location tended to persist when some grains were removed from each spikelet, indicating a possible role of growth potential as a controlling influence. This may be partly due to the sequence of morphogenesis, established as early as the double ridge stage. \n    Although the removal of competing grains within a spikelet usually enhanced the growth of the one remaining, this was not always so; there was evidence from one experiment that removal of competing grains towards the spikelet apex represented the removal of some beneficial influence. \n    The bearing of the results on possible limitations to grain yield are discussed.</jats:p>"
