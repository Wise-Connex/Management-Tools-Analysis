Microbiological quality of drinking water supplied in Moamba, a small town in southern Mozambique, was assessed by collecting and analyzing 91 water sample from 5 sampling sites: raw or inlet water, treated water and 3 household taps along the water distribution system. The presence of <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> as indicator fecal contamination, three bacterial pathogens, <jats:italic>Vibrio cholerae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Campylobacter</jats:italic> spp., and Cefotaximee resistant <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> as antibiotic resistance determinant, was assessed.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>. The results showed fecal contamination in all types of water samples: <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> was found in 100% of inlet water samples, in 21% of treated water samples, and in 22% of tap water samples. No <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> spp. was detected during the study. The presence of <jats:italic>V. cholerae</jats:italic> was detected in 42% of all water samples tested: 100% of inlet water samples, in 16% of treated water samples, and in 23% household tap water samples. All <jats:italic>V. cholerae</jats:italic> confirmed isolates where genotyped by PCR as non-O1/non-O139; however, 9 isolates showed the presence of the genes encoding for cholera toxin. The presence of <jats:italic>Campylobacter</jats:italic> spp. was detected in 36% of the water samples tested: in 95% of inlet water samples, in 10% of treated water samples and in 23% household tap water samples. Cefotaxime resistant <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> was detected in 63% of inlet water, 16% of treated water, and in 9% of tap water samples, these isolates were also resistant to multiple other antibiotics: ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline chloramphenicol. All 70 <jats:italic>V. cholerae</jats:italic> non-O1/non-O139 confirmed isolated were resistant to ampicillin, 51% to streptomycin, 13% to gentamycin, and 1 isolate was resistant to tetracycline; 13% showed a multi-drug resistant profile, being resistant to at least three antibiotics.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>. The presence of fecal contamination and pathogens in the water treatment system and household taps in Moamba indicates a health risk for the population. This burden increases by the presence of bacterial pathogens showing multidrug resistance.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For one variable–supply currency in isolation, one player’s Cobb–Douglas utility depends on the current supply divided by the initial supply, multiplied by the inverse of the accumulative inflation/deflation. With equal weight assigned to both factors, money printing outweighs inflation, and money withdrawal outweighs deflation. The study design is to analyze how competition between one variable–supply and one fixed–supply currency impacts the player’s choice of currency. Applying the 1959–2021 US M2 money supply data and the 1635–2021 US inflation data, the player’s utility increases over time when assigning high weight to money printing/withdrawal and increases less or decreases overall when assigning high weight to inflation/deflation. With different player support for the two currencies, depending on each currency’s backing, convenience, confidentiality, transaction efficiency, financial stability, and security, replicator dynamics is used to determine the player’s volume fraction of transactions in each currency. Low, high, increasing, and decreasing support of a currency are analyzed. Each fraction may increase, decrease, be inverse U–shaped, U–shaped, and approach low or high levels over time. For example, high weight assigned to money printing may cause the player to eventually prefer the variable–supply currency unless the player supports the fixed–supply currency highly and increasingly.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The area of supply chain resilience continues to gain increasing attention from scholars and practitioners as new risks and unforeseen disruptions have emerged posing serious threats to operational performance. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of global supply chains. Against these growing concerns, supply chain networks need to be re-examined as organizations grapple with the challenge of strengthening their capacities for preparedness, response, recovery and growth from disruptions. This study analyses the body of literature on innovation, leadership and resilience in relation to supply chain from different perspectives. Conceptual, theoretical and empirical review was undertaken on 101 relevant journal articles and publications across the study area. Issues that present a case for a new theoretical model to advance the present understanding of the constructs and the emerging phenomenon in supply chain were identified. It emerged that the concept of leadership suffers from an unclear conceptualization and is inconsistent in the characteristics of its dimensions. Similarly, there is lack of common understanding of innovation; how organizations should deal with it; and how it relates with leadership. In addition, there are few empirical studies involving innovation, leadership, and supply chain resilience. This study presents a new theoretical framework linking the three constructs to help in developing the implementation of capabilities necessary in attaining resilience in supply chain networks.

The population of the large sized registered members as per the directory is 461. This study employed Cochran’s formula to sample 160 large manufacturing firms from the total population. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data, which was analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This study adopted a descriptive data analysis and inferential data analysis. The analyzed data was presented using tables, graphs and pie charts.&#x0D;\nResults: The findings of the study revealed that the relationship between inventory ownership analysis and performance was significant at 5% level of significance. The findings of the study revealed that majority of the firms had not effectively posited inventory ownership analysis through, embracing the analysis of acquisition related costs, maintenance related costs, majority had no analysis of salvage related costs. The p-value was 0.000 which indicated that the null hypothesis failed to be accepted at 5% level of significance hence inventory ownership analysis have a significant influence on performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study concluded that through adoption of inventory ownership analysis, the operational costs were reduced as well as the reduction of lead time.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: While the existing transaction cost theory used in this study was validated, the study recommends that the policy makers and management of manufacturing firms should invest in acquisition related costs, maintenance related costs, salvage related costs since it influences performance positively. The policy makers hold a major role in determining how key sectors such as the manufacturing sector are run. The regulators and the legislators formulate policies and guidelines that guide on how manufacturing firms should carry out their operations including supply chain processes. The study also recommended that manufacturing firms policy makers should develop a policy and regulatory framework to accelerate effective implementation inventory ownership analysis to enhance their organizational performance.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Automation in inventory monitoring, product control, storage, customer relationships, fleet tracking, etc. is a common issue faced by firms suggesting alternatives to the various problems. In this study, IoT-assisted bio-inspired framework (IoT-BIF) has been proposed for effective logistics management and supply chain processes. IoT with bio-inspired model sensors can track products via different supply chain units to address under-stocking and over-stocking issues. This modern technology allows the connection of numerous objects by gathering real-time data and sharing it; the resulting data can help automated decision-making in industries. The experimental results show that the proposed IoT-BIF method reduces the cost, memory utilization, average running time compared to other popular methods.</p>",

However, such extensions may also engender costly supplier retaliation that results in operational disruptions and financial loss. Terms of payment between buyers and suppliers often affect the relationships established between trade partners; thus, changes to these terms should be evaluated within a social context. Social exchange theory (SET) is applied to analyze the benefits and costs of abrupt payable extensions on buyers' operational outcomes and profitability. The findings indicate that buyers who delay supplier payables by abruptly lengthening payables tend to subsequently increase investments in accounts receivable, inventory, and capital expenditures. Contrary to popular expectations, however, these buyers financially underperform when compared with similar (matched) firms that do not raise payables. Further analysis indicates that these buyers also experience greater supplier turnover and increases in indirect costs. These results are consistent with the expectation of retaliatory supplier responses to payable extensions. It is also revealed that the detrimental effects of delaying supplier payments by payable extensions are significantly smaller for more powerful and financially stronger firms. However, the relationships between payable extensions and capital‐based benefits do not appear to be contingent on buyer power or financial strength. This study extends SET by applying it as a lens through which researchers can examine shifts in trade credit terms. The findings suggest a broadened scope of factors to be considered in social exchange and offer new operationalizations of power and trust factors often addressed in SET studies. The study ends with a discussion of the implications of these findings for practice and future research.</jats:p>",

With water conflicts increasing due to stressors such as population growth, climate change, and aging infrastructure, stakeholder engagement holds the promise to improve decisions, save time and money, and improve relationships between governing bodies and stakeholders. This opinion paper reviews the benefits of engaging stakeholders in water supply management decision-making, assesses the current state of the practice, and predicts future trends in the North American setting. The current use of technology will undoubtedly continue, allowing water managers to engage more stakeholders and engage them more substantively. We predict increased roles for the private and nongovernmental sectors in stakeholder engagement, taking place at different scales, but with a focus on the local level. Evaluating the benefits and effectiveness of engagement processes will help justify the investments, and also support practitioners to determine the most appropriate tools and techniques. Finally, foundational principles of open communication, building and maintaining trust, and ethical decision-making must be placed front and center. We see continued growth in the importance, tools, and application of stakeholder engagement as water managers and the communities they serve to strive towards sustainability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>There is no bigger industry on our planet than food and agriculture. In fact, the World Bank estimates that food and agriculture comprise about 10% of the global GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Despite a huge customer base, the food industry is facing unprecedented challenges in production, demand and regulations stemming from consumer trends. Due to the involvement of humans, the food industries are failing to maintain the demand-supply chain and lacking in food safety. To overcome these issues in food industries, industrial automation is the best possible solution. Automation is completely based on artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms. Artificial intelligence with data science can improve the quality of restaurants, cafes, online delivery food chains, hotels, and food outlets by increasing production by utilizing different algorithms for sales prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI), a radical concept developed by computer scientists in the 1950s, has tremendous applications in our daily lives. Artificial intelligence aims to learn human cognitive abilities and eventually surpass them. Currently, most AI models rely on deep neural networks, inspired by the human brain, which takes in a lot of raw data and expects results and learns the relationship between the two. The Global AI in the Supply chain market reached USD 5,610.8 Million in 2021a across the globe. Increasing attention to artificial intelligence, large statistics, analytics, and a widening scope are all driving AI growth in the supply chain market globally. Every autonomous and semi-autonomous program implements computer vision. There are several players operating in the global AI supply chain market, including FedEx, McLane Company, DHL, Amazon, CSX, XPO Logistics, C.H, and others. The machine learning segment accounted for the largest share of the global AI in the supply chain market. I tried to find these answers through my research article. • Importance of AI and how will impact in Supply chain in the mid-and long-term? • What are the ubiquitous movements in AI in the Supply chain? • What are the key strategies adopted by leading companies For AI in Supply chain logistics? • How the implementation of AI can make the Supply chain more efficient? To answer all these questions, I use secondary data and reports from various government agencies and did SWOT analyses to check where we can implement AI in supply chain optimization.</jats:p>"

We first extend existing theory to characterize the roles of imperfect competition and product differentiation, then investigate these relationships empirically using a panel of 14 Eurozone countries between 1999 and 2013. We find that consumers pay a larger share of VAT increases when producers face more competitive upstream markets: the higher tax reduces final demand, but this lower demand does not in turn reduce input prices when upstream markets are competitive. Greater scope for quality differentiation also increases pass-through, by reducing the relative price elasticity of demand.\nJEL: D43, H22, H25</jats:p>"

Due to the continuous rapid development of renewable energy sources, requirements for secondary power supply systems keep increasing from year to year. Productive uptime for end users is dependent on the efficiency and stability of the power supply system. Such systems should be able to distribute and store energy from renewable sources having various parameters and configurations. Therefore, the present work is aimed at developing technical solutions for efficient uninterruptible secondary power supply systems in low voltage DC networks.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>. Advanced circuitry solutions are used for performing pulse conversions with high efficiency. The flexible hardware-software system is used for implementing the parameter control system.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>. An uninterruptible power supply for low-voltage DC networks is developed. The description of subsystems and calculations for all main elements including the power ones are given. Using a contemporary component base, the system prototype is assembled, configured, and measured by parameters. The presented solutions allow achieving the universality of the system in terms of the input and output voltage range. Support for the fast-charging Power Delivery protocol is integrated. As well as regulating the battery charging current and voltage, the Li+ battery charging controller permits changes in the number of chargeable cells. The monitoring and control unit monitors network parameters and controls the system automation. Using a microcontroller as the control device, it is possible to easily change control parameters by changing software settings. Dual redundancy of the module monitoring the built-in battery parameters is used to ensure the reliability and safety of system functioning. Support for the standardized I2C communication protocol with a separate power bus allows any necessary sensors to be connected for monitoring system parameters. External high-power devices controlled by a PWM signal may be added, if required. In the paper, the Li+ battery charging profile recommended by the manufacturer is provided.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>. The designed system provides stable power supply to end users at a power consumption up to 40 W for at least 45 min. The automation demonstrates reliable operation.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the current situation of urban drinking water supply is analyzed and the causes of pollution are analyzed. Then, the autoregressive model is used to predict the time series of multiple water quality indicators by constantly introducing new monitoring data modes for the residual vector group, the outlier scores of each vector group are obtained by using the isolated forest algorithm to judge whether the water quality is abnormal or not, and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to evaluate the level of the abnormal situation and carry out the corresponding level early warning. The experimental results show that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve can reach 0.919 when using the prediction residual vector group of turbidity and conductivity to detect the numerical changes of water quality parameters in the drinking water supply chain, accurately predict the abnormal data, make early warning, and provide the guarantee for the survival of urban residents and urban development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>There are many natural and other disruptions to businesses and supply chains in this dynamic and uncertain business world. Facing those disruptions and surviving the company becomes highly challenging. Global apparel value chains have been severely disrupted by the COVID- 19 pandemic, which has delayed their recovery in the short term. This study explores how the sector mitigates challenges during the pandemic and the steps the industry should focus on in the new-normal era. Using a multidisciplinary approach, this study conducted an evidence- based case study method. Through secondary data, it was examined short-term and long-term strategies executed by the industry. Due to the scattered nature of the supply chain and the labour intensity, the apparel sector faced significant challenges compared to other businesses. However, the industry rebounded after the pandemic by adopting short-term and medium-term resilient strategies. This cross-case analysis discusses the challenges faced by apparel manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries. The industry adopted short-term and long-term solutions to recoup from the COVID-19 storm. The findings provide an opening for the researchers to explore the viability of the strategies adopted by the industry. Also, the results open avenues how for exploring other techniques to be assumed to be resilient in unexpected situations like COVID-19.</p>"

Regarded for a decade as complex and with limited application, blockchain has now matured to be on the verge of fully realizing its disruptive potential. In Enterprise Strategy for Blockchain, business strategy expert Ravi Sarathy shows how companies can gain competitive advantage by developing and deploying blockchain capabilities. Sarathy explains what makes blockchain unique, including its capacities to eliminate intermediaries, guard against hackers, decentralize, and protect privacy. Presenting examples drawn from such sectors as finance, supply chains, computer services, consumer products, and entertainment, he describes how executives can strategically assess blockchain's applicability to their business.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>After outlining blockchain's technological features—and its technological obstacles—Sarathy describes disruptive technologies already happening in the financial services market with the emergence of decentralized finance, or DeFi, arguing that a wave of innovation might be positioning DeFi as blockchain's “killer app.” He also explores, among many other uses, a blockchain application that addresses chronic supply chain problems, pilot blockchain programs aimed at facilitating cross-border payments, and the use of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that allow digital art to be collected and traded. And he outlines a path for organizations that includes establishing a business case for applying blockchain, evaluating enterprise cost-benefits, and preparing the organization to develop the requisite knowledge and people skills while overcoming resistance to change.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Business leaders should invest, explore and experiment with blockchain now, positioning their organizations to be first in their fields, ahead of both rising startups and late-to-the game incumbent peers.</jats:p>",

Empirically, multiple benefits of BDA in Supply Chain Management (SCM) have been demonstrated. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between technical, organizational, and environmental factors and supply chain firms’ performance using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory. This study was conducted at medium-large supply chain firms in Saudi Arabia, the sample size reached 700 firms recognized by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry in different domains. In this study, a questionnaire was used to collect primary data. The collected data are analyzed using SPSS version 26.0. SPSS is used to describe respondents’ demographic profiles. The percentage of respondents to the questionnaire reached 57%. In addition, to test hypotheses and accomplish research goals, PLS-SEM version 3.0 is used to examine the relationship between independent and dependent variables. From the PLS results, the study reported that complexity (β = 0.097, t = 2.817), security (β = 0.222, t = 3.486), IT expertise (β = 0.108, t = 1.993), and external support (β = 0.211, t = 3.468) were positively related to firm’s performance; in contrast, relative advantage (β = –0.006, t = 0.200), compatibility (β = –0.020, t = 0.314), top management support (β = –0.046, t = 0.386), organizational resources (β = –0.065, t = 1.179), competitive pressure (β = –0.011, t = 0.199), and privacy (β = –0.05, t = 0.872) were negatively related to firm’s performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The apparel industry is undoubtedly a sizeable global industry with a vast history and contributions to the worldwide economy. The entire supply chain is spread across various locations around the globe. Like any other industry apparel supply chain also has its limitations and challenges to be competitive. At the same time, digital technologies have evolved in a rapid phase in the past couple of decades, enabling the fourth industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 technologies have disrupted many industries and supply chains and help to gain unique capabilities to become competitive over the rivals. Undoubtedly these intelligent technologies can transform the apparel supply chain and gain a competitive advantage. This paper investigates the impact of smart digital technologies on the apparel supply chain to gain a competitive advantage through a thorough literature review. The article discusses the evolution and future trends of intelligent technologies and apparel supply networks, technological impacts on supply chains and links them to the competitive advantage of the apparel supply chain. Also, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for digital apparel supply chain and competitive advantage and open up avenues to researchers to carry out future research on this subject.</p>"

As a result of the above, industry and academia have taken an interest in the concept of sustainable supply chain management, owing to its importance in terms of environmental, social, and corporate responsibility, as well as its e-commerce component. The most important theoretical contribution of this research is that it demonstrates that independent factors have a positive impact on organizational growth. Because of commercial concerns, Sustainable Supply is a major issue in the corporate sector. Supply chain management has gotten increased attention since the 1980s when companies began to illustrate the benefits of reciprocal ties in the workplace. As a result, academics are concentrating their efforts on developing new supply chain theories that benefit businesses. The main goals of this study are to provide a written assessment of possible supply chain management based on publications published from 1990 to the present. The moment provides a conceptually plausible supply chain process model based on the triple foot line premise. The results from the study on cost-effective supply chain management don't add up. Most previous studies have focused on the environmental, social, and economic aspects of one could in the supply chain. The majority of previous inquiries were focused on overwhelming conceptual nature. There is a scarcity of research on long-term supply chain management based on extensive observational evidence. This research focuses on the Pakistan supply chain's triple foot line maintainability, taking into planning, execution, collaboration and coordination factors. This consideration also emphasizes the importance of PhD research in this sector in the future.</jats:p>"

It aims to cover two gaps in the SCM literature: the missing links between MRKT–SCM alignment and the performance of a firm, mediated by the SCR, and the role of absorptive capacity (AC) in shaping such links.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>After the identification of a key capability in SCM, i.e. firms’ ability to align their’ MRKT–SCM processes and the role of AC, the relationships with performance are empirically tested in a sample of 133 firms in the fast-moving consumer goods industry in Saudi Arabia. The data was analyzed using SPSS 27 through hierarchal multiple regression and the PROCESS macro.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>First, MRKT–SCM alignment capabilities provide a significant direct effect on SCR, and in turn, SCR also had a significant indirect effect on firm performance. Second, there is a significant mediating effect of SCR on the MRKT –SCM alignment and firm performance relationship. Third, a novel finding shows a statistically significant interaction effect and the interaction pattern supported that absorptive capacity would substitute the positive effect of SCR on firm performance, which implies that in the absence of SCR, AC can substitute the role of SCR. Finally, the results suggest a significant moderation and mediation effect for the overall model.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The investigation is based on a self-reported cross-sectional analysis, and it is specific to a single economy. Nonetheless, it suggests a number of interesting implications. Achieving excellence in SCR requires the development of a distinct set of capabilities because the management of core supply chain activities and the alignment of MRKT with the supply chain are not mutually exclusive, rather they are complementary. Contrary to common expectations, an alignment of MRKT–SCM processes leads to improved interfunctional coordination.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>In the postCOVID-19 world firms should develop and integrate their AC to capitalize on their MRKT–SCM alignment to pursue better performance. Investment in AC is required to develop, maintain and use it. It can play an important role against uncertainties in the long run.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper is unique in that it employs the RBV – to unpack the mechanisms through which MRKT–SCM activities contribute to SCR, and firm performance. It represents a first response to the call for research into the use of such theoretical frameworks which has recently been made in the SCM literature because of the COVID-19 pandemic. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper also offers the first empirical test of how the MRKT–SCM interacts with existing capabilities to create SCR, providing clear guidance on how to exploit its often undervalued potential.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

Previously, its effect on the river\ncommunity is considered to be stronger in summer, while weaker in winter\nwhen terrestrial invertebrates are less abundant. The movement of the\nterrestrial earthworms are triggered in winter, so they may be supplied\nto winter rivers as terrestrial resource pulse, but little is known\nabout it. Here, we report that the massive numbers of the terrestrial\nearthworms were supplied intensively to an upstream of the small river\nin early winter. In particular, we found large numbers of Megascolecidae\nearthworms were supplied in an upstream of the small river in Northern\nJapan. Furthermore, we observed that supplied earthworms were consumed\nby salmonid fish species (masu salmon, white spotted char and rainbow\ntrout) and aquatic invertebrates (gammarid amphipod, planarian flatworm\nand stonefly larvae). These findings suggests that the terrestrial\nearthworms may play a key role in ecosystem functioning in winter when\nsevere and other resources are scarce.</jats:p>"

As such, it represents the interface between economic geology and mineral economics. The traditional approach to studying mineral supply, however, is less an interface than a series of silos covering geologic, engineering, business, and social aspects of the conversion process. The challenges of meeting the ever-increasing demand for minerals and metals will require better communication and understanding across disciplines and stakeholder groups in order to mitigate discovery and development risks. For economic geologists, improved communication starts with an understanding of the essential economic tools and metrics that are used to assign value to projects and make decisions about their advancement toward production. Furthermore, economic geologists should recognize and build on the interface between the economic characteristics of valuations and the underlying geologic characteristics of deposits. The sizes and distribution of project cash flows are intimately linked to the underlying styles and distribution of mineralization within deposits. Understanding how geologic processes created and altered mineral deposits is incredibly useful in grasping the economics of undoing those processes to recover payable minerals and metals.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The dominant retailer has strong bargaining power and market power, which means that it enjoys a lower wholesale price and can obtain part of the unmet demand transferred from the weak retailer. The manufacturer offers a wholesale price to the weak retailer. As the weak retailer’s private demand information is unknown to the other participants, whether to share the information to other players become an important issue. We develop a game-theoretic model to examine four information-sharing formats: no information sharing, only sharing with the dominant retailer, only sharing with the manufacturer, and full information sharing. We obtain the equilibrium profits and decisions under the four sharing formats and investigate the firms’ preferences regarding these formats. We find that the weaker retailer prefers not sharing information and only sharing information with the dominant retailer formats, since these two formats lower the wholesale price and increase the weak retailer’s order quantity. The dominant retailer prefers full information sharing to only sharing with the dominant retailer because the former format increases the manufacturer’s wholesale price to the weaker retailer, thereby improving the dominant retailer’s total demand. This study also provides a theoretical basis for the application of advanced information technology in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The proposed system consists of a multi-tap regulating\ntransformer, a DC traction converter, a DC step-down converter, and a\nthree-phase inverter. The DC traction converter adopts the topology of\ninput-parallel-output-series (IPOS) uncontrolled rectifier and fully\ncontrolled converter. Its main capacity is assumed by the uncontrolled\nrectifier, which has the advantages of low cost, simple structure and\neasy to realize engineering applications. In this paper, the voltage\nregulating transformer is used for shifting and voltage regulation to\nexpand the ice melting function, which can be used to solve the icing\nproblem of the railway traction system. In order to realize the\nfunctions of harmonic compensation, DC-side voltage stabilization and\npower distribution in multiple parallel operation of DC traction\nconverter, this paper proposes a compound control method for traction\nconverter, which realizes power distribution by droop control with\nvoltage compensation, voltage stabilization by suppressing voltage\nfluctuation by power feedforward control, and harmonic compensation by\nharmonic current compensation control. The small-signal model of the\nsystem under this control strategy is also established, and the\nstability of the control parameters on the system is analyzed.

However, future food security scenarios are often based on models that ignore annual weather variability and weather extremes. As a result, this approach also disregards the risk of having lower than expected yields, with adverse consequences for food security and farmer livelihoods. Here we present a stochastic food production model to show how optimal crop allocations change depending on food security risk targets. To guarantee stable livelihoods for farmers, we examine the viability of a contingency fund that supports farmers in the event of low crop yields. Applied to the West African context, accounting for weather variability can substantially improve the reliability of the food supply and boost the fiscal sustainability of a contingency fund. Yet, setting reliability targets for food security is costly and leaves high residual risk in certain regions. Spatial risk-sharing through regional cooperation at the West African scale can eliminate the risk of insufficient food supply and further enhance the fund solvency without additional cost.</jats:p>"

The work used news and media articles gathered from the LexisNexis database covering 5 months between February and July 2020. The data analyses describe the general patterns in the news texts by using text mining techniques, and the methodology describes the relationship between consumer behavior, supply chain issues, and the reduced level of service shown during the study period. Demand behaviors include precautionary and opportunistic buying, which affected many countries and could be the result of a lack of perceived control and other factors; for example, near-empty shelves of certain products could have prompted consumers to increasingly look for comparable products, driving up demand. Additionally, the method explored the potential effect of strategies to mitigate impacts on the resilience of supply chains. The results confirmed that buying behaviors and a reduction in the capacity of the supply chain led to a lower level of service being perceived by consumers, however, resilience strategies were found to mitigate the impact of such capacity reductions. Empirical analyses showed that the proposed approach, using data extracted from the news, could identify and represent impacts consistent with expectations from the supply chain field under disruptions, and quantify the magnitude of the impacts as the pandemic evolved, providing more information for decision making. </jats:p>",

In a nutshell, because open source is about the use of third party code, compliance is the nexus of where equality of access, safety of use, and reduction of risk can be found. OpenChain ISO 5230 is thus built to increase trust between organisations to accomplish this.</jats:p>",

It aims to elaborate on and emphasize how a sustainable supply chain will be more effective the traditional construction management and its supply chains. A quantitative research method with a deductive approach was used to test research hypotheses. A sample of 154 respondents using a questionnaire responded for data analysis. In Pakistan, the market for a construction company is primarily local based and highly volatile. The assessment is carried out to determine the level of significance and degree of impact of supply chain management (SCM) and sustainability on the construction industry's performance. The results derived from the test show that SCM has a moderate impact leading to leading to increased performance. The lack of time and budget limited the focus to Karachi-based construction businesses, leaving other construction businesses in Pakistan as not relevant. The paper primarily focused on the Pakistan-based construction industry, and the articles that are a source for this study generated knowledge regarding various issues and opportunities associated with supply chain management in the Karachi-based construction industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a model for short-term time-horizon production and distribution planning of a manufacturing company located in the middle of a supply chain. The model focuses on an unbalanced market with broken supply chains. This reflects the state of the current post-COVID-19 economy, which is additionally struggling with even more uncertainty and disruptions due to the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The manufacturer, operating on the post-pandemic and post-war market, on the one hand observes a soaring demand for its products, and on the other faces uncertainty regarding the availability of components (parts) used in the manufacturing process. The goal of the company is to maximise profits despite the uncertain availability of intermediate products. In the short term, the company cannot simply raise prices, as it is bound by long-term contracts with its business partners. The company also has to maintain a good relationship with its customers, i.e. businesses further in the supply chain, by proportionally dividing its insufficient production and trying to match production planning with the observed demand. The post-COVID-19 production-planning problem has been addressed with a robust mixed integer optimisation model along with a dedicated heuristic, which makes it possible to find approximate solutions in a large-scale real-world setting.\n\n</jats:p>",

It underscores the significant impact of total logistics costs, encompassing transportation, facility, and inventory expenses, on a company's competitiveness. By harmonizing inventory and distribution policy decisions, businesses can streamline costs and enhance their ability to respond effectively to market demands. The effectiveness of this integration is illustrated through a practical example involving a scenario of single supply and multiple demands. Moreover, the study examines the pivotal role of Vendor Managed Inventory in optimizing inventory management throughout the supply chain. Additionally, it explores the utilization of the Traveling Salesman Problem to streamline transportation expenses. Through the adoption of this integrated approach, organizations can realize cost efficiencies and bolster their responsiveness, ultimately strengthening their competitive position within the industry.</jats:p>"

As the current first choice of power battery, lithium-ion batteries have overwhelming advantages. However, the explosive growth of the demand for power lithium-ion batteries is likely to cause crises such as resource shortages and supply-demand imbalances, hindering the future of the low-carbon world. This study adopts qualitative and quantitative research methods to comprehensively evaluate the global power lithium-ion battery supply and demand risks by analyzing the global material flow of these batteries. Based on data availability, we use qualitative research on the world reserves and mine production of critical raw materials and quantitative dynamic material flow analysis for the shipment, installation, and global consumption of the batteries. The results show that each process in the power lithium-ion battery industry is highly concentrated, but each within different countries or regions, creating significant risks for the raw material supply, battery shipping, and market demand sides. The comprehensive results show that the supply risk of power lithium-ion batteries is very high.</jats:p>"

After formulating the FIC-INP model, upper and lower disinfection booster costs can be obtained for two cases under various combinations of credibility levels of upper and lower limits. The results indicated that the upper and lower booster costs increased with the credibility levels of the lower limits. The upper as well as the lower booster costs increased with the booster numbers. For credibility levels of lower limit constraints ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, the upper and lower booster costs increased under enlarging/widening trapezoidal distributions, and the intervals of booster costs increased with interval uncertainty. For a lower limit constraint credibility level of 0.5, the upper and lower booster costs decreased under shrinking/narrowing trapezoidal distributions, and the booster cost intervals increased under larger interval trapezoidal distributions. The degrees of effect of the interval uncertainty are higher than the fuzzy uncertainty. The results obtained can provide more information for managers to make booster schemes under fuzzy and interval uncertainties.</jats:p>",

Emphasis is placed on the relative roles of reproduction and of external supply; the latter includes capture in warfare, kidnapping, enslavement through taxes and debt, penal aspects, and child exposure and sale, as well as self-enslavement. Consideration is also given throughout to questions such as the ethnic origin of slaves, the significance of manumission, and the role of slave traders. The challenges presented by the range of extant evidence for slave demography in antiquity are also discussed.</jats:p>"

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, logistics problems, especially production and transportation costs, have further strengthened Türkiye’s position in this context. Türkiye’s strategic location, strong logistics infrastructure, costeffective and qualified workforce, along with a liberal investment climate, offer a suitable environment for international companies. Türkiye ranks well\nin the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index, which evaluates countries’ logistics performance in customs, transportation, and infrastructure. Türkiye has served as a bridge between the east and west since historical times. During the Seljuk period, caravanserais and other infrastructure and service areas were established in Anatolia to support commercial activities. The Silk Road, which had an important place until a certain period of the Ottoman Empire, lost its importance due to other developments.\nThe “One Belt One Road Project” initiated by China, still in progress and planned to be completed in 2049, will make Türkiye even more important in terms of the global supply chain in the next 10 years. İpekyolu follows the northern and southern routes in Anatolia. With China’s “One Belt One Road Project”, the Silk Road will regain its former importance as the “Modern Silk Road”. Chinese President Xi Jinping fi rst mentioned the Land and Sea Silk Road project in one of his speeches in 2013. It has been decided to name these\ntwo projects as the “Belt and Road Initiative-BRI” or the “One Belt One Road-OBOR” project. The word belt constitutes the land route of the project, which includes highways, railways, oil and natural gas pipelines, and infrastructure investments. The word road includes the sea routes covered by the project. The routes of these corridors are provided by multidimensional corridors in the direction of Asia-Europe instead of a single route. Within the scope of this project, many infrastructure investments are made in Türkiye as well. In this study, the cost advantages that Türkiye will provide to the global supply chain will be evaluated due to both its cost and geographical location and the infrastructure investments made.</jats:p>",

However, recent skyrocketing oil prices have been one of the greatest concerns among policymakers, business executives, and the general public due to their impacts on daily necessities, including food, clothing, and automobile transportation. As a result, fast-rising inflation on the global scale is attributed to mounting oil prices. Even though many countries have made a conscious effort to tame oil prices and the subsequent inflation, their efforts are often in vain due to some uncontrollable situations. These situations include the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, where Russia began weaponizing its oil resources and limiting oil supplies to its neighboring European countries. Faced with the current energy crisis, a growing number of policymakers and business executives have attempted to develop energy-induced risk mitigation strategies. With this in mind, the primary purpose of this paper is to investigate what may have caused oil price hikes and to determine how significantly oil prices influence commodity prices. This paper then proposes ways to mitigate energy-induced supply chain risks by analyzing four decades of secondary data obtained from multiple sources.</jats:p>"

India, being the world’s largest producer of drugs, faces a crucial issue of counterfeits. Moreover, counterfeits identify their path into the pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) effortlessly owing to the dearth of security and traceability in the prevailing system. This is because the software applications currently in use stockpile the information about drugs on centralized servers and are accessed by manufacturers, distributors and retailers via the internet. The security of such systems is found to be weak. To address these issues, in this work, a novel method called Supersingular Isogeny and Hosmer–Lemeshow Logistic Regression-based (SI-HLLR) secured information sharing for the pharmaceutical supply chain is proposed. The SI-HLLR method is split into two sections, block validation and authentication. First, with the pharmaceutical sales data provided as input, the supersingular isogeny Diffie–Hellman key exchange model is applied for block validation and then is implemented using a blockchain. Next, with the validated blocks, the authentication mechanism is performed using Hosmer–Lemeshow logistic regression-based authentication that in turn eliminates the counterfeit drugs from the pharmaceutical supply chain. The hyperledger fabric blockchain solution using SI-HLLR leads to improved security ensuring data integrity and better authentication accuracy in the proposed method.</jats:p>"

To achieve the purpose,  this research uses semi-structured interview for data collection. The researcher of this study has identified the key problems to be solved by the BCSC mode. Results show that the potential risk suggested in this study in relation to the use of the BCSC is possible attack risk due to additional tasks that need to be completed other than the processes in traditional database. These additional tasks include signature verification, and attaining consensus. Moreover, there are different key applications of BCSC in both cross-border e-commerce and the general business environment, such as identification and traceability of products, enhancing the efficiency and speed of supply chain processes, and improving the financing, contracting and cross-border transactions. Finally, based on the findings of this research, it was determined that RFID could be incorporated with the BCSC. RFID will increase the traceability of the products that are on transit within a specific supply chain. This study has made contribution to the literature as it uncovers the positive side of using blockchain technology in supply chain management. As the existing literature do not extensively cover the future of businesses that integrate blockchain into their supply chain management processes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pengoperasian sebuah kapal supply untuk mendukung sisi operasional sebuah rig atau juga sebuah platform menjadi suatu hal yang sangat lazim digunakan perusahaan kilang minyak. Kerja sebuah kapal supply dalam hal rig movement atau anchor handling tergantung dari sisi kemampuan awak kapal yang bekerja. Permasalahan yang sering terjadi pada kapal supply adalah kurangnya pemahaman awak kapal terhadap prosedur kerja ketika melaksanakan Anchor Handling atau Rig Movement, dikarenakan awak kapal yang kurang begitu familiar bekerja di atas kapal supply. Dengan pokok permasalahan tersebut, dapat dirumuskan suatu rumusan masalah, yakni mengapa kinerja Anak Buah Kapal (ABK) di atas kapal supply saat pelaksanaan rig movement atau anchor handling kurang optimal. Penelitian mengenai kinerja awak kapal ketika anchor handling mempunyai tujuan untuk meningkatkan kesiapaan Anak Buah Kapal (ABK) dan fasilitas kapal untuk dapat mengoptimalkan operasi anchor handling. Didasarkan pada penelitian yang bersifat kualitatif, maka ditemukanlah suatu pemecahan masalah berupa pendidikan singkat oleh bagian pengawakan kepada awak kapal. Dan perusahaan perlu bekerja sama dengan suatu badan diklat perhubungan untuk mendapatkan sarana dan prasarana yang ada untuk mendidik calon Anak Buah Kapal itu melalui praktek yang benar, terhadap sarana yang ada dan Anak Buah Kapal akan mendapatkan sebuah sertifikat keterampilan pelaut bagi yang telah lulus menguasai materi. Jadi, dengan diadakannya suatu pendidikan singkat mengenai sisi operasional kapal supply oleh perusahaan, diharapkan setiap awak kapal akan dalam kondisi siap kerja.</jats:p>"

The threat of climate change became more evident as the world population from across the world began to feel the impact. The rapid rate of sustainable energy sources such as solar and wind needs an energy storage system, as such sources of its energy are not always available. One of many kinds of energy storage system is lithium-ion battery. The demand for lithium-ion batteries reflects the world's demand for sustainable energy, making material for Lithium-ion batteries the new oil. Nickel in Lithium-ion battery is one of significant materials used to make this battery. Indonesia has been one of the world’s top producers of nickel and has the most reserve in the world. Most Indonesian nickel has been exported as raw ore to be processed in other countries. Recognizing its potential, the government has been imposing a law banning the export of raw nickel ore. The government constructs smelters to purify the ore to get a higher nickel content. But still, Indonesia has issues to work on so its plan will proceed as intended. Issues such as extensive political involvement, complicated government bureaucracy, and inconsistent policies and laws. The big investment in mining infrastructure must align with the investment in the people who will manage it and who are going to execute the actual plan.</jats:p>"

As part of the preliminary CFD studies, the pressure and velocity distributions of the flow control valve were obtained, and the discharge coefficient of the valve nozzles was determined as a function of the valve spool position. Then, a mathematical model of the system was formulated, which was used to build a simulation model in the Matlab/Simulink environment. Next, the ability of the system to achieve the assumed operating parameters and its energy efficiency in a given load range were tested. The results indicate that the system can effectively perform the required work cycles with sufficient accuracy.</jats:p>"

The focus of this commentary will be practical application of The Five Domains Model in commercial systems. Commercial buyers of meat need simple easy-to-use guidelines. They have to use auditors that can be trained in a workshop that lasts for only a few days. Auditing of slaughter plants by major buyers has resulted in great improvements. Supply chain managers need clear guidance on conditions that would result in a failed audit. Animal based outcome measures that can be easily assessed should be emphasized in commercial systems. Some examples of these key animal welfare indicators are: percentage of animals stunned effectively with a single application of the stunner, percentage of lame animals, foot pad lesions on poultry, and body condition scoring. A farm that supplies a buyer must also comply with housing specifications. The farm either has the specified housing or does not have it. It will be removed from the approved supplier list if housing does not comply. These types of easy to assess indicators can be easily evaluated within the four domains of nutrition, environment, health and behavioral interactions. The Five Domains Framework can also be used in a program for continuous improvement of animal welfare.</jats:p>"

Recent dam failures at tailing ponds with catastrophic outcomes have raised public concern, such that industry initiatives and investors are beginning to address the problem. So far, a lack of publicly available data makes an independent and comprehensive risk assessment challenging. We introduce a simple and transparent hazard indicator built from environmental proxy variables and screen a global sample of 112 copper mines for natural hazards regarding tailings dams. In a second step, material footprints of copper for the European Union and five major economies are estimated and compared using a Multi-Regional Input–Output model, shedding light on the regions of origin. Finally, hazard scores are linked to regional copper footprints to identify hotspots in supply chains of final consumption. The most hazardous mines are located in Chile and Peru including some of the world’s largest copper producers. China and the US have the largest copper ore footprints and per capita values in the US were 25 times larger than in India. The United States’ and European footprints are satisfied by domestic extraction to about 66 and 40 percent respectively. Copper from Poland contributes around 19 and 28 percent to supply chains of German and European final demand respectively and, as a consequence, Poland constitutes the main hazard hotspot for Europe’s copper supply chain.</jats:p>"

Key incentives identified include favorable government policies, rising costs of fossil fuels, and the need to reduce emissions levels globally. Notably, despite the high initial cost of green energy, the investigation noted substantial future financial savings along with protecting the environment and introducing the social cost of carbon (SCC) in the analysis. Therefore, standardization of green energy costs would contribute to the adoption of green energy sources. Above all, the rising cost of conventional energy makes it imperative for governments and organizations to adopt green energy.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Despite many studies on green energy, this paper presents novel ideas as it focuses on incentives for production costs. It outlines how to lower the cost of producing green energy to the same standard as conventional sources increasing its capacity compared with historical patterns. The incentives under discussion also underscore energy efficiency by making it a cheaper and cost-competitive alternative, and technology comes out as a crucial ground leveler in achieving cost-effectiveness and efficiency. For example, improvement of storage would be vital in storing power for extended periods once harnessed or fuel transitioning in transportation. Overall, government incentives and interventions in areas of funding, research, and development would mitigate existing challenges and contribute to the long-term development of green energy.</jats:p>",

Shocks to the Swiss economy have generally, although not uniformly, declined in magnitude over the sample period. The World Wars, the deflation of the 1920s and the Great Depression represented much larger shocks than either of 1970s break-up of Bretton Woods and move to floating exchange rates or the Global Financial Crisis.</jats:p>"

We find that the pandemic has negatively affected the labor market status of both men and women, but that the effect is significantly stronger for women, magnifying the already large gender gaps that characterize LAC countries. The main channel through which this stronger impact is taking place is the increase in child care work affecting women with school-age children.</jats:p>"

The industries seem to lack of awareness, knowledge, and cost in implementing the traceability system inside food premises. This study aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of the concept of the halal food supply and halal traceability system and examine the challenges faced by the industry in the halal food supply chain. The study adopted the qualitative method where the data were collected through documentary and library-based reviews of both primary and secondary literature. The gathered data were analysed by using document and content analysis to review documents related to the research’s objectives. The finding indicated that halal supply chain management does not only cover the aspect of the halal status of the raw material but also involves tools, machines, and logistics.  It shows that a traceability system is adopted to ensure that information related to halal food and products is available and can be traced along the supply chain. It includes the information before the production, such as the sources and origin of the raw materials.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 outbreak adversely impacted agri-food supply chains and caused a severe socio-economic crisis worldwide. Preventive measures taken by several countries have affected production and distribution. Moreover, producers have had to face difficulties related to changes in local and international export markets, a decrease in the labor force due to the spread of the virus, and challenges in harvesting, processing, and shipment of products. However, despite the extraordinary nature of the disruption, supply chains have demonstrated a fair, resilient, and sustainable crisis recovery. Although a large number of papers deal with supply chains and the pandemic’s impact, a review of measures implemented that comprehensively includes resilience dimensions is still lacking. The scope of this paper is to survey available literature in order to understand whether there are classes of actions and strategies undertaken by meat supply chains in managing the pandemic. Documents were reviewed through a protocol based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review technique. The survey highlights which actions have enabled supply chain resilience by underling virtuous behaviors and lessons learned. These findings support the need for further investigation of supply chain resilience and offer practitioners guidance toward a greater understanding of impacts and implementable strategies.</jats:p>"

However, most of the countries with the greatest burden of HIV/AIDS experience regular stock outages which could be detrimental to reaching these targets. ART and other commodities such as HIV test kits and laboratory supplies need to be readily and consistently available to achieve these targets. The main objective was to improve access to HIV/AIDS related commodities and strengthening institutional capacity for the management of HIV/AIDS logistics services through the MAUL procurement and supply chain strengthening project (PSSP) that rolled out four interventions on mentorship and support supervision, stock level monitoring, spatial visualization of stock indicators using GIS, and using WhatsApp to submit order reports as photo images.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Medical Access Uganda Limited, a private-not-for-profit supply chain management company in Uganda, implemented these interventions as part of a procurement and supply chain strengthening project (PSSP).

Trade credit supply is measured as average collection period. For panel data analysis, this study uses the Prais - Winsten Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) method. PCSE removes the of cross-sectional dependence issue in the panel dataset. Findings indicate that firms had to pay their suppliers earlier during the financial crisis 2008 than pre-crisis. Financial crisis significantly influenced the relationship between determinants and trade credit supply but to different levels in different income groups. Average payment periods and private credit to GDP significantly and positively increased the average collection period more in lower-middle income developing countries and less in upper-middle developing income countries. Cash flow volatility and leverage influenced the average collection period significantly and negatively during the crisis. This influence was stronger than pre-crisis and post-crisis periods, and more significant in lower-middle income countries and less in upper-middle income countries. The negative relationship between inflation and trade credit supply is strongly negative in lower-middle income countries. Overall, the results suggest that financial crisis changed the relationship between determinants and trade credit supply and the extant of this change was different in different income group countries.</jats:p>"

As stay-at-home orders were instituted, most economic activities closed or required work from home; however, companies in the Food Supply Chain (FSC) continued to operate, considered “essential businesses.” The meatpacking and agriculture sectors in Illinois - 79,000 and 55,000 workers, respectively - are largely populated by (im)migrant workers, some on short-term work visas and many of whom are part of the informal (cash) economy. Only a tiny percentage of meatpacking and no agriculture businesses are unionized in Illinois or most of the USA. Initially, FSC workplaces were not re-configured for social distancing; sanitation and entry procedures were not instituted; workers were not offered personal protective equipment (PPE); and no plans were made for quarantine of infected workers or isolation of COVID-exposed workers. Lack of paid sick leave for these workers, who earn subsistence wages and whose employment is extremely precarious due to immigration status, added pressure for them to continue to work while infectious. Investigation and enforcement of health and safety was taken on by local health departments rather than the occupational safety and health enforcement agency. Finally, these workers, who live in congregate housing and share transportation, carried the virus from work to community and community to work. We review US laws related to immigration, labor, and occupational health and safety before and during the pandemic, as well as epidemiological data. We will highlight the changes required to address “work” in the web of contagion during an infectious disease epidemic. Protection of workers’ rights, as well as a clearer understanding of the integral connection between workplace and community, will be a likely “side effect” of these efforts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Despite growing popularity, Circular Economy has not reached its full potential. One of the frequently mentioned success factors is the adoption of a Circular Business Model. However, fueled by (too) many constraints, its implementation is often hampered by so-called vicious cycles. Successful Circular Business Models require intensive collaboration between buyers and suppliers, with one of the key questions remaining who takes the initiative and leads the development: buyer or supplier? Methods: Through a single case study combining desk research, interviews, participative observations and analysis of vicious cycles, we investigate how supply chain relationships managed by the supplier can enhance the implementation of Circular Business Models. Results: We show that supplier tactics can relax constraints and break vicious cycles through (1) buyer–supplier relationship management, (2) functional integration of stakeholders and (3) incentive management. We also show that, due to supplier captive conditions, a number of enabling factors are indispensable, namely: (1) the availability of buyer incentives; (2) (joint experimenting to develop) circular knowledge; (3) sharing clear visions on circularity; (4) being transparent in possibilities; and (5) supply chain leadership. Conclusions: As a consequence, strategic trust-based partnerships are a prerequisite for turning vicious cycles into virtuous cycles. Future research should also investigate the role of the buyer, including buyer captive conditions, and how to shape supply chain leadership. Finally, the role of supplier tactics in relation to other success factors next to Circular Business Models needs to be further explored.</jats:p>"

Based on a literature review and the manager’s input, twenty COVID-19 impacts were collected. An integrated approach of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and grey-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (G-DEMATEL) was used to reveal the causal interrelationships among the COVID-19 impacts. Initially, a questionnaire survey was administered among 220 respondents for EFA. Based on the outcome of EFA, the twenty COVID-19 impacts were categorized into seven critical areas. Then, based on the experts’ inputs, G-DEMATEL was utilized to reveal the causal interrelationships among various COVID-19 impacts. The results indicate that disruption management, relationship management, and production management are the top three critical areas that need to be addressed in the COVID-19 crisis. Disruption in supply, ripple effect on supply chain operations, and obsolescence of machines were found to be the most influential impacts while disproportionateness between supply and demand, difficulty in demand forecasting, and reduced cash inflow were found to be the most influenced impacts. This study’s outcomes will help policymakers and supply chain managers develop strategies to restructure supply chain networks. This study is an original contribution to the analysis of COVID-19 impacts in the supply chain activities in India due to the use of EFA and G-DEMATEL. This study considers India only, and hence, the outcomes lack generalizability. A study considering multiple developing countries could generalize these findings.</jats:p>"

The literature review and the examples from experience show that third-party logistic providers have a higher chance to exploit IT since they must share integrated IT systems with their clients. We analyze how e-logistics' relative effectiveness affects the bottom lines of various companies scattered along the distribution chain. Competition nowadays is between supply chains, and there is a growing need for firms to improve operations that affect their performance. The research studied the supply chains of major corporations, to draw substantial results.This resulted in analyzing a whole supply chain from the manufacturer all the way to the consumer. E-logistics tools used in the execution and planning of supply chains were identified, and their effectiveness was evaluated. A questionnaire was sent out to 475 people who were selected at random to be a good cross-section of the population. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression were utilized to analyze the data in this research. We make an effort to draw a picture of the tools' ability to improve the performance of specific businesses by tracing the connection between e-logistics setups and key performance characteristics. The results showed that e-logistics do affect the efficiency of businesses. In addition, the positive effects that IT has had on logistics are highlighted.

Also, the supply chain involves a manufacturer and customers, in which the manufacturer produces and sells products from the manufacturing market. Interestingly, combining forward and reversal strategies presents challenges on both the on-demand and supply sides of the market. When customers purchase products, they are uncertain about the quality of the product, and the manufacturer offers a warranty to assure the customers about the reliability and quality of the products. This paper presents a two-phase News-vendor framework for warranted and non-warranted products with inventory carryover to describe the best manufacturing and re(manufacturing) procedures. The demand is modeled in stochastic nature with one dimensional extended warranty for both new and reman products. Two scenarios are considered to demonstrate the importance of providing an extended warranty. Finally, the numerical analysis concludes that the expected profit affects the manufacturer’s influence when providing a warranty and graphical results reveal that offering an extended warranty and lowering holding expenditure enhances the manufacturer’s expected total profit over two phases.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As a result of the emerging energy crisis and the requirement for countries to utilize more energy derived from renewable sources, demand for renewable energy technologies is likely to rise. Therefore, it is critical that production of such technologies is ramped up in order to meet this demand. However, evidence suggests that engineering and manufacturing companies in the UK are not entering the renewables market at the desired rate and, hence, renewable supply chains currently lack the ability to respond to increased demand due to the lack of businesses willing to move into supplying the renewables sector. Through a three phased research approach, this paper will identify the barriers and risks that are suggested as reasons why companies do not invest and operate within the renewables sector. Through further analysis obtained from the survey work and focus groups, the paper goes on to identify and categorize these barriers and risks in the form of ‘system constraints’ which are then used to construct a current reality tree (CRT) that connects the constraints into a comprehensive characterization map of the sector which suggests why companies fail to enter the renewables supply chain market. The CRT identifies the complex arrangement of issues which act as risks and barriers. These issues include; poor supply chain readiness leading to a company’s inability to respond quickly and correctly to opportunities, a lack of suitable policies and government investment in the renewables infrastructure (which leads to a lack of opportunities for supply-chain companies) and a lack of knowledge of the sector by companies, meaning that supply-chain companies are resistant to investing in the sector for fear of poor return on investment. This work provides key insights into the UK manufacturing supply chain and its attitudes to entering the renewables sector. Furthermore, the paper also applies and evaluates the use of the CRT technique and ascertains its suitability to effectively characterize sector issues and its current problems.</jats:p>"

The article develops a prospective analysis of the opportunities offered by smart technologies regarding the sustainability of the service supply chain. A prospective analysis of the possible alternatives in terms of technological and commercial opportunities but also terms of barriers to the development of technologies is proposed. This approach is guided by a literature review, interviews with experts, and a quantitative study. The prospective vision obtained traces strong development opportunities in artificial intelligence and Big-Data and exposes the strong presence of financial limits and technological risks inherent to sustainable and digital service logistics. This article proposes an original approach in terms of prospective methodology based on the PRODIN method integrating a literary study, semi-directive interviews, and a quantitative questionnaire.</jats:p>"

Therefore, a new stability control model of wind power grid connected is designed. Determine the DC grid connection mode when the wind farm is connected, convert the DC power into AC power through the converter station, and transmit it to the final AC system to realize the grid connection of wind power and power grid; According to the determined wind power access mode, calculate the mechanical operation power, mechanical torque and wind energy utilization coefficient collected by the wind turbine, complete the best collection of wind energy, and determine the shafting according to the mass block model of the wind turbine and generator, so as to realize the research on the mathematical model of wind power generation. By analyzing the power flow direction of the stator and rotor of the wind turbine generator set, the unstable state of the power supply voltage of the wind turbine generator set after grid connection is determined. The PV curve method is used to calculate the steady-state voltage stability of grid connected wind turbines, and a power supply stability control model based on the voltage stability of grid connected wind turbines is established. The nonlinear objective function method is used to optimize the critical point of power supply stability, calculate the maximum load and maximum power of the system, establish the static power supply and transient power supply stability model after wind power grid connection, and realize the power supply stability control research of grid connected wind power through the analysis of power supply characteristics. The experimental results show that the model is closer to the stability of the actual power supply in the test of improving the stability of the power supply, ensuring the quality of power supply, while the test results of the other two methods have large fluctuations. In the analysis of the change of power supply after grid connection, the experimental results obtained by the model are very close to the actual data values. Therefore, this method can effectively improve the performance of power system.</jats:p>"

The satisfaction of their needs is increasingly demanding, essentially associated with the growth of the population's income and the possibility of improvements in terms of comfort, quality, and safety at lower costs. However, despite the accuracy of engineering design, the functional performance of the building's water networks does not always match the expectations because it can be subjected to failures, which can compromise other infrastructures and cause a lot of inconvenience to the residents or users. In this case, we can say that the water supply system is no longer reliable. In the study presented in this article, profiles were developed that make easier the assessment of the reliability of the installation, specifying key aspects involved, which may be called performance indicators. The indicators combined in a balanced way according to their importance make it possible to translate the relevant aspects regarding the operation of the water supply systems in the building and their reliability. In this sense, it is expected to contribute to the improvement and durability of building installations, regarding the water supply's performance, security, and quality.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>People with type 1 diabetes require insulin, a lifesaving and essential medication, to maintain their blood sugar levels below dangerous levels. Unfortunately, the insulin industry faces supply and affordability issues, and patients and their families face an enormous burden. As a result of high prices and lack of availability, individuals are turning to other options for purchasing insulin, such as online pharmacies, which may or may not be legitimate. Despite the necessity of safe insulin for diabetics in the legitimate Pharmaceutical Supply Chain (PSC), few researchers have considered implementing strategies to maximize patient safety for purchasing insulin. Therefore, the current research seeks to bridge this gap and provide cohesive information on overcoming this challenge and maximizing insulin safety. This study employs a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) model that combines Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) metrics, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to develop a model that can prioritize and select the best criteria for maximizing insulin safety and achieving the study objective. A comparison of two insulin supply chain scenarios was performed. As a result of this research, adding a traceability technology to the insulin supply chain, specifically blockchain (T42) in scenario 2 provides the best results to the supply chain for maximizing and ensuring the safety of insulin, as compared to scenario 1, where the final score achieved almost 71%. This research provides a useful tool for assessing the safety of other critical goods that customers value in strategic and complex decision-making. Academics, professionals, and decision-makers can benefit from this research using a rigorous scientific decision-support system.</jats:p>"

The third deep-water port in Pakistan, Gwadar, plays a significant part in trade between the Gulf countries, Africa, China, United Arab Emirates, and Cordillera Administrative Region. However, the load Shedding of 12-16 hours in Gwadar is the most concerning issue. Pakistan imports 70 MW of electricity from Iran. The wind and solar system are already installed but for a limited residential area. In Gwadar, there are enough renewable energy resources that can be utilized for electricity generation. In this context, a Techno and Economic Analysis is performed using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) Pro. Two models are considered for this study. Model-1 includes PV/Wind Turbine/ and Battery while Model-2 consists of PV/Wind Turbine/Converter and Grid. The yearly energy generated by Model-1 and Model-2 is 57.37 GWh and 81.5 GWh, respectively. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for Model-1 and Model-2 is respectively $0.401/kWh and $0.0347/kWh. It is shown that the simple payback of Model-1 is of 6.70 years, and the simple payback of Model-2 is 7.77 years. Due to the high LCOE of Model-1, its payback year is lesser than model-2. All of these facts indicate that Model 2 is the most optimal solution.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Almost every supplier faces uncertain and time-varying demand. E-commerce and online shopping have given suppliers unprecedented access to data on customers’ behavior, which sheds light on demand uncertainty. The main purpose of this research project is to provide an analytic tool for decentralized supply channel members to devise optimal long-term (multi-period) supply, pricing, and timing strategies while catering to stochastic demand in a diverse set of market scenarios. Despite its ubiquity in potential applications, the time-dependent channel optimization problem in its general form has received limited attention in the literature due to its complexity and the highly nested structure of its ensuing equilibrium problems. However, there are many scenarios where a single-period channel optimization solution may turn out to be myopic as it does not consider the after-effects of current pricing on future demand. To remedy this typical shortcoming, using general memory functions, we include the strategic customers’ cognitive bias toward pricing history in the supply channel equilibrium problem. In the form of two constructive theorems, we provide explicit solution algorithms for the ensuing Nash–Stackelberg equilibrium problems. In particular, we prove that our recursive solution algorithm can find equilibria in the multi-periodic variation of many standard supply channel contracts such as wholesale, buyback, and revenue-sharing contracts.</jats:p>"

The bed sediment materials with close median diameter values and different non-uniformities were utilized to investigate the scour at various crossing angles. The results were also compared with the equivalent single jet. The proper novel relationships were presented to predict the scour hole depth, and dimensions. The results showed that at a crossing angle of 30° with low and medium tailwater depth, the scour depth increases with increasing the non-uniformity of the bed materials. At the crossing angle of 30°, the armor layer was created perfectly that was thick on the bottom of the scour hole, but for the crossing angles of 70° and 110° it was thin and was a mixture of the coarse and fine particles. At low tailwater depth at the crossing angles of 70° and 110°, by increasing the non-uniformity of the sediments, the scour tended to be more asymmetric. At the high tailwater depth, for the crossing angles of 70° and 110° the scouring was less than that of the crossing angle of 30° and single jet.</jats:p>",

While the full complexities of the relationship between inequality, COVID-19 and water in South Africa are still unfolding, the importance of access to water emerged early on in the pandemic, and catalysed an emergency response from the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). This article analyses the impact of the DWS' COVID-19 response in three ways. Firstly, the available data on the provision of tanks and tankers is examined to highlight the importance of a reliable monitoring system. Secondly, the dangers of prioritising short-term action at the expense of long-term sustainability are discussed with reference to the twin challenges of further reduced municipal revenue and redirected funds. Thirdly, the implications of a future cessation of emergency water supply is considered. This analysis provides evidence and perspectives to guide the post-COVID-19 transition from emergency to routine water services provision, and distils lessons which might be applied to the approaching challenge of water services provision in the context of climate change.</jats:p>"

Considering that consumers have heterogeneous preferences for virtual technologies, we investigate a virtual product supply chain consisting of a brand owner, a virtual technology platform, and consumers (where the virtual technology platform has superior information about consumer preferences). We develop a signaling game model with preference information signaled by the virtual technology investment to study the optimal information-sharing strategy for the virtual product supply chain. We find that the virtual technology platform always prefers information sharing without paying any signaling cost. Moreover, we also observe that the brand owner and the platform can achieve alignment, that is, when consumers are more likely to prefer virtual technology, both the brand owner and the virtual technology platform are better off if the virtual technology platform chooses to share information with the brand owner. Finally, we analyze the consumer welfare and find that when consumers are moderately likely to prefer virtual technology, consumers can gain more benefits in the information-sharing scenario.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the single-phase MMC mathematical model is established, and the power compensation characteristics of MMC-RPC are derived. Secondly, the Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) control strategy is adopted to provide inertial support. Compared with the double closed loop (DCL) control, it has better anti-disturbance and dynamic performance. Then, based on the VSG control, a two-stage circulating current suppression strategy is proposed, in which Quasi-Proportional Complex Integral (QPCI) control is used to suppress the bridge arm circulating current, and integrated Proportional Integral-Quasi Proportional Resonant (PI-QPR) control is an improvement of the VSG control to further suppress the circulating current inside the VSG. Furthermore, the virtual DC motor (VDCM) strategy was proposed to control the charge and discharge of the distributed SC connected to MMC-RPC to recycle railway braking energy. Finally, simulation results of the VSG small signal model and the MMC-RPC simulation model on the Matlab/Simulink platform verify the effectiveness, stability of VDCM and improved VSG controls in the MMC-RPC.</jats:p>"

The bed and suspended loads are ejected with minimal flushing water through the slit with the same efficacy as any other alternative extractor. The whirling flow phenomena through the vortex duct are very complex, so ordinary classical models have results contrary to required design guidelines. So, the machine learning (ML) models of the artificial neural network (ANN), deep neural network (DNN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), stacked ensemble (SE), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) are used to predict vortex tube trapping efficiency (VTE). The input dataset takes the size of the sediment (Sz), concentration (I) of the sediment, the ratio of slit thickness to diameter of the tube (th/dia), and extraction ratio (Extro) while trapping efficiency (TE) is taken as output. Based on statistical assessments, GBM appears to be better than all proposed models. However, other proposed ML models give comparable performance. The classical models, multivariate linear, and nonlinear regression techniques also provide comparatively good results. According to sensitivity analyses, the extraction ratio is the most relevant parameter in evaluating the VTE.</jats:p>",

The article uses social network model and GARCH model to study the contagion effect of energy supply chain finance risk from both enterprise creditworthiness and economic environment. The social network model is used to analyze the degree of differentiation of the supply chain network and the correlation between node enterprises before and after the implementation of the \"double carbon\" target, using the asset-liability ratio of enterprises as the default risk indicator. The GARCH model was used to empirically analyze the risk contagion effect between CSI energy and Shanghai and Shenzhen stock indices from the perspective of economic environment. The study found that there is a significant correlation and contagion effect between the financial risks of silicon energy enterprises, and the enterprises with higher creditworthiness are less affected by the implementation of the \"double carbon\" target plan, and the supply chain network is more obviously centralized by the \"double carbon\" target. The results of GARCH model show that the energy market is influenced by the external economic environment and there is risk contagion effect between markets. Based on the results of the GARCH model, we provide policy recommendations for supply chain risk prevention and control.</jats:p>"

In this study an attempt has been made to evaluate the existing water supply system in the Khulna City Corporation (KCC) area regarding water supply installations and their capacity, water consumption pattern, satisfaction level of water supply and water demand-supply analysis. Structured and open-ended interview schedule were used as primary data collection tool. A two stage stratified random sampling was adopted and some statistical conventional techniques were used to analyze the data. The study reveals a wide gap between water supply and demand in KCC area. Again, the study shows that above 90% people use tube well (shallow and deep) water for drinking instead of supplied pipe water. It is shown that most people are not satisfied with quality and quantity of the supplied water for their daily usages. This study suggests to adopt the appropriate policy measures in order to safeguard the interest of the people for water supply, which would eventually improves the living and socio-economic conditions of the people in the study area.</jats:p>"

This social welfare vector is a representation of a supply chain with one supplier, many producers, and one retailer. The provider may determine whether a product line design is a Pareto optimum with the use of the social welfare vector and a multi-criteria model built on the principles of data envelopment analysis (DEA). The study findings came up with an alternate solution approach for upstream suppliers to achieve Pareto optimum product line design in huge data set scenarios.

This study aims to develop a new framework to compare the different formulas currently used for the evaluation of local scour. For this purpose, 18 distinctly different formulas are selected and then evaluated using a large set of field-measured scour data. The rating is pronounced along three main streambed granulometric distributions. The validation process is performed using the Analytical Network Process approach (ANP), in which the already available conventional weights are re-evaluated and updated using various analyses, notably in terms of statistics, sensitivity, and correlation. The validation and comparison results of these 18 scour formulas reveal that the efficiency of a given particular formula depends on the type of stream soil studied. Furthermore, the scour formulas that include parameters having a geometrical dimension provide better performances.</jats:p>",

To eliminate the double marginalization effect between supply chain parties, a two-part linear tariff contract is introduced for coordination. The results show that information sharing is always profitable for the manufacturer, but not for the retailer. The inventory and shortage costs will reduce the manufacturer's optimal pricing and fresh-keeping effort level. When the manufacturer overestimates the market demand predicted by the retailer, asymmetric information will increase the manufacturer’s inventory.

This has an unnecessary environmental impact, indicating not only the potential for more energy-efficient solutions but also the challenges that need to be understood. The purpose of this article is to increase the knowledge of challenges in applying different types of more or less energy-efficient CLSCs for flat glass. Through a literature review, an overview of CLSC types, together with challenges in different areas, is provided. The CLSC types and challenges are corroborated in a flat glass context, including focus groups and expert interviews. Four CLSC types—two CLSCs based on remanufacturing, one on reconditioning, and one on reuse—are identified. A framework provides implications for both literature and practice. It contains 19 challenges—such as lack of large-scale actors, lack of material knowledge, lack of knowledge of customers’ behavior, lack of promotion of flat glass CLSCs at many levels in society—in terms of both legislation and cost—and lack of business models—structured in four areas—material characteristics and quality, inefficient logistics systems, demand and supply, and means of control and costs. The least-applied CLSC includes almost every challenge and has a large upscaling potential, indicating the necessity of mitigating challenges. The framework identifies challenges not included in earlier flat glass literature. CLSC types are related to different challenge set-ups and different energy efficiency potentials, leading to expanded CLSC knowledge. One additional implication is that practitioners can identify potential CLSC types and understand their challenges from the perspective of several stakeholders. The participatory research methodology fills a methodological research gap within CLSC literature and provides important insights.</jats:p>"

A sequential, exploratory mixed-methods approach was employed, combining key-informant interviews with a reduced form of discrete choice analysis—best-worst scaling. The findings highlight that while Australian and Chinese travel intermediaries differed significantly in terms of their preferences regarding the different CSR factors, they were unanimous in regard to their belief that commitment to CSR was critical to firm performance. The research also reports universal support for a partial-mediating relationship, suggesting that firm performance is enhanced by strong alignment in the CSR orientation of supply chain intermediaries. This finding reinforces the inter-dependent nature of tourism supply chains, emphasizing that firms and society can benefit from supply chain partners working more closely together.</jats:p>"

The study investigates the relationship between Non-Cash Transactions (through APMK and E-money proxies), National Income (GDP), Money Supply (M0), and Velocity of Money with the Vector Auto Regression method. The data was used from 2010 to 2021 at three different times, before Covid-19 and during Covid-19. Our result confirms that there was a relationship between money supply and non-cash transactions, the positive response occurred in all periods, and the negative response occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic. National income positively impacts money supply and velocity of money during all periods and Covid-19. It implicates that electronic money should be increased because it accelerates the circulation of money and can increase the flow of goods and services.How to Cite:Ferlicia, S., Suhel, S., &amp; Andaiyani, S, (2022).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the incentives of firms to share demand information in two competing supply chains. We consider a model in which each supply chain consists of a manufacturer and a retailer, and the manufacturers decide their products’ carbon emissions reduction levels. Through information sharing, manufacturers can adjust their wholesale price and the level of carbon emissions reduction according to the demand signal. The results reveal that information sharing always benefits the manufacturer. Information-sharing arrangements are more likely to occur when the manufacturer’s carbon emissions reduction efficiency or the customer’s low-carbon product preference is relatively high. Moreover, under Cournot competition, the retailer’s incentive to share information increases when information is less accurate or the competition is less intense. By sharing demand information, manufacturers will invest more in reducing the carbon emissions of their products. Therefore, there are two effects of information sharing: the “economic effect” on the benefits of all parties and the “environmental effect” on reducing carbon emissions. Our findings highlight the economic and environmental incentives of information sharing in the supply chain and the synthesis impacts of low-carbon preferences, efficiency of carbon emissions reduction, and the competition intensity on the retailer’s incentives to share information.</jats:p>"

As a result, the dairy industry needs to improve its operational efficiencies by implementing effective optimization techniques. Conventional and emerging optimization techniques have already gained momentum in the dairy industry. This study’s objective was to explore the optimization techniques developed for or implemented in the dairy supply chain (DSC) and to investigate how these techniques can improve the DSC. Methods: A systematic review approach based on PRISMA guidelines were adopted to conduct this review. The authors used descriptive statistics for statistical analysis. Results: Modernization has led the dairy industry to improve its operational efficiencies by implementing the most effective optimization techniques. Researchers have used mathematical modeling-based methods and are shifting to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) -based approaches in the DSC. The mathematical modeling-based techniques remain dominant (56% of articles), but AI and ML-based techniques are gaining traction (used in around 44% of articles). Conclusions: The review findings show insight into the benefits and implications of optimization techniques in the DSC. This research shows how optimization techniques are associated with every phase of the DSC and how new technologies have affected the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) is the process of adding a reverse supply chain to the traditional forward supply chain. It has a positive effect on reducing environmental pollution, and therefore many governments have introduced relevant policies to encourage enterprises to develop CLSCs. Among them, the reward–penalty policy (RPP) for the recovery rate of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is considered better. At the corporate level, the development of CLSCs can enhance the social responsibility awareness of the enterprise and effectively enhance the corporate image. Therefore, in order to study the decision making and recycling channel selection of CLSCs that consider corporate social responsibility (CSR) under the government’s RPP, this paper constructs a two-stage CLSC, including a manufacturer, a retailer, a third-party recycler, and the government. By adopting the Stackelberg game method, we determine the optimal results of the three models and draw a series of conclusions: (1) when the manufacturer is responsible for recycling WEEE, the profit is the largest, and it shows an increasing trend as the government’s reward–penalty coefficient increases; (2) the manufacturer recycling model enables the manufacturer to obtain the maximum CSR investment level, followed by the third-party recycler recycling model, and the smallest is the retailer recycling model; and (3) the government tends to build third-party recycling agencies, which is conducive to improving the level of contribution to GDP. The conclusion of this paper has certain management inspirations for the decision making of the enterprise and the formulation of government policies.</jats:p>"

Nonetheless, despite the substantial quantity of research, conclusions are still dispersed and occasionally even inconsistent. Because customers' assessments of service quality vary widely, the goal of this study is to demonstrate analytically and empirically how the SERVQUAL dimensions are coherent across service industries and even within the same service industry.

For people all across the world, groundwater is a vital source of water. Physical, chemical, and biological aspects determine the amount and quality of groundwater for human consumption and irrigation. People in some parts of the world are experiencing true water scarcity because groundwater is used faster than it is regularly recharged. Groundwater contamination must be remediated, because people's general well-being and prosperity are inextricably linked to their ability to obtain sufficient amounts of high-quality water. This study is an attempt to have insight into the role of nanotechnology for groundwater remediation. This study shows that nano remediation has the ability to minimize time and lower pollutants concentration to near zero by cleaning contaminated areas in situ. However, there are questions about safe disposal and long-term impact on the environment. Green Nanoparticles (GNP) are an alternative that are made with environmentally friendly procedures and materials, resulting in less waste. They also have the advantage of being environmentally friendly and sustainable.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The agri-food supply chain is responsible for high GHG emissions. In industrial food processing, there is potential for reducing environmental impacts. In the case of apricot jam, several practices for realizing the finished product can be adopted. If, on the one hand, the scientific literature provides detailed studies on the economic aspects of the existing practices, on the other hand, a comprehensive assessment of the most common production practices from an environmental perspective is not provided. Apricot jam production can be based on two different kinds of raw materials: fresh fruit and the so-called “semi-finished product”, which is obtained by treating fresh fruits with mechanical and thermal processes. The most extended shelf-life of the semi-finished product allows for the adoption of more flexible production practices, leading to increased production performance and ensuring more efficient transportation strategies. In environmental terms, the convenience of this approach compared to adopting fresh fruit is questionable. The aim of this paper is to compare the environmental impacts due to these two different production and transport practices of apricot jam. Consistent with this end, a Life Cycle Assessment methodology has been adopted to evaluate the environmental impact of each step in the apricot jam supply chain. Research results suggest that the use of fresh apricots in the production of jams has a lower environmental impact (about 50–65% without considering transport activities) than the use of semi-finished products, and that losses due to the short shelf-life of fresh fruit limits the transportation distance of the raw and fresh material, also depending on the transport mode adopted (in the range of 875–4450 km). This highlights the need to adopt more clean and sustainable practices in the current industrial food processes.</jats:p>"

An analysis of responses to COVID-19-related challenges in agriculture and meat-processing pinpoints similarities and differences between the two industries, offering lessons for workers’ health and safety, and for the improvement of the FSC's systemic resilience. Agriculture and meat-processing were highlighted as “essential” during the COVID-19 syndemic in Germany. In agriculture, amidst lockdowns and border closures, special arrangements allowed permits for migrant workers to harvest seasonal and perishable produce, thus ensuring food supply and mitigating economic loss. Bilateral agreeements with countries neighbouring the EU were concluded to increase temporary labor migration for seasonal work; while COVID-19 specific occupational health standards were set. In meat-processing, which emerged as a hotbed for COVID-19 in Germany, the public debate problematized the contradictions between migrant workers’ essential contribution to the economy on the one hand, and their poor working and living conditions on the other hand. Here, the pandemic led to new legislation, prohibiting subcontracting in the meat processing industry and requiring higher standards for the housing of temporary migrant workers. While the long-term outcomes of these reforms remain to be seen, enforcement of health standards and other social rights will need attention. The German case, thus, underscores the importance of structural changes for ensuring social protection and dignified working conditions for labor migrants, which can, in turn, improve fairness, sustainability and systemic resilience of the FSC.</jats:p>",

In current approaches to cold supply chain risk evaluation, there is a lack of systematic classification and quantitative analysis of the influences of risk factors in the chain. To accurately evaluate unknown risks that can exert a fluctuating influence and result in great losses, this study builds a knowledge base of expert systems based on expertise and extensive experience and modifies the expert weights in conjunction with entropy weights to reduce subjective error. An ordered weighted average (OWA) operator is used to evaluate risk in a cold supply chain effectively. First, in combination with a case study of a typical fresh food e‐commerce enterprise, a typical fresh food e‐commerce enterprise, this paper identifies the risks in a food refrigeration supply chain. Second, relying on an expert group with professional knowledge and rich experience, an expert system knowledge base is constructed, risks are assigned, and the expert weight is modified in combination with the entropy weight method. Finally, based on the OWA operator, the modified risk assignment is effectively evaluated, and the risk value is obtained and sorted. Specific risk control measures are put forward according to the results of the calculation. The results show that an evaluation method combining an expert system knowledge base and the entropy‐OWA method can effectively depict and process the evaluation information needed for risk rankings and solve the problems of supply chain risks more rapidly and effectively.</jats:p>",

This paper focuses on the citrus fruit supply chain network. The novelty of this study is the proposal of a mathematical model for a three-echelon AFSCN considering simultaneously CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions, coefficient water, and time window. Additionally, a bi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming is formulated for production–distribution-inventory-allocation problem. The model seeks to minimise the total cost and CO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> emission simultaneously. To solve the multi-objective model in this paper, the Augmented Epsilon-constraint method is utilised for small- and medium-sized problems. The Augmented Epsilon-constraint method is not able to solve large-scale problems due to its high computational time. This method is a well-known approach to dealing with multi-objective problems. It allows for producing a set of Pareto solutions for multi-objective problems. Multi-Objective Ant Colony Optimisation, fast Pareto genetic algorithm, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, and multi-objective simulated annealing are used to solve the model. Then, a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm called Hybrid multi-objective Ant Colony Optimisation with multi-objective Simulated Annealing (HACO-SA) is developed to solve the model. In the HACO-SA algorithm, an initial temperature and temperature reduction rate is utilised to ensure a faster convergence rate and to optimise the ability of exploitation and exploration as input data of the SA algorithm. The computational results show the superiority of the Augmented Epsilon-constraint method in small-sized problems, while HACO-SA indicates that is better than the suggested original algorithms in the medium- and large-sized problems.</jats:p>"

The WPP-SCND decision system minimizes the total supply chain (SC) cost of the system while also reducing carbon emissions associated with wood pellet SC activities. All objective parameters, including biomass availability at the supply terminals, market demand, and biomass production, are considered fuzzy to account for epistemic uncertainty. A fuzzy flexible robust possibilistic programming (fuzzy-FRPP) technique is developed for solving the suggested uncertain WPP-SCND model. The case findings show that the imprecise nature of the parameters has a significant impact on the strategic and tactical decisions in the wood pellet SC. By investing almost 10% of the total cost, robust decisions within the wood pellet SC can be obtained. It is established that the fuzzy-FRPP technique successfully provides robust decisions and achieves a balance between transportation costs, emissions costs, and economies of scale when making capacity decisions. Although the suggested decision support system is used to manage the production and distribution of wood pellets, the insights and solution methodology may be extended to the production of other biofuels. The proposed research may be valuable to authorities involved in planning large-scale wood pellet-related production-distribution projects.</jats:p>"

Armed with new technologies and techniques, you can effectively influence the economic performance of an enterprise. Therefore, the development of new pricing methods in digital economy is not only an urgent task, but also necessary in the daily activities of business entities. The article describes a price function development model using the main parameters of supply and demand and the generalized Hooke’s law, as the closest one to display the processes of its state. Formulas are given to determine the price and its constituent parameters, taking into account supply and demand indicators, at which it becomes unprofitable for a seller to increase the amount of profit, and to increase the volume of consumption for a consumer. The results obtained allow trading and manufacturing companies during the period of economy digitalization, together with the involvement of financiers and IT experts, to automate the process of calculation and construction of retail prices for their products and move away from manual modeling of these parameters.&#x0D;\nPurpose is to find, as a first approximation, a mathematical expression of the price, taking into account supply and demand indicators, at which it becomes unprofitable for a seller to increase the amount of profit, and it becomes unprofitable for a consumer to increase the volume of consumption.&#x0D;\nMethodology: the article describes a model for a price function development using the main parameters of supply and demand and the generalized Hooke’s law.&#x0D;\nResults: the results obtained allow us to predict profit taking into account the state of demand, while the price of a product may differ significantly from the price calculated by the classical method at the same costs.&#x0D;\nPractical implication: it is advisable to apply the obtained results for automated calculation and modeling of retail prices for products.</jats:p>"

One way in which this can be accomplished is to apply the possibility of device recovery through high-level disinfection and sterilization (a process referred to as ‘reprocessing’). As increasing emphasis is being placed on reducing health care-generated emissions, several major OEMs of single-use medical devices have extended their business to reprocessing services, taking a green servitization orientation. The present paper examines the trend towards green servitization in the single-use medical device industry. It uses interviews with industry experts, complemented with information from secondary sources, to explore how the green servitization phenomenon is supporting the transition of the industry to a more sustainable economic model. The findings provide insights into the green servitization endeavors of device OEMs as regards services offered, strategic intents, dominant business models, use of collaborative relationships and capability requirements. The paper reveals that single-use device OEMs may have started to understand the perspective and the long-term market share gains of combining a service model and a manufacturing model, making reprocessing an integrated part of how they think about how to design, produce and deliver their products.</jats:p>"

Observations suggest that river discharge and valley‐wall lithology are the main controls on valley width. Yet, current models based on these observations fail to explain the full range of cross‐sectional valley shapes in nature, suggesting hitherto unquantified controls on valley width. In particular, current models cannot explain the existence of paired terrace sequences that form under cyclic climate forcing. Paired river terraces are staircases of abandoned floodplains on both valley sides, and hence preserve past valley widths. Their formation requires alternating phases of predominantly river incision and predominantly lateral planation, plus progressive valley narrowing. While cyclic Quaternary climate changes can explain shifts between incision and lateral erosion, the driving mechanism of valley narrowing is unknown. Here, we extract valley geometries from climatically formed, alluvial river‐terrace sequences and show that across our dataset, the total cumulative terrace height (here: total valley height) explains 90%–99% of the variance in valley width at the terrace sites. This finding suggests that valley height, or a parameter that scales linearly with valley height, controls valley width in addition to river discharge and lithology. To explain this valley‐width‐height relationship, we reformulate existing valley‐width models and suggest that, when adjusting to new boundary conditions, alluvial valleys evolve to a width at which sediment removal from valley walls matches lateral sediment supply from hillslope erosion. Such a hillslope‐channel coupling is not captured in current valley‐evolution models. Our model can explain the existence of paired terrace sequences under cyclic climate forcing and relates valley width to measurable field parameters. Therefore, it facilitates the reconstruction of past climatic and tectonic conditions from valley topography.</jats:p>",

This experiment reveals the wear mechanism of the micro-texture surface under different initial oil film thickness, and establishes the lubrication state control model of the micro-texture surface. The results show that the velocity and initial oil film thickness have a more significant effect on the friction properties of the micro-texture surface. When the velocity is less than 0.06 m/s, the contact surface has been in the semi-dry friction state with the initial oil film thickness increases, the COF decreases by up to 13.32%, and the micro-textured surface produces abrasive wear, adhesive wear, and fatigue wear. When the velocity is more significant than 0.06 m/s, as the initial oil film thickness increases, the contact surface transits from the semi-dry friction state to the boundary lubrication state, and the COF decreases by up to 44.96%. When the velocity increases to 0.18 m/s and the initial oil film thickness is more significant than 19.8 µm, the micro-texture has a hydrodynamic pressure effect and the contact surface in the mixed lubrication state.

More importantly, the health performance of manufacturing employees may also be affected by unsustainable production practices in the industry. Therefore, the green supply chain management (GSCM) practice has become a topical issue in recent decades due to its significant impact on the ecosystem at large. Via green practices, various performances have been achieved in organisations; meanwhile, the relationships between the practices and performance metrics in most developing countries are unclear, although there have been supposed general submissions. In addition, the study of relationships in a leading business conglomerate in developing nations is rare. Therefore, this paper investigated relationships between GSCM practices and performance metrics in a leading manufacturing organisation in Africa by using a close-up study approach with data collected from 154 respondents. The data were analysed using multiple methods such as factor analysis to consolidate the measured variables; correlation, multiple regression analysis with stepwise estimation, and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to examine the relationships between GSCM practices and performance. The results of these analyses revealed that environmental performance is significantly predicted by the measure of the organisation’s commitment to GSCM vision, while financial performance is significantly impacted by eco-centric consumption and education. This study concludes that inhouse-drafted strategies based on the insight from the study will facilitate the optimisation of GSCM practices.</jats:p>"

Drawing upon the service‐dominant logic of marketing and using an empirical research approach, we developed supply chain structure maps for nine service firms. Our findings indicate that the supply chain structure maps of service companies are comparable to those in the product‐based literature, which supports the service‐dominant logic. Then, we identified the six key processes that constitute a framework to manage service supply chains. The customer relationship management and the supplier relationship management processes form the critical links in the supply chain, and the other four processes are coordinated through this linkage. The SCM framework for services provides direction for executives in service firms who need to increase cross‐functional integration within their firms and with other members of the supply chain. For academics, 12 avenues for future research are identified.</jats:p>",

Such predictions have attracted much attention due to their tremendous importance and the challenge of determining them accurately. Over recent decades, based on diverse methods, researchers have developed many relevant analytical solutions. Considering these research efforts, this article identifies and describes the most critical key factors that strongly influence the accuracy of groundwater inflow predictions in rock tunnels. In addition, it presents a synthesis of the latest advances in analytical solutions developed for this purpose. These key factors are mainly time dependency of groundwater inflows, water-bearing structures, aquifer thickness, hydraulic head and groundwater drawdown, rock permeability and hydraulic conductivity, fracture aperture, and rainfall data. For instance, groundwater inflows into tunnels comprise two stages. However, the transition between the stages is not always rapid and, for tunnels located in faulted karst terrains and water-rich areas, groundwater inflows can exceed 1,000 L/min/m. Under high stress, rock permeability can increase up to three times near the inevitable excavation-damaged zones, and groundwater inflows into tunnels can be significantly affected. Despite the enormous amount of research already conducted, improvements in the accuracy of predicting groundwater inflows into rock tunnels are still needed and strongly suggested.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, the study was carried out in five steps and the sample size consists of 47 companies as pilot data and 426 companies for the main data. These steps consist of item generation and purification, pilot test, initial identification of dimensionality, dimensionality confirmation and convergent validity assessment. As a result of the study, a new scale with a single factor structure was developed. The study ends with the evaluation of the findings. Correcting the lack of a measurement tool developed in this field in the literature is the theoretical contribution of the study.

This fmincon toolbox from MATLAB attempts to find a constrained minimum of a scalar function of several variables starting at an initial estimate. This is generally referred to as constrained nonlinear optimization or nonlinear programming. The objective in OPF problem is to minimize the total cost function of generating units and the transmission losses, while maintaining the design and performance of the entire power system, satisfying the operational requirements such as the real and reactive power outputs of the generating units, bus voltages and power flow of transmission lines…etc. This project presents the most optimal solution of power flow incorporating wind generation cost, to supply power to a new domestic load located at the outskirts of an industrial area for three different scenarios. This residential is typical of long rural line with isolated load area. The challenge in our case study is to incorporate a wind generation unit as one type of green energy, that are currently being considered as an alternative source of power, to feed this long rural line for the domestic load without effecting in the total generation cost. A case study is carried out for three different scenarios incorporating wind generation cost. The results of OPF in this project shows that incorporating wind generation unit as renewable energy source with the entire power system will have a minimum generation cost and minimum transmission losses for the entire power system even if the wind generation cost assumed to be the most expensive one comparing with other conventional generation units. This project report provides implementation of Algorithm for the entire power load flow using the fast decoupled power flow (FDPF) and optimizes the best solution for the three different scenarios by using fmincon Interior Point Algorithm as one of optimization toolbox to achieve the minimum total cost function of generating units and minimum transmission losses.</jats:p>"

In this paper, under a series of experimental aeration conditions in standing water, it was concluded that aeration had a positively promoting effect on releases of supersaturated DO and TDG, while aeration aperture and aeration depth had inhibitory effects on them. For single factor analysis, aeration had the greatest effect on the release of DO and TDG, the second effect on DO was that of aeration depth and the smallest effect was that of aeration aperture, but the second effect on TDG was that of aeration aperture and the smallest effect was that of aeration depth. Most importantly, the release coefficient of DO was greater than that of TDG, and a quantitative relationship between the release coefficient of DO and TDG and aeration conditions, respectively, was established. An exponential function relationship of the release coefficients of DO and TDG was also established. The results of the research have important guiding significance and theoretical value for reducing the harm caused by supersaturated DO and TDG.</jats:p>",

Previous research documents that suppliers could collaborate with or be exploited by powerful major customers. I expect that suppliers with high-ability managers are perceived to be with more favorable future prospects to fulfill contractual obligations and thus possess stronger bargaining power. As a result, these suppliers could resist rent extraction from major customers and achieve supply chain collaboration, making it beneficial for them to operate with a concentrated customer base. Using a comprehensive sample of supply chain links, I hypothesize and find a positive association between managerial ability and customer concentration. I also find that suppliers with more able managers are more likely to continue their existing supply chain relationships. This paper extends the implications of managerial ability to the supply chain setting and adds to the understanding of collaboration/competition between suppliers and customers. </jats:p>",

Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the shortage of medical materials. Based on this, we investigate the tradeoff of the critical medical devices refurbishing strategies when blockchain is used in three different structures: manufacturer refurbishing, retailer refurbishing, and third-party refurbishing in the two-period refurbishing strategies. We find that the manufacturer always benefits from the adoption of blockchain technology strategy in the manufacturer refurbishing scenario. However, for the retailer in the second period, the retailer references the adoption of blockchain only if the willingness to pay is extremely high. Additionally, when the medical supply chain channel member chooses retailer refurbishing or third-party strategy, the manufacturer always likes to use blockchain technology. That’s because it will help the information value spillover from the retailer to the manufacturer, which leads the manufacturer to get more profits and a lower profit for the retailer. However, in the retailer refurbishing or third-part strategy, the whole channel profits are higher than not adopting blockchain technology. Therefore, business managers can be based on our research to achieve profits Pareto-improving.</jats:p>"

A few Banks or financial institutions in Bangladesh are implementing the concepts of Financial Supply Chain Management to provide benefits to the buyers (Anchors) and suppliers (Vendors). We explored the benefits and challenges of FSC from the management perspective of Bangladesh. The researchers made an effort to support our findings through a case study involving three parties: Bank Asia, Banga Millers limited (a sister concern of PRAN Company), and marginal suppliers. The researchers establish that trios can benefit if a strong Financial Supply Chain system can be established with the help of the latest computer software like VEEFIN. Researchers are aware of the fact that technology makes data transparent and does transaction settlement more successfully. The main objective of this paper is to discover the loopholes and challenges to popularizing the concept of Financial Supply Chain Management in Bangladesh's perspective, to search for benefits for the stakeholders on account of implementing a Financial Supply Chain, and also to find out the potentiality of FSC in Bangladesh perspective in the coming years. The Researchers also made a forecast to identify the amount of disbursement through the Banks or financial institutions five years later to explore the scenario of FSC flow and found that the disbursement amount will be equivalent to twenty core takas by using the least square method. The findings of this research can help financial institutions and banks in favor to introduce the Financial Supply Chain in their organization to provide better services and enhance customer satisfaction.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the unpredictable nature of renewable sources such as sun and wind, the integration of such sources to a grid is complicated. However, a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) can solve this problem. Constructing a reliable HRES in remote areas is essential. Therefore, this paper proposes a new methodology incorporating a crow search algorithm (CSA) for optimizing the scale of an HRES installed in a remote area. The constructed system comprises photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines (WTs), batteries, and diesel generators (DGs). The target is to achieve the most economical and efficient use of renewable energy sources (RESs). The CSA is used as it is simple in implementation, it only requires a few parameters, and it has a high flexibility. The designed system is constructed to serve an electrical load installed in the northeastern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The load data are provided by the Saudi Electricity Company, including those of the Aljouf region (Sakaka, Alqurayyat, Tabarjal, Dumat Aljandal, and its villages) and the northern border region (Arar, Tarif, Rafha, and its affiliated villages). The temperature, irradiance, and wind speed of the Aljouf region (latitude 29.764° and longitude 40.01°) are collected from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) from 1 January to 31 December 2020. Three design factors are considered: the PV number, the WT number, and the number of days of battery autonomy (AD). We compared our results to the reported approaches of an elephant herding optimizer (EHO), a grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), a Harris hawks optimizer (HHO), a seagull optimization algorithm (SOA), and a spotted hyena optimizer (SHO). Moreover, the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) is calculated to assess the constructed system’s reliability. The proposed COA succeeded in achieving the best fitness values of 0.03883 USD/kWh, 0.03863 USD/kWh, and 0.04585 USD/kWh for PV/WT/battery, PV/battery, and WT/battery systems, respectively. The obtained results confirmed the superiority of the proposed approach in providing the best configuration of an HRES compared to the others.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of procurement contract management on sustainable performance of state corporations in Kenya.&#x0D;\nMethodology: The research design used in this research was mixed-methods research design. The study focused on 187 state corporation as the target population. Census was applied where all state corporations were surveyed and purposive sampling was used to pick the finance manager and the procurement manager which resulted to 374 respondents. The study main source of data was primary data which was gathered using research questionnaires. The gathered data was assessed with the help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 28. The study carried out both descriptive and inferential analysis to draw conclusions.&#x0D;\nResults: The inferential analysis results revealed that procurement contract management had a significant and positive influence on the sustainable performance of state corporations in Kenya at p&lt;0.05. This indicates that contract preparation, contract administration, contract control and monitoring and contract conflicts resolution mechanisms are crucial drivers of sustainable performance of an organization. The model summary found that a unit change in procurement contract management may account for a variability of 45.1% in a firm's sustainable performance. The R value for the model was 0.670 and the R2 was 0.451. This was a sign that the model was appropriate for establishing the link between procurement contract management and sustainable performance and, as a result, for drawing the conclusions and suggestions from the study.&#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: While the existing theory of public contracts used in this study was validated, the study recommends that the government through the appropriate regulatory agencies and the management of public procuring entities have the mandate to make sure that appropriate oversight of the management of contracts in state corporations is carried out as a means of ensuring accountability and justice throughout the entire process. According to the study, policymakers and state regulatory organizations should take the lead in making sure that contracts are properly documented and that they are diligently and effectively managed to ensure full adherence to the rules and regulations.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, in developing countries, designing an appropriate biofuel supply chain network regarding environmental competencies is an important problem. This paper presents a new bi-objective mixed integer mathematical model aiming to minimize CO2 emission and total costs in the process of the biofuel supply chain, creating a suitable green supply chain network. In this respect, CO2 emission and biofuel demand are regarded as uncertain data to address the real complex cases. Moreover, the SAUGMECON approach was implemented to construct a single objective model, and the obtained Pareto optimal points were depicted and analyzed. Thereby, a robust possibilistic programming approach was implemented to the proposed model to handle existing imprecise data. Furthermore, the applicability and performance of the proposed model were demonstrated based on an experimental example. In this respect, the obtained results from the proposed robust possibilistic programming model were compared with its crisp form to show the robustness and reliability of the proposed uncertain mathematical model.</jats:p>"

This fmincon toolbox from MATLAB attempts to find a constrained minimum of a scalar function of several variables starting at an initial estimate. This is generally referred to as constrained nonlinear optimization or nonlinear programming. The objective in OPF problem is to minimize the total cost function of generating units and the transmission losses, while maintaining the design and performance of the entire power system, satisfying the operational requirements such as the real and reactive power outputs of the generating units, bus voltages and power flow of transmission lines…etc. This project presents the most optimal solution of power flow incorporating wind generation cost, to supply power to a new domestic load located at the outskirts of an industrial area for three different scenarios. This residential is typical of long rural line with isolated load area. The challenge in our case study is to incorporate a wind generation unit as one type of green energy, that are currently being considered as an alternative source of power, to feed this long rural line for the domestic load without effecting in the total generation cost. A case study is carried out for three different scenarios incorporating wind generation cost. The results of OPF in this project shows that incorporating wind generation unit as renewable energy source with the entire power system will have a minimum generation cost and minimum transmission losses for the entire power system even if the wind generation cost assumed to be the most expensive one comparing with other conventional generation units. This project report provides implementation of Algorithm for the entire power load flow using the fast decoupled power flow (FDPF) and optimizes the best solution for the three different scenarios by using fmincon Interior Point Algorithm as one of optimization toolbox to achieve the minimum total cost function of generating units and minimum transmission losses.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the global economy today energy certainly has a strategic importance, whereas in terms of energy supply and securing of primary energy sources a special role is played by crude oil and, to an increasing extent since the start of the new century, natural gas. In the past two decades the consumption of natural gas has been significantly rising and natural gas as energy source is gaining, like crude oil, a strategic importance. While oil is still a dominant energy source in the overall global consumption, which is not going to change in some decades to come, it is anticipated that the share of natural gas in the world energy consumption will go up by 2050 from the present 23 % to nearly 45 %. Securing oil and gas supply is hence a primary task of the energy policy of any country. Considering the fact that 70 % of its primary energy needs Croatia meets by using liquid and gaseous fuels, it is extremely important to review the needs, circumstances and situations concerning natural gas supply and to analyze the overall security of natural gas supply as a prerequisite for Croatia’s energy security as a whole.</jats:p>"

Temperature-sensitive products within the supply chain are products that encompass pharmaceutical goods or products, which, when not stored or transported within predefined environmental conditions and/or within predefined time limits, are degraded and rendered not fully effective. The objective of this study was to evaluate the compliance to the good distribution practices of temperature-sensitive products in Rwanda.\nMethods\n A cross-sectional study was conducted at a medical supply company in Rwanda and involved 30 staff members managing temperature-sensitive products. The staff came from the Quality Assurance and quality control unit, Warehouse and logistics unit, Sales and marketing unit, Distribution unit, as well as some branch directors. Interviews were conducted and historical data on recorded temperature and humidity levels in storerooms and refrigerators/freezers as well as transit temperature data from representative district branches were collected for a period of three years (2017–2019). All data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. For compliance, temperature and relative humidity were compared with international standards.\nResults\n It was found that the Standard Operating Procedures were available but not updated to ensure compliance. The scarcity of trained staff was found to be the main factor hindering adherence to standards, hence monitoring of temperature and relative humidity sometimes had loopholes that need to be addressed. This study also discovered that adherence to recommended temperature ranges for the products was compromised by inconsistency in recording and reporting temperature and humidity, and a lack of temperature monitoring tools and qualified equipment.\nConclusions\n The study revealed the weaknesses that exist in the process of distribution of temperature-sensitive products at the medical supply company, which mainly, are attributed to paucity of trained staff. Strategic planning for short, medium, and long-term remedies will require that all parties involved in the management of these products work together towards upholding the standard.</jats:p>"

The target population in the study was 400 employees working with BIDCO. Sampling technique was used to ensure that each case in the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. A questionnaire was used as a data collection instrument that aided to collect the relevant information needed for analysis. After collection of data it was analyzed using descriptive statistics methods such as mean, weighted averages and percentages. The analyzed data was presented by use of frequency tables, charts and graphs. Regression analysis was also applied where computer software was used also that is Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for data analysis.&#x0D;\nFindings: The results indicated that there was positive relation between green procurement and customer satisfaction and the researcher recommended more application of the variables used in this study to increase on the customer satisfaction of manufacturing organization. Further studies recommended a comprehensive study to be done using both questionnaires, interviews and any other method of data collection to obtain in-depth information that the researcher missed in this study. System theory was tested by the researcher, This theory was used to describe an organization as a system that requires interrelation of all parts and change at one point may lead to multiple changes of other parts, (Maignan, 2012).organizations should operate as open systems where it should interact with the environment, even as many firms are painting their products green and they are not environmental friendly.&#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The study recommends that with the global warming and environmental concerns from all sectors, there’s is need for manufacturing organizations in Kenya to adopt green procurement practices in order to help in efforts of conserving the environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has an ambitious plan to install 40 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity via large scale projects (majority of which are &gt;100 MW) across the country by 2030. These projects are required to achieve a threshold percentage of the overall project cost as in country expenditure, termed “local content”. This threshold will rise to 40–45% by 2028, ensuring solar projects do not simply become investment opportunities for overseas companies but deliver jobs and skills development within the Kingdom. Local content is assessed across all aspects of a PV system—module, inverter, structure, etc. Typically, the PV module cost can range between ~34% to ~44% of the overall system cost. However, 56% of this module cost represents the manufacture of the solar cells. To maximise local content, the opportunity for KSA lies in module fabrication of imported solar cells. This study assesses the capacity readiness of the KSA to meet this opportunity in relation to its 2030 targets and the current policy landscape. The recently completed 300 MW Sakaka project had a local content of &gt;30% based on the developers’ website and &gt;35% based on our private communication. Our results indicate that this would rise by 19% for a project like Sakaka if all modules were fabricated in-country rather than being imported. The work also projected a shortfall in terms of in-country module fabrication capacity with clear implications to local content targets. The results show a shortfall in the range of 35% to 75% by 2030 depending on the adopted KSA energy policies and government support. KSA is seen to have good capacity in other PV components such as steel and float glass. In-country distribution of imported solar cells to module fabrication centres and subsequent distribution to PV farm sites has also been assessed. Our analyses indicate that a two-location solution reduces cost with new module fabrication capacity sited near Jeddah and Riyadh, minimising storage times, delivery time to site and distribution waiting times.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The reduction of global CO2 emissions requires cross-sectoral measures to reduce fossil energy consumptions and to strengthen the expansion of renewable energy sources. One element for this purpose are thermal energy storage systems. They enable, due to their time-decoupled operation, increases in systemic efficiency and flexibility in various industrial and power plant processes. In the electricity and heat sector such solutions are already commercially available for large-scale applications or are focused in diverse R&amp;D projects, but are largely new in the transport sector. By transferring existing concepts specifically to the requirements for the heat supply of battery electric vehicles, efficiency improvements can also be achieved in the transport sector. The idea is to provide the required heat for the interior during cold seasons via a previously electrical heated thermal energy storage system. Thus, battery capacities can be saved, and the effective range of the vehicle can be increased. Basic prerequisites for this concept are high systemic storage densities and high performances, which must be justified to commercial battery powered PTC-elements. Compared to large-scale applications, this results in new challenges and design solutions needing finally a proof of concept and experimental tests under vehicle typical specifications. For the first time, a novel thermal energy storage system based on ceramic honeycombs with integrated heating wires and a double-walled, thermally insulated storage containment was developed and constructively realized. This storage system meets all the requirements for the heat supply, reaches high systemic storage and power densities and allows due to its high flexibility a bifunctional operation use: a cyclic storage and a conventional heating mode. In the focused storage operation, high-temperature heat is generated electrically through heating wires during the charging period and transferred efficiently via thermal radiation to the ceramic honeycombs. During the discharging period (driving) the stored thermal energy is used for heating the interior by a bypass control system at defined temperatures with high thermal output. The systematic measurement campaigns and successful model validations confirm high electrical heating powers of 6.8 kW during the charging period and a heat supply with a thermal output of 5 kW over more than 30 min during the discharging period. Despite current infrastructure and test rig restrictions, high systemic storage densities of 155 Wh/kg with constant discharging outlet temperatures are reached. Compared to battery powered heating systems, the experimental results for the developed thermal energy storage system confirm an excellent level of competitiveness due to its high performance, operational flexibility and low-cost materials.</jats:p>"

Under three CSR-undertaking modes, the optimal decisions of carbon-emission-reduction intensity and technological-innovation level of low-carbon supply chain are explored by using the Stackelberg game. Through a comparative analysis of the optimal equilibrium solutions, we found that, with the enhancement of CSR awareness of member firms, the carbon-emission-reduction intensity, technological innovation level, and product sales volume of the low-carbon supply chain under different CSR-undertaking modes are all improved, and the total profits and total welfare of the low-carbon supply chain are all increased. The carbon-emission-reduction intensity, technological innovation level, and product sales volume are all the highest under the mode of the retailer undertaking CSR, the second highest under the mode of the producer and retailer jointly undertaking CSR, and the lowest under the mode of the producer undertaking CSR mode. Therefore, under the background of technological innovation carried out by the producer, it is most conducive to promoting the development of low-carbon supply chain for the retailer to undertake social responsibility.</jats:p>"

The global COVID‐19 pandemic has further encouraged industrial leaders to evaluate new challenges and opportunities. Our research provides insights into current applications of analytics technologies and organizationally integrates these insights for decision‐makers in restaurant supply chains. The study applies decision theory as a framing perspective to this phenomenon, thereby advancing the academic literature on the interface between data management, analytical techniques, and computing. We combine data drawn from interviews of leading players in U.S. and Chinese‐based restaurant chains with insights from trade publications and social media posts to identify best practices for analytics usage and supporting organizational changes. Our analysis provides examples of ways in which business leaders are applying analytics technologies to structured and unstructured data to address targeted objectives for demand/supply processes and to foster higher order organizational learning. In keeping with the stated objectives of this special issue of Production and Operations Management, this study provides an overview of both current state‐of‐the‐art and next‐generation capabilities for analytics in the restaurant industry. We further identify specific limitations of current processes, opportunities for development and theory‐based research, and challenges to implementation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To alleviate farmer poverty, this paper investigates the effect of a retailer’s different socially responsible practices on a two-echelon supply chain consisting of one rural (poor) farmer, one suburban farmer, and one common retailer. Different from a commercial supply chain (whose members’ objectives are to maximize their profits) and a humanitarian supply chain (whose objective is to save more people, rather than to prioritize profits), the paper aims to study a development supply chain where the CSR-conscious retailer aims to lift the poor farmer out of poverty through cost sharing, altruistic practices, or fairness practices. Can the CSR-conscious retailer (and the development supply chain) do well by doing good? To answer the above question, four models of potential CSR investment are established and analyzed. Considering the different influences of the retailer’s CSR practices, this paper uses a Stackelberg game to analyze the decisions and profits of the farmers and the retailer in these four models. Our study finds that, first, the retailer’s CSR practices can improve the whole supply chain’s performance, which means that the supply chain has the potential to achieve the Pareto improvement for both the farmers and the retailer. Second, the retailer’s CSR practices yield benefits while implementing cost-sharing or fairness practices. Third, the rural farmer always benefits from the retailer’s CSR practices and may prefer the altruistic practice from which they can benefit the most. In addition, to benefit their profit more, the rural farmer should grow high- or low-value-added crops rather than medium-value-added ones. Fourth, from the suburban farmer’s perspective, the retailer’s CSR practices are not beneficial for their performance. However, the extent to which the suburban farmer’s performance decreases is much lower than the extent to which the rural farmer’s performance improves. The results of this paper might be used by stakeholders to alleviate poverty.</jats:p>"

Thus, integrating non-traditional supply chain stakeholders, such as non-governmental organizations and competitors, in supply chain practices is essential for achieving a more sustainable supply chain. Hence, this research aims to show how stakeholders and their roles are related to sustainable supply chain management practices. A systematic literature review including 78 peer-reviewed English journal articles published between 2000 and 2020 was conducted. The results suggest that multiple supply chain external and internal stakeholders drive, facilitate, or inspect the implementation of sustainable supply chain management practices. While governmental and non-governmental organizations are key drivers for implementing sustainable supply chain management practices, they can also support their implementation. Moreover, proactive engagement with external supply chain stakeholders facilitates the organizational learning process through capability development, increasing understanding and awareness of sustainability, and creating knowledge. This study strengthens the value of proactive and collaborative measurements to deal with stakeholder issues before putting pressure on a company, which can result in reputation and legitimacy loss. These insights enrich the theoretical debate while explaining stakeholders’ relevance and roles in the sustainable supply chain management context. However, the study has some limitations regarding the chosen sustainable supply chain management and stakeholder constructs and potential within-study bias, offering possibilities for further research.</jats:p>",

In most cases, strategies related to digitalization and sustainability operate independently and are driven by separate sub-organizations in a decentralized and sporadic manner. A digital maturity model is a valuable tool to access the current state of the supply chain and guide it toward a better state of digitalization. The digitainability matrix, also knowns as the digital sustainability matrix, serves as a collaborative method to address any potential short-term or long-term undesired effects of digital technology usage. A seamless global supply chain with sustainability at the center of all activities and adopting visibility and integration at all touch points helps organizations.

Because of limited access to finance and other factors, a significant number of MSMEs, particularly in developing countries, cannot realize their full potential. The study investigates the micro, small, and medium enterprises' access to finance challenges from the supply-side perspective in Ethiopia. The study employed descriptive analysis using survey data collected from purposely selected 11 banks and 9 micro-finance institutions (MFI). The results show that the lack of collateral, unavailability of financial records, poor pre-loan savings, low loan repayment rate, business feasibility problems, credit information asymmetry, attitudinal problems of the MSMEs, and diversion of the loan are demand-side constraints. From the financial institution’s perspective, the result shows that the liquidity problem, the influence of unfair competition from government banks, the lack of competent human resources, political leaders’ intervention, especially in MFI, corruption, the COVID-19 pandemic, political instability, and inadequate capital are major obstacles. Macroeconomic conditions related to challenges such as foreign exchange shortages, inflation, and trade imbalances are also mentioned as major obstacles. According to the findings of this study, designing and implementing business skill development in mindset, business planning, business bookkeeping, and financial reports can help MSMEs access loans. For financial institutions, the study suggests cash flow-based lending products, applying psychometric testing for credit scoring, improving the governance of the government-affiliated MFIs, and automating the MFIs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyse the influence of operations and processes on performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya.&#x0D;\nMethodology: In this study, descriptive and cross-sectional research designs were used. According to the directory, there are 461 large-sized registered members. In order to sample 160 large industrial companies from the entire population, this study used Cochran's formula. Data was gathered using a standardized questionnaire, and both qualitative and quantitative analysis were performed on it. Both a descriptive and an inferential data analysis were used in this investigation. Tables, graphs, and pie charts were used to present the analysed data.&#x0D;\nResults: The findings of the study revealed that the relationship between operations and processes and performance was significant at 5% level of significance. The model summary in the hypothesis testing revealed that the R2 for the model was 0.305. This is to imply that 30.5% of the variations in performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya are as a result of operations and processes. The p-value for the variable was 0.000 which is less than the standard P-value of 0.05. This is to mean that operations and processes had a significant influence on the performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya. To this end, we therefore, reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant relationship between operations and processes and performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: While the existing Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) Model used in this study was validated, the study recommends that the policy makers and management of manufacturing firms should come up with policies and legislations that cover the concept of supply chain operations and processes as an essential driver to the performance of the manufacturing sector in the country. The policy makers hold a major role in determining how key sectors such as the manufacturing sector are run. The regulators and the legislators formulate policies and guidelines that guide on how manufacturing firms should carry out their operations including supply chain processes. The study also recommended that manufacturing firms policy makers should develop a policy and regulatory framework to accelerate effective implementation supply chain processes and operations to enhance their performance.</jats:p>"

Considerable portions of the countries’ income are invested in construction and reconstruction of houses, shopping centers, schools, universities, research centers, pavements, bridges, dams, among other infrastructures. In view of its importance, it becomes relevant to understand the determinant factors for the strategic management of the cement supply chain (SC). The knowledge of these factors can support the development of management strategies that adequately orientate the operation of the cement industry and ensure an agile and/or efficient structure that facilitates the distribution of the products from this industrial sector.Methodology: This article presents the results of a qualitative research, based on semi-systematic literature review and interviews, which aimed to identify the determinant factors and barriers in the management of the SC of the Angolan cement industry (CI).Findings: This research made it possible to conclude that the determining factors are: cement production capacity and quality; supply levels and channels; infrastructure capacity and quality; capacity and quality of transport modes; existence of cement distribution strategies; collaboration, integration, agility, effectiveness and efficiency in the SC; availability of qualified labor; geographic location of markets; competitiveness factors (price, quality, response time, flexibility, agility, services, reliability, process variability and differentiation). Some barriers that undermine the supply of cement in the Angolan market have also been identified.Originality/value: Based on the literature review and the analysis of the interviews, we found that, in general, the strategic management of the SC of the CI depends on the level of development of the infrastructures, logistics, communication and the degree of collaboration and integration between the entities.</jats:p>"

The length of data can significantly affect the results of ARIMA models. This article investigates the effect of different lengths on prediction accuracy. For this purpose, 732 monthly data of streamflow of the Kortian gauging station at the Kortian Stream watershed were used. To study the impact of the type of data in terms of monthly or seasonal observation data on the accuracy of modeling results, monthly data were converted into seasonal data and the results of monthly and seasonal modeling were compared. Therefore, multiplicative ARIMA models were performed for the monthly and seasonal modeling. Compared with the seasonal modeling, the monthly modeling presented more precise results than the sum of the square errors of monthly and seasonal modeling, which were 0.9408 and 2.5, respectively. For the monthly modeling, five different lengths of data were used. The C1 model used the last 60 data, C2 used the last 120 recorded observations, C3 used the last 240 data, C4 used the last 480 observations, and C5 used the last 708 data. To test the precision of models, 24 observations were put aside. Among the C1 to C5 models, the C4 model presented the best results in predicting 2 years ahead and C1 had the worst results.</jats:p>",

Up to now, test cases are not exchangeable between test processes because interoperability is not given. The developed approach enables the source-to-source compiling of test cases between test script languages. With this, the interoperability of test cases is achieved, and seamless integration within the supply chain is possible. The developed approach uses transcompilers as a baseline. In doing so, an interoperability model for test cases is presented. Based on the interoperability model, a source-to-source compiling for test cases is shown. The outcome is a prototype that handles test script languages, which are different with respect to type safety and applied programming paradigms. The approach ensures that test cases are still understandable and usable for test reports. The evaluation confirms the translation capabilities as well as the readability of the generated test case for the high-lift scenario from aviation. The interoperability of test cases within the supply chain enables the formalisation of procedural test knowledge to be used in a broad range of future scenarios, such as test automation, digital twins and predictive maintenance.</jats:p>"

This paper studies a joint contract that combines revenue sharing with quantity discount to coordinate the supply chain under demand and yield uncertainty, which consists of one manufacturer and one retailer. The retailer pays the manufacturer a down payment at the beginning, and the manufacturer gives the retailer a quantity discount and shares a proportion of profit from the retailer at last. To make sure that both members in the supply chain want to adopt this contract, we prove the feasibility of the joint contract achieving a win–win situation. In addition, we investigate how the price in the secondary market influence the contract, and the conclusion further proves that supply chain coordination is actually a process of re-sharing risks among all nodes of the supply chain. However, the joint contract in this paper has certain adaptability to such risks. Finally, numerical analysis is given to show the impacts of uncertainties on the profit of the supply chain, the decisions made by the members, and the effectiveness of our joint contract.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we study optimal procurement policies with advance contracting option over a finite multi-period horizon for a seasonal product. In this setting, each period is defined by the time between two consecutive inventory replenishment stages where demand is not stationary across periods. Demand for the product in each period is stochastic whose probabilistic distribution is a function of the market signal received right before the beginning of the selling season. The firm receives price discounts by making quantity contracts in advance of the selling season and thus, before the realization of the market signal. Replenishment costs vary across periods during the selling season. We investigate optimal combination of advance contracting and expedited replenishment policies using stochastic dynamic programming. Our research is primarily motivated by applications in the cruise line industry where contracts are made before the final number of bookings is realized and additional purchases can be made at ports of call with varying local prices. Our results show that optimal replenishment policies follow order-up-to policies and there is a unique advance contract amount that minimizes the expected costs over the planning horizon. We provide a numerical sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of replenishment prices, demand volatility, and disparity between periods in terms of demand on the advance contract amount, replenishments from the spot markets, service levels, and the overall expected cost. </jats:p>",

For Nigeria to move closer to unlocking its full agriculture potential, the value chain have to be identified, mapped, prioritized and digitized. The findings reveal that Information technology (IT) play an overwhelming role to put together and streamline the supply chains and supply chain management in full. This supply chain also requires a continuous cold chain during various steps along its network. Currently, technologies like RFID, GPS, Data recorder, Blockchain are used with Information technology (IT) mainly in tracking and tracing the products right from the field to the consumer.

However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth‐environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single‐crystal hexagonal‐shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear‐carbon‐supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large‐area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands are successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar‐tunnel‐junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands is achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. It is therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear‐carbon‐supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high‐quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene‐based nanodevices in the future.</jats:p>",

Our experience of knowledge creation in joint industry-academia research projects in the domain of logistics and supply chain management (SCM) has led us to deepen the study of industry-academia interactions more specially the knowledge processes at work in such projects. With this perspective, we adopted an action research approach to launch and conduct two research projects in collaboration with a global manufacturing company. The chapter reviews the knowledge management (KM) literature on knowledge processes, presents the action research approach, and reports the results from the two action-research joint industry-academia research projects with knowledge creation objectives in logistics and SCM. The analysis of the projects reveals that the knowledge creation dynamic results from three intertwined, interactive, and iterative processes: knowledge transfer, knowledge sharing and knowledge generation. This outlines a framework of industry-academia knowledge processes dynamic. The analysis also underlines factors influencing the dynamic, among them action-research methodological choices and tactics. The chapter concludes on the value of action research to boost knowledge creation in joint industry-academia research projects and questions adopting a KM approach in this type of projects that could be part of the KM strategies of partners.</jats:p>"

Sills are placed in positions below, tangentially and upstream of the gate at distances of 7.5 and 17.5 cm from the gate. The results of the present study showed that the discharge coefficient increases with increasing sill width and decreasing total area of the flow passing through the gate. The discharge coefficient increases by installing the sill at certain intervals at increasing distance with respect to the upstream of the sluice gate and has a lower value compared to the non-sill state. At the same opening in non-sill and suppressed sill states, with a sill below and tangential to the gate, the discharge coefficient of the sluice gate with the sill has increased compared to the non-sill state. In addition, the discharge coefficient for a tangential sill has the highest value.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Design/methodology/approach: food insecurity is discussed within population health and food supply chain framework. Research shows that food insecurity is one of the three main causes in impacting population health. After exploring the relationship between food insecurity and population health, this study explores possible solutions to address food insecurity through food supply chain management framework. Food supply chain is different from commercial supply chain in many important attributes. Literature does not provide research framework linking these three attributes (food insecurity, population health and food supply chain). Therefore, we use an exploratory map to build roadmap to a successful integration of these three attributes. Purpose: social determinants of health are considered as a precondition for population health. Food security forms basis for catalyst in population health. Food security touches human dignity. Many people face starvation while tons of foods are wasted globally. There is a mismatch between supply and demand for food production and consumption. Distributions of foods from producers to consumers become a focal point in managing starvation and waste/glut of foods. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how food supply chain mitigates food insecurity and provides sustainable food supply. Findings: this paper reveals mismatch between supply and consumption of food at a global scale. Inadequate supply chain assets -technologies, storages, distribution networks, etc. - at the producer’s ends causes lower return on investments for producers. Unique characteristics of food supply chain compared with commercial supply chain raises challenges to the imbalance between supply and demand. Oligopolistic market structure may solve the chronic mismatch. Originality/value: literature addresses these three constructs – food security, population health and food supply chain – separately and independently from each other. This paper argues these three constructs should be addressed together in order to solve global food insecurity and waste. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to unify these three constructs.</jats:p>"

In today’s fast-paced market, the ability to provide accurate product availability information is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and optimizing inventory management. The aATP solution offers organizations the capability to assess inventory levels and fulfillment options in real time, integrating seamlessly with existing SAP systems. This study investigates the key features of SAP aATP, including its demand-driven replenishment, real-time analytics, and enhanced visibility across the supply chain.\r\nThrough a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, including case studies and surveys, the paper analyzes the impact of aATP implementation on order fulfillment rates, inventory turnover, and overall supply chain efficiency. The findings indicate that organizations leveraging aATP experience significant improvements in responsiveness to customer demands and a reduction in stockouts and excess inventory. The paper concludes by discussing best practices for implementing SAP aATP, highlighting its role as a transformative tool in achieving agile and efficient supply chain operations. This research not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge on supply chain optimization but also provides practical insights for businesses seeking to leverage technology to enhance their operational capabilities.</jats:p>"

Research was carried out in an open field with the aim to improve A. ursinum growth, through its intercropping with Armoracia rusticana (horseradish). In the latter context, with and without sodium selenate application, ramson and horseradish showed reciprocal growth stimulation, as ramson biomass increased by 1.28 times and horseradish root biomass by 1.7 times. The biofortification level of horseradish roots increased from 5.9 to 9.6 times due to joint plant growth under selenium (Se) supply. The opposite phenomenon was recorded for ramson leaves, as the biofortification level decreased from 11.7 in the case of Se supplementation to 6.7 in plants supplied with sodium selenate when jointly cultivated with horseradish. Among the tested antioxidants, the highest increase due to joint cultivation and/or Se supply was recorded for ascorbic acid by 1.69 times in ramson leaves and 1.48 and 1.37 times in horseradish roots and leaves, respectively. All treatments significantly increased the total antioxidant activity (AOA) of horseradish leaves (by 1.33–1.49 times) but not roots. Comparison of the results obtained in field conditions with those obtained earlier for the Se biofortification of ramson in the natural habitat (forest) revealed significantly higher levels of the plant’s antioxidant status under environmental stress (field) and a decrease in the correspondent differences as a consequence of Se biofortification. The estimation of allelopathic beneficial interaction between ramson and horseradish implies the efficiency of ramson growth and production of functional food with high levels of Se (Se–ramson leaves and Se–horseradish roots).</jats:p>"

The basic metals industry is the most energy-intensive industries in the electricity supply chain. There are some differences between this chain and other supply chains including the impossibility of large-scale energy storage, reservation constraints, high costs, limitations on electricity transmission lines capacity, real-time response to high-priority strategic demand, and a variety of energy rates at different hours and seasons. A coupled demand forecasting approach is presented in this paper to forecast the demand time series of the metal industries microgrid with minimum available input data (only demand time series). The proposed method consists of wavelet decomposition in the first step. The training subsets and the validation subsets are used in the training and fine-tuning of the LSTM model using the ELATLBO method. The ESC dataset used in this study for electrical demand forecasting includes 24-h daily over 40 months from 21 March 2017, to 21 June 2020. The obtained results have been compared with the results of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Boosted Tree, and Random Forest forecasting models optimized using the Bayesian Optimization (BO) method.

It finds that supply-side distribution approaches played a critical role in improving PICS bag availability. Some of the supply-side constraints included poor inventory management, pricing, and limited access to capital. Inventory management can be improved through better forecasting using sales records and prediction of farmers’ harvests. Improved access to credit during peak season can improve the timely supply and reduce stockouts. Marketing inefficiency appears to be fueled by a high-profit margin at the distributor level. Using all available distribution channels in addition to ag-input dealers will enhance the availability of the bags in rural communities.</jats:p>"

Supply chain finance is becoming a new way to solve the problem of difficult credit in agricultural development. As the importance of sustainability issues continues to rise, there are growing numbers of practical examples of combining agricultural supply chain finance (ASCF) with sustainability, and the attendant risks are emerging. The objectives of this study are first to construct a risk indicator system for sustainable ASCF, then to propose a fuzzy decision method that considers the confidence of decision-makers, and finally to perform a risk assessment of a credit case in the coffee bean supply chain. A combination of the neutrosophic enhanced best–worst method (NE-BWM) and combined compromise solution (COCOSO) is used to evaluate risk problems. The practicality and effectiveness of this research method is verified by a numerical simulation and a comparison with the method. The results show that the credit rating of core companies is the most important indicator. In the context of green and sustainable development, this indicator system is more suitable for the current green transformation development of agriculture and can help decision-makers scientifically and reasonably assess the risk level of ASCF. When loans are needed to transform green agriculture, this study provides new ideas for credit models for various actors in the agricultural supply chain and offers a new entry point to the issue of sustainable agricultural development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aviation is an industry that has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several number of risks arise due to the low demand for flights which results in a number of business risks, including obstacles that occur from the SCM side of the aircraft maintenance industry. This study aims to analyze risk control strategies in supply chain management, by offering updates in the evaluation of SCOR using the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model version 12, House of Risk (HOR), and pareto diagram.The object of research is PT GMF Aero Asia, which is an aircraft maintenance service provider (MRO). This research is a qualitative-phenomenological type using primary and secondary data. Primary data was obtained from interviews with informants who represented managerial in the field of SCM at GMF Aero Asia, while secondary data was obtained from documentation studies by collecting documents related to the research. The data obtained is then processed according to the stages of risk identification, risk severity analysis, risk probability, and risk management. The results showed that there were 50 risk events, including 7 risk events from the SCM planning process (planning), 9 risk events from the source procurement process (source), 11 risk events from the production operation process (make), 12 events risk from the delivery process, 7 risk events from the product return process (return) and 5 risk events from the maintenance &amp; compliance process (enable), as well as 30 risk triggers (risk agent). Other results state that there are 9 risk agents that will be prioritized for preventive action.</jats:p>"

By adding battery discharge regulators (BDR) between the platform bus and the SAR load bus as a grid-connected controller, the SAR load bus can supply power to the platform load, and the solar array and battery pack can be used efficiently while achieving dual bus output. Aiming at the composite bus, this paper also proposes an efficient high-power filter technology.

Our results show that the retailer’s fairness behavior further causes a benefit for herself, while the manufacturer and the total supply chain to suffer. Moreover, a revenue-cost-sharing (RCS) contract is introduced to coordinate supply chain . We prove that a win-win outcome is reachable, and the RCS contract is applicable in practice.</jats:p>",

The issues of the water quality and sanitary protection of water bodies in the Russian Federation are constantly in the zone of increased scientific and practical attention. The purpose of the work is a hygienic assessment and determination of ways to improve the drinking water supply of the population in the Russian Federation. Materials and methods. analysis of materials from annual state reports on the state of sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the population, data literature, dissertation, and own researches, development of proposals for improving the drinking water supply of the population. Results. A hygienic assessment of the current state of the water supply of the population is presented in terms of the compliance of water with the main criteria, indicators, and regulatory parameters of the water and sanitary legislation of the country is presented. Updated problems and measures to improve the quality of water sources and water used for household and drinking purposes are noted. The problematic issues of improving federal laws and technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union in the field of providing the population with high-quality drinking water are outlined. The terminological, conceptual and essential aspects of the assessment of drinking water as the main food product in terms of the mass consumption of the population are considered. Conclusion. Despite the high level of domestic water legislation, it is necessary to constantly improve it, understanding that water, on the one hand, is the only cleaning liquid on the planet, which is why it is the accumulator of all pollution entering the environment, and, on the other hand, is the most significant according to the average daily mass of consumption, a food product that affects health to the extent that a person spoils it.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s complex and ever-changing world, a distribution network in lending impact analysis is an evaluation of a client’s procedures, rules, and financial well-being to evaluate as considerable risk and it provides to the contracting company. A creditor’s capability to pay the current lender’s obligations is considered while doing a lender’s threat assessment. Traditionally, it refers to the concern that the borrower may not be able to collect the sequence and interest. The challenges in lenders’ threat assessment are a lack of adequate data storage and retrieval, problematic delays caused by a lack of access to the relevant data at the right time, extended lead times that lead their shipments at risk, and demand for speedier deliveries. This paper introduces a machine learning-based linear regression algorithm (ML-LRA) for supplier credit risk (SCR) assessment based on supply chain management (SCM) in credit risk frameworks that depend significantly on modeling ML. Regression models are logistical constraints that can be used to simulate the impacts of multiple variables on a customer’s creditworthiness. The chain of distribution forecasting tool assesses specific decisions based on assumptions in variability. As a result of the findings in this study, it can be assumed that ML-LR approaches have a significant role in a variety of business processes such as supplier selection, risk prediction along with the supply chain, and demand and sales estimation. Finally, the study’s consequences for the most critical constraints and obstacles are examined to enhance the supply chain management system and ensure overall system sustainability.</jats:p>",

Information flow plays an integral role in determining the effectiveness of supply chain processes and how they enhance firm performance. Outsourcing logistics comes with varied risks and one of the risks is management risks. These risks are aligned with the administrative differences between the outsourced company and the manufacturing firm, which could affect the effectiveness of the cooperation towards enhanced performance.&#x0D;\nMethodology: The study was informed by core competency theory. Both descriptive and explanatory research designs were adopted. The unit of observation was the supply chain administrators of manufacturing firms in Kenya. Stratified sampling was conducted on all the one thousand one hundred and twenty three manufacturing firms registered by KAM, simple random sampling was carried out on the strata to identify a sample size of 295 firms. The study relied on primary data which was collected through semi-structured questionnaires that were administered to administrators charged with the management of supply chain within the selected firms. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics namely percentages, mean and standard deviation through the help of SPSS.&#x0D;\nFindings: The study revealed that management risk significantly influenced the performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya. The findings further revealed that information flow had a positive but insignificant moderating effect on the relationship between management risk and performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya.&#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The study concluded management risk is essential in the performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) is used to assess the barriers to SSCM implementation in Iran, and a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is used to obtain qualitative assessments from multiple experts regarding how to mitigate the impact of the barriers. To validate the proposed methodology, out of 20 barriers identified through the literature review and 9 more barriers suggested by experts, 26 barriers are identified to be relevant to the context of Iran using FDM. Six SSCM implementation barriers (i.e., economic sanctions; banking problems; economic instability; high inflation rate; lack of regulation and guidance from the government and lack of a globally competitive environment) were determined as important barriers in the cause group. All of them are related to Iran’s economic situation, the economic sanctions against Iran, and the government’s neglect of the importance of sustainability issues, all of which are obviously out of the companies’ control; moreover, the impact-relation map for each has been developed to facilitate the visualization of its interactions (i.e., influencing and influenced) with other barriers. The outcomes achieved are unique to Iranian companies and cannot be generalized to every company in other countries; however, the proposed approach might serve as a foundation for analyzing and comprehending the interactions between barriers. The suggested technique would identify the most effective areas for directing resources and efforts to reduce the effects of barriers to successful SSCM implementation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply chain is an important part for firms to maintain competitive advantages. With the development of the Internet industry, the complexity of the business environment faced by E-commerce firms has greatly increased. Additionally, unexpected events have occurred from time to time, which have seriously affected the stability of the E-commerce supply chain. Supply chain social capital comprises the resources obtained by firms in the supply chain network through reputation, status, trust, commitment, etc., which allows the firms in the supply chain to form an interdependent relationship. Supply chain social capital can generate sustainable competitive advantages for supply chain firms. Based on the theory of social capital, this paper analyzes the impact on supply chain collaboration and stability from the three dimensions of supply chain capital: structural capital, cognitive capital, and relational capital. The results show that supply chain social capital positively affects supply chain collaboration and affects the stability of the supply chain in indirect ways. At the same time, this paper also found that under different supply chain governance modes, there are differences in the relationship between supply chain social capital and supply chain collaboration, that the moderation effects of contractual governance are not significant, while relational governance has positive moderation effects on the relationship between supply chain structural capital, relational capital, and supply chain collaboration. The conclusion of this study provides a theoretical basis for E-commerce firms to improve the level of supply chain social capital, adopt informal relational governance to face market uncertainty, and then promote the stability of the supply chain. At the same time, it also provides practical reference for the management department to issue policies so as to promote mutual understanding between supply chain cooperative firms, and to form a harmonious supply chain relationship.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is high time to explore technological applications to overcome such inadequacies. The faster speed, low maintenance cost, and absence of road dependency in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have popularized them as an alternative to road delivery. Hence, it is suggested as a solution to overcome the persisting distribution inefficiencies in healthcare logistics of low-income countries. According to the case study analysis conducted on the Sri Lankan vaccine cold chain, incorporating UAVs increases truck-space utilization and reduces the time consumed, cost incurred, and carbon dioxide emission in a delivery round. Moreover, the most suitable way to cover the initial setup cost of an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is by receiving aid from international donors. The capital cost also can be covered by government investments or via service outsourcing only if the number of flights per year is increased. Moreover, a homogenous (i.e., only UAV) solution was revealed to be more beneficial than a heterogeneous (i.e., truck and UAV) solution. However, due to the lack of technology literacy and willingness to change in low-income countries, it is recommended to initially execute a heterogeneous solution and expand to a homogeneous plan in the future years. However, it was evident that for a mixed-fleet solution to be advantageous, drone characteristics play a vital role. Hence, a UAV with specifications ideal for the use case must be utilized to garner the maximum benefits. Nevertheless, it was apparent that with the right implementation plan, UAVs possess the potential to overcome the shortcomings in the healthcare logistics of low-income countries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>MSME production activities contribute significantly to environmental pollution due to the limited knowledge and use of the latest technology on health and environmental impacts. The implementation of green supply chain management will bring drastic changes in supply chain processes. The costs incurred will increase, including the costs of inventory, production, and transportation. This study aims to analyze the relationship of three different levels of variables from the implementation of green supply chain management. This study uses quantitative methods with multivariate analysis methods. Data processing is assisted using smartPLS software. Data were collected by distributing 100 online and offline questionnaires to respondents and using a Likert scale measurement scale. Institutional pressure has a significant effect on external green collaboration and internal green practices. Leadership has a positive effect on internal green practices, but has no relationship with external green collaboration. External factors have no significant effect on economic and organizational performance. However, internal factors have a significant effect on economic and organizational performance. This research helps food SMEs to make decisions in formulating strategies and provides knowledge on the application of green supply chain management from various organizational perspectives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, the method and a control algorithm for detecting resonant destruction of a resonant auxiliary power supply for railway vehicle are proposed. It is essential to reduce the weight of the electric equipment attached to the lower part of the railway vehicle because it greatly affects the life of the railway vehicle, such as wheel and bearing. In order to reduce the weight and volume of the auxiliary power supply, in the case of windings, high-speed switching should be performed by lowering the input voltage. Therefore, in this paper, the auxiliary power supply control algorithm using an LLC resonant converter to reduce the weight of auxiliary power supply for railway vehicle is proposed, and the method of detecting resonant destruction due to device failure of a resonant converter is proposed. The proposed algorithm steps down the wire voltage using an input buck converter for high-speed switching, and the inverter input voltage is controlled through the LLC resonant converter. In addition, ZVS (Zero Voltage Switching) is operated to minimize the loss of the resonant converter, and the optimal design of the resonant tank is also proposed. In order to detect resonant destruction, a detection method formulated by analyzing the resonant current peak value for the load capacity is proposed. The algorithm proposed in this paper is verified by simulation and experiment.</jats:p>"

The three perspectives of evaluating project success which involve project stakeholders, project managers and project end users are introduced. The main categories of the project management methodologies are outlined and diagrammed; the characteristics of every category are specified; the examples of the most established methodologies recognised in the business community are given. Brief conceptual explanation of each methodology is outlined together with its pros and cons and the most suitable areas of implementation are explored. The comparison of CPM and CCM is presented in a graphical manner. The latest statistics on the current trends in the methods’ usage is presented and analysed. It was revealed that there is a strong tendency in preferring and applying hybrid methodologies and a strong decline in consistent usage of traditional methodologies. Scrum as the most popular agile methodology at team level has been identified followed by Kanban and others. The extension of using agile methodologies beyond IT-related and software development applications has been detected. Basic diagrams demonstrating logical structure and principles of some methods are shown. Recommendations for considering specific project features in the context of its scope, collaborating team characteristics, level of certainty and predictability of affecting factors coming from external and internal environments, customer and stakeholder involvement, objectives and project success evaluation criteria are developed.</jats:p>"

It also emphasizes strategic planning and forward thinking for iSC decisions, building on the processes established for the PMT through CCEOP. The original iSC strategy was an impetus for the establishment of CCEOP. The new strategy reflects shifting trends and priorities to fill gaps identified through practical experience, advocated for by stakeholders and thought leaders engaged in the iSC, and validated by the evaluation.

The cooling and lubrication are key aspects of manufacturing processes such as grinding to achieve a high surface quality at high productivity. The coolant supply to the contact area has a high impact on the performance of the coolant. This paper presents the results from two approaches to tailoring the coolant supply for conventional and high-performance processes. An analytical approach is established to determine the coolant outlet velocity. Afterward, a sensor is developed to measure the coolant velocity at the nozzle. Conclusively, the influence of the coolant velocity on the volume flow through the contact zone is investigated. The results of this study highlight the importance of coolant outlet velocities of at least 60% of the cutting speed. The two approaches outline low impact possibilities to ensure optimal coolant outlet velocities and thus low thermal loads during the grinding process.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Article Highlights</jats:title>\n                <jats:p><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n                  <jats:list-item>\n                    <jats:p>Analytical approach to calculate outlet velocities for varying noozles in high-performance grinding with cutting speeds of up to 100 m/s</jats:p>\n                  </jats:list-item>\n                  <jats:list-item>\n                    <jats:p>Utilization of a high-speed camera to determine the outlet nozzle velocities in a conventional deep grinding process</jats:p>\n                  </jats:list-item>\n                  <jats:list-item>\n                    <jats:p>Validation of the impact of the coolant outlet velocity on the volume flow through the contact area by means of a coolant collection box</jats:p>\n                  </jats:list-item>\n                </jats:list></jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

Warehouses not only serve as a place to store goods, but also have other important functions. Operational efficiency and logistics control in finished goods warehouses are increasingly becoming an urgent need for companies in various industries. However, ineffective warehouse management can lead to negative impacts such as decreased profits and customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, efforts are needed to manage warehouses with good efficiency and structure. This article discusses the concept of Warehouse Management System (WMS) and finished goods warehouse management in an effort to improve operational efficiency and logistics control. Through a qualitative approach with data acquisition using literature review from various relevant sources, the relationship between the use of WMS and increased productivity in a company is examined. The results showed that there was a significant improvement in the performance of a company. The WMS is proven to increase the number of orders received and the company’s operational efficiency. WMS aids inventory management with real-time stock data, preventing shortages or excesses. Successful implementation demands proper strategy, tech utilization, planning, system integration, and employee training. Thus, WMS implementation can bring about positive changes in warehouse operational efficiency, inventory optimization, and meeting customer needs.</jats:p>"

Untuk memberi peringatan bagi mahasiswa saat terjadi arus berlebih di Laboratorium Elektronika Dasar Politeknik Negeri Malang, dirangkailah sebuah catu daya yang dapat diatur dengan menggunakan proteksi arus memanfaatkan IC LM 723 untuk level operasi catu daya 2 Ampere. Pada penelitian ini menggunakan 2 sistem proteksi yang diterapkan pada catu daya yaitu menggunakan buzzer sebagai sistem peringatan dan sekring sebagai pemutus arus. Penelitian ini akan menjelaskan tahapan pembuatan dan pengujian sistem. Sistem membatasi arus kerja maksimum 2.5 Ampere untuk beberapa variasi tahanan beban&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nABSTRACT &#x0D;\nThe type of power supply that is often used for basic electronics practicum is adjustable power supply because it requires relatively low current with varying voltage. The security system commonly used for power supply is usually a fuse. If there is an overcurrent from the fuse that has been installed due to a circuit or wiring error will make this protection system active, a fuse replacement will be required. To give a warning to students when an overcurrent occurs at the Basic Electronics Laboratory of the State Polytechnic of Malang, a power supply that can be adjusted using current protection utilizes IC LM 723 for a power supply operating level of 2 Ampere. In this study, two protection systems were applied to the power supply, namely using a buzzer as a warning system and a fuse as a circuit breaker. This research will explain the stages of making and testing the system. The system limits a maximum working current of 2.5 Ampere for several variations of load resistance.</jats:p>"

The supraglacial drainage system of the Greenland Ice Sheet, in combination with surface melt rate, controls the rate of water flow into moulins, driving subglacial water pressure. We apply a physically-based surface meltwater flow model to a ∼20 × 27 km2 catchment on the southwestern Greenland Ice Sheet in high and low melt years to examine the impact of surface melt rate and variability on moulin inputs. The model outputs predict important differences in moulin inputs between high and low melt years.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In modern society, the food supply chain management system has become an important research area realized nationally and internationally, which has established a collaborative relationship between producers, manufacturers, processors and retailers. Now, consumers are more interested in food quality, safety and the authentication of the products. Food safety has become an important issue in public health in the food market because people of all types and races around the world are affected due its poor quality. The traditional supply chains are centralized and face different issues such as lack of transparency, accountability and audit ability. The general issues in supply chain management include lack of communication, trust among the stakeholders, and interference of entities and wastage of food. A lot of work has been completed by researchers to address the above issues, but still, there is a need for effective mechanisms for the modeling of supply chain management systems. In this paper, a trusted, self-organized, traceable formal system based on blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) is developed by using wireless sensors networks and finite automata. In the proposed model, smart contracts are designed to assure the automated payment procedures. The proposed model reduced the need for centralized authority. Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to realize the requirements, and automata is used to capture behavior of the system. A blockchain-based model is used to provides the privacy and security mechanism for the transitions record. Wireless sensors are used to sense the information, and actors are used for decision making in case of any violation in the contact. A lot of work has been completed by researchers on smart contracts. Different smart contracts are designed to achieve the better traceability among producers, transporter/logistics and consumers. Our system provides the smart contract algorithm to show the interaction of entities in the food supply chain management system. Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL) is used to describe the formal system and the VDM-SL toolbox is used for the validation and analysis of the system.</jats:p>"

Although electrochemical CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reduction (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>R) to useful carbon chemicals is challenging to meet the industrial requirements, recent studies have made a significant improvement in the performances both of the product selectivity and current density. Gas-diffusion electrode configurations allow direct CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> gas-feeding to the catalyst layer and several hundred mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> of current density have been demonstrated with a zero-gap type of membrane electrolyzer assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. However, many underlying phenomena are still not clearly understood.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Among various components of MEA, here, I will focus on the cathode catalyst, and balanced CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> / water supply at the catalyst/membrane boundary to understand the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>R activity. We demonstrate the importance of the water supply from the anolyte for the selective CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>R in the zero-gap MEA electrolyzer. We confirm that hydrogen is mostly originated from the aqueous anolyte for the production of the ethylene from CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>R with controlled labelling experiments. In terms of the Cu catalyst morphology, the alkaline environment near the catalyst layer leads a significant morphology changes during the pre-treatment steps for the ionomer activation, which contributes to increase in the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>R activity. The microenvironment behavior is simulated and compares with the experimental CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>R MEA performance to understand the mass flow and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>R activity, which also support the catalyst thickness dependence. For the practical application consideration, we also study the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>R activity for CO production with the low concentration (~ 10%) of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> feeding and amine-captured direct CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reduction condition. Weak HER activity is important especially with the low concentration of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> because the slower CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reduction rate lead to more hydrogen compared to 100 % of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> gas feeding.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The emergence of a mass market for electric vehicles (EVs) offers development opportunities for countries that have abundant resources of cobalt, nickel, lithium, copper, aluminium and manganese. Not surprisingly, developing countries have proposed ambitious plans to expand production of these raw materials. However, an observation from the resource curse literature is that strong institutions are required if they are to mitigate the risk of poorly directed, often excessively procyclical, investment, not least because of the complexity, opacity and price volatility of many raw materials utilised by global EV value chains. This paper examines the outlook for EV demand and associated raw material usage paying attention to the drivers and sensitivities required to assess and track future market transformations. These end use shifts are then placed in the context of the broader supply chain adjustments and trends shaping the demand. For resource exporters, adapting to structural change will require fiscal, regulatory, environmental and institution reforms designed to capture shifting patterns of resource wealth in a way which takes appropriate account of comparative advantages in specific value chains and mitigates adverse environmental and social consequences from their extraction and processing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A storage battery is used as an emergency power supply that stores energy and supplies the stored energy to the load when necessary. While stationary lead-acid batteries were used in the past, lithium-ion batteries are being increasingly used in recent times, yielding improved efficiency. There are two methods to calculate the capacity of stationary lead-acid batteries, domestically and internationally. One is from IEEE Std. 485, conforming to KEPIC EEG 1200, and the other is from the design criteria of a construction-based electrical installation that quoted SBA S 0601. First, to calculate the capacity of a stationary lead-acid battery (for using emergency power), I compared both methods and analyzed their differences, modifications, and capacity calculations. Subsequently, I demonstrated the gaps between the two methods using actual calculations by applying the duty cycle from IEEE Std. 485-2020 and the Kt-T curve by the manufacturer. Based on these results, I finally reviewed the approaches to calculate the capacity of lithium-ion batteries and proposed an effective method.</jats:p>",

A variety of factors differentiate agile supply networks. They should not only be network-based but also market-sensitive, with tightly linked virtual and crucial operations. If agile supply chains are to adapt for ever-faster turnaround time towards both volume and variety changes, they must integrate supply and demand. The agile supply chain must be able to swiftly modify the output to satisfy customer needs and move from one version to the next. Of course, information technology is essential to the smooth running of agile teams. However, this chapter will focus on two additional essential facilitators of supply chains.

It is well established that the technicalities of keeping the systems going are impacted by complex political, social, financial, and institutional challenges. While the shift to federal, three-tiered governance allocates concurrent responsibility for drinking water management to the local government with federal and provincial governments, water and sanitation user groups continue to shoulder the management of local supply systems voluntarily. All three levels have jurisdiction over water-related services resulting in confusion of roles. This study focuses on the local level, where community management of water and sanitation decentralisation is the key approach in this complex tangle of diverse institutions with different actors managing and governing water. User Groups and their Committees in the Guras Rural Municipality of Dailekh district, Karnali province, in West Nepal, provided the case study, which was analysed using Ostrom's well-recognised Eight Principles for Sustainable Governance of Common-Pool Resources. The community-based model, established formally through the Water Resource Act 1992 (2049 BS), is critically analysed in light of the changing socio- economic context through the intervening years. The results highlight the need for stronger collaboration between the rural municipality and users to achieve good water supplies and the risks of losing access and voice in water management for women and marginalised people when inactive user groups are replaced by private or group interests taking control of the water access.</jats:p>"

In the present study, trends of daily streamflow and sediment load for Upper Tapi Basin are analyzed using Mann-Kendall, modified Mann-Kendall, and innovative trend analysis and change points are found using Pettitt tests from 1985 to 2020 to determine time series' trend with the statistical significance. Land use land cover (LULC) for Upper Tapi Basin is prepared for three decades (1989–2020). Innovative trend analysis has shown non-monotonicity in the time series with a decreasing trend. The streamflow is found to be significantly decreasing in the basin. A decline in sediment load is observed in Burhanpur and Gopalkheda while there is an increasing trend in Yerli G.S. The rise in anthropogenic activities is the main reason behind the reduction in suspended sediment load (SSL) over the basin. The decadal analysis of LULC showed an increase in built-up area (18.3%), barren land (5–8%), waterbodies (1.2–1.9%) agricultural land (50–60.79%) and a decrease in vegetation (from 43 to 21%). The LULC for 2030 is predicted with Land Change Modeler (LCM) in IDRISI Terrset. The estimated LULC shows that the built-up area will expand as agricultural land decreases. The overall study indicates that anthropogenic activities will increase in the future. The findings of this study will aid in decision making for river basin water resource management, as well as understanding the influence of human-caused activities on flow and sediment load variance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As an effective way to realize energy savings and environmental protection, cost sharing is gradually becoming an important measure to reduce emissions in the logistics service supply chain under O2O mode in recent years. How to conduct contract selection and design optimization under the cost-sharing situation, and then improve the operational efficiency of the logistics service supply chain is an important issue that needs to be addressed. Firstly, based on the initial market demand for logistics, this paper involves the influence of both online logistics service integrators and onsite functional logistics service providers on logistics market demand in terms of emission reduction and platform brand image and develops a model based on the logistics service demand function in the O2O mode. Secondly, for the role of online and onsite emission reduction services in multi-cycle continuous cooperation to enhance the platform integrator’s brand image, a cost-sharing differential game model between online and onsite services is developed to facilitate providers’ adoption of high-quality emission reduction services. Finally, the HJB equation is used to compare the non-cooperative Nash game, the cost-sharing Stackelberg game, and the cooperative game to make the optimal abatement decision, the optimal benefit, and the cost-sharing ratio of the abatement service supply chain in the non-cooperative Nash game, the cost-sharing Stackelberg game, and the cooperative game. By comparing the results of the three games, we find that the optimal onsite and online abatement service decision is related to the cost, marginal revenue, and the impact of the service on demand; the abatement cost-sharing contract and cooperation are both better than the non-cooperative independent decision state, which can effectively guide the provision of high-quality onsite abatement service and improve the revenue of both parties involved in the logistics service supply chain and the total system’s revenue in the O2O mode. Compared with the cooperative game model, the cost-sharing contract can more effectively facilitate close cooperation between the actors, and the relationship between onsite and online marginal revenue affects the improvement of both parties’ revenue. The findings of the study can provide useful managerial insights for the selection and design optimization of abatement contracts for logistics service supply chains considering cost-sharing via the O2O model.</jats:p>"

Increasing flood frequency affects developing nations as these countries lack strong forecasting systems. The most flood-prone urban regions are near the coast or riverbanks. Using The International Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) data, a coupled atmospheric-hydrologic ensemble flood forecasting model for the Sabarmati river was developed. Incorporating numerical weather prediction (NWP) information into flood forecasting systems can increase lead times from hours to days. When predicting the weather, we employed numerous NWP models from various prediction centers. European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data with a 5-day advance time are coupled with the HEC-HMS model to provide ensemble stream flow predictions. The ensemble flood forecasting model uses the 2015 flood season as a test scenario. In this research, we discovered that TIGGE ensemble prediction data can be useful for prediction of stream flow and results showed effective flood forecasting for Sabarmati river. HEC-HMS, a semi-distributed hydrologic model, uses ECMWF, NCEP, and UKMO precipitation ensembles. ECMWF shows that 90% of the correlation with observed data and peak time and peak discharge is also match with the observed discharge with a peak on 29 July 2015 with 9,300 cumecs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ensuring industrial safety, labor protection, health of workers, including in the field of electricity, is an urgent task today. This task is set out in the development strategies of the European Union, the United States, Canada and others. This position of the states is aimed at reducing the level of occupational injuries and occupational diseases, which is high, especially in the field of electricity in almost all countries. Analysis of the state of the solution of this problem shows that the working conditions of the staff of the power supply system, especially in the central control points, in many cases need to be improved. The study of the relationships in the system «dispatcher of the main control point of power supply systems - production environment» confirms the importance of solving the problem of improving their working conditions. The peculiarities of power supply system managers are revealed, which are due to the following two main facts. 1 - production activity of dispatchers of the central dispatching points is characterized by the considerable list of tasks which differ in character of the performed work. This necessitates frequent switching of their activities. This mode of operation causes significant psychophysiological loads in their body. 2 - the state of health directly affects the health and well-being of dispatchers during the work shift. This is especially true in emergencies, which require the maximum concentration of professional knowledge, the attention of dispatchers in developing the necessary solution to restore power. Thus, the task of ensuring proper (regulatory) working conditions, regulated by regulations, is complemented by the need to develop measures to optimize the regime «work – rest» during the work shift, ergonomics of the workplace. In this case, for example, while ensuring proper microclimatic conditions, it is necessary to ensure their optimal parameters, and the design or improvement of artificial lighting systems should be based on the qualitative characteristics of light flux. That is, the organization of the production environment should be improved not only taking into account changes in regulations, but also taking into account the latest advances in ergonomics, other areas in the field of providing a comfortable working environment. Based on this, the solution of the problem requires a comprehensive system approach. This approach is proposed to be implemented using the developed adaptive management system of working conditions, ergonomics, ie in general, the production environment in the central control point of the power supply system. A software algorithm for such a management system is presented. The presented methodology for developing an adaptive management system is universal. It can be implemented in power supply systems for various purposes.\nKeywords: power supply systems, central control point, labor protection, management, reliability of power supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tHydrogen that has high energy density is one of the main energy sources for the next generation. Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which can utilize hydrogen's high energy storage density, are a very useful power source. The development of oxygen supply and storage technologies is essential for PEMFCs. Hydrogen peroxide, which has a high oxygen storage density, is present in an aqueous state at room temperature, making it easier to transport and storage in sparse oxygen environments. However, decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalyst has some problems. In order to reserve hydrogen peroxide, it is necessary to add stabilizers, but this causes degradation of the catalyst. We identified the effect of hydrogen peroxide stabilizers on the catalyst in the long-time decomposition reaction. The activation time of the catalyst depends not only on the materials of catalyst but also on the reactor design, and on the decomposition conditions. The effect of these variables on activation time were analyzed. As a result, the possibility of using hydrogen peroxide for long-term oxygen supply to PEMFCs was verified. We observed an improved activation time of 23 hours while maintaining an 1.6L/min oxygen flow rate.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"1476fig1.jpg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rise of manufacturing informatization, many transactions are conducted on the Internet, but the final form of transaction completion is the transaction of actual products, which makes the logistics industry emerge as the times require. How to achieve the optimal allocation scheme and the fastest efficiency in the supply chain has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper considers the characteristics and advantages of 3D image processing technology, describes the characteristics of 3D image processing supply chain (SC), and analyzes the channels that 3D image technology affects SC. Combining the respective characteristics of fuzzy theory and grey theory, the two theories are combined to develop strengths and circumvent weaknesses to form grey fuzzy theory. Comprehensive evaluation of supply chain logistics capability can achieve better evaluation results. The application of grey theory in this chapter includes constructing the factor set of the evaluation index system and determining the weight matrix of the factor set with the game method. The grey fuzzy evaluation weight matrix (i.e., single index evaluation result) is determined with the grey theory, and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation result is finally calculated. This paper studies the supply chain logistics capability evaluation and optimization system from the aspects of system analysis, system function module design, and system architecture design and analyzes the overall goal, demand, feasibility, system business process, and data flow of the system construction. At the same time, this paper designs the supply chain logistics capability evaluation and optimization system and shows some functional interfaces. It is of great significance to improve the responsiveness, total inventory level, total cost level, supply chain performance, agility, and flexibility of the supply chain in the new environment.</jats:p>",

It is motivated by the realization that there is an urgent need for accelerating the decarbonisation agenda, as highlighted in pre-COP26 debates and in the resulting Glasgow Climate Pact, through the mitigation measures that can be unpacked at both cost and scale. This is further reiterated in the third instalment of Assessment Report 6 (AR6) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, dwelling on Mitigation of Climate Change, underlining the required policy shifts and technology developmental needs. Green technology, however, comes at a green premium, being more expensive to implement in geographies that cannot absorb its cost in the immediate short term. This engenders an inequitable and unjust landscape, as those that require green technology are unable to have access to it but are most often on the frontlines of the impacts of climate change. While it is urgent to review this issue and to encourage more cooperation for technology development and transfer, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine war are posing mounting challenges for achieving these objectives. These two crises are causing an unprecedented rise in commodities and labour pricing, with further knock-on impacts on global supply chains for technology. This is in turn rendering green technology unattainable for developing and less developed countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).</jats:p>"

The analysis of both side-scan sonar sonograms mosaic and high-resolution seismic data allowed us to perform a detailed mapping of various substrates highlighting the presence of complex bedform associations. These bedform associations are typical of continental shelf environments affected by high-speed bottom currents. Multisource data analysis integrated by sedimentological study allowed us to identify the directions of sediment movements on the seabed and the progradation of bedforms. Locally, it was found that the bedforms of mobile bottoms are still active and they persist for more than a decade. The path of the currents’ circulation revealed that in the Bonifacio Strait, the bottom currents flow westwards, opposed to the prevailing sea surface flows.</jats:p>",

Applying the discursive agency approach and using evidence from policy documents and 21 interviews with key stakeholders, we analyze the political strategies that paved the way toward MDD in Germany. The decisive strategy was an innovative benchmarking and monitoring mechanism that provided the legitimacy for a law and opened a window of opportunity for MDD supporters. Civil society and supportive politicians used this window of opportunity to build broad political coalitions that included the support of some companies. We discuss the ramifications of these findings for understanding the domestic politics behind the newly emerging norm of foreign corporate accountability.</jats:p>",

The influence rules of the incidence angle, pipe diameter, and wind speed of the tail burnout air on the combustion in the furnace and the movement of the tail particles were obtained. The results show that the setting of burnout air at the tail of the grate can better organize the air flow field at the grate tail, change the particle distribution, prevent small density particles from directly falling into the ash hopper, and prolong the residence time of particles on the grate. Under the study conditions, with an increase in the outlet velocity and the pipe diameter of the tail burnout air, as the movement degree and the burnout degree of grate particles increase, the boiler efficiency increases. With an increase in the incidence angle of the tail burnout air, the flow field in the furnace and the reduction ratio of the tail particles increases at first and then decreases, and the optimal incidence angle is 11–13°.</jats:p>"

However, surface water resources are threatened by human and climatic influences, which may result in changes in size and density. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the normalised difference water index (NDWI), modified normalised difference water index (MNDWI) and automated water extraction index (AWEI) in detecting land surface water changes using Landsat satellite data. The results showed that the AWEI performed considerably better than the MNDWI and NDWI for extracting water surface area in the Upper Mzingwane sub-catchment, with an overall accuracy of 0.93 and a kappa coefficient of 0.82. The MNDWI and NDWI had overall accuracy/kappa values of 0.88/0.74 and 0.89/0.73, respectively. The AWEI can enhance surface water features while effectively suppressing or eliminating pollution and noise from surrounding vegetation and muddy soil. NDWI/MDWI water information is often mixed with pollution noise, vegetation and muddy soil, overestimating the area of water. All the applied indices indicate a progressive loss in the surface area of the water bodies in the sub-catchment. The decrease in water surface area could be a result of degradation, as it coincided with a decrease in vegetation cover and an increase in degraded areas. Future research needs to investigate the hydrological response of the sub-catchment to the potential influence of climate, variability, change, and land use land cover (LULC) changes.</jats:p>",

In order to utilize hydrogen energy, a hydrogen supply chain is required so that hydrogen can be processed and transported to vehicles. It is helpful for technology and policy development to analyze technologies necessary to charge the hydrogen energy generated into vehicles through the supply chain to discover technologies with high potential for future development. The purpose of this paper is to identify promising technologies required in storing, transporting, and charging vehicles generated by the hydrogen fuel supply chain. Afterward, the promising technologies identified are expected to help researchers set a direction in researching technologies and developing related policies. Therefore, we provide technology information that can be used promisingly in the future so that researchers in the related field can utilize it effectively. In this paper, data analysis is performed using related patents and research papers for technical analysis. Promising technologies that will be the core of the hydrogen fuel supply chain in the future were identified using the published patents and research paper database (DB) in Korea, the United States, Europe, China, and Japan. A text mining technique was applied to preprocess data, and then a generic topographic map (GTM) analysis discovered promising technologies. Then, a technology roadmap was identified by analyzing the promising technology derived from patents and research papers in parallel.

Consequently, CR is a critical and valuable resource that should be managed carefully along supply chains. However, the current CR literature is fragmented, and a general definition of CR is elusive. Besides, the academic CR debate largely lacks a supply chain perspective. This is not surprising, as it is very difficult to collect reliable data along supply chains. When supply chains span the globe, data collection is especially challenging, as the chain consists of multiple suppliers and subcontractors, positioned at different tier levels. Recognizing this, the paper examines firstly the current state of CR research through a systematic literature review from a business perspective. The review is combined with a bibliometric mapping approach to show the most influential research clusters, representative of CR research streams and their contributors. This process highlights that the connection between CR and supply chain issues represents a major research gap. Consequently, this paper introduces a research agenda connecting these the two traditionally separated research fields.</jats:p>",

As a new financial model, agricultural product supply chain finance has attracted much attention. Through the analysis of the agricultural product supply chain finance model, we find that the core problem of agricultural supply chain finance is the management and control of supply chain financial risks. Based on the identification of financial risk categories of agricultural products supply chain, this paper constructs tan evaluation index system. Taking Jiangsu Province of China as the research object, this research collects relevant data of financial institutions, logistics enterprises, agricultural product production, and processing enterprises and farmers in southern and northern Jiangsu Province in 2021. The structural equation is used to establish the model. This statistical method can handle multiple potential variables at the same time, and allows observation variables and potential variables to contain measurement errors. The application of statistical methods that can handle multiple potential variables at the same time and allow observation variables and potential variables to contain measurement errors to build a model. By using the Amos calculation model, this research found that the factors affecting the financial risks of the agricultural product supply chain in Jiangsu Province from high to low are: the agricultural product pledge risks, the credit risks, the supply chain operation risks, the technical risks, the legal and policy risk. We hope this research can play a theoretical guiding role for the effective development of agricultural product supply chain finance business.</jats:p>"

An analysis of the influence of exchange, regulatory, technical and technological and other criteria and factors on price formation for energy industry enterprises was carried out. It is indicated that the offer of prices for electric energy on the stock exchange is formed by three components: marginal costs, \"no-load\" costs and \"loading\" costs. It is established that the opportunity given to the consumer to influence the price of electricity independently is an important criterion for the formation of the price of electricity in the conditions of market liberalisation, and the mechanism of implementation of this criterion is detailed. The existence of both a positive and a negative impact of excessive market regulation by the introduction of the procedure \"imposing special obligation\" on energy industry enterprises is indicated. The main factors influencing the \"cost of the supplier's services\" criterion are established and analyzed. The conclusion that the criteria for the formation of the electricity price should represent a coordinated system that realizes the principle of compatibility of incentives for all parties that form a balance of interests - both producers and consumers is a scientific novelty. In addition to the principle of the compatibility of incentives, other principles which must be met by the criteria for the formation of the electricity price were also named for the first time. In order to introduce a systematic approach to analysis, a model of electricity price formation in conditions of market liberalization has been proposed for the first time. The advantage of this model lies in the fact that it allows not only for assessing the impact of the identified criteria on the  electricity price but also to forecast this price for future periods.</jats:p>"

Then, Stackelberg Game and Mathematica 12.0 are used to work out the equilibrium strategies of the recovery model, then we reveal the impact of government subsidies and consumers' low‐carbon preference on the closed‐loop supply chain. (1) Entrusting retailers to recycle is the best choice. (2) The government subsidy to the manufacturer and retailer within a certain range is conducive to promoting recycling activities and has a positive impact on the manufacturer's cost savings and carbon emission reduction investment. Nevertheless, the effect of subsidizing the third party is not obvious. (3) Cultivating consumers' low‐carbon preference for low‐carbon/remanufactured products can not only directly promote the overall profit of the closed‐loop supply chain, but also increase the rate of recovery and level of carbon emission reduction. Thus, the government should increase the subsidized prices of manufacturers and retailers and there is no need to subsidize third parties. It is necessary to cultivate consumers' low‐carbon preference, which is conducive to promoting manufacturers' carbon emission reduction activities.</jats:p>",

The ability of water to supply the different populations has different origins: water taken from river diversions, water from underground catchments, water from lakes and reservoirs, water from the recirculation of treated water, etc. Episodes of turbidity and color changes in the water supply in pipe distribution systems are non-isolated problems that occur in many cities and towns. In particular, sedimentation in water supply pipelines and the subsequent resuspension of these particles in the system have created the need to investigate the processes and variables that promote turbidity episodes, including why, when, and where these episodes occur. In this study, different physicochemical parameters were investigated and analyzed in the water supply distribution network of the city of La Coruña (northwest Spain) through a pipe monitoring panel under real operating conditions. The supply waters come from the Mero river basin, a basin made up of siliceous materials, a unique condition with respect to the majority of studies that have been carried out using waters coming from basins made of basic materials. In this case, the relationships between different variables were studied, including the number of particles, particle size, turbidity, color, concentration of particulate materials, and mineralogy. In this article, only those parameters that are better correlated have been noted. The results revealed a predominant relationship between color and the concentration and mineralogy of particulate materials, as well as between turbidity and the number and size of particles.</jats:p>"

However, these studies neglect to take into account the impact of administrative divisions on public service supply. Current developments in information technology (IT) have brought new opportunities to urban governance. In this study, we take the Community Public Service Centers (CPSCs) of Shanghai as an example to illustrate the impact of administrative divisions on the equitable delivery of public services. We then explore the use of IT-driven implementation of cross-boundary public services to establish an innovative urban governance model that improves the accessibility of public services. The study found that the cross-boundary supply with the support of IT will effectively improve the equitable delivery of public services.

Hence, water containing UFB is gaining increasing attention for potential agricultural applications. Although certain hypotheses have been proposed, such as the collection of ions in water through the electrical characteristic of UFB, no clear experimental data have been provided. We found that improvement in turbidity may cause the adsorption of fine soil particles in the water by the UFB, thereby improving the quality of the water. The data from the paddy field showed that a decrease in turbidity (below 2 nephelometric turbidity units) occurred over a short period of time (3 days). UFB concentration is directly related to turbidity with a coefficient of determination of 0.93. This phenomenon was also observed through the distribution of bubbles and soil particles, where the average particle size increased because of the aggregation of soil particles and the decrease in turbidity in the paddy field, indicating that UFB collect soil particles and thereby improve water quality. Therefore, UFB are highly effective in cleaning rice field water and will be a preferred method for purifying the environment in the future.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, we focus on the electoral preferences of Muslims in Belgium based on mock ballot data connected to an exit poll for the Belgian local elections in 2018. Our structural equation analyses reveal that issues are particularly relevant for Muslims compared with non-Muslims when explaining the leftist vote. Furthermore, neither the Michigan model nor the minorities-specific variables seem to explain Muslims’ preferential voting vis-à-vis non-Muslims. Consequently, using in-depth interviews with Muslims, we further unravel these motivations and the decision-making process leading to their vote choices.</jats:p>",

This research note explores the latter aspect by focusing on the Dutch national election held in March 2021. Based on a small sample of survey data, this exploratory analysis shows that non-citizen residents largely support less-established parties that have positioned themselves as parties that want to innovate and bring about new politics.

This paper balances holistic assessments of the land demands for biomass heating and their ecosystem services. It is predicted that biomass will continue to play an important role in the heating sector in Germany by 2050, as it is one way to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce CO2 emissions. To balance this out, it is important to ensure that the substitution of fossil fuels with fuelwood does not result in losses in biodiversity, natural forest, and agricultural land. Based on the observed types of fuel demand, the need for space in terms of the growing area is characterized as the corresponding land under the consideration of a given land-use type. Formulas have been applied at the federal level in Germany. The area required to supply an average German household is 0.64 ha if all the wood harvested is used for energy purposes, but this is in competition with all other types of timber use. Fuelwood from thinning alone cannot meet the domestic demand. However, a sustainable supply of woody biomass is possible if residues mainly from forestry and the wood processing industry are used, causing a land demand of 2.69 ha per house, possibly in combination with smaller shares of the above-mentioned types of use. Thus, the shares of pellets and wood chips for heating purposes should be expanded, which would also bring ecological advantages. The qualitative consideration of forest ecosystem services shows that changing the forest composition or management may increase the fuelwood supply but does not necessarily decrease forest ecological services.</jats:p>"

However, education becomes the object of social change when education must submit to the development of the industrial world. The hidden curriculum is taught to prepare human resources to fulfil the market’s needs. Education is prepared to work for people who have capital as known terminology, capitalism. The growth of technology and its equipment make education a private and expensive institution economically, whereas unfortunate people cannot participate. Therefore, it creates incapable human resources to fill the free-market vacancy, and religious education is placed in the midpoint. The inequality of supply in human resource skills towards the demand for working space forms the unstable demand and supply curves. As a result, the shifting curve of the Short-Run Aggregate Supply of human capital moves toward supporting capitalism to stand still. Through the sociological approach, the perspective emic discovers the problematic fundamental for religious education is facing a social change. The dilemma of religious education leads to legitimate the path of capitalism in the education area (or market).

Published examples of high-frequency pressure monitoring in intermittent networks are lacking. Intermittent supply can be caused by poor network condition and is associated with delivering less water, less frequently, and with poorer quality than continuous supply. Given the frequency with which intermittent systems drain, fill, and change supply regimes, pressure transients have been hypothesized to be common and to be one mechanism by which intermittent supply further degrades network condition. We present supply start-up data from two very different intermittent systems: a low-pressure, intermittent network in Delhi, India, and a higher-pressure intermittent network in Arraiján, Panama. Across monitoring locations at both sites, we did not detect substantial pressure transients due to pipe filling. In Arraiján, pump start-ups, pump shutdowns, and pipe bursts were associated with potentially problematic transients. We conclude that pipe filling in intermittent supply does not always result in concerning pressure transients. The largest risks to pipe conditions we observed were due to pumping changes in close succession; hence, we recommend that utilities operating intermittent (and continuous) systems leave adequate dissipation time between changes in pump operation.</jats:p>",

Despite many EU workers falling under the label of ‘essential workers’, they are nonetheless vulnerable to unhealthy and unfair working and living conditions linked to the type of work they perform (manual), the conditions of their employment (highly flexible) and their lack of social networks that makes them dependent on their employers for housing and health. Taking EU mobile workers in the meat and distribution sectors, two specific Food Supply Chain sectors in the Netherlands, as a case study, this contribution discusses how in the Netherlands protection during the Covid-19 pandemic was organized for this group of workers in relation to protective measures at the work place, quarantining, pay during periods of quarantine and protection against job loss, and access to public health services (testing, vaccines), topics that generated a great deal of insecurity among EU mobile workers. The analysis is based on data provided by a survey among 153 EU mobile workers (May-July 2021), 35 interviews with Polish and Romanian workers, and 50 interviews with national stakeholders. The aim is to problematize the disjuncture revealed by the pandemic between an EU legal regime that prioritizes mobility and national arrangements around welfare and social protection that leave many mobile workers vulnerable. We argue that EU free movement of workers needs to be flanked by measures to ensure that the people who move do so under decent and fair conditions.</jats:p>",

The results show that the logistics development level, railway transport connectivity, road transport connectivity, economic development level, market size, and common border of Central Asian countries positively affect the development level of the supply chain at different significance levels. Among them, the degree of railway transport connectivity has the greatest impact on the supply chain, followed by the common border, and then the level of logistics development. Moreover, the geographical advantage cannot be underestimated and it plays a positive role in promoting the high-quality development of cross-border agricultural product supply chain. China borders Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and the agricultural product import and export trade quota is significantly greater than that of other Central Asian countries.

An extended (T, s, S) inventory control strategy is utilized to manage spare parts in customer nodes which can determine supply time, consumption and demand. In this spare part supply chain, the supply environment is different in different periods, so the mathematical model and solution method should be able to respond to and detect the environment change quickly. Hence, a dynamic nonlinear programming model is developed for optimizing inventory control decisions and spare part supply decisions so as to minimize the total cost. Furthermore, an improved self-adaptive dynamic migrating particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. In this algorithm, a novel environment change detection and response strategy is applied to deal with the dynamic period in the spare part supply chain network. The results obtained show that the improved algorithm improves the computation time by eight percent and has better computational efficiency compared with the traditional algorithm.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Inventory is the core link of enterprise operation and an essential resource for enterprises to occupy the market. Therefore, optimizing the control and management of inventory is a necessary measure for enterprises to maintain their core competitiveness. However, at present, the optimization of the enterprise’s inventory is basically still at the single inventory level, which seriously shortens the life cycle of the enterprise’s products and reduces the speed of the enterprise’s capital flow. Digital supply chain is the digitization of traditional supply chain services, which can change the traditional thinking of inventory control and management, break down the barriers between enterprises and modern logistics, and build a complete management system for enterprises. Smart logistics is a product of the new era, and it is also a product of the development of the digital supply chain. To this end, this paper proposes an inventory optimization algorithm based on digital supply chain and smart logistics. The algorithm is optimized on the basis of the original inventory optimization scheme, so that the improved algorithm can be more suitable for actual inventory management needs. The experimental results of this paper show that the improved new inventory optimization algorithm improves the comprehensive benefit by 39.1% on the original basis, which can effectively reduce the error in the actual use process.</jats:p>",

We investigate Supply Chains, Government Fiscal Policy Strategies, and Technological Innovation. The government's fiscal policy strategy is indicated by the percentage of tax revenue % of GDP. The supply chain is represented by International trade % of GDP. Technology is indicated by High Technology Exports % of GDP. We found that Technological developments in China can affect the level of tax revenue from the country itself. Then again, using technology also has a significant relationship with the level of trade in China. That is, China's technological advances have a great influence on supply chain activities in China itself. The policies implemented by the Chinese government regarding supply chains are apparently influenced by technological developments, meaning that the more technology develops, the stronger government policies in carrying out economic activities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article examines the peculiarities of logistics activities of transport enterprises at the macro and micro levels. A transport enterprise can be considered an intra-production logistics system in which incoming material flows are transformed into transport services. The types of logistics activities of transport enterprises are analyzed, which are divided into four groups: “Supply Logistics”, “Intra-Production Logistics”, “Sales Logistics” and “Resource Logistics”. A comprehensive indicator for determining the level of logistics controlling is proposed, which makes it possible to assess the state of logistics management. An algorithm for assessing the level of logistics controlling at transport enterprises has been developed, which consists of three survey stages. In the first stage, a survey of the expert group is conducted regarding the importance of each type of logistics activity in four groups. The second stage of the survey is the selection of the most important logistics and control indicators for further evaluation using the Delphi method. The third stage of the survey is determining the weight, points, and relative importance of each indicator. A structural and logical scheme for the formation of logistics controlling indicators has been formed. On this basis, a system of basic logistics and control indicators for transport enterprises was developed. The developed model summarizes the system of logistic-controlling indicators, stages, and formulas for calculation and serves as a tool for determining the level of logistic controlling at a transport enterprise. The basis of the model is creating an objective system of logistics and control indicators for a specific enterprise. Using the developed model for assessing the level of logistics controlling at a transport enterprise will provide the opportunity to obtain the necessary information for strategic and operational planning, as well as improve the management of logistics processes. Given the size and specificity of the enterprise's work, an essential task for managers is the formation of an information base for logistics management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rapid growth in carbon emissions from transport, reducing these emissions is becoming as important as reducing emissions from production. We took a transporter as a member of the supply chain system and constructed a three-echelon supply chain composed of a manufacturer, transporter, and retailer. This study applies the Stackelberg game and Nash game to research the optimal carbon emission reductions, pricing, and social welfare when the government imposes a carbon tax on carbon emitters and consumers are environmentally conscious. The four scenarios were designed as follows: 1) non-cooperative decision-making (NN model), in which neither carbon emission reduction cooperation nor pricing cooperation takes place; 2) local-cooperative decision-making Ⅰ (CN model), in which only cooperation in the field of carbon emission reductions takes place; 3) local-cooperative decision-making Ⅱ (NC model), in which cooperation in the field of pricing without cooperation in the area of carbon emission reductions takes place; and 4) overall-cooperative decision-making (CC model), in which both cooperation in the field of carbon emission reductions and cooperation in the area of pricing take place. The results show that economic (as profit of the supply chain system), social (as pricing and social welfare), and environmental benefits (as the optimal carbon emission reductions) for the three-echelon supply chain will improve with the deepening of cooperation among the supply chain members. Carbon tax policies have different impacts on clean and polluting supply chains. High carbon tax can encourage clean supply chain to increase carbon emission reduction, but will lead to the reduction of carbon emission of polluting supply chain. A cross-shareholding contract is designed to coordinate the supply chain and achieve the optimal state of the overall cooperative decision. Finally, the paper provides suggestions on carbon emission reductions for enterprises and policymaking for the government.</jats:p>"

The hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium Ralstonia eutropha can biosynthesize poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] [P(3HB)], the most common PHA, from carbon dioxide using hydrogen and oxygen as energy sources. In conventional autotrophic cultivation using R. eutropha, a gas mixture containing 75–80 vol% hydrogen is supplied; however, a gas mixture with such a high hydrogen content has a risk of explosion due to gas leakage. In this study, we aimed to develop an efficient cell culture system with a continuous supply of a non-combustible gas mixture (H2: O2: CO2: N2 = 3.8: 7.3: 13.0: 75.9) for safe autotrophic culture to produce P(3HB) by hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria, with a controlled hydrogen concentration under a lower explosive limit concentration. When the gas mixture was continuously supplied to the jar fermentor, the cell growth of R. eutropha H16 significantly improved compared to that in previous studies using flask cultures. Furthermore, an increased gas flow rate and agitation speed enhanced both cell growth and P(3HB) production. Nitrogen source deficiency promoted P(3HB) production, achieving up to 2.94 g/L P(3HB) and 89 wt% P(3HB) content in the cells after 144 h cultivation. R. eutropha NCIMB 11599, recombinant R. eutropha PHB-4, and Azohydromonas lata grew in a low-hydrogen-content gas mixture. R. eutropha H16 and recombinant R. eutropha PHB-4 expressing PHA synthase from Bacillus cereus YB-4 synthesized P(3HB) with a high weight-average molecular weight of 13.5–16.9 × 105. Thus, this autotrophic culture system is highly beneficial for PHA production from carbon dioxide using hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria as the risk of explosion is eliminated.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study sought to identify the best possible strategies for exchanging treated urban wastewater for agricultural water in Mashhad city, located in Iran, a country that suffers from decreased urban water resources. Based on the interviews conducted with the experts and the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis, 28 influential factors were identified for the water exchange project, and eleven strategies were developed for its implementation. The results of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and F-TOPSIS indicated that organizing educational and awareness campaigns regarding the exchange project's goals, devising an appropriate organizational structure, enhancing treated wastewater's quality according to the WHO standards, taking the necessity of conducting social, cultural, and economic studies into account, developing consumers' awareness programs, and supporting, training, and counseling the farmers and setting the required incentives for them were among the main factors involved in the implementation of the water exchange project in Mashhad.</jats:p>",

This article suggests a new blockchain architecture to protect the integrity of agricultural data. The goal of this architecture is to provide farmers with safe storage. The agriculture data inserted cannot be modified without some rules. Many procedures are completed automatically using smart contracts to limit the danger of manipulation. One of the suggested architectures is the proof of concept. It connects a traditional farm system with the blockchain accompanied by smart contracts to facilitate the entire agri-supply chain. The conceptual architecture will eliminate the flaws discovered in prior studies. Sensors are used in this approach to provide us with environmental data. As a result, we store our data in blocks using the blockchain system. Then, we built some unique agricultural smart contracts to handle all transactions and automatize decisions based on the source code of these automated contracts. This strategy would be more efficient and secure.</jats:p>",

Because of that, organizational culture and normative commitment are also included as extremely important factors. The research includes a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature and at the same time obtaining and analysing data from practice through a survey. The research focuses on employees from the logistics departments in the supply chain of electronic component production and supply. Group of companies across Europe were included in the survey (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia and Ukraine). The research demonstrates the realization that the types of classification of organizational culture have different effects on direct and indirect normative commitment. Gender differences were also found. The research-based on the calculated average mean values shows the classifications of organizational culture and normative commitment. The latter follows the organizational culture with minor deviations. The order of classification of organizational culture follows the current economic situation, where according to the studied criteria, the first is a culture of the market. The research shows that men’s rate of normative commitment is better than women’s, while in organizational culture the situation is exactly the opposite. One of the most significant findings is based on the Pearson correlation coefficient with the SPSS program was found that, according to the classification, Hierarchy culture has a positive effect on indirect normative commitment.</jats:p>",

Especially to examine the existence of ecocentricity and supply chain traceability that moderates GSCM practices with environmental performance and operational costs.  Design/Methodology/Approach: The judgement sampling method was used in this study, and 85 respondents contributed. Research questionnaires were distributed online, and data were analysed using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM).  Research Findings: The results of this study indicate that GSCM practices have a significant relationship to environmental performance and operational costs of MSMEs in the food and beverage industry in Indonesia. Supply chain ecocentricity moderates the relationship between GSCM practices, environmental performance, and operating costs. However, supply chain traceability does not moderate the relationship between GSCM practices, environmental performance, and operational costs.  Theoretical Contribution/Originality: The concept and practice of GSCM is gaining popularity in developing countries, but is still limited to the scope of MSMEs. Thus, research on GSCM still has to be extended to MSMEs because most research is limited to large organisations.  Managerial Implication in the South East Asian Context: This research covers the concept and practice of GSCM on MSMEs in Indonesia. For MSMEs in the food and beverage industry, this research is expected to be taken into consideration in implementing GSCM for supply chain ecocentricity to improve business performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Service‐level requirements play a crucial role in eliminating stock‐outs in a production pipeline. However, delivering a specific service level can become an unattainable goal given the various uncertainties influencing both the production pipeline and customer demand and causing the manufacturer to adapt the initial strategy in response to disruptions. Such deviations from optimality frequently result in unexpected (and potentially very high) costs and are complex to manage. On the one hand, the manufacturer can use a robust or distributionally robust approach to prepare for the worst‐case disruption, ensuring that the realized cost will be lower than the estimated cost with high probability. On the other hand, this solution may lead to overly conservative production schedules. In this article, we take a different approach and develop a bilevel stochastic optimization model with chance constraints, which allows us to make the production more predictable in the event of disruptions by driving costs and optimal schedules closer to the benchmark for each scenario considered. We introduce doubly probabilistic service‐level requirements to account for two interdependent layers of uncertainty, that is, production disruptions and distributional uncertainties in customer demand. This allows us to make high‐quality production decisions with only a limited understanding of the demand pattern. Approximating the problem for a numerical solution, we guarantee tight optimality gaps for high service levels and propose an efficient solution scheme, combining robust scenario reduction with a customized Benders decomposition procedure. In the managerial section, we use the Omega× Swatch MoonSwatches example to demonstrate that a desirable doubly probabilistic service level can be attained for disruptions with a drop in demand. In the case of disruptions followed by a peak in demand, one can tighten the optimality gaps if the service level is reduced. </jats:p>",

It has been established that despite the indirect and relatively low sensitivity of e-commerce to political risks, there is a high probability of negative impact on the mechanism of functioning of supply chains of e-commerce enterprises of military conflicts. The characteristic directions of influence of the risks of military conflicts on the activities of e-commerce enterprises are revealed. Five groups of risks for the supply chain of an e-commerce enterprise caused by military conflicts have been identified: infrastructure, contractual, economic, financial, social, reputational. The consequences and directions of influence of factors of military-political instability on the functional areas of logistics of the supply chain of e-commerce enterprises are determined. The ranking was carried out using the expert method of risks of military conflicts for supply chains of e-commerce enterprises. It was established that in 1st place with an importance coefficient of 0.18 there is a risk of deterioration of information relations. It was estimated that the average period for the restoration of supply chains since the beginning of hostilities is 2–3 months.

In the present work, we propose a comprehensive computational model for tubular photobioreactors equipped with glass sponges. The simulation model requires a minimum of at least three submodels for hydrodynamics, light supply, and biomass kinetics, respectively. First, by modeling the hydrodynamics, the light–dark cycles can be detected and the mixing characteristics of the flow (besides the mass transport) can be analyzed. Second, the radiative transport model is deployed to predict the local light intensities according to the wavelength of the light and scattering characteristics of the culture. The third submodel implements the biomass growth kinetic by coupling the local light intensities to hydrodynamic information of the CO2 concentration, which allows to predict the algal growth. In combination, the novel mesoscopic simulation model is applied to a tubular PBR with transparent walls and an internal sponge structure. We showcase the coupled simulation results and validate specific submodel outcomes by comparing the experiments. The overall flow velocity, light distribution, and light intensities for individual algae trajectories are extracted and discussed. Conclusively, such insights into complex hydrodynamics and homogeneous illumination are very promising for CFD-based optimization of PBR.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a deep learning model, the effect of the model may vary depending on the setting of the hyperparameters. Despite the importance of such hyperparameter determination, most previous studies related to burst detection models of the water supply pipe network used hyperparameters applied in other fields as-is or made a trial-and-error setting based on experience, which is a limitation. In this paper, a study was conducted on the deep learning hyperparameter determination of a deep neural network (DNN)-based real-time detection model of pipe burst accidents. The pipe burst model predicted water pressure by using operation data in units of 1 min, and the data period applied for the model training was less than 1 month (1, 2, and 3 weeks) in order to consider frequent changes in the system. A sensitivity analysis was first performed on the type of activation function and the period of the learning data, which may have different effects depending on the characteristics of the target problem. The number of hidden layers related to the network structure and the number of neurons in each hidden layer were set as hyperparameters for additional sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis results were derived and compared using four quantified prediction error indicators. In addition, the model running time was analyzed to evaluate the practical applicability of the development model. From the results, it was confirmed that excellent effects could be expected if using a rectifier function as the activation function, 144 nodes in the hidden layer, which is eight times the number of nodes in the input layer, and four hidden layers. Additionally, by analyzing the appropriate period of training data required for model pressure prediction through prediction error and driving time, it was confirmed that it was most appropriate to use the data of two weeks. By applying the hyperparameter values determined through detailed sensitivity analysis and by applying the data of one week including actual burst accidents to the built-up pressure prediction model, the accident detection and predictive performance of the model were verified. The rational determination of the period of input factors for the optimal hyperparameter setting and model building, as in this study, is very necessary and very important as it can serve to ensure the continuity of the operation effects of the deep learning model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> The Korean Pharmaceutical Information Service (KPIS) was established in October 2007 to increase the transparency of the pharmaceutical supply chain by integrating relevant information. This study aimed to describe the KPIS program and perform a cost-benefit analysis of the KPIS.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> We conducted a cost-benefit analysis based on cost savings in terms of National Health Insurance (NHI). The outcome measures were the net financial benefit and benefit-cost ratio over the 12 years since the establishment of the KPIS. The cost estimate included the costs of labor and business operations, the development of an information entry system, and office maintenance. Financial benefits were defined as savings resulting from the implementation of the program based on KPIS data. Social benefits were defined as the prevention of recalled medicines from entering the supply chain and the decrease in inventory and disposal.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The KPIS clearly resulted in a net financial benefit, saving 37.2 million USD, which was 2.6 times higher than the cost of implementation. While the benefit-cost ratio was less than one during the first period, it exceeded 3.4 during the second period. After calculating and integrating social benefits, the net benefit increased to 571.6 million USD, and the benefit-cost ratio was 24.8. A sensitivity analysis of the annual benefit showed that the net benefit varied from a low of −1.5 million USD to a high of 24.7 million USD according to the program implementation year.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The establishment of the KPIS and a system for collecting information on the pharmaceutical supply chain showed meaningful financial and social benefits when compared to the input cost. Since no other countries have an integrated pharmaceutical information system that incorporates all information from production to administration, the example of the KPIS can provide a precedent for other countries.</jats:p>"

In the present study, the effect of water depth on the thermal performance of tubular solar still (TSS) with v-corrugated and flat absorbers has been analyzed experimentally and optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM) technique. Experimental results showed that the water temperature of TSS using a v-corrugated absorber is improved by increasing the surface area of water. The peak temperature of water from the TSS using corrugated fins is improved by about 7.54, 7.12, and 3.77% than the TSS with a flat absorber for water depths of 5, 10, and 15 mm, respectively. The average temperature difference between water and cover is improved by about 53.19, 64.28, and 112.90% for water depths of 5, 10, and 15 mm using the TSS with a corrugated absorber rather than a flat absorber. The influence of water depth on cumulative yield using 5, 10, and 15 mm in the v-corrugated absorber is recorded as 4.35, 3.86, and 3.83 kg, and it is higher by about 108.13, 128.40, and 216.52% compared to the cumulative yield of TSS with a flat absorber, respectively.</jats:p>",

In this study, a hydroponic experiment was performed to determine the critical B requirement and B distribution in B. napus. The plants were grown for four weeks at a range of B levels (from 0.25 to 1000 µM) supplied in a nutrient solution. The results showed significant differences in the root and shoot dry matter and B accumulation in these tissues among the supplied B levels. Severe visible symptoms of B deficiency were observed on the leaves at levels lower than 1 µM B and toxicity at 1000 µM B in the nutrient solution. The maximum shoot and root dry matter were recorded at 25 µM B in the nutrient solution. The plants supplied with the lowest and the highest B levels produced 35% and 37% less shoot dry matter than those supplied with 25 µM B, while the corresponding decreases in the root dry matter were 48% and 36%, respectively. The critical concentration of B, which is the lowest concentration at which plants produce 90% of the maximum shoot dry matter, was proven to be 1 µM B for oilseed rape. At this level of external B supply, the B concentration in the shoot was 26.9 mg kg−1 DM. It was found that with the increase in B levels in the nutrient solution, the relative distribution of B between the roots and the shoots shifted in favor of the shoots.</jats:p>"

However, pH is not usually targeted as a primary control parameter and its effects on T&amp;O are often overlooked in favor of other treatment issues. When it comes to T&amp;O control, treatment alternatives typically focus on oxidation and adsorption processes. Whether within these processes or separately, pH plays an important role and the effects on T&amp;O should be considered. For example, pH plays a role in the speciation of odorous chemicals in the environment, some of which arise in wastewater treatment and others from the occurrence of metals in water. During blooms of algae and cyanobacteria in surface water, pH is an important parameter affecting water quality and T&amp;O. Finally, as pH is important for the sample preservation and analysis of T&amp;O compounds, pH is important in the fate and control of T&amp;O. The objective of this article is to better understand the various ways that pH can influence T&amp;O production, control, and analysis of odorants in water and encourage advancement in the state of the science of pH optimization for T&amp;O control.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the sustainable development of the global economy, environmental problems and the green economy are increasingly becoming points of concern for the community. However, the large amount of capital invested in green technology and the high price of green products have become the key problems hindering the development of a risk-averse green supply chain. In order to promote the supply chain to increase green investment level, improve the green degree of products, and reduce the impact of risk aversion on green investment, this paper studies a two-echelon green supply chain composed of a risk-averse manufacturer and a risk-neutral retailer, in which the retailer is the leader and the manufacturer is the follower. We construct the wholesale price contract model, cost-sharing contract model, and two-part contract model, respectively, and use the Optimization Theory and Methods to discuss the impact of the three contracts on the green degree, expected utility of supply chain, retail price, consumer surplus, and social welfare. The results show that in the cost-sharing contract, compared with the wholesale price contract, the green degree of the product has been significantly improved, but the expected utility of the supply chain enterprises cannot achieve Pareto improvement, and the higher consumer environmental awareness will cause the manufacturer’s expected utility to decline. In the two-part tariff contract, compared with the wholesale price contract, the expected utility of supply chain enterprises achieves Pareto improvement, and the green degree of products is the highest in the three contracts; more importantly, in the two-part contract, the product green degree, the retail price, and the expected utility of the supply chain are not related to the manufacturer’s risk aversion; meanwhile, the retail price in the two-part tariff is the lowest among the three contracts, and the consumer surplus and social welfare are the highest. Our main contribution is that the two-part contract eliminates the influence of the manufacturer’s risk aversion on the above decision variable and realizes the unification of manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and social benefits. Finally, this paper uses numerical examples to verify the above conclusions and then analyzes the sensitivity of the supply chain system.</jats:p>"

Therefore, we have constructed a differential game model based on the delay effect to determine the optimal traceability level and traceable goodwill and compare the profits of the food supply chain (FSC). The results show that the delay time is positively related to the level of traceability effort and has a high impact on the traceable goodwill.

The relevance of the research is related to the comprehensive solution to the problem of the logistical nature of the supply and mastering modern various weapons by the military to create parity of forces in the military conflict zone. The current study creates a complex of logistic methods and models that allow analyzing training of the military, supply of weapons, ammunition and spare parts to the zone of military conflict, for the successful implementation of the goals of the military operation. This article analyzes the problem of using modern and diverse military equipment, which needs to be solved by systematically presenting military training in logistics, supplying various weapons from various manufacturers to the area of combat operations. The optimization model has been created to select and justify the composition of suppliers of weapons, spare parts and ammunition, in the context of risks that arise in the production and transportation of military cargo in a heterogeneous transport network. Optimization is performed in conditions of conflicting criteria: the number of new weapons; time and costs for the production and supply of military equipment; logistical risks. To study dynamic processes in the logistics of supplying weapons, spare parts and ammunition, a model has been created that allows, with the help of simulation agents, the investigation of the paths of movement of military cargo under the conditions of military threats and possible excitation of critical vulnerabilities in the heterogeneous transport supply network. An algorithm for forming the optimal delivery route at the minimum time under risks has been developed. Simulation modeling is used to estimate the movement time of military cargo, delays in supply, accumulation of risks in cargo transportation, consequences of threats and vulnerabilities in supply logistics, etc. This study examines the process of training the military by mastering new competencies for the use of various modern weapons in combat conditions. Simultaneously, the short terms of training of military personnel and the logistics of their transportation to training centers are considered subject to the threats and risks of wartime. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is ensured by a systematic representation of the logistics of supplying various weapons, spare parts and ammunition to the conflict zone, and a comprehensive solution to the research tasks set. The scientific novelty of the conducted research is associated with the development of new methods and models based on system analysis. The following methods were used: simulation modeling, models for optimizing, competence model for acquiring new knowledge by the military personnel. The results of the study should be used to select and justify suppliers of new diverse weapons and military equipment, train the military to use modern kinds and types of weapons, plan routes and schedules for the supply of military cargo to the area of combat operations, in conditions of wartime threats.</jats:p>"

However, there are cases where fire water is not supplied quickly, which is also caused by the inability to find the connection water pipe inlet owing to unclear regulations on the installation location of the connection water pipe facility fire safety standards. If the connected water pipe facility is not found, fire-fighting tactics involving ropes are used, which takes a lot of time. To improve this problem, we confirmed experimentally that fire extinguishing water can be quickly and stably delivered to fire suppression personnel using a water outlet (40 A) installed in an indoor fire extinguishing tank on the first floor of an apartment. Through the experimental results, the Fire Safety Standards (NFSC 502) for Connected Water Pipeline Facilities (NFSC 502) proposed a plan to improve the fire safety standards (new) that require installation of water outlets (65 A, rotating) in the indoor firebox on the first floor of the apartment. If the revised fire safety standards are applied to the new building, firefighters who arrive at the site can quickly and stably supply fire water through the connecting water pipe connection port (65 A, rotary type) installed in the indoor fire extinguishing tank.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The private sector in Ghana provides 50% of health services in the country yet there is limited information on the supply chain management of MNCH commodities in this sector.\n\nAim: To understand how MNCH commodities are managed within the private sector.\n\nMethod: A mixed methods approach was used to capture supply chain related data on a subset of MNCH commodities in the private sector. The sampling strategy included the selection of four regions (Ashanti, Greater Accra, Northern, and Upper East) in Ghana. Quantitative data on product management, availability, source, pricing and registration were collected from retail pharmacies, private health facilities and wholesalers. Additionally qualitative data on factors influencing supply decisions were collected from wholesalers.\n\nResults: The study showed that retail pharmacies and wholesalers were less likely to manage injectable products like gentamicin, magnesium sulphate and oxytocin as compared to private health facilities. At all three facility types, amoxicillin DT, chlorhexidine gel and ORS + zinc co-pack were the least managed products. The main reason for non-management of MNCH products was “low or no client demand”. Majority of MNCH products had at least half of the most prevalent brands registered. Regarding product pricing, the results showed lower NHIS prices for certain products compared to selling prices at retail pharmacies and health facilities. Ninety percent of all three facility types met at least half of the storage requirements; with 100% of wholesalers and 96% of health facilities storing oxytocin in a working refrigerator. However, 25% of retail pharmacies did not store oxytocin within the recommended temperature range of 2-8 degrees.\n\nConclusion: The private sector is influenced by commercial factors, which could come at a high cost in terms of availability, accessibility, and affordability for individuals and families. There is the need to create a cost incentive that encourages the private sector to offer and improve access to critical MNCH commodities, including amoxicillin DT, ORS + zinc co-pack, chlorhexidine gel and injectable MNCH products.\n\nKeywords: Private sector, MNCH, Supply Chain, Wholesale pharmacies, Retail pharmacies</jats:p>"

The sector of small, medium, and artisan mining enterprises (PAMMA), in Chile, has the same pressure as large mining to meet the demands of sustainability in the medium term, but the network of PAMMA facilities is precarious and requires government support for development. One strategy to improve the supply network is to locate intermediate points with limited capacities (called purchasing powers) to help the viability of the business model by incorporating sustainability objectives, such as diminishing the movement of minerals, as well as reducing the carbon footprint and gas emissions, all in support the promotion of the activity of small miners. In order to achieve the strategy above, a mathematical model of location and sustainable capacity is proposed. A grouping of suppliers was carried out to establish the number of mining suppliers in each cluster and the location of the intermediate hubs. Then, the prioritization of the parameters and classification of the processing plant alternatives was performed to define a vector of weights to rank the degree of sustainability. A sustainability matrix was calculated on the basis of the distances and transportation costs between the supplier hubs of the supply network and the processing plants. With each of these factors, a capacity model was developed to validate the mineral process flows in the supply network and estimate the expected productivity levels. The model is intended to support operational decision making when determining the location of an intermediate purchasing power that reduces the impact of transportation costs and emissions. The model was applied in a case study of the supply network in the small mining sector in Chile. The results recommend the location of hubs to add value and encourage investment in the PAMMA supply network.</jats:p>"

In light-limited regimes – high-latitudes – this process can initiate phytoplankton blooms prior to the springtime warming. The question is whether mixed layer eddies can enhance the spring bloom by delivering nutrients from beneath the mixed layer. We couple a submesoscale-resolving model (SUB) with a simple ecosystem model and examine the role of mixed layer eddies on the development of the spring bloom. We compare the SUB simulation to two coarser resolution (10 km) simulations, one that includes a mixed layer eddy parameterization (MLE) and another that prescribes the restratification from SUB and advects the biogeochemical tracers using geostrophic velocities (NVF). The MLE simulates restratification of the mixed layer and bloom onset, but the spring bloom has a deficit of 10–13% in the new production compared to SUB. The NVF has the same restratification as SUB, and with no vertical flux of nutrients, leads to a spring bloom with a 32–40% new production deficit compared to SUB. Submesoscale processes lead to exchange across the mixed layer base, which is not represented in coarse resolution model simulations, even with mixed layer eddy parameterizations. Our results show that nutrients supplied by mixed layer eddies are important to enhance the spring bloom.</jats:p>"

This understanding has been gaining more and more prominence in studies in Brazil and also in the world. In this context, this research aims to map the risk of water shortages and sewage insufficiency in a Brazilian semi-arid city using GIS-MCDA. The secondary data used in this research were collected from IBGE, Compesa, and the City Hall of Caruaru and were processed using the QGIS 3.12 Bucareşti software. The Pernambuco Tridimensional database and the Analytical Hierarchy Process method were used in the process to generate the maps. After collecting and analyzing the data, it was seen that, according to the water shortage risk map, seven neighborhoods had a “Very high” risk, in which the criteria with the greatest weight were the distance from distribution reservoirs, the main supply network and altimetry. The map of the degree of sanitary sewage insufficiency showed that four neighborhoods have a “Very high” degree; these neighborhoods are far from the main sewage network and from sewage treatment stations and have the lowest rates of households served by the system. Such characteristics need to be highlighted in the planning and implementation of water and sewage services. Thus, it is concluded that the use of high-resolution spatial databases for the planning of urban services, as carried out in the present work, provides a greater level of confidence for solutions that can be implemented in the expansion of service networks to the population.</jats:p>"

As a result, the challenges associated with project procurement and supply chain management need to be carefully analyzed and evaluated. Although there has been reasonable literature on procurement and supply chain management, the limitations include the following: The literature, especially focusing on the analytical methodology, is scarce, as is the case with the developing country public-sector project context. This study, in its own modest way, contributes to this gap. Thus, the goal of this paper is to critically examine the Delphi and/or analytical hierarchy process (AHP), as well as their application and appropriateness in analyzing the challenges in the Bangladesh context, from relevant literature published between 2000 and 2019. A systematic review was carried out using the ABI/Inform, EBSCO, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases for the study. The review of 2071 articles yielded 37 articles for the study. The Delphi and/or AHP were the most applied tools found in the review. Finally, the study examined 18 articles that applied Delphi and/or AHP methods. The review findings contribute to the literature by providing academics and practitioners with an understanding of the appropriateness of the Delphi-based AHP research framework for analyzing challenges to procurement and supply chain management in public-sector agriculture projects. Following that, a novel best-practice research framework based on the Delphi–AHP method is presented.</jats:p>"

Between 2013 and 2017, Burkina Faso implemented a performance-based financing (PBF) program to improve primary health care service provision (including FP) at rural health centers. Our prior work revealed that PBF did not lead to a reduction in unmet need for FP, in spite of FP being an explicitly targeted service. Our current study assesses supply-side factors that have likely contributed towards this lack of effect at population level, by examining changes in facility-based indicators relevant to the provision of FP induced by PBF.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We used facility-based survey data from 406 PBF and 117 control facilities collected before and after the PBF implementation.

The aim of this study was to compare two transmittance/reflectance‐based sensors (SPAD, ASD) and a florescence‐based sensor (Multiplex) in their ability to measure N content in corn (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.), spring and winter barley (<jats:italic>Hordeum vulgare</jats:italic> L.), and rye (<jats:italic>Secale cereale</jats:italic> L.), both at the leaf and canopy level. Measurements of leaves and canopies from six fertilization field trials in 2019 and 2020 were analyzed to establish relationships between sensor information and laboratory‐determined N content in crops. Analyses included linear regression for single sensor variables and machine learning for multivariate approaches, to assess the relative accuracy of the proximal sensors to measure N. The ASD is time‐intensive and requires post hoc analyses of the spectra. However, the spectral outputs of this device were clearly correlated with the N status of leaves and canopies. At the leaf level, SPAD showed higher accuracy than any of the single Multiplex variables to predict plant N. Multiplex performance could be improved by combining three of its variables. At the canopy level, interpolated SPAD values and the best‐performing Multiplex variables showed similar accuracy. It could be concluded that the relationship sensor‐N status is species specific. Despite the high standard deviation recorded in some raw Multiplex variable, the derived indices showed a comparable low standard deviation. At both, leaf and canopy levels an integrated sensor solution would combine the multidimensionality of Multiplex and ASD, and the accuracy and practicality of SPAD.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The analysis of the congruence between the demand- and supply-side of populism is key to understand the relationship between citizens and populist parties, and to what extent this is mainly a “pull” or “push” phenomenon. Although the study of populism has experienced an unprecedented growth across social sciences during the last decade, research directly addressing this connection remains scarce. Moreover, most existing tools used to measure populism have not been created paying much consideration to their compatibility with those applied in the other side of this demand-supply divide. This article critically revisits the influential Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) Module 5 dataset to illustrate shortcomings regarding current efforts to measure the demand- and supply-sides of populism. We show that according to CSES data the, often presumed, correspondence between “populist” attitudes and likelihood of voting for “populist parties” is only partial and country specific. But more importantly, we identify three main potential sources of such mismatch linked to instrumental issues: (i) problems with the choice, design and operationalization of attitudinal survey items; (ii) problems in the assessment of parties' populism; and (iii) instrument biases that make them more effective with some varieties of populism than with others. These methodological limitations are hindering our ability to settle longstanding theoretical debates concerning the correspondence between the demand- and supply-side, the relative centrality of attributes, and varieties of populism. Therefore, we invite scholars working in this field to update existing measurement tools, or develop new ones, considering the multidimensionality of this latent construct, the diversity of movements, and the need to apply consistent criteria and operationalization techniques when assessing degrees of populism in citizens and parties.</jats:p>"

To inform energy planning and policymaking, cost-optimisation models for energy systems must be fed with adequate data on potential sites for VRE plants, including costs reflective of resource strength, grid expansion needs and full hourly generation profiles.

The innovation is that a new design framework for urban virtual water and power networks with interdependent characteristics combined with geographic information is suggested based on the perspective of practical engineering. After giving an overview of the framework, this paper presents the planning and design of the water and power supply networks as well as the interdependence between them in detail. Then the water and power supply networks of a virtual city called Virtual Shangcheng City are established, which verify the feasibility and practicality of the approach. This framework can establish virtual water and power supply networks with interdependent characteristics that conform to actual engineering and urban geographic information characteristics. Moreover, it can provide an effective modeling method for water and power supply networks in the absence of data for urban resilience and disaster risk studies.</jats:p>"

In this channel integration environment, the customer service provided by the bricks‐and‐mortar store is critical to the chain's success. Based on a stackable game model, we analyze the contract methods for the cases of revenue sharing and no revenue sharing, where the latter is classified into two types: All the credit goes to the offline or online channel. Focusing on improving consumer service and supply chain performance in the BOPS mode, we observe that revenue sharing is not necessarily the best contract type, while the non‐revenue‐sharing contract of a lump‐sum subsidy plus quantity discount can coordinate the supply chain. We also analyze the impacts of some endogenous parameters and derive the conditions for the equilibrium outcomes. We find that revenue sharing cannot effectively stimulate the offline channel to improve its service effort as the offline channel is more concerned about service cost sharing than revenue sharing. The results are similar to those of revenue allocation to the online or offline channel in the BOPS mode, but the conditions are slightly different. Conducting numerical studies to gain insights from the analytical findings, we find that the subsidy contract is better than the revenue‐sharing approach under various market conditions.</jats:p>",

Deemed “critical infrastructure,” workers in the food supply chain (FSC) were particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to poor adaptation of policies and practices related to health, immigration, and work. The pandemic has shone a light on preexisting inequalities and risks related to precarious and hazardous work, particularly for (im)migrant workers. We conducted harmonized policy analyses in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany, in the Netherlands, and in Illinois, USA on measures taken during the pandemic and how they affected migrant workers. These three regions host large businesses in meat-processing and agriculture. They saw significant COVID-19 outbreaks, with widespread health, social and economic repercussions. Public health effects included higher risk for all communities in the region; social effects included local lockdown measures; economic effects included food supply problems, euthanized animals, and financial losses due to the temporary closure of businesses. In our workshop, we will deliver three brief presentations on (im)migration, labor, and occupational safety and health policies during the COVID-19 syndemic in Germany, the Netherlands, and the USA. We present results of our analysis, highlighting similarities and differences between the EU-member states Germany and the Netherlands, on the one hand, and the US, related to the employment and exploitation of migrant workers from the global South/East in the global North/West. We highlight issues to be addressed in future global emergencies. The pandemic has prompted occupational safety and health measures in the FSC. However, agro-industrial sectors in Western Europe and the US heavily rely on precariously employed workers (e.g., seasonal, temporary and/or subcontracted workers). This may impact the extent to which preventive measures “work” for these populations: even when good policies are formulated, information exchange, collaboration, and enforcement by relevant agencies and immigration authorities is critical. Without such cooperation, the realization of stronger social protection of (im)migrant workers is are left to the good will of the employer. Structural drivers in the form of policies related to mobile labor, (im)migration and employment, superimposed on segmented labor markets and discriminatory practices, drove significant morbidity among (im)migrant workers. The following discussion will synthesize insights from the three contexts, and provide an opportunity to brainstorm with workshop participants to facilitate cross-national collaboration on this issue.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Key messages</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>• Food supply chain workers are at the intersection of discrimination in health, employment, and migration.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>• Comparative analysis provides a rich framework to guide management of vulnerable sectors, workers and workplaces during future pandemics.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Energy consumption and generation are projected steadily up to 2050 under all scenarios while the carbon emissions show a downward trend with a rapid decline from 2021 to 2030 and a relatively stable state for the next 20 years. Combining policy advancement and marginal carbon abatement cost (MACC) of different energy technologies, energy structure optimization-low cost (ESO-LOW) scenario shows a higher emission reduction benefits than the others. Six other villages in Shandong are analyzed in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of supply-demand bilateral energy structure optimization, sensitivity results show that the optimization is significant to the carbon neutrality target and carbon emission reduction.</jats:p>"

Water consumption and multilayer analyses (e.g., geology, groundwater abstraction, groundwater level, piped water coverage, and groundwater quality) were carried out to determine the priority areas for piped water development. Based on three parameters, namely the water demand–supply gap, land subsidence, and groundwater quality, the northern and western regions of Jakarta were selected as the priority areas for piped water development, followed by the southern and eastern regions. The demand for piped water by the population in the abovementioned priority areas is estimated to be 462,211 m3/d, while the total water demand of Jakarta is 1,878,899 m3/d, which is greater than the supply capacity of 1,747,440 m3/d from the existing water treatment plants. Therefore, the areas for controlled groundwater abstraction were also selected to augment the shortfall of the piped water supply capacity.</jats:p>"

It was determined that the basis of the formation of logistics customer service is their segmentation or differentiation. A classic logistic approach to the differentiation of customers can be considered their division using ABC-XYZ analysis. At the same time, ABC analysis is usually carried out based on the income brought by clients for a certain period of time, XYZ analysis is carried out according to the stability of relations with the client, that is, according to the number of orders placed by the client during the same period of time. We proposed our own view on the direct process of dividing customers into groups A, B and C, which is based on the calculation of the \"jump in share\" of customer revenues. The advantage of the proposed approach is that customers with relatively equal importance to the company cannot fall into different categories, and customers with very different values of importance to the company cannot fall into the same category. Another approach to customer differentiation based on customer profitability was also proposed and recommendations for servicing each customer group were made. Thus, the correct segmentation of customers and assessment of the potential of each segment will allow building several different service strategies aimed at increasing the company's profits.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, the locking bandwidth decreases with the increase of power supply ripple. Thus, to achieve injection locking, both power supply ripple and frequency pushing effect must be considered. The experiment results show that at injection ratio μ of 0.003, frequency pushing effect at 0.5, and power supply ripple increases from 0% to 1% and 2.5%, the locking bandwidth of magnetron decreases by 0.32 MHz, 2.12 MHz. With the amplitude of ripple increasing, the spectrum after injection locking deteriorates, and output amplitude reduces, which verifies the theoretical analysis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the years, the global supply chain has evolved into a more extensive interconnected complex network with multiple suppliers, manufacturers, and customers. Since environmental issues have become a burning question in recent years, the focus has shifted to attaining sustainability in supply chain management. The green supply chain or sustainable network is a concept to reduce environmental impacts in the life cycle of a product. However, green supply chain management is often challenged with additional operating costs and difficulty monitoring the implications within the complex network system. Additionally, many stakeholders are unaware of the importance of sustainability analysis, which eventually complicates adopting green cultures in actual applications. Since green supply chain management deals with multiple aspects, such as cost and carbon emission, the multiobjective optimization method is widely used to evaluate supply chain performance. This paper intensively reviews the state-of-the-art literature on applying multiobjective optimization techniques in green supply chain management. The study highlights aspects of green supply chain structures, model formulation techniques considering multiple objectives simultaneously, and solution methods for multiobjective optimization problems. Finally, a conclusion is drawn with the scope of the potential research opportunities for integrating economic and environmental considerations in sustainable supply chain management practice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article deals with the evaluation of agricultural production and the national economy's financial facilities development, with emphasis on its financial assurance key figures. The peculiarities of agricultural production financial facility development and the improvement of regional agricultural enterprises' financial assurance have been defined. The peculiarities of financial resource use in modern conditions have been analyzed. The control of the financial resources helped determine the forecast value of agricultural production financial facilities. The aim of the article is to define the factors of agricultural production financial facilities, which are taken as the basis of macroeconomic analysis, and explain the characteristics of the region's agricultural enterprise development in Ukraine’s agroclimatic zones. Agricultural production may have an efficient development due to the commensurability and equation of the real and potential volume of financial resources, which assure financial facilities and play an important role in the stability of agricultural activity. At the same time, the dynamism of the market environment almost always causes a change in agricultural production conditions. Distribution and redistribution of income and financial resources between agricultural market entities influences the volume of agricultural enterprises' financial resources and determines the conditions of their access to cheap financial loans. On the one hand, the vectorial retargeting of the financial system towards a favorable financial environment assurance contributes to the reasonableness of problem solving of agricultural production financial facilities in this manner.On the other hand, it is caused by the improvement of agricultural enterprises' business functions and financial components, which are adjusted to external environmental realities. Discharged funds from the state budget financial flow and the banking sector will allow for the formation of financial facilities and potential sources for the development of agricultural enterprises, subject to the improvement of the legal framework in the following direction and the state control scheme of agricultural production finance and credit assurance. The complexity of the category \"financial facilities\" shows that it should be reviewed as the ability to transform financial resources into the real factor of agricultural production development. Financial facilities can be used to estimate the rate of profitability in the critical range, save money, and possibly establish a degree of separation between the activity spheres of agricultural enterprises. Considering the importance of bank crediting and state financial support as factors in the development of regional financial facilities, it is reasonable to consider their overall influence on earning capacity, which corresponds to the critical level of agricultural production financial facilities. Commensurability: The establishment of all elements and components of financial facilities and the use of their possibilities will assure the equating of nationwide, sectoral, and private interests for economic development and the activation of long-term investment activity.</jats:p>"

The authors have attempted to establish a connection between CE, Ind 4.0 and SCM in context of tribal economy. In this paper a systematic literature review (SLR) of 47 research articles using the PRISMA protocol and VOSviewer Software has been done. The SLR is based on peer-reviewed articles which were extracted from the Web of Science Database between 2015 and 2022. The VOSviewer software helped the authors in identifying three key themes: (i) Integration/Interoperability between Ind 4.0, Circular Economy Model and Supply Chain Management to achieve Sustainability; (ii) Challenges &amp; Emerging Opportunities for Tribal economy and (iii) Relationship between Ind 4.0, Supply Chain Management &amp; Circular Economy. Furthermore, the paper proposes a conceptual framework in the form of ‘Barriers, Mitigation Strategies &amp; Opportunities’ associated with the integration of CE and Ind 4.0. This study would help in acknowledging the role of integrated systems (CE, Ind 4.0 and SCM) which may help in improving the current tribal working culture. </jats:p>",

Violations of the usual supply scheme in conditions of crises in the energy markets, international conflicts, etc., lead to the problem of simultaneous restructuring of the entire supply scheme. This requires changes in the directions and capacities of domestic production and imports. In this article, the above problem is solved by the economic and mathematical model of production type. The developed model includes subsystems of domestic production and import supply. The results of modeling economy supply with thermal coal for different values of demand are given. The model was used to determine the amounts of coal production for Ukraine with the structure of the coal industry of 2021 and under the condition of anthracite consumers’ transformation to the high volatile coal. Simulations have shown that eliminating the use of anthracite requires the modernization of existing coal mines. Under those conditions, the import of high volatile coal will amount to 3.751 million tons in 2030 and 11.8 million tons in 2035. The amounts of coking coal imports will be 5.46 million tons, 5.151 million tons, and 7.377 million tons in 2025, 2030, and 2035, respectively.</jats:p>"

Firstly, we set the dynamic E-CLSC game model including a manufacturer, an E-commerce platform (E-platform) and a recycler, where the manufacturer dominates the supply chain and both the E-platform and the recycler are followers. Secondly, we propose an E-CLSC information structure to depict four symmetry and asymmetry cases about the E-platform’s fairness concern and the manufacturer’s altruistic reciprocity, and the backward induction method is adopted to solve the equilibrium in each case. By comparative analysis, we propose a revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contract to optimize recycling decisions, coordinate the E-CLSC and Pareto-improve all parties’ profits. We show that whether information is symmetrical or not, only the wholesale price contract cannot coordinate the E-CLSC, whereas the revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contract can always achieve optimal recycling decisions, coordinate the supply chain and Pareto-improve all parties’ profits with a constant cost sharing ratio. In addition, the E-platform’s fairness concern can widen the range of the revenue sharing ratio and make it easier to coordinate the E-CLSC, but the manufacturer’s altruistic reciprocity may narrow the range of the revenue sharing ratio and make it harder to coordinate the E-CLSC.</jats:p>"

During efficiency assessment, the selection of the best, intermediate and least performing UWUs involves averaging scores of many efficiency assessment criteria analysed separately. This study expands a UWU efficiency assessment based on attaining service-level-benchmark and agreed target-level criteria using network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) for ratios. The assessment shows that the average of efficiencies of the two criteria identify a UWU with the best and worst performance in selected key indicators.</jats:p>",

C’est particulièrement vrai lorsqu’il s’agit de planifier le renouvellement des conduites grâce aux modèles de prédiction de leurs défaillances tels que ceux implémentés dans le logiciel Casses. Différents systèmes d’information (SI) performants existent pourtant pour stocker ces données chez les gestionnaires de réseaux. Néanmoins, peu de méthodologies ont été pensées pour intégrer des données historiques et non géolocalisées concernant les conduites et leurs défaillances dans ces SI. Dans ce travail, nous présentons un ensemble de méthodes automatisées (scripts en langage R) s’adressant à cette problématique et développées grâce aux données de la Société wallonne des eaux (SWDE) sur le secteur de Mons, dans l’optique d’alimenter le logiciel Casses. Ces algorithmes règlent essentiellement le problème de trouver la conduite du système d’information géographique défaillante, ne connaissant que l’immeuble le plus proche de cette dernière ou seulement la rue où s’est déroulée sa réparation. Pour cela, il a été nécessaire de définir rigoureusement la notion d’appartenance à une rue pour une conduite, ainsi que la manière de sélectionner le tronçon le plus vraisemblablement défaillant parmi les candidats compatibles avec la localisation renseignée, voire avec les caractéristiques connues de la réparation (diamètre, matériau). Ces méthodes, dont les limites sont également discutées, pourraient être utiles pour d’autres gestionnaires de réseaux d’eau potable qui disposent de données historiques encore non exploitées pour la construction des stratégies de GPI ou qui souhaitent faire évoluer leur SI. Enfin, les masses de données pouvant être rendues opérationnelles pour les modèles de défaillance de façon automatique représentent un gain important dans l’optique d’amélioration de la connaissance des processus de fuite et de casse des canalisations.</jats:p>",

Quality of food supplies is a global issue that this study wishes to respond to in Kenyan Secondary schools of Nairobi County. The research was guided by the following objectives: first, to investigate the relationship between e-Procurement and quality of food supplies in secondary schools in Nairobi County. Secondly, to assess the influence of supplier relationship management between suppliers and schools on quality of food supplies. Thirdly, to establish how procurement planning affect quality of food supplies and finally, to evaluate how risk management practices influence quality of food supplies in secondary schools, Nairobi County. The research used mixed method convergent parallel design. This study used total quality management theory and agency theory. The research used mixed method convergent parallel design. The researcher preferred this design since it was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data, and it provided a better understanding of the research problem as well as build on the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative data. The study adopted a census technique since the population was small. The target population was 32 secondary schools. The study sample was 96 respondents including 32 principals, 32 procurement officers and 32 storekeepers sampled from 32 secondary schools Nairobi County. Data collection was done through interview schedules and questionnaires. Quantitative data was analyzed descriptively through the distribution of frequencies, which have been expressed in means and percentages. The results were achieved using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) program and presented in tables and graphs, while qualitative data was transcribed and translated into themes that support the quantitative findings through a content analysis approach. In its findings, the study revealed that e-Procurement, supplier relationship management, procurement planning, and risk management practices significantly influence quality of food supplies. The study has therefore recommended that in order to enhance quality of food supplies, schools should fully make use of e-procurement, which include e-sourcing, e-tendering and e-advertisement. In addition, there should be proper management of suppliers to ensure that they supply on time and provide quality food supplies. The procurement planning processes should be adhered to in order to ensure that no part of the process is skipped. The risks faced on procurement should be documented and minimized of eliminated. All these will ensure an efficient procurement process. Keywords: E-Procurement, Inspection, Procurement Practices, Quality, Supplier relationship</jats:p>"

The prospect of an equally rapid economic recovery in the automotive industry is still threatened by supply bottlenecks for raw materials and key components, foremost for semiconductors. The so-called ‘semiconductor crises’ show exemplarily the overlapping of short-term supply chain disruptions with long-term structural features of the semiconductor industry. The combination of both is preventing that the supply situation in the automotive industry will improve quickly. First in this paper, the reasons for and respective effects of the crisis on the automotive industry are investigated by a quantitative market analysis. Second, specific strategic measures and options of automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and suppliers in Germany to cope with the situation and increase resilience in future supply chains are described by the means of qualitative expert interviews. By that, the paper helps in understanding the actual situation in the automotive industry, on the one hand, and contributes to the field of strategic supply chain and risk management with a focus on practical implications on the other hand. The results aim to support political stakeholders as well as small and medium sized enterprises to prepare themselves for future developments in the automotive market and changes in manufacturer–supplier relationships due to the transformation to new powertrain technologies and digitization.</jats:p>"

To mitigate haze from the source, it is essential to achieve co-control of three important haze precursors: volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxide (NOx). In this study, we used the environmentally extended input–output model, structural path analysis, and structural path decomposition method to investigate changes in consumption-based emissions of three major haze precursors (i.e., NOx, SO2, and VOCs) in China during 2007–2017. First, the results revealed that fixed capital formation was the most critical final demand to co-control the three precursors. Investment in construction was the most important behavior for co-control. Second, the most crucial common path driving the changes in emissions of the three precursors was “transportation and warehousing→household consumption” during 2007–2012, and “electricity, gas, and water supply→household consumption” during 2012–2017. Finally, direct emission intensity of transportation and warehousing, and electricity, gas, and water supplies were critical to co-control precursors. The results of this study provided a comprehensive understanding of changes in haze precursor emissions driven by demand. Therefore, China must strengthen the co-control of multiple pollutant emissions on both the production and consumption sides by adjusting supply chains.

A literature survey comprising an analytical review of blockchain technology with the Internet of things (IoT) for food supply chain management (FSCM) is presented to better understand the associated research benefits, issues, and challenges. At present, with the concept of farm-to-fork gaining increasing popularity, food safety and quality certification are of critical concern. Blockchain technology provides the traceability of food supply from the source, i.e., the seeding factories, to the customer’s table. The main idea of this paper is to identify blockchain technology with the Internet of things (IoT) devices to investigate the food conditions and various issues faced by transporters while supplying fresh food. Blockchain provides applications such as smart contracts to monitor, observe, and manage all transactions and communications among stakeholders. IoT technology provides approaches for verifying all transactions; these transactions are recorded and then stored in a centralized database system. Thus, IoT enables a safe and cost-effective FSCM system for stakeholders. In this paper, we contribute to the awareness of blockchain applications that are relevant to the food supply chain (FSC), and we present an analysis of the literature on relevant blockchain applications which has been conducted concerning various parameters. The observations in the present survey are also relevant to the application of blockchain technology with IoT in other areas.</jats:p>"

The Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software package was used to evaluate the viability of solar, hydro and wind hybrid power generation for a remote community in Ethiopia's Geba catchment. The hydrologic, climatic and demographic data were used to analyze the community's electrical supply and demand. Using survey data from chosen residences, the community's hourly and daily electricity demands were calculated. Two or more schemes were investigated besides the standalone scheme to assess the hybrid system's capacity. Wind, micro‐hydro and solar can generate an average annual power of 96.8, 272.4 and 161.8 kW, respectively. A mix of energy sources can meet the community's electricity demand. During peak demand periods, however, the hybrid system's mean hourly variability in power production showed inadequacy, which could be remedied by power stored in the battery and generator output. The economic analysis showed that the hybrid system proposed here is less expensive, indicating that hybrid energy generation might be employed to electrify Ethiopia's remote settlements. We advise decision‐makers and power authorities to use hybrid systems for rural electrification.</jats:p>",

In the present study, three levels of restoration for the Hawr-Al-Azim wetland (35, 50, and 100%) and two agricultural-related scenarios, maintaining the current cultivation area and decreasing the area under cultivation, were considered and assessed using classical bankruptcy methods. The results showed that, because of climatic conditions and agricultural demands, full wetland restoration was out of reach and led to minimum satisfaction levels for agricultural beneficiaries. The results also showed that the modified bankruptcy method led to the highest satisfaction levels for beneficiaries in the scenario of maintaining the current cultivation area. In addition, the percentage of the water supply was increased by applying the scenario of crop restriction in the conditions of the full restoration of the wetland; for example, in the Abbas Plain region, this increase was achieved by almost 10–15% in all methods. On the other hand, decreasing the area under cultivation shifted the allocation problem in the basin to a non-bankruptcy one.</jats:p>",

However, the rainbow trout industry is divided on whether to allocate or abolish imported trout subsidies. The elimination of such support would lead to a three‐fold rise in the price of imported trout eggs (which are already more expensive than domestic trout eggs). Furthermore, the economic performance of the domestic trout supply chain over the imported trout supply chain remains yet to be clarified. The present study seeks to evaluate whether imported trout egg subsidies should be continued. Economic efficiency and network data envelopment analysis are used to evaluate the performance and role of subsidies in trout supply chains in Mazandaran, one of the largest trout farming provinces as a new case study in the aquaculture sector, in 2018. Farms that used imported trout eggs were found to have lower economic efficiency and higher dependence on import subsidies. Feed costs were identified to be the most important explanation for poor economic efficiency of trout production. Finally, the results reveal that the development of domestic trout propagation supply chains with integrated forward vertical structures could improve efficiency in the system. The re‐distribution of imported trout egg subsidies to fund feed cost reduction technologies could provide effective solutions to enhance economic efficiency, production sustainability and food security.</jats:p>",

We must know if skeletonization of the network graph and different hydraulic timesteps have an influence on simulation results. This study strives to prove that this decision can lead to unforeseen problems during the calibration process, thus making it impossible to achieve the required calibration precision. In order to prove this, two different model variants were created with different levels of graph detail, and simulation data results were used to determine which model variant is best suited to achieve the highest fidelity simulation results. Following this, the chosen model was run with different hydraulic timestep settings, which made it possible to showcase the large influence this setting has on achieved results.</jats:p>"

This article proposes novel spherical fuzzy aggregation operators (AOs) based on Aczel–Alsina (AA) operations, which offer a lot of advantages when tackling real-world situations. We begin by introducing some new SFS operations, such as the Aczel–Alsina product, the Aczel–Alsina sum, the Aczel–Alsina exponent, and the Aczel–Alsina scalar multiplication. We developed many AOs namely, the “spherical fuzzy Aczel–Alsina weighted averaging (SFAAWA) operator,” “spherical fuzzy Aczel–Alsina ordered weighted averaging (SFAAOWA) operator,” “spherical fuzzy Aczel–Alsina hybrid averaging (SFAAHA) operator,” “spherical fuzzy Aczel–Alsina weighted geometric (SFAAWG) operator,” “spherical fuzzy Aczel–Alsina ordered weighted geometric (SFAAOWG) operator,” and “spherical fuzzy Aczel–Alsina hybrid geometric (SFAAHG) operator.” Different attributes of these operators have been defined. The idempotency, boundary, monotonicity, and commutativity of suggested averaging and geometric operators are demonstrated. Then, based on these operators, we propose a novel approach for tackling the “multi-criteria decision-making” (MCDM) problems. We use a agriculture land selection scenario to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach. The outcome confirms the new technique’s applicability and viability. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and a comparison analysis between the existing approaches and the recommended technique have been provided.</jats:p>",

More soil water was depleted from the deep soil layer (80–100 cm depth) than that in the shallow layer (20–60 cm depth). The average contribution rates of soil water content at sowing to grain yield under DS were 23–25%.

Our results show that the ESSI decreased from 2000 to 2010, but remained almost unchanged from 2010 to 2020. The low ESSI values were mainly distributed over the North China Plain, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Sichuan Basin. The HMDI increased from 2000 to 2020, but the rate of increase has slowed since 2010. The high HMDI values were mainly distributed over the east coast of China, Inner Mongolia, and part of Xinjiang province. From 2000 to 2020, the cities with spatial mismatches of the ESSI and HMDI showed a significant increase and spatial agglomeration. The sustainability of most regions showed a decreasing trend, and the higher the value of the supply-demand balance index, the faster the speed of decrease. Overall, there were more regions in a state of conflict between the natural ecosystem and humans than in a synergistic state, although this number has decreased since 2010. Urban agglomerations and western regions should receive more attention for their ecological health. This study provides a new methodology to assess the sustainability of CHANS that could be applied to other locations. Our findings could support the Chinese government in regional ecosystem governance and territorial space planning.</jats:p>"

For most species considered to be ready for commercialization, there are few or no farms from which to evaluate the size of the market or to estimate revenues and costs necessary to assess economic feasibility. This present study takes a first step to fill this gap with an analysis of the existing supply of 20 marine finfish species identified as candidates for commercialization in the United States, as a proxy for effective demand (the volume of a product sold at the market equilibrium price). Secondary data from 1950 (where available) through 2019 were compiled on each species, including (1) global aquaculture production, (2) US aquaculture production, (3) US commercial landings, (4) US recreational landings, and (5) imports. Current effective market demand (measured as the sum of commercial landings, farmed production, and imports) was low, totaling 36.6 million kg across the 20 species, which is equivalent to less than 23% of the annual volume sold of US farmed catfish. Commercial landings for 17 of the 20 species exhibited declines, potentially offering opportunities for farmed product to capture market share by filling the increasing gaps in supply. The variability in commercial landings provides opportunities for farms to capitalize on their advantage in supplying product with a high degree of consistency of volume, size, delivery frequency, and quality. Several unknown factors suggest the need for follow‐up studies on consumer preferences, degree of substitutability among finfish species, and effects of recreational landings on demand. An important limitation to prospective producers is the lack of species‐specific import data for the generic categories of “flounder,” “bass,” and “snapper.” This supply analysis provides a foundational analysis for prospective producers, investors, and researchers interested in commercialization of these marine species.</jats:p>",

The objectives of the optimization model included electricity charges for a pumping station operation and the start-stop loss of a pumping station. The blade angle and start-stop scheme were taken into account as the double-decision variables, while the target water extraction (equality constraint), start-stop scheme, and power were the constraint conditions. A combination of an orthogonal experiment and a 0-1 integer programming algorithm was proposed to explore the optimal solution of the model. A real case of a single-unit pump station in China was applied to prove the effectiveness of the algorithm. The results showed that the optimization efficiency of the proposed algorithm was 4%–10% higher than that of the genetic algorithm. Additionally, the maximum optimization benefit was obtained when there were fewer than three start-stops during the operation process. The proposed algorithm provided a reference for similar complex nonlinear models.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, integrating sustainability performance measurement in the supply chain risk management would offer interesting avenues for managing risks in BoP supply chain. Therefore, the paper conceptualizes an intersection between supply chain risk/uncertainty management and sustainable performance measurement. This intersection is then tested by a literature review of 164 BoP SC articles between the years 2000 and 2022. Descriptive, frequency, and correlation analysis identify various risks factors studied in the BoP literature so far, their management strategies and respective performance measures. The findings show a broad strategical aspect of managing SC risks and proffered the tactical or operational level performance measures which along with these practices can manage the related risks. Therefore, their incorporation into the risk management process should be considered. The correlation findings highlight the important role of performance process measures and the impact of these along with the management practices on firm's performance outcomes. The study contributes to supply chain risk and performance management literature by capturing the nexus between BoP and supply chain management.</jats:p>",

It was found that compared to animals fed according to phosphorus requirement the deficiency and excess of dietary phosphorus did not influenced o total feed intake (mean 120.6 kg) and feed conversion (mean 1.9 kg/kg gain). However phosphorus deficiency lowered total gain of the body mass (P=0.0072), diminished weight of the inedible part of the carcass (P=0.0229), decreased the content of body protein (P=0.0171), ash (P=0.0001), and phosphorus (P=0.0001). Whereas, over-supply of dietary phosphorus did not cause any change of these component. Utilisation of the total phosphorus was diminished (P=0.0001) in pigs fed diet with both excess (by 16.26%) and deficiency (by 12.28%) of the phosphorus, but excess had much lower negative impact than its’ deficiency. When available form of this element was considered over-supply still reduced (P=0.0001) its utilisation the most (by 26.58%) but deficiency made utilisation the best (7.77%). Both dietary deficiency and over-supply of the phosphorus diminished (P=0.0001) femur mass (by 25 and 11 g, respectively). Thus negative impact of phosphorus deficiency was much stronger. Moreover, phosphorus deficiency diminished (P=0.0015) bone length (by 0.5 cm), however, excess did not change this feature. Response of animals to a decrease bone mass and length due disturbances in phosphorus supply (both deficiency and excess) was the increase the vertical external diameter of the femur shaft.</jats:p>",

Still, there is little data on factors regulating the maintenance of luteal function during early pregnancy in gilts. Previous studies emphasize the role of hypoxia and HIF-1 in the regulation of steroidogenic and angiogenic genes expression and progesterone production by ovarian cells. Using the corpus luteum of cyclic and early pregnant gilts we analyzed: (1) the in vitro effects of reduced oxygen tension on progesterone production and mRNA expression of HIF1A and luteal function regulators, STAR and VEGFA; (2) the ex vivo profiles of mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1α, STAR, VEGFA and transcription factors-cJUN and CREB, regulating STAR expression, in the corpus luteum of cyclic and pregnant gilts. The synthesis of progesterone was gradually inhibited in cyclic or pregnant gilt luteal tissue (on day 13 of cycle or pregnancy) incubated in a decreasing concentration−20%, 10%, and 3% of oxygen (O2). Luteal tissues of pregnant gilts produced trace amounts of progesterone in 10% O2, which was similar to cyclic gilts in 3% O2. HIF1A expression increased after 24 h of incubation in tissues of cyclic gilts in 3% vs. 20% O2 (p &lt; 0.01), whereas levels of STAR and VEGFA increased significantly in cyclic and pregnant gilt tissues incubated in 10% and 3% vs. 20% O2. The ex vivo mRNA expression of HIF1A and VEGFA was elevated (p &lt; 0.001) on day 14 vs. day 12 of pregnancy. The protein expression of HIF-1 and VEGFA increased (p &lt; 0.001), whereas the level of STAR (mRNA and protein) and progesterone dropped (p &lt; 0.001) on day 14 of the estrous cycle vs. a parallel day of pregnancy and/or day 12 of the estrous cycle. The content of phosphorylated cJUN and CREB was elevated (p &lt; 0.01) in the luteal tissue on day 12 or 14 of pregnancy vs. parallel days of the estrous cycle. These increases of phosphorylated cJUN and CREB may be involved in STAR expression in the luteal tissue during early pregnancy in gilts.</jats:p>"

The value of biochars should be evaluated as a part of the pyrolysis system that coproduces biochars and biofuels. Biochars can improve agricultural productivity and soil functioning and contribute to climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration. Furthermore, it can provide extra benefit by contributing to fire prevention. The cost of biochar system depends on the costs of feedstock acquisition, transportation, and processing. Biochar is most likely to be adopted in locations with marginal land and high‐value crop, and near low‐cost feedstock sources. The adoption of biochar can be enhanced by compensation for carbon sequestration, further investment in research, and learning of producers to enhance efficiency of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

In order to solve the problem of coordination and cooperation between e-commerce platforms and manufacturers, and to further develop the C2B model of high-grade e-commerce, this paper studies the coordination of supply chain interests by establishing a differential game model considering product grade factors. By comparing the equilibrium solutions of differential games under different decision-making situations, a cooperative coordination mechanism is proposed. Next, the equilibrium solution is further analyzed by means of numerical simulation. Finally, the influence of several important parameters on the equilibrium solution is discussed through sensitivity analysis. It is found that (1) the supply chain parties have optimal quality behavior in the centralized decision-making situation, and the overall benefit is the greatest. (2) Compared with the Nash non-cooperative game, the optimal quality behavior of the dominant party remains unchanged, and the optimal quality behavior of the following party is enhanced after both parties move from the Stackelberg master-slave game, and the optimal profits of both parties, as well as the overall increase. (3) The cooperative coordination model can coordinate the quality behavior of both sides of the supply chain when the benefit distribution coefficient is within a specific range.</jats:p>"

The qualitative method with a descriptive approach is the method used in writing this article with the results showing that the criteria that have the highest rating weights are the level of service criteria with 47%, the location criteria with 26%, the responsiveness criteria with 19% and the price criteria with 8%. After considering these four criteria, the sequence of vendors with the highest priority value is Vendor E with a total priority value of 0,59. Meanwhile, Vendor D and Vendor F occupy the second and third positions with a total priority score of 0,57 and 0,54.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the article is to develop a mathematical model of the heat balance and conduct a theoretical study of one-story rural houses based on the use of solar energy in a non-stationary mode. To achieve this goal, an experimental one-story solar house with autonomous heat supply was built. The heat supply of the experimental solar house mainly uses solar energy, and when the heat supply load exceeds this load, the traditional boiler device is used. The power supply of the experimental solar house is provided by a solar panel (photovoltaic converter). A heat balance scheme for a solar house with autonomous heat supply and an electrothermal scheme of a physical model are proposed. Based on the proposed schemes, a mathematical model of heat balance and a calculation algorithm based on the heat balance equation of the dynamic state of the heat supply system of a one-story experimental solar house in a non-stationary mode have been developed. On the basis of mathematical modeling, the influence of the heat capacity of the wall structure on the temperature regime of the building was studied. On the basis of the MATLAB-Simulink program, the main temperature characteristics were built, on which the change in the temperature of the internal air of the building was analyzed depending on the ambient temperature. On the basis of the program, a modular scheme of the dynamic model was built. Based on the modular scheme, the results of the experiment on changing the air inside the solar house and the outdoor temperature are presented in the form of a graph. The mathematical model of the thermal balance of the building in dynamic mode and the obtained calculation results are recommended for use in the development of energy-efficient solar houses.</jats:p>"

Despite the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, literature still lacks the application of state‐of‐the‐art methods to optimize the performance of supply chain ordering management problems. Thus, this paper proposes a relatively new Deep Reinforcement Learning‐based Ordering Mechanism (DRLOM) for multi‐echelon linear supply chain systems. Initially, the supply chain ordering management problem is formulated as an agent‐based reinforcement learning model and, afterwards, solved using a recently developed policy‐based algorithm called proximal policy optimization. The proposed approach (DRLOM) aids the assumed supply chain echelons, such as the Retailer, the Wholesaler, the Distributor and the Factory, to learn the optimal/near‐optimal dynamic strategies for inventory ordering systems. The experimental results also validate that the proposed approach efficiently minimizes the system‐wide total accumulated inventory costs under different problem instances than other ordering heuristics and evolutionary computation methods. Throughout this paper, benchmark findings from the literature are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Furthermore, limitations of the earlier works are addressed through this paper and contribute to the supply chain ordering management literature.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim: to conduct an analysis of the state of functioning of pharmaceutical supply systems for the population in European countries and Ukraine based on a set of socio-economic indicators.\r\nMaterials and methods. General theoretical (historical, formal, graphic, hypothetical-deductive) and applied (organizational-economic, mathematical-statistical) research methods were used. The object of research was data that was freely available.\r\nResults. It was established that the highest volume of the pharmaceutical market volume per inhabitant is typical for Italy (410.18 euros) and the lowest for Ukraine (53.58 euros). It has been proven that with an increase in GDP indicators, which are calculated based on purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita, the range of variation of this indicator by groups decreases, and the number of countries with a negative value of the foreign trade balance also decreases. Within groups of countries, there is a different level of dependence on the import of pharmaceutical products. In Ukraine (the first group), imports exceeded the export data of pharmaceutical products by 8.6 times. For other countries in this group (Latvia, Bulgaria, and Slovakia), imports exceeded exports by 1.3, 1.4, and 4.0 times, respectively. The highest values of the volume of foreign trade in pharmaceutical products were characteristic of the countries of the third and second groups. The undisputed leader is Germany (134,541.0 million euros), in second place is Italy (59,533.0 million euros), and in third place is France (58,568.0 million euros).\r\nThe highest values of health care costs as a percentage of GDP (%) are typical for the countries of the third group and the lowest for the countries of the first group. For all countries, this indicator had a characteristic tendency to increase over time. Growth rates varied both across groups and within groups across countries. According to the indicator of the amount of reimbursement of the cost of drug consumption per person, there was a significant fluctuation of the data by country within the groups. The most extensive range of fluctuations was observed in the third group (284.83 euros). The highest reimbursement amounts are typical for Germany (483.53 euros) and the lowest for Bulgaria (54.25 euros). In most countries, there is a high level (50.0 % and higher) of state participation in the payment of medicine, except for Poland (36.0 %), Lithuania (34.0 %) and Latvia (37.0 %). The lowest values of money consumers spend to pay for medicines (from 13.0 % to 44.0 %) are characteristic of the countries of the third group.\r\nConclusions. The established peculiarities of the functioning of the pharmaceutical supply systems of European countries should not diminish the value of the state's aspirations to harmonize the processes that take place to promote medicinal products to consumers</jats:p>"

The target ship was a 14,000 TEU large container ship traveling from Asia to Europe. The NH3 fuel supply system was developed to feed the liquid fuel at 40 °C and 80 bar and cope with the re-circulated fuel with the sealing oil. Its power consumptions and SECs ranged from 56.4 to 157.5 kW and from 0.0063 to 0.009 kWh/kg, respectively. An onboard re-liquefaction system with a vapor compression refrigeration cycle was also designed to liquefy the BOG from the fuel tank. The re-liquefaction system’s exergy efficiency and SEC were 34.71% and 0.224 kWh/kg, respectively. The equipment with the most exergy destruction was the heat exchangers, accounting for 60% of the total exergy destruction. NPV analysis found that it is recommended to introduce the re-liquefaction system to the target ship. At the NH3 price of USD 250/ton, the reasonable cost of the re-liquefaction system is less than USD 1 million. According to LCC, NH3 fuel is economically feasible if the carbon tax is more than USD 80/ton and the NH3 price is around USD 250/ton.</jats:p>"

In this paper, deep learning techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) were adopted and applied to classify supply chain pricing datasets of health medications. Then, Bayesian optimization using the tree parzen estimator and All K Nearest Neighbor (AllkNN) was used to establish the suitable model hyper-parameters of both LSTM and 1D-CNN to enhance the classification model. Repeated five-fold cross-validation is applied to the developed models to predict the accuracy of the models. The study showed that the combination of 1D-CNN, AllkNN, and Bayesian optimization (1D-CNN+AllKNN+BO) outperforms other approaches employed in this study. The accuracy of the combination of 1D-CNN, AllkNN, and Bayesian optimization (1D-CNN+AllKNN+BO) from one-fold to 10-fold, produced the highest range between 61.2836% and 63.3267%, among other models.</jats:p>"

These magnetofossils were produced by magnetotactic bacteria and unidentified, iron‐biomineralizing organisms. Previous work shows three distinct magnetofossil endmembers identified from principal component analysis of first‐order reversal curves (FORC‐PCA). The relative proportions of these magnetofossil endmembers varied over time during the PETM. Benthic foraminiferal species associations from the same sediments also vary during the PETM. Here, we compare the variability in magnetofossils and benthic foraminifera and statistically test, for the first time, whether they are significantly correlated. We find that changes in the type of magnetofossils present within the sediment correspond to changes in benthic foraminiferal assemblages, thus reflecting syndepositional conditions such as changes in oxygen, nutrients, and organic carbon concentrations, rather than diagenetic processes. We also find that magnetofossil‐producing organisms may respond to specific environmental pressures differently than benthic foraminifera, and in some cases, may better record these environmental signals. Therefore, FORC‐PCA on magnetofossil‐rich sediments can be used to understand discrete changes in ocean and/or early sediment chemistry over episodes of climate change. These environmental responses are inferred from non‐destructive, reproducible magnetic measurements, adding an independent environmental proxy to more commonly studied microfossil and geochemical proxies. Notably, these measurements only require small bulk sediment samples and do not need to contain calcium carbonate, making this approach ideal where sample material is limited and the record is affected by ocean acidification.</jats:p>",

This study employs a qualitative approach in conjunction with a literature review method. Process, packaging, warehousing, transportation, fundamentals, policy, and technology are all barriers to Halal Supply Chain Management in the Halal Cosmetics sector.

This study focuses on the evaluation of organics reduction performance of the GAC filtration with regenerated carbons using long-term operational data. Three drinking water treatment facilities at Busan were selected for this purpose. It was found in this study that GAC filtration and ozonation helped these facilities to reduce the treated levels of DOC (dissolve organic carbon) as well as of 1,4-dioxane. Regeneration affected organics reduction performance of GAC filtration. The GAC filtration with regenerated carbons was found more effective for DOC reduction, while the filtration with virgin carbons was more effective for THM (trihalomethane) reduction. These results were related to the pore size change that occurred after the regeneration. The regeneration increased the meso pore volume but decreased the micro pore volume. The regeneration cycle was important for the decrease in the micro pore volume. The micro pore volume remained relatively unchanged after the first regeneration but was substantially decreased after the regeneration was repeated by more than second time.</jats:p>",

Considering the very high solar radiation potential in Iran, this study used roof solar collectors to partially supply the heat required for domestic hot water (DHW) and heat the indoor space and a swimming pool in a 48-unit building in a cold climate (Shahrekord, Iran). Climatic data were extracted from Meteonorm 7.3, and technical, energy, environmental, and economic analyses were performed with the help of TSOL 2018 R(1). The one-year dynamic analysis was performed, considering all possible losses, and an auxiliary gas boiler (AGB) was also used. According to the results, considering the available roof area, 8.7% of the total required heat equivalent to 82814 kWh is supplied by SWHs with a unit cost of $0.022/kWh. The AGB supplied 867259 kWh/year, preventing CO2 emissions by 25.5 tons. This is the first study in this regard in Iran, and the authors hope that the results can be employed as a guideline for decision makers to extend the use of SWHs in Iran.</jats:p>",

An interplay of tectonism and magmatism is thought to control melt ascent, but the detailed process of melt extraction is not yet understood. We present a detailed image of the seismic velocity structure of the Logachev volcanic center and adjacent region along the Knipovich Ridge. With travel times of P‐ and S‐waves of 3,959 earthquakes we performed a local earthquake tomography. We simultaneously inverted for source locations, velocity structure and the Vp/Vs‐ratio. An extensive low velocity anomaly coincident with high Vp/Vs‐ratios &gt;1.9 lies underneath the volcanic center at depths of 10 km below sea level in an aseismic area. More shallow, tightly clustered earthquake swarms connect the anomaly to a shallow anomaly with high Vp/Vs‐ratio beneath the basaltic seafloor. We consider the deep low‐velocity anomaly to represent an area of partial melt from which melts ascent vertically to the surface and northwards into the adjacent segment. By comparing tomographic studies of the Logachev and Southwest Indian Ridge Segment‐8 volcano we conclude that volcanic centers of ultraslow spreading ridges host spatially confined, circular partial melt areas below 10 km depth, in contrast to the shallow extended melt lenses along fast spreading ridges. Lateral feeding over distances of 35 km is possible at orthogonal spreading segments, but limited at the obliquely spreading Knipovich Ridge.</jats:p>",

However, only a few studies focus on green supply chain management (GSCM) practices in Vietnam. Hence, this work is the first study modeling the challenges in implementing green initiatives in the Vietnamese manufacturing supply chain. The authors aim to identify the fundamental challenges and evaluate the cross-interactions among them. The Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) method has been employed, based on experts’ perspectives, to clarify which factor is the most potent challenge. Consequently, seven major challenge clusters have been identified, and they were divided into nineteen sub-challenges. Meanwhile, the authors evaluated their interrelationships based on the hierarchical structure diagram and the Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement (MICMAC) analysis. It is observed that the “Financial Costs” elements group is the most difficult, followed by the lack of the Vietnamese government’s green regulation and the lack of senior managers’ support. The “Information” challenges cluster is considered as the middle bridge between the strong and weak elements. At the end of the diagram, two challenges are a lack of training courses about implementing GSCM and a lack of customer awareness and pressure about GSCM. Hence, these findings will become valuable suggestions for the top managers of Vietnamese manufacturers to make blueprint decisions.</jats:p>"

The proposed RA_IWS_Canal model is developed by coupling uncertainty and risk analysis with a logistic regression equation. The Zhudong irrigation zone, located within the Touqian River watershed in northern Taiwan, was selected as the study area, with the inflow from Shanping Weir, water supplies at 15 irrigation canals, and water intakes of two reservoirs (Baoshan and Baoshan II) and a water treatment plant (Yuandon); 1000 simulations of 10-day irrigation water allocations and resulting exceedance probabilities of the water supplies at the 15 canals were achieved using the multivariate Monte Carlo simulation and the uncertainty with the water allocation model (RIBASIM), and employed in the development of the proposed RA_IWS_Canal model. The model development and application results indicate that the uncertainty factors and the inflow from Shanping Weir markedly and positively influence the exceedance probability of the canal-based irrigation water supply to boost the corresponding reliability (about 0.8). The water intake of the Baoshan Reservoir has a lower relationship (by 0.19) than the Yuandon water treatment plant with the reliabilities of the irrigation water supplies at its downstream canals. As a result, the proposed RA_IWS_Canal model can evaluate the effect of not only the canal-based uncertainty factors, but also the regional features on the irrigation water supply reliability. In addition, using the proposed RA_IWS_Canal model, the planned irrigation water demands at various canals within a multi-canal irrigation zone could be accordingly formulated based on acceptable reliability.</jats:p>"

The world population is likely to consume 178 million tons of food fish/aquatic animals by 2028, whereby 58% of fish will likely be from aquaculture. Growth of food fish production is expected to increase overall production of aquafeeds to over 87 million tons by 2025. Aquafeed production relies largely on fishmeal which is getting expensive due to its multiple use and scarcity. A remedy to this situation is the use of non-conventional protein sources, which may be of plant (leaves, cereals, pulses etc.) or animal (insects, worms, etc.) origin. This paper demonstrates the potential of non-conventional ingredients for aquaculture. It was found that crude protein levels of selected non-conventional plant ingredients ranged from 25-71% while those of animal origin were from 66-72%. Inclusion levels of 5-40% and 25-66% were recommended in aquafeeds, respectively, from ingredients of plant and animal origin. Performances of fish fed aquafeeds containing selected non-conventional ingredients have been reviewed. Presence of anti-nutrients, chitin and high lipid in feed ingredients, and shortcomings in processing and mass production technologies, have been identified as the main challenges limiting the commercialization of the selected feed ingredients. To remove the unwanted factors and to enhance inclusion of non-conventional ingredients in aquafeeds, authors suggested varied strategies. The strategies such as defatting, heat treatment, extrusion cooking, solvent extraction, dehulling, fermentation, ensiling, genetic modification and inclusion of enzyme are identified as some of the most efficient methods. Effective and affordable technologies to improve nutritional value should be validated through research for adequate and consistent supply of aquafeed in Sub-Saharan Africa. Consequently, provision of sufficient, quality and affordable aquafeeds will promote sustainable aquaculture production and reduce fishing pressure and pollution in natural aquatic ecosystems.</jats:p>",

It is unfortunate that from the amount of potential owned by this industry, it does not have a factory layout according to The Indonesian Food and Drug Authority (BPOM) standards, thus hampering the production process. The method used in this research is a qualitative method with data collection techniques in the form of interviews, documentation, and observation. After obtaining the method to be used, then the layout is made with the selected method, namely the Activity Relationship Chart (ARC) and Activity Relationship Diagram (ARD) methods. Based on the results of the analysis and evaluation of the activity relationship of each department needed, it shows that the layout made can help streamline production and logistics activities because it has a flow of activities that have been adjusted to the degree of relationship as a basis for consideration and has been adjusted to the actual size needed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The reasonable distribution of urban green space (UGS) is a topic that urban researchers have been exploring for a long time. Solving the imbalance between the supply and demand of UGS plays an important role in improving the health level of a city. This study examines the central urban area of Hefei as an example. We developed a modified Gaussian two-step floating catchment area method and used the path planning model of Gaode Map to evaluate the accessibility of UGS under different transportation modes and different time thresholds while integrating mobile phone signaling data. Additionally, a fine-scale analysis of the actual supply and demand relationship of UGS was conducted by integrating the accessibility evaluation results with the recreational situation of UGS to analyze the deviation of supply and demand to further discuss the spatial distribution equilibrium of UGS. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) The spatial distribution of UGSs in the central urban area of Hefei is uneven. Different time thresholds and different transportation modes have a significant impact on the UGS accessibility evaluation results. (2) With the increase in the time threshold or travel distance, the number of grids above the moderate accessibility level generally increases. The spatial distribution of the grids with moderate, high and highest accessibility level present different patterns of contiguous, clusters, and spots distribution. (3) After combining these results with the actual recreational situation of UGS, we found that the overall demand in the central urban area exceeds the supply at the 15-min threshold, while the overall supply exceeds the demand at the 30-min threshold. The grids with balanced supply and demand or more supply than demand have comprehensive parks with a moderate population density and strong road connectivity in the neighborhood. This study strengthens the data granularity and improves the accuracy of accessibility evaluation by integrating mobile phone signaling data with the path planning model of Gaode Map. Also, we evaluate the accessibility with multi-transport modes and different time thresholds, which can bring more practical guidance for optimizing the distribution of UGS.</jats:p>"

To improve water-saving potential, the inter-annual variation of IWEUC from 2014 to 2021 in Jiangsu Province was analyzed. Taking consideration of natural factors, planting structure, management levels, and water-saving engineering, the primary influencing factors of IWEUC were investigated through principal component analysis. The results revealed that IWEUC in Jiangsu Province was higher than the annual national level and showed an insignificant increasing trend. IWEUC and its trend were negatively correlated with irrigation district size. Water-saving irrigation areas had an extremely significant impact on IWEUC (P &amp;lt; 0.01). The positive load of water-saving engineering investment was rated first. Furthermore, economic and water-saving benefits for different irrigation district scales based on the TOPSIS model were evaluated. Despite restricted government support, the economic gains for large irrigation districts were superior to those for small irrigation districts. In the past decade, agricultural water declined while agricultural water conservation rose. The completion of integrated agricultural water pricing reform, as well as the improvement of water-saving engineering and optimization of management level, had a significant beneficial influence on IWEUC. Jiangsu's IWEUC has been efficiently implemented, and provides guidelines in other regions.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this work is to explore and further compare the optimal outcomes in a green dual-channel supply chain in three scenarios, which are the fairness-neutrality scenario (Model N), the manufacturer is concerned with fairness scenario (Model F), and the manufacturer has altruistic preference (Model A), respectively. The game-theoretical models with different fairness preferences, comparative, and numerical analyses are used to put forward the impacts of consumers’ channel preference and CEA on pricing, profits, and utilities, and to identify the differences in decisional outcomes between the three models. The results indicate that CEA always contributes to developing the green market while adversely affecting common products. Moreover, consumers’ channel preferences might enable the manufacturer and retailer to enhance profitability under certain conditions. The findings also reveal that manufacturer’s fairness concerns can possibly increase the demand for green products but impair the overall performance of the supply chain in general. Moreover, while the manufacturer’s altruistic preference benefits the retailer’s profits, it has a detrimental effect on the performance of the green supply chain. The practical implications of this research come to promote green consumption and increasing consumer awareness of environmental protection are effective ways to develop a green supply chain. It is also important to note that in order to maintain the durability and stability of the sup-ply chain, the manufacturer must maintain a moderate level of fairness preference behaviors so that downstream retailers will remain enthusiastic about establishing long-term relationships.</jats:p>"

Researchers and policy‐makers are interested in identifying means to reduce the disruptive effects caused by the pandemic. We investigate the impacts of COVID‐19 on the operation of e‐commerce stores (in short, e‐stores) specialising in agricultural inputs. The difference‐in‐differences method (DID) is employed to estimate the causal relationship between COVID‐19 and online sales of agricultural inputs using data from 54,244 agricultural input e‐stores registered in 118 prefecture‐level cities across 15 provinces and hosted on two major Chinese e‐commerce platforms. The results show that COVID‐19 led to a substantial growth in monthly sales of agricultural input e‐stores, and this growth of online sales varied across store scales and by types of agricultural inputs. In particular, e‐stores selling seeds and seedlings experienced a larger growth in sales than stores selling agricultural machinery and implements, and the mid‐ and larger‐scaled e‐stores experienced more growth of sales than micro‐ and small‐scaled e‐stores. Further analysis reveals that the growth of online sales of agricultural inputs was driven mainly by an increase in the quantity of customer orders (QCO). The findings of this paper underscore the importance of e‐commerce in ensuring the resilience of the agricultural supply chain during the pandemic period.</jats:p>",

HAB occurrences are influenced by numerous environmental factors; thus, accurate predictions of HABs and explanations about the predictions are required to implement preventive water quality management. In this study, machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), were employed to predict HABs in eight water supply reservoirs in South Korea. The use of synthetic minority oversampling technique for addressing imbalanced HAB occurrences improved classification performance of the ML algorithms. Although RF and XGB resulted in marginal performance differences, XGB exhibited more stable performance in the presence of data imbalance. Furthermore, a post hoc explanation technique, Shapley additive explanation was employed to estimate relative feature importance. Among the input features, water temperature and concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus appeared important in predicting HAB occurrences. The results suggest that the use of ML algorithms along with explanation methods increase the usefulness of predictive models as a decision-making tool for water quality management.</jats:p>",

We herein propose a hybrid stochastic and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach to hedge against discrete disruption scenarios and uncertain customer demands. We also tailor a Benders decomposition‐based algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting large‐scale mixed integer linear programming reformulations.

The philosophical basis of the study is the concept of service dominant logic. In addition, the research methodology is an inter-industry analysis of economics, and WIOD is used for analysis data. Petroleum product manufacturing and warehousing are the backward industries of the last mile delivery industry. And it seems clear that wholesale and retail industry are forward industries. Therefore, the last mile delivery industry plays a role in connecting the relationship between the supply industry, the manufacturing industry, and the distribution industry on the supply chain. In addition, the supply chain architecture of the last mile delivery service is significantly different from the existing manufacturing-oriented supply chain structure. Academically, the concept of a traditional manufacturing-oriented supply chain has been expanded to the service sector. And it identified the supply chain structure of the last mile delivery service. In practice, if a strategic industry is selected with limited resources, it will be an important indicator for determining investment priorities.</jats:p>",

Lyophilization is a common procedure employed to conserve HM that enables reconstitution of the milk in different volumes, therefore it provides better control of nutrient content, and consequently facilitates adapting its nutritional content to better fulfill the needs of PTNBs. Thus, this study assessed the proximate composition of HM, lyophilized HM, and hydrated lyophilized HM. For that matter, mature HM of 20 mothers was collected and sampled into 3 sample pools (HM, lyophilized HM, and hydrated lyophilized HM) for further analysis to define their proximate composition. Results demonstrated that lyophilization increased by 8-fold ash, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate content, and energy values compared to HM. Moreover, dilution of 1 g of lyophilized HM with 3.5 g of water was proven ideal for babies weighing up to 1.5 kg, as it provides macronutrient concentrations that approach the recommended nutritional needs. Furthermore, lyophilized HM displayed potential as a possible replacement of infant formulas since, regarding macronutrients, it can supply the nutritional needs of PTNBs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While achieving fruitful patents in innovation, enterprises can face bottlenecks in industrial transformation. The fundamental cause of such difficulties is the lack of pilot equipment. To this end, the science and technology (S&amp;T) innovation platform introduces equipment sharing to solve the problems in transforming enterprise patents. Based on the premise that service demand is endogenous to platform service effort and user relationship resilience, this paper introduces revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contract mechanisms. It constructs a Stackelberg game model between S&amp;T innovation platforms and enterprise users. Further, we explore the decision-making optimization involving platform service pricing, service effort, and a user’s relationship resilience. Our main findings are: (1) service pricing and relationship resilience show supermodularity to the platform revenue while showing submodularity to the user revenue. (2) The optimal user relationship resilience always indicates a decreasing trend in the pricing of platform services. (3) The platform and users have their preferences for contract types. When the platform dominates the game, they tend to adopt a revenue-sharing contract. When the users dominate, they are more willing to implement a cost-sharing contract. (4) As the S&amp;T innovation platform strengthens the connection between the platform and users through the revenue- and cost-sharing contracts, it further enhances the supply chain collaboration among equipment suppliers, technology innovation platforms, and users, thereby achieving the purpose of improving supply chain sustainability and resilience. Technological innovation is an essential means to improve supply chain sustainability and resilience.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The search for a pleasant home has concerned people ever since. Paradoxically, people are facing strong difficulties in finding a decent place to settle their lives in cities. As such, the housing market regained momentum in connection with the development of Smart Cities, where life quality of residents is strongly emphasized. Well-being in the metropolis is affected by a wide variety of factors with housing supply being among the most important, hence stirred by financing costs, construction costs, vacancy rate, sales delay, inflation rate, housing stock, price of agricultural land, and regulation. The present article reviews empirical studies on housing supply for a better understanding of the dynamics in this market, shedding some light on the expectable outcomes of policy actions in the promotion of sustainable housing towards the smart city transition. Our review shows that the long-run price elasticity of housing supply is larger than the short-run, as well as the existence of substantial differences in the price elasticity across countries and regions. As such, overall, the hypothesis of a perfectly elastic supply is rejected. In addition, our review highlights that housing supply is negatively related to financial costs, inflation, sales delay, and the existence of regulatory or physical constraints. Also, the elasticity is lower when there are regulatory constraints. Newfangled strategic interaction models, though overlooked in the literature, reinforce that housing does not fit the perfect competition frame. The review proves that we are in face of a non-competitive market in which policy intervention is required to maximize social welfare; policy packages to grant people access to the housing market may be required. However, policy interventions should be carefully designed and clear, to mitigate their potentially negative impact on the housing supply as adverse results may be harmful to the transition towards a smart city.</jats:p>"

This paper, drawing on multi-stakeholder theory, aims to empirically identify the key determinants influencing the reduction of FLW in Indian agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) for ensuring food security. A structured questionnaire was used to collect responses from the various stakeholders of the AFSC and then the exploratory factor analysis technique was used to summarize the items into underlying determinants of reduction of FLW in Indian AFSC for ensuring food security. The results of this study reveal that (1) government support, (2) supply chain partnerships, (3) technological support, (4) consumer attitude and (5) top management commitment are the key determinants in the given context. All the stakeholders of AFSC must be aware of these key determinants affecting the reduction of FLW. They must work collaboratively to make a difference by preventing and managing FLW as it is everyone’s responsibility to work towards food security. </jats:p>",

Therefore, the automatic, quick, and accurate location of fault sections is of great significance to the reliability of power supply. In order to prevent large-scale power outages in the power supply area caused by the failure of feeders and transformers, this paper proposes a novel method to locate fault sections in active distribution networks by taking into account the data of the power supply area. On the basis of the synchronization of calculated and measured time and the observability of the fault state, a limited number of intelligent terminals are reasonably arranged in the distribution network feeder and power supply area. Additionally, the fault location equation is established based on the three-phase voltage change values of the nodes before and after the fault collected by intelligent terminals, so that the fault section is determined by comparing the residuals. Finally, the proposed method is verified by the improved IEEE 37-node and IEEE 123-node three-phase distribution networks. The results show that it has high accuracy in locating fault sections in multiple fault scenarios.</jats:p>"

Among other treatment options, timely prescribed optimal nutritional-metabolic support is one of the priority methods of intensive treatment for this category of patients. OBJECTIVE: To study the severity of metabolic dysfunction in sepsis and determine the parameters of optimal substrate supply for this category of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 166 patients with sepsis. We studied the severity of systemic metabolic dysfunction and the impact of various options for energy and protein supply on the course of the disease and its outcome. Energy expenditure and the severity of the catabolic reaction of the body were studied by dynamic evaluation of indicators of indirect calorimetry, actual losses of nitrogen and nitrogen balance. RESULTS: Actual energy expenditure in sepsis reaches its maximum values by the 5–6th day of the disease (33.5 ± 1.8 kcal/kg/day or 2366 ± 126 kcal/day). The average energy consumption in sepsis is 2226 ± 96 kcal/day or 30.9 ± 1.4 kcal/kg/day. Energy supply in sepsis less than 25 kcal/kg/day leads to a significant increase in mortality. Protein losses in sepsis reach their maximum values by the 5–6th day of the disease (1.93 ± 0.12 g/kg/day). The average loss of protein in sepsis is 1.68 ± 0.06 g/kg/day. Protein provision of this category of patients with more than 1.5 g/kg/day contributes to a significant decrease in mortality, relative to patients receiving less protein per day. CONCLUSIONS: Energy supply in the range of 25–35 kcal/kg/day, as well as protein supply of more than 1.5 g/kg/day, significantly contribute to better survival of patients with sepsis.</jats:p>"

This work provides a new case for a better understanding of how to establish this simultaneity. Future solutions are being explored in practice on the campus of the FH Westküste University of Applied Sciences in the Lecturing and Exhibition Building (LEB). The motivation was to design and operate a case building for research in energy science for teaching the bachelor’s program Green Building Systems as well as for demonstration purposes for the general public. With a floor space of 207 m, the LEB is supplied with renewable energy from the adjacent energy park consisting of a 10 kW wind turbine and photovoltaic modules with 10 kWp. The heat and cold generation system consists of two reversible heat pumps: one is an air–water heat pump with approx. 7 kW heating and 6 kW cooling power, and the second is a brine–water heat pump with approx. 8 kW heating power and a depth of the two boreholes of 80 m. To match the energy generation and the energy consumption, different kinds of storage units, i.e., batteries with 3 × 8 kWh and storage tanks with 1000 L heat storage and 600 L cold storage, were installed as well as a smart automation system with a database. This paper evaluates measurement data from 2021. It is demonstrated that a fully renewable energy supply of the building is possible for most of the time from spring to autumn. In winter, an additional long-term energy storage, e.g., hydrogen, is necessary for certain days.</jats:p>"

Different practices, including humidification, were used to preserve the leaves during selling. Traditional baskets or old clothes were used for the transportation and storage of gboma. Important quality attributes mostly used by actors during purchasing were freshness and color followed by physical damage and, to a lesser extent, weight and leaf surface at different degrees. gboma is currently sold in informal markets; however, improving handling and selling practices could preserve the freshness of this leafy vegetable that could then be placed in conventional supermarkets.

It establishes a model analysis framework to analyze pricing optimization strategies and the channel-mode selection of electric vehicle batteries and considers manufacturer recycling and retailer recycling scenarios. When a retailer recycles, it needs to invest capital to build its recycling channel and so suffers from capital constraints. For this reason, retailers consider bank loans or trade-credit financing from manufacturers. This work explores a two-stage, CLSC pricing strategy that considers consumers’ preferences for remanufactured products and recycling rates, and it investigates financing channels for capital-constrained retailers. It analyzes optimal equilibrium strategies in three modes and compares the recycling and financing modes. Through numerical examples, it analyzes the effects of value preference rates and recycling rates of remanufactured products on supply chain profits, product demand, and model selection. The results show that the recycling rate can effectively incentivize the demand for new products in the first period. For any remanufactured product recycling cost, the manufacturer’s profit is most significant in the retailer-recycling bank financing model, and the retailer’s profit is largest in the manufacturer recycling model. As the consumer preference rate for remanufactured products increases, the demand for new products in the second stage decreases and the demand for remanufactured products increases. The retailer recycling trade-credit financing from the manufacturer model gives the largest profit to the retailer when the preference rate is significant or when the preference rate is low with a moderate recycling rate.</jats:p>"

Predicting how coastal dunes, and the services they provide, will change in the future requires an understanding of the relative roles of the physical and ecological processes that shape their structure and function. Here we assess the relative roles of sand supply, beach morphology, and vegetation in determining foredune morphology, and its change, along a 300‐km stretch of the US Central Atlantic coast. In particular, we used the spatial variability inherent in beaches and dunes of this region to determine the relative importance of shoreline change rate (SCR; a proxy for sand supply to the beach), beach morphology, and grass density of four widespread dune grasses (<jats:italic>Uniola paniculata</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Ammophila breviligulata</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Panicum amarum</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Spartina patens</jats:italic>) to foredune morphology metrics (height, width, and aspect ratio) along the North Carolina Outer Banks barrier islands. Foredune morphology and change metrics are correlated with three main factors: multidecadal SCR (1997–2016), beach slope, and dune grass density and species identity. Multidecadal SCR and beach width explained the most variation in, and were positively correlated with, foredune height and width, and were negatively correlated with foredune aspect ratio (height divided by width). In addition, grass density and changes in grass density contributed significantly to foredune morphology change. We found a positive relationship between change in <jats:italic>A. breviligulata</jats:italic> density and foredune width, which aligns with previous studies on the US Atlantic and Pacific Northwest coasts. Our results demonstrate the interactive roles of beach sand supply and dune grass functional morphology in dune building processes on highly vulnerable coastlines.</jats:p>",

The legal nature of contract performance is analyzed from the point of view of the general norms of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation and special legislation. A review of judicial practice in the enforcement of contract performance security for improper performance of the contract terms has been conducted. The purpose of the study is to analyze the mechanism of implementation of public contract performance security of federal customers. The legal nature and functions of public contract performance security have been studied; a comparison of judicial practice in similar cases has been made. Methods: the methods of consistency, analysis and comparative law are used. Results: the authors’ position justified in the work is based on the legislation, the results of the specialists’ study on the use of a mechanism for compensating a penalty by a state customer by withholding contract security from an unscrupulous supplier. The paper presents brief conclusions and suggestions for improving the mechanism for the implementation of the restoration of violated rights of the parties in the execution of public contracts. Conclusions: given the importance of uninterrupted execution of the state order, the legislator has taken care of a system of measures to protect the interests of the state customer. One of the important mechanisms for protecting the customer’s right is the implementation of a security payment. Based on the analysis of judicial practice on this issue, the authors have found that in case of breaking by the supplier of the terms of the public contract, the customer does not always lawfully withhold compensation for penalties in the form of a security payment or an independent guarantee. This issue is especially relevant at the present time in an unstable economic situation. On the one hand, this mechanism guarantees the protection of the rights of the customer; on the other hand, if the supplier is included in the register of unscrupulous enterprises, it puts a stigma on the business reputation and the possibility of further development of a market participant. Therefore, the impartial position of the Federal Antimonopoly Service and the performance in good faith of its duties by the state customer is very important in this matter.</jats:p>",

Enough minerals in an accessible form in a medium are a prerequisite for maintaining a high growth rate of P. purpureum. Carbon is the main element of microalgal biomass and is a component of all organic compounds. The work aimed to study the morphological features of cells and the accumulation and production of B-phycoerythrin and total protein in P. purpureum biomass in different ways of supplying CO2 into the culture. In Variant 1, CO2 was directly injected into a gas–air mixture (2–3 percent v/v) used for culture bubbling via capillary. In Variant 2, the air was supplied to the culture through the aquarium sparger. Variant 3 was like the first one but without the additional introduction of carbon dioxide. The application of the method for sparging atmospheric air led to a significant increase in both the productivity of the P. purpureum and the rate of protein and B-phycoerythrin synthesis in comparison with growing it using the air without spraying (two-and-a-half times, five times, and more than eight times, respectively). Moreover, there were significant changes in the morphological structure of P. purpureum cells, which were visualized both by microscopy and by changes in the color of the culture. Based on the experimental data obtained, the variants for the carbon supply experiment were ranked as follows: Variant 1 is better than Variant 2 and Variant 3. The use of atomization as a technological method made it possible to speed up the transfer of carbon dioxide from the air to the medium, which helped to keep the growth rate of P. purpureum biomass and B-phycoerythrin accumulation high.</jats:p>"

This change in policy paired with the healthier HPV vaccine supply is an incredible opportunity to facilitate rapid access and expansion of HPV vaccination. Female adolescent vaccination including multiage cohorts must be prioritized. In the coming decades, this is the most cost-effective approach to avert millions of projected cervical cancer cases, which account for most HPV-related cancers globally.</jats:p>",

Cobalt demand is increasing due to its requirement in lithium-ion batteries, which will significantly contribute to the energy transition. Supply is threatened for various reasons, primarily regarding supply chain concentrations, with the majority of the world’s cobalt originating in terrestrial deposits in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and being refined in China. There remain environmental and ethical concerns over the present supply chain. Previous discussions around reducing cobalt’s criticality have suggested diversifying processing locations to reduce geographical and jurisdictional reliance where possible. This study assesses the viability of extracting cobalt from polymetallic nodules (PMNs) located on the deep-seabed in the Area, as an alternative strategy to reduce cobalt’s criticality. Assessments are made of the viability of PMN extraction considering ongoing barriers to introduction, contrasted with current arguments supporting PMN extraction. PMN mining offers a more stable and decentralised alternative to current cobalt supply. There exist impediments to its introduction, notably potential environmental impacts, which remain poorly understood. Technical and political restrictions must also be overcome. It is argued that the wider environmental benefits of increased cobalt supply from PMN mining may offset its detrimental environmental impacts. It is suggested that PMN mining be used in a wider strategy to improve supply security of cobalt to US markets.</jats:p>",

On the basis of the received results of the conducted diagnostics, barriers, threats, ecological principles of functioning of the regional industrial waste management system were identified. As a result of the study, it was proved that for effective infrastructural support of industrial waste management, it is advisable to implement a comprehensive approach, the essence of which is the integration of the principles of transformation of the industrial waste management system, the implementation of the reverse logistics algorithm, the main components of the organizational and economic mechanism (functions, methods, management tools, information systems, digital, “green” and innovative technologies), financial instruments of green investment for the implementation of the regional industrial waste management strategy. The implementation of the proposed integrated approach will contribute to the adoption of justified innovative decisions on the greening of logistics activities and environmental management; timely solution of problems of management of return flows of production waste using the principles of reverse logistics; minimization of the negative impact on the environment by reducing the volume of waste generation, increasing the volume of processing and reuse of industrial waste; effective implementation of circular economy models, transition to expanding producer responsibility; increasing the level of environmental safety of the region and the country; achieving the goals of sustainable development of the national economy. It has been established that in order to improve the industrial waste management system in the region, it is expedient to: introduce the latest technologies and equipment for collection, sorting, transportation, processing and utilization of waste taking into account advanced European practices; promoting the use of waste recycling as secondary raw materials on the basis of “green” investment; development of a financial mechanism for the application of public-private partnership based on attracting private investments and other non-budgetary sources of financing in the field of industrial waste management; creation of an appropriate cluster structure as an organizational form of partnership in the field of industrial waste management; development and implementation of tools for economic stimulation of industrial waste utilization; implementation of the concept of reverse logistics in the context of the green and circular economy.</jats:p>"

In this study, we build on innovation management, circular business model (CBM), and circular supply chain (CSC) literatures and develop a theory-based framework where circularity leads to product/process/service innovation from a micro-perspective, and to possible innovation in companies’ supply chains (retaining existing chains/renewing them) from a meso-perspective. Through a multiple-case study of Finnish and Italian CE pioneer companies, we validate this framework, find evidence on interplay between CBM and CSC innovation, and identify innovation strategy variants. The framework contributes to innovation management, CBM, and CSC literature works, and encourages managers willing to adopt circularity to consider innovating simultaneously both their business models and supply chains. </jats:p>",

Two methods are then used to coordinate the supply chain, and the results are verified by numerical analysis. The results show that: (1) the stronger the concerns of consumers regarding a low-carbon preference and endurance, the better the development of new energy vehicles; (2) raising the integral calculation coefficient and the integral price can increase the demand for, and profits from, new energy vehicles, which can expand the market; and (3) the supply chain can be fully coordinated through Nash negotiations.

Herewith, the intensity of energy extraction by the soil heat exchanger decreases, excess heat is accumulated with a decrease in the depth of wells, and the costs of installing and operating probe heat exchangers are also reduced. An improved version of the conceptual arrangement of a vapor compression system for heat and cool supply of buildings based on the integrated heat of soil and ventilation air has been developed. Its distinguished features are the possibility of automatic redistribution of generated heat flows in the subsystems of customers’ heat consumption and accumulation of excess part in the soil mass. When the system is operating in the warm season with the extraction of heat only for hot water supply, there is a more intensive accumulation of excess heat of the ventilation air in the soil mass, which restores its temperature in the accumulation mode for further use with the coming of the heating period. Multifactor analytical dependences of the heat flows of the main equipment have been established, taking into account the initial parameters and operating conditions of the structural subsystems for the extraction, transformation and consumption of heat, which are the basis for determining the energy potential of vapor compression heat and cold supply using a binary low-temperature source.</jats:p>"

Financial risks in the supply chain greatly hinder its sustainable development; thus, strengthening financial risk management is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the supply chain. Based on the single-channel and dual-channel credit financing models of retailers in the supply chain, the purpose of this paper was to construct a model of the intensity of credit default risk contagion among supply chain enterprises under different credit financing models, and investigate the influencing factors of credit risk contagion among supply chain enterprises and its mechanism of action through a computational simulation system. The results were as follows: (1) there was a positive relationship between the production cost of suppliers and the contagion intensity of the supply chain credit default risk, and the contagion effect of the supply chain credit default risk increased significantly when both retailers defaulted on trade credit to suppliers; (2) the market retail price of the product was negatively related to the contagion intensity of the supply chain credit default risk, and the contagion intensity of the supply chain credit default risk increased significantly when both retailers defaulted on trade credit to the supplier; (3) the intensity of credit default risk contagion in the supply chain was positively correlated with both the commercial bank risk-free rate and the trade credit rate, and retailers’ repayment priority on trade credit debt was negatively correlated with suppliers’ wholesale prices and positively correlated with retailers’ order volumes, with retailers’ repayment priority positively affecting retailers’ bank credit rates and negatively affecting suppliers’ bank credit rates; and (4) retailers’ repayment priority on trade credit debt was negatively correlated with the intensity of supply chain credit default risk contagion, and the lower the retailer’s bank credit limit, the higher the trade credit limit, and the stronger the credit default contagion effect in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

In this HSSC, a healthcare institution establishes both a traditional offline channel and an online channel to provide healthcare services for some health conditions. Considering the public welfare of healthcare institutions, we employ a sum formula of economic revenue and patient surplus to describe the total revenue of both healthcare service channels. Based on the Stackelberg game, we develop a decentralized supply chain model to maximize supply chain members’ revenue. By employing the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality condition, we derive an analytical expression for the optimal service price, which includes the functions of the public welfare coefficient and channel acceptance. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical analyses under various system parameters to verify the optimal price decision-making strategies. Our analytical results indicate that: (1) the healthcare service price is closely related to the patients’ channel acceptance, the public welfare coefficient, and the government price ceiling policy; (2) the public welfare coefficient strongly influences the service price and total revenue, and its increase can decrease the economic revenue of the HSSC; (3) the acceptance of online channels is an essential factor that should be carefully considered in the construction of a dual-channel HSSC. Improving patient acceptance of online channels is conducive to developing and improving a sustainable dual-channel HSSC.</jats:p>"

Reducing food waste has been identified as essential to tackle the current climate crisis, and links to several UN’s sustainable development goals. This is especially critical for energy and resource-intensive food products like meat, whose consumption is predicted to reach an historical maximum by 2030. Whilst wastage occurs at all stages of the supply chain, tractable data about the journey of food from production to consumer remains largely hidden or unrecorded. Powered by the latest advances in sensing like smart food packaging and digital technologies such as Big Data and IoT, Digital Twins offer a valuable opportunity to monitor and control meat products and processes across the whole supply chain, enabling food waste to be reduced and by-products reintegrated into the supply chain. This paper proposes a new framework for a Digital Twin that integrates key technological enablers across different areas of the meat supply chain towards with the goal of a “zero-waste”, circular meat supply chain.</jats:p>"

The bubble dynamic and particle movement in the reactor is primarily responsible for uniform heat and mass transfer and mixing. The properties of bubbles in BFB are governed by the gas distribution inside the reactor or supply of the fluidizing gas. This work investigates the influence on the fluid dynamic behaviour of the BFB reactor at different fluidizing gas injection systems using the Computational Particle Fluid dynamic model. Three different modes of fluidizing gas injection include uniform injection, air injection via twenty-five nozzles, and air supply via side nozzles along the reactor height in a gasification reactor of 10.04 cm diameter. Air is used as the fluidizing gas and silica sand as the bed material. The CPFD model is developed in Barracuda Virtual reactor 20.01. The CPFD model is validated against the experimental data obtained from the Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) sensors. The result depicts the better fluidization quality of the bed with uniform air supply as flow boundary and air injection via twenty-five nozzles located at the bottom of the reactor. With air injection via two side nozzles along the reactor height, the bed is fluidized with large bubbles and particle entrainment in the freeboard zone of the reactor. A method is proposed to improve the fluidization quality of the bed while using side nozzles as inlet flow Boundary Conditions (BC) for air injection. The proposed method includes addition of four nozzles along the reactor wall instead of two which improves the fluidization quality of the bed in terms of smaller size bubbles without particle entrainment in the freeboard region.</jats:p>"

The study combined a hydrological change index method and the Mann–Kendall test to assess the temporal dynamics of both discharge and water levels along the main rivers of the VMD. Results highlight that the system of rivers and canals helps facilitate waterway traffic and drainage during the flood season. However, the low elevation of the delta has created conditions suitable for saline water to increasingly penetrate upstream during the dry season. Observed changes in the hydrological indicators at the upstream stations of Tan Chau (Mekong River) and Chau Doc (Bassac River) are not only due to the dike system but also upstream alterations to the flow regime. More research is needed to consider the various drivers of flow-regime change associated with natural and human activities both inside and outside of the study area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Effective management of hypertension in low- and middle-income settings is a persistent public health challenge. This study examined supply- and demand-side barriers to receiving quality care and achieving effective hypertension management in rural Bihar, India. A state-representative household survey collected information from adults over 30 years of age on characteristics of the hypertension screening, diagnosis, and management services they received. A linked provider assessment determined the percent of providers who provided quality hypertension care (i.e., had a functioning BP measurement device, measured a patient’s BP, could correctly diagnose hypertension, had at least one first-line antihypertension medication, and could prescribe correctly based on standard guidelines). Patients were linked with their provider to determine the quality-adjusted coverage of hypertension management and logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine characteristics associated with receiving quality care. A total of 14,386 patients and 390 providers were studied. Nearly a quarter (22.5%) of adults had never had their BP measured before and 8.1% of adults reported a previous hypertension diagnosis. Less than one third (31.0%) of all interviewed providers demonstrated ability to provide quality hypertension care, and quality varied between provider types (14.8% of private homeopathic, 25.2% of informal, 40.0% of private modern medicine, and 60.0% of public providers gave quality care). While 95.8% of diagnosed individuals received some treatment, only 10.9% of patients received care from quality local providers. Nearly 45% of individuals with hypertension received care from non-local providers. Individuals from the general caste with comorbidities living in villages with more high-quality providers were most likely to receive quality care from a local provider. Whereas the coverage of services for individuals diagnosed with hypertension is high, the quality of these services is suboptimal for economically and socially vulnerable populations, which limits effective management and control of hypertension in rural Bihar. Efforts should be targeted towards providers to initiate quality treatment upon diagnosis, including correct prescription of antihypertensives.</jats:p>"

Two 96-hour tests were conducted in a sealed shipping container, which was used as a surrogate for a refuge alternative. While burning propane gas to simulate human oxygen consumption, cryogenic air was provided to the shipping container to determine if the cryogenic air supply will keep the O2 level above 18.5% and CO2 level below 1% inside the shipping container as required by the federal regulations pertaining to refuge alternatives. Both 96-hour tests simulated the breathing of 21 persons.

In order to pursue greater progress in the ELV business establishment, a comprehensive analysis of previous ELV studies with regard to the supply chain uncertainty perspective is essential. The objective of this study is aimed at categorising the existing supply chain uncertainty sources according to their end-of-life (EoL) strategies, identify the management approaches adopted to analyse the prominent research trends, and conduct a regional analysis of ELV supply chain studies for the past years, from 2016 until 2022. The content analysis method was used to extract all the essential information from previous research, and an analysis was performed to obtain the latest research trends and identify the relationship between the gathered data. The findings show that the past research focuses on three main supply chain uncertainties, namely, uncertainty in logistics and network facilities (31.8%), production and operations (30.7%), and environmental (25.0%). Furthermore, the regional analysis shows that 83% of the studies were conducted in developing countries over the past years. Lastly, several research gaps were presented to provide researchers with potential directions and the way forward to explore ELV supply chain research from the uncertainty management context.</jats:p>"

We provide evidence that several weeds are reservoirs of YMMV and that YMMV isolates infecting weeds cluster together with those infecting yams, pointing to the role of weeds in the epidemiology of YMMV. We report the occurrence of yam chlorotic necrosis virus (YCNV) in Guadeloupe, the introduction of YMMV isolates through the importation of yam tubers, and the absence of vertical transmission of YaV1. We identified specific effects on some cropping practices, such as weed management and the use of chemical pesticides, on the occurrence of a few viruses, but no crop-related factor had a strong or general effect on the overall epidemiology of the targeted viruses. Overall, our work provides insights into the epidemiology of yam viruses that will help design more efficient control strategies.</jats:p>"

However, the responses of the rhizosphere microbial community to P input and its effects on P uptake by tea plants have not been widely reported. In this study, the high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and the ITS2 region was employed to examine the responses of tea rhizosphere microbiomes to different P input rates (low-P, P0: 0 mg·kg−1 P; moderate-P, P1: 87.3 mg·kg−1 P; high-P, P2: 436.5 mg·kg−1 P). The results showed that the P input treatments significantly reduced the soil C: N ratio and C: P ratio compared to the P0 treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the P2 treatment significantly increased the soil available P, plant biomass and P content of the tea plant compared to the P0 and P1 treatments (p &lt; 0.05). Both bacterial and fungal communities revealed the highest values of alpha diversity indices in the P1 treatment and the lowest in the P2 treatment. The dominant phyla of the bacterial community were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria, while in the fungal community they were Ascomycota and Mortierellomycota. In addition, P input enriched the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria but decreased the relative abundance of Acidobacteria. The Mantel correlation analysis showed that the fungal community was influenced by P input, whereas bacterial community was affected by the soil TC and C: N ratio. Furthermore, the P input treatments enhanced the TCA cycle, amino and nucleotide glucose metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and phosphotransferase system expression, which could promote C and N cycling. On the contrary, the P input treatments negatively affected the growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The PLS-PM model revealed that the rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities, respectively, negatively and positively affected the P content by affecting the biomass. Meanwhile, rhizosphere microbial function profiles affected the P content of tea plants directly and positively. In summary, moderate P input favors the rhizosphere microbial diversity and functions in the short-term pot experiment. Therefore, we suggest that moderate P input should be recommended in practical tea production, and a further field test is required.</jats:p>"

The result shows that whether an enterprise actively participates in the cooperative recycling depends on the actual cost of establishing the cooperative recycling system. Additionally, the government support and supervision will affect the actual cost of cooperation. When the actual cost of establishing a collaborative recovery system is very large, under the influence of government interventions, there will be two kinds of evolutionary results for enterprises, either with cooperation or not at the same time. On the contrary, when the actual cost is small or medium, both manufacturers and the platforms will choose to cooperate.

This paper uses panel regression analysis to quantitatively measure the effect of the market supply of construction land (MSCL) on labor resources misallocation (LMIS). The results show that LMIS decreased year-by-year during the study period. The development of the MSCL can effectively reduce LMIS. The negative effect of the MSCL in the central region is greater than that in the eastern region, and the negative effect in the western region is the smallest. There is a single-threshold effect on the impact of the MSCL on LMIS. Specifically, when the MSCL is less than 18,045 hectares, the impact effect is −0.324, and when the MSCL is higher than 18,045 hectares, the effect is not significant. Moreover, the impact of the MSCL on LMIS has a spatial spillover effect, which is greater than the direct effect. Labor resources tend to migrate to economically developed areas, not just adjacent areas. These conclusions are of great significance for reducing LMIS from the perspective of land system reform in China.</jats:p>"

This is the most vital task to solve in securing sanitary-epudemiological welfare of population in any country. The purpose of the study was to identify harmful factors that affect public health when people consume tap drinking water from centralized supply systems and to perform their hygienic assessment. Materials and methods. The study involved using data from statistical reports published by Federal Service for Supervision in Protection of the Rights of Consumer and Man Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor (Form No. 18)) and data provided by the Federal information fund of social-hygienic c monitoring collected in 2012-2021. Additional disease cases and deaths that were associated with water quality were calculated based on mathematical modelling of relationships within the “indicators of water quality - health disorders” system. Results. The study showed that in 2021 in the Russian Federation as a whole approximately 1.54 million disease cases were caused by poor quality of drinking water including violations of hygienic standards as by certain indicators. Health disorders were registered as per such nosology categories as “diseases of the digestive system”, “endocrine diseases”, “infectious and parasitic diseases” etc. Priority factors that cause additional diseases cases and deaths include chlorine and its organic derivatives, some metals such as iron, manganese, nickel, and boron. Microbiological agents also make a substantial contribution to medical and demographic losses. At the same time, a number of diseases cases associated with drinking water quality went down by more than 14% against 2012; a number of deaths decreased by 6.2%. Limitations of the study. Initial data are rather specific since they describe only the period from 2012 to 2021; all the established relationships between health and indicators of water quality have been determined based on regional data. Conclusion. Improvement of water quality requires implementing several priority activities. Water treatment faculties and pipelines should be modernized; a list of monitored indicators that describe water quality should be optimized (enlarged) considering incidence and mortality among population as per categories of nosologies associated with drinking water quality.</jats:p>",

We also investigate how various supply chain characteristics and strategies can moderate the impact of such trade friction. Motivated by the 2018 U.S.–China trade war, we conducted a difference‐in‐difference analysis to examine the impact of trade tariffs on performance indicators of U.S. firms with direct supplier connections in China. Specifically, we found that U.S. firms with direct supply partners (i.e., first‐tier suppliers) in China had a worse performance than the U.S. firms without direct supply partners in China in terms of inventory (i.e., days of supply) and profitability (return‐on‐assets). We further found that the negative impacts were more severe for firms with a higher degree of outsourcing, and horizontal and spatial supply base complexity. We discuss the implications for international operations management, supply chain networks, supply risk management, and provide suggestions to supply chain practitioners and trade policymakers.</jats:p>",

From the perspective of performance evaluation, optimizing each enterprise’s efficiency independently will probably result in undesired inventory of intermediate products in the supply chain. Taking the two-stage supply chain where the outputs from the upstream supplier are taken as the inputs for the downstream manufacturer as an example, this paper introduces enterprises’ relative dominance into allocating the responsibility of inventory management between two decentralized enterprises. To motivate these enterprises to adopt the allocation strategy, this paper takes the loss aversion of enterprises into account to reveal the utility subjectively perceived by each decentralized enterprise insisting on independence instead of cooperation. Subsequently, a DEA-based cooperative model is developed to readjust the production processes of two decentralized enterprises. We find that adjusting the relevant parameters is able to explore the relationship between the proposed model and the non-cooperative model and the relationship between the proposed model and the centralized model. Finally, a practical example of coordinating sustainable supply chains is applied to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. </jats:p>",

Life cycle sustainability assessment is a tool to identify social, economic, and environmental aspects of raw materials, but it is mostly used for negative impacts, whereas the supply and use of raw materials may also lead to benefits. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help to determine how raw materials boost or hinder the achievement of a sustainable society. In this study, the SDGs were used as a reference to assess contributions and risks of cobalt supply for electric mobility in the EU and whether this technology supports the achievement of the SDGs. The risks were determined using eight indicators focused on social risks, but environmental aspects like water quality and usage, and greenhouse gas emissions were also considered. The literature and databases were consulted to identify which SDGs receive contributions or burdens. Global and European cobalt supply scenarios were defined, considering the most representative countries. Results indicate that, although some SDGs receive positive contributions, like SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) and SDG 13 (Climate action), most of the identified correlations are negative, especially for SDG 3 (Good health and well‐being) and SDG 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions).

It is discussed whether single grain growth is limited by the sink or the source size under a non‐stress environment. This study explores the effect of e[CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] combined with varying N supply on the source and sink size during grain filling. Source size was defined as the amount of stem reserves per grain (SRG) and the proportion of incident radiation intercepted by the green canopy per grain (f<jats:sub>IR</jats:sub>G) at anthesis. Data from a 2‐year free‐air CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment experiment with wheat with three N levels (on average 38 [Nd], 190 [Nad] and 320 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> [Nex]) and two CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> levels (393 and 600 ppm) on SRG, f<jats:sub>IR</jats:sub>G and grain filling rate (GFR) and duration (GFD) were evaluated. SRG ranged from 2.5 to 12.9 mg and f<jats:sub>IR</jats:sub>G from 4.0 × 0.001% to 6.8 x 0.001%. Rising N supply or e[CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] decreased SRG and f<jats:sub>IR</jats:sub>G via their increases in grain number. Accordingly, there was a negative linear relationship between grain number and SRG (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> ≥ 0.84) or f<jats:sub>IR</jats:sub>G (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> ≥ 0.97). Increasing N supply decreased GFR, but increased GFD, and GFR was increased by e[CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] under Nad and Nex. For GFR and final grain weight, there was a strong positive (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> ≥ 0.85), and for GFD, a strong negative linear relationship (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> ≥ 0.76) with f<jats:sub>IR</jats:sub>G under Nad and Nex. Under these N levels, f<jats:sub>IR</jats:sub>G supplied the largest share (&gt;86%) for grain growth and thus single grain growth was possibly source limited under Nad and Nex. Under high grain number such as under Nex and e[CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>], there might be a risk for low final grain weight due to the low SRG that is insufficient for buffering assimilate shortage under unfavourable environmental conditions in early grain filling.</jats:p>",

Predicting changes in enterprise supply chain resilience can help enterprises adjust their operational strategy timeously and reduce the risk of supply and demand interruption. First, a comprehensive resilience assessment framework for manufacturing enterprises was constructed from the perspective of the supply chain, and an improved technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was used to quantify the resilience level. Considering that the resilience index is easily affected by uncertain factors, and this produces large fluctuations, the buffer operator and metabolism idea are introduced to improve the grey prediction model. This improvement can realize dynamic tracking of the enterprise resilience index and evaluate changes in the enterprise resilience level. Finally, through the analysis of the supply chain data of a famous electronic manufacturing enterprise in China over a two-and-a-half-year period, the results show that the improved TOPSIS method and the improved grey prediction model are effective in improving the supply chain resilience of manufacturing enterprises. This study provides a reference method for manufacturing enterprises to improve their supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

To reduce “Food loss and waste,” laws have been put in place to turn it into animal feed and fertilizers, relax delivery deadlines, and reduce serving sizes of meals. In addition, there are other activities promoted by the government, such as the use of food banks. However, even if all these activities are utilized, food loss and waste can never be reduced to zero. Another way to reduce food loss, other than these laws and activities, is to provide food materials to restaurants that provide inexpensive meals in the city, called “Kodomo-Shokudo.” By using food that would otherwise be wasted at the “Kodomo-Shokudo,” we can contribute to reducing food loss and lowering the operating costs of the these restaurants. Our aim is to clarify the difference between the food bank and “Kodomo-Shokudo” and create a route model that supplies food losses to the “Kodomo-Shokudo.” Kodomo-Shokudo is a community place where local residents or NPOs take the initiative to provide meals to children for free or at a low cost. Consequently, Monte Carlo simulations show that the resulting transportation costs could be significantly reduced.</jats:p>",

In this study, plants’ performance in responding to AR regulation based on nutrient supply was investigated in terms of plant morphology, physiology and AR traits. Results indicated that Cleistocalyx operculatus possesses higher waterlogging tolerance than Syzygium cumini according to the waterlogging tolerance coefficient, mainly because of the higher fresh weight, porosity and length of AR in C. operculatus. Nutrient supply treatment under a waterlogging condition significantly decreased the fresh weight, length, number, porosity, cortex area of AR and the ratio of cortex-to-stele area in both species relative to those in the waterlogging treatment, but significantly increased the activities and stele areas of AR, and leaf nutrient content. This result showed that nutrient supply caused variations in the morphological and anatomical structures of AR that were more beneficial to improve nutrient transportation than oxygen absorption under waterlogging conditions, supporting the nutrient-priority hypothesis. Moreover, nutrient supply under waterlogging conditions induced greater increase in stele area of ARs, fresh weight of the whole plant, total leaf area, leaf nitrogen level, total chlorophyll content, net photosynthesis rate and maximum photochemical quantum yield of PSII in S. cumini than in C. operculatus, suggesting that S. cumini can transport more nutrients and easily adapts to increase in nutrient supply under waterlogging conditions. Thus, S. cumini have better performance in extracting and utilizing nutrients in the water for plant growth. The findings showed that terrestrial arbor plants have physiological and microstructural mechanisms that respond to nutrient supply under waterlogging conditions and provide novel insights into the phytoremediation of eutrophic water bodies in wetland systems.</jats:p>",

As water is vital, it needs to be adequately monitored and managed to prevent its degradation. This research presents the results of monitoring the main sources of water supply in two continuously growing departments of Bolivia, La Paz, and Tarija. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the water to which the population has access, with particular attention to heavy metals with concentrations that exceed the permitted limits. The metals found were arsenic, chromium, mercury, manganese, iron, zinc, and tin in the Milluni area, and lead, iron, and manganese in the Guadalquivir area. Exposing the presence of metals in water sources implies immediate attention by decision-makers to take action to reduce the risk to public health.

This problem is a multi-objective function designed to reduce the transported costs and associated delivery times. The Matheuristic presents a brilliant hybridize between the meta-heuristics steps and mathematical procedures in solving large-size problems with the slightest deviation [Formula: see text]. This paper proposed an ant colony-based algorithm evolved by mathematical procedures called Mat-ACO, compared with SA “simulated annealing” and CA “Camel algorithm.” The authors deduced that the mathematical solution is limited as the instances grow, significantly if increased than 600 network hotspots. The Mat-ACO, SA, and CA results are close to counterparts obtained by LINGO, with a difference of 2.03%, 2.49%, and 3.75%, respectively, and continue to extract results from more than 1350 network hotspots. The main contribution is to find the optimum tuning parameters, which will reduce the deviation from the exact solution. This paper reveals that no feasible solution can catch the LINGO at large-size problems. At the same time, the CA is superior to SA in the large problem sizes, while Mat-ACO still presents preferred solutions in minimum time. The proposed methodology is classified as a closed-loop network strategy that targets green management. </jats:p>",

Many scholars have examined the role of different technologies on sustainable performance. However, research using eco-innovation (EI), digital transformation (DT), and smart technologies (ST) is still scarce. The current study develops the conceptual model based on the resource-based view (RBV) and technology, organization, and environment (TOE) theories, and using a simple random sampling technique, valid data from 375 professionals in the manufacturing industry is collected to test the relationship between sustainable development strategy (SDS), EI, DT, ST, and sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP). The results indicate strong positive relationships between SDS, EI, DT, ST, and SSCP. Results indicate that even if organizations are executing SDS and EI, without DT and ST, organizations cannot achieve SSCP. Therefore, it is recommended to the managers that they must apply DT and ST to guarantee their pursuit of achieving sustainable performance and contribution toward SDGs. </jats:p>",

Maritime transport and ports are important sources of pollution and, while industry and the rest of the large-scale emitters have achieved considerable reductions in this area, “shipping” is still not advancing at the same rate, falling behind in this race. The aim of this article is to underline the importance of an early implementation of On-Shore Power Supply (OPS), Cold Ironing (CI) or Alternative Marine Power (AMP) by making a study of potentially avoidable CO2 emissions from vessels docked (on the basis of the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] and ENTEC [Environmental Engineering Consultancy, an environmental and engineering consultancy in UK] methods) close to urban areas in the Port of Santander (Spain). It is the first time potential reductions have been calculated for the last 11 years (2011–2021), distinguishing yearly emissions per type of vessel and providing real information to port authorities to prioritize the installation of this technological basis for the operation of piers/terminals to optimize investments and outcomes. In this case study, results demonstrate the outcomes of ROROs, ferries, and cruises being the first target of OPS implementation (reaching total of 37.95% of total emitted tons of CO2 during the period of study). As a clear conclusion to this paper, the reader can understand the enormous and growing potential of this technology multiplied by the continuous development, increase and implementation of green energies.</jats:p>"

A clear understanding of the relationship between the ES supply–demand mismatch and urbanization is crucial as it could have a lot of significance for implementing ecological compensation and conservation action. Although a large number of studies have explored this problem, previous studies have focused primarily on the spatial mismatching of the ESs, and only a few studies have considered the spatial relationship between the ES supply–demand mismatch and urbanization at the watershed scale. Taking the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) as an example, this study quantitatively assesses the supply and demand of five ESs, including carbon sequestration, water retention, soil conservation, food production, and recreational opportunity. The bivariate Moran’s I method was used to analyze and visualize the spatial correlation between the ES supply–demand mismatch and urbanization. The results indicate that both the total supply and the total demand of the five ESs increased, while the increasing rate of total demand was higher than the total supply of the ESs; this resulted in a significant spatial mismatch between the supply and demand of the ESs from 2000 to 2020. There is also a negative spatial correlation between the ES supply–demand and urbanization, while the results of local spatial clustering have obvious spatial heterogeneity. The metropolis and its surrounding counties are mostly the ES supply and demand deficit area, but some surrounding counties have managed to transform a deficit into a surplus. These results indicate that urbanization has a certain interference on the mismatch of the ES supply and demand, and this interference is not irreversible. Moreover, this study provides a reliable reference for government management in the context of balancing urbanization and the ecosystem.</jats:p>"

Urban areas are vastly expanding all over the continent and many larger cities in SSA struggle to provide safely managed drinking water. Phytoremediation implemented in constructed wetlands (CWs) is a low-cost and sustainable alternative to highly costly and energy-consuming wastewater treatment plants. In addition, CWs offer the potential to be integrated into farming and aqua-culture systems and can therefore improve food quality and production. The most prominent pollutants in urban SSA surface waters and the pollutant removal efficiencies for microbial and chemical contaminations of different plant species were identified from the literature and the accumulation rates for Pb, Cr, and Cd were compared with each other. A strong focus was given to studies conducted in SSA or other (sub)tropical regions. This review identified a range of potential phytoremediators to treat contaminated surface water and highlights the need for further in situ studies in SSA. Plant species such as Lemna minor, Ipomoea aquatica, Spirodela polyrhiza and Brachiaria mutica show a high potential to phytoremediate the heavy metals Pb, Cr and Cd from surface water.</jats:p>",

Maintaining the balance of water supply and demand is essential in the sustainable development of a regional economy and society. Taking western Jilin, where the difference between water supply and demand is increasingly prominent, as the research object, from the perspective of land consolidation and precipitation changes, this paper analyzes the temporal and spatial changes of water resources supply and demand at the regional and county scales in western Jilin from 2000 to 2018 by the InVEST model and the water resource demand model. The results show that water production in western Jilin did not change significantly before and after land consolidation. The change in planting structure made water demand increase from 3.03 billion m3 to 4.96 billion m3, which reversed the relationship between supply and demand. The impact of precipitation changes on water production is extremely significant. The annual production of water in wet years is 8.05 billion m3, and the annual water production in dry years is 1.08 billion m3. The amount of precipitation can directly change the relationship between the supply and demand of local water resources. The evolution of the water resources supply and demand pattern in western Jilin is the result of the combined effect of land consolidation and precipitation changes. Precipitation mainly affects supply, while land consolidation mainly affects demand.</jats:p>"

We aimed to study the effects of seasonal and multiyear water shortages on nutrient supply and demand in Scots pine and Norway spruce. We studied pine and spruce trees naturally grown in the Bryansk region (Russia). The dynamics of several nutrients (K, Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Ca) in wood, needles, and bark of current-year twigs and the dynamics of the available pools of these elements at different soil depths were analysed. To assess the physiological consequences of changes in element concentrations, lipid peroxidation products and photosynthetic pigments were measured in the needles. Water shortage increased the wood concentrations of all elements except for Mn. In pine, this increase was mainly due to seasonal water deficit, whereas in spruce, multiyear differences in water supply were more important. This increased availability of nutrients was not observed in soil-based analyses. In needles, quite similar patterns of changes were found between species, with Mg increasing almost twofold and Fe and Mn decreasing under water shortage, whereas the remainder of the elements did not change much under differing water supplies. Neither the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments nor the contents of lipid peroxidation products correlated with element dynamics in needles. In summary, water shortage increased the availability of all elements except Mn for the plant; however, needle element contents were regulated independently of element availability for plants.</jats:p>"

Beta ordination revealed distinct clustering of bacterial OTUs for the skin and gut samples from three different groups. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria was most abundant in all groups except the Fusobacteria in the control fish gut. Although Aeromonas was found ubiquitous in all types of samples, diverse bacterial genera were identified in the marketed fish samples. Nonetheless, low species richness was observed for the frozen fish. Most of the differentially abundant bacteria in the skin samples of marketed fish are opportunistic human pathogens enriched at different stages of postharvest handling and processing.

In this paper, a smart supply chain management system (SSCMS) is constructed to realize the intelligence and automatization of the management of sand factories, using edge-computing and deep learning techniques. Along the supply chain, the deep learning model is used to realize the automatic identification of sand, avoiding the disadvantages of human identification, while improving the quality of sand factory operations. In order to relieve the pressure of network bandwidth, reduce system delay, and improve system operation efficiency, we use edge-computing technology to process data at the edge. To verify the performance of the constructed system, a sand factory simulation platform is established. Experiments show that the most critical indicator in the system, the accuracy rate of sand type identification, is above 98%, and the sand type identification time is only 0.022 s. In general, compared with traditional supply chain management, the constructed smart supply chain improves the quality and efficiency of sand factory operations, and all indicators of the designed system have achieved satisfactory results.</jats:p>",

It effectively collects and shares data from the surrounding environment to achieve better IoT services. For data sharing, the publish-subscribe (PS) paradigm provides a loosely coupled and scalable communication model. However, due to the loosely coupled nature, it is vulnerable to many attacks, resulting in some security threats to the IoT system, but it cannot provide the basic security mechanisms such as authentication and confidentiality to ensure the data security. Thus, in order to protect the system security and users’ privacy, this paper presents a secure blockchain-based privacy-preserving access control scheme for the PS system, which adopt the fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to ensure the confidentiality of the publishing events and leverage the ledger to store the large volume of data events and access crossdomain information. Finally, we analyze the correctness and security of our scheme; moreover, we deploy our proposed prototype system on two computers and evaluate its performance. The experimental results show that our PS system can efficiently achieve the equilibrium between the system cost and the security requirement.</jats:p>",

(1) The annual average HDL in all cities of the YREB increases, the regional HDL is spatially unbalanced and decreases from downstream–midstream–upstream, and HDL overlaps with economic development spatiotemporally. (2) The increase in high-tech industrial land supply promotes local HDL, and the raw material industrial land supply promotes HDL more indirectly than directly. (3) The land supply of the industrial supporting service, processing, food and light textile, and raw material industries has significant indirect effects. Processing has the strongest positive spillover effect, and food and light textile has a significant negative spillover effect. The HDL equilibrium in the YREB increased from 2010 to 2019, and the clustering of the processing, industrial supporting service, and food and light textile industries aggravated the spatial imbalance.

Corporate zero-deforestation supply chain commitments (ZDCs) have the potential to address this deforestation, especially if strong state-led forest governance is absent. Yet, because ZDC adoption is limited to particular locations and supply chains, these commitments may fall short at reducing regional deforestation and protecting biodiverse ecosystems. Here, we leverage timeseries of spatially explicit corporate commodity sourcing data and ZDCs to assess the current and potential effect of ZDCs within soybean supply chains on forest loss and biodiversity. We focus on the Brazilian Amazon, where the first ZDC (soy moratorium (SoyM)) was implemented, and the Cerrado, where companies have adopted but not implemented ZDCs. We found that in the Amazon, SoyM signatories that controlled the market caused a 57% reduction in direct deforestation for soy from 2006 to 2015. In the Cerrado, if companies had implemented their ZDCs with the same relative effectiveness as in the Amazon, deforestation for soy could have been reduced by 46%. Thus, ZDC implementation in the Cerrado via stringent monitoring and enforcement could contribute substantially to forest and habitat conservation. Yet, incomplete ZDC adoption leaves &gt;50% of soy-suitable forests and the biodiversity that they harbor outside the reach of ZDCs. To protect these forests, it is vital to incentivize more companies—including smaller, less publicly exposed traders—to make and implement ZDCs, while also promoting forest governance through public policy.</jats:p>",

Based on the water inrush event in Taoyuan Coal Mine of Huaibei coalfield in 2013, the water rock interaction mechanism of Taiyuan Formation limestone water (namely, ‘Taihui water’) was discussed. The results showed that: (1) the relationship of cation mass concentration before and after water inrush was Na+ + K+ &amp;gt; Ca2+ &amp;gt; Mg2+; the correlation of anionic mass concentration before water inrush was SO42− &amp;gt; HCO3− &amp;gt; Cl−, while it was HCO3− &amp;gt; SO42− &amp;gt; Cl− after the event. Before the event, the main water quality types were SO4•Cl-Ca and SO4•Cl-Na; after the event, they mainly included HCO3-Na and SO4•Cl-Na; (2) There is a strong positive correlation between mineral saturation index and pH value, that is, minerals are easy to dissolve under acidic conditions, while alkaline conditions will inhibit the dissolution and transformation of minerals; (3) The hydrogeochemical processes of limestone aquifer mainly included cation exchange, carbonate dissolution, pyrite oxidation, sulfate and silicate dissolution.</jats:p>",

The chemical functional group spectral features of the Prairie cool‐season oat varieties in western Canada were determined by Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy. The protein‐related spectral parameters of chemical functional groups included peak height and peak area intensity of Amide I, Amid II, protein structural α‐helix and β‐sheet, and their ratios. The rumen degradation kinetics were determined using in situ techniques with four rumen‐canulated lactating dairy cows. The intestinal digestion was evaluated using a three‐step in vitro technique with 12 h preincubation. The experiment was an randomized complete block design. The data were analysed using the mixed‐model procedure of the Statistical Analysis System. The results showed that the interconnection between rumen degradation kinetics, intestinal digestion and true nutrient supply to dairy cows and protein‐related chemical functional group spectral features could be revealed by ATR‐FTIR with univariate and multi‐variate spectral analyses. These findings indicate that ruminant relevant nutritive value of cool‐season oats could be rapidly evaluated and predicted using oat‐specific functional group spectral characteristics which could be obtained by a non‐distractive bioanalytical tool of ATR‐FTIR spectroscopy.</jats:p>",

However, limited space in the textile plant is an important constraint for the process enhancement. Therefore, an easily applicable heat recovery system with a small amount of additional equipment to the existing dyeing process is required. To meet the needs from the industry, this study suggests an integrated heat recovery and supply system consisting of single heat exchanger and single storage tank using freshwater as a thermal carrier to utilize the reusable heat in the wastewater. Freshwater is stored in a tank after direct heat exchange with wastewater and is supplied to the next dyeing process. Three different designs of the integrated system were compared based on the lower limit of the wastewater temperature: above 50 °C, 40 °C, and 30 °C for Cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The energy and energy flow analyses showed Case 2 to be well balanced between the quality and quantity of the recovered heat, and there was no heat loss via drainage. The heat demand for Case 2 was 795.5 kW, which was the lowest among all cases. Furthermore, an economic analysis showed that the total cost for Case 2 was reduced by 63.2% compared with the base case. Despite the use of an additional heat exchanger and water storage tank, the proposed system was more economical because of the reduced operating costs. Finally, a detailed analysis was conducted by determining the more efficient temperature for heat recovery and supply.</jats:p>"

Through exploratory and descriptive evidence, and using documentary research as a method, a retrospective survey was carried out from 2000 to 2022 using documents proposing evaluation methodologies. A single document was found to fit the research objective, which was used to develop the proposed HIA methodology. Development of the methodology consisted of two stages: definition of the health dimensions and selection of the indicators making up each dimension. The HIA methodology was then applied to a school in northeast Brazil to test its use, before a water-efficient management intervention was going to be used. The overall score of 46% indicated that there was room for improvement, which the new management approach could facilitate. This methodology is therefore proposed to be an instrument for the evaluation of public water and sanitation policies, thus assisting managers in the decision-making process and in guiding sanitation programs and plans.</jats:p>"

The results of this study are as follows: (1) When CEs and SMZESs’ default losses are lower than some critical value, they tend to break their promises. (2) When accounts receivable are greater than some critical value, CEs cannot repay on time because they can make a relatively large profits from delayed repayment, whereas SMZEs can be constrained to be trustworthy. Finally, the results using numerical simulation show that both relatively large default losses and enough large, trustworthy income sources can make CEs and SMZEs tend to keep their promises; in turn, CEs would be non-paying and the SMZEs tend to be trustworthy for relatively large accounts receivable. The results provide theoretical support for realizing healthy and sustainable development for supply chain finance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Aiming at the proton exchange membrane fuel cell air supply system subject to time-varying external load, system uncertainty and limited network communication resources, a chattering-free event-triggered nested adaptive terminal sliding mode controller is first developed to achieve the tracking control of oxygen excess ratio. First, an integral terminal sliding mode function with recursive structure is designed to eliminate the reaching phase of sliding mode control and ensure that the high-frequency switching term only appears in the first derivative of control law. Then, to alleviate the communication burden, an event-triggered control strategy is adopted for the controller-to-actuator channel. Furthermore, a nested dual-layer adaptive law is constructed to adaptively update the robust gain without overestimation, so as to counteract the composite disturbance composed of the lumped system uncertainty and event-triggering error, which does not require priori upper bounds of the composite disturbance and its derivative. Besides, it is theoretically proved that the output tracking error can converge to the origin in finite time and the Zeno behavior can be strictly excluded. Finally, the adaptability and superiority of the proposed event-triggered nested adaptive terminal sliding mode controller are fully validated by a series of numerical simulations and comparative analysis. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Government subsidy is a common practice in poverty alleviation. We used game theory and the mathematical model of operations management to investigate the efficiency of subsidy with different poverty scales when the firm owns the decision power of the wholesale price. Comparative analysis of the equilibrium solutions demonstrated the following results: Exclusive subsidy has a significant effect on the payoff of the poor farmer, but the dilemma is that the increase in the payoff of the poor farmer is against the payoff decrease of the regular farmer. Sharing subsidy has a counterbalancing effect on the payoff of the poor and regular farmers. Co-subsidy is the best for consumer surplus and social welfare, but it has little effect on improving the poor farmer’s payoff. Generally, when the poor farmers are in the majority, sharing subsidies or co-subsidy is more reasonable than exclusive subsidy. When the poor farmers are in the minority, exclusive or sharing subsidies will be more economical for the government than co-subsidy. Our research helps the government recognize that spending more money may achieve a poor result in poverty alleviation and help the firm realize that it is better to give more subsidies to the poor farmer than to itself. The highlights of the paper are as follows. Firstly, our work provides a new perspective in supply chain operations management with poverty alleviation by considering the participation of the poor and regular farmers together; secondly, the poverty scale is introduced into the mathematical model; thirdly, we pay attention to the impact of government subsidy to enterprise on the payoff of the poor farmer.</jats:p>"

Although the effect of terrigenous dilution on marine CaCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> has long been established, there is still a lack of quantitative assessment on how the terrigenous input shapes sedimentary CaCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> depth distribution features. In this study, we focus on the CaCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> depth distribution patterns on the seafloor in the Southeast Atlantic Ocean. Based on an up‐to‐date compilation of surficial sedimentary CaCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> content data and a simple conceptual model, the regional dilution effect of terrigenous supply from the African continent on the basinal sedimentary CaCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> depth distribution is quantified. Our results show that the flux of noncarbonate materials needed to reproduce the carbonate distribution decreases with distance to the African continent. The noncarbonate flux to pelagic sediment in the Southeast Atlantic Ocean is on the same order of magnitude of the dust deposition rate, while the flux to marginal sediment is intensified as a consequence of the fluvial discharge. Moreover, enhanced dissolution of CaCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> is found in marginal regions, which is due to faster rates of deep (boundary) currents than those in the pelagic ocean. These new insights help to distinguish the dilution impact from carbonate dissolution patterns and will advance research on land–ocean interaction and paleoclimate/environment reconstructions in ocean margins.</jats:p>",

In this work, the effects of increasing the fertilizer S and N concentration on volatile compound composition and odor and taste attributes of monovarietal VOOs of Istarska bjelica and Leccino cultivars were investigated. The volatile compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization and mass spectrometric detection after isolation by solid-phase microextraction, while sensory attributes were assessed by a professional panel. In all the investigated VOO samples, aldehydes were the most represented group of compounds, with (E)-2-hexenal as the most abundant, followed by (Z)-3-hexenal and 1-penten-3-one. Significant differences in the volatile profiles and sensory attributes were observed between VOOs from different treatments, mainly attributable to the interactions between all the factors that were investigated: treatment, cultivar, and year. Although significant interactions were noted for sensory attributes as well, the score for overall quality was generally lower for Leccino VOOs and for VOOs from both cultivars that were obtained after the highest SN dose treatment. All the samples were graded by overall sensory scores that were higher than eight and were characterized by well-pronounced fruitiness and the absence of sensory defects. The results of this study showed that foliar application of S and N significantly affects the quality of VOO, confirming that such a practice can modulate the characteristic olive oil odor and taste attributes and thus possibly influence its acceptability and preference among consumers.</jats:p>"

The objectives of the study were (1) to determine the discharge of AC waste water produced within 30 minutes and (2) to determine the effectiveness of the filter in reducing the pollutant content of AC waste water so that it is good for plant irrigation. The research was conducted by analyzing the quantity and quality of AC waste water in the CC Building, Muhammadiyah University of Jember. Parameters analyzed include hardness, pH and ammonia. One solution to sterilize AC wastewater is by using a sponge that is able to capture solids in the water before the water enters the container and activated charcoal which is considered to be able to reduce NH4 levels. One of the ingredients for making charcoal comes from coconut shells, which are relatively cheap. In addition to using coconut shell charcoal, exposure to UV rays is felt to reduce the bacteria contained in the AC water. UV light can function as a destroyer of bacteria and microorganisms so it is safe to use, both for living things and the environment. This study uses a descriptive qualitative   research with an evaluation approach which aims to determine the amount of air conditioning waste water within 30 minutes and to determine the physical and microbiological quality of AC waste water by analyzing the data and comparing it with the Minister of Health Regulation No. 32 of 2017 concerning Health Quality Standards for Sanitation, Swimming Pools, Solus Per Aqua and Public Baths. Data was collected by measuring the discharge of air conditioning, observation, interviews and documentation. The instrumentation used is a measuring cup, TDS meter, thermometer, turbidity meter, timer, sample bottle, Bunsen, alcohol and ice box. Based on the results of the examination of the quality of the AC wastewater with specifications of AC 1 PK, the results of the examination of physical and microbiological parameters that meet the requirements in accordance with the Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia No. 32 of 2017 concerning Health Quality Standards for Sanitation, Swimming Pools, Solus Per Aqua and Public Baths.</jats:p>",

The large-scale flooding causes not only direct damage but also indirect damage due to the closure of lifelines such as water, electricity, roads, and railways, and both impact the affected region’s resilience. Therefore, it is important to understand the current level of disaster resilience and consider non-structural measures accordingly to prepare for the next disastrous event. To assess current disaster resilience requires understanding how each building or lifeline structure is damaged in a disaster and the recovery time. In this study, water supply related facilities are selected from various kinds of lifelines, and a questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate facility damage and recovery after being affected by major flood events occurring in Japan after 2015. A comprehensive study on the damage and recovery of water supply related facilities due to flood has never been conducted, not only in Japan but also worldwide. This is because of difficulty in collecting enough data from many facilities, and thus, there have been reports of damage and recovery of an individual facility, but not more. However, occurrence of several severe flooding disasters in recent years in Japan made it possible to do so. This study dug into not only facility-level damage and recovery but also component level ones based on the quantity of data collected (97 components from 61 facilities) through the questionnaire survey. We found that control panels are most likely to be damaged by flood, and the number of days required for temporary recovery strongly depends on how quikly replacement equipment/parts for failed equipment can be procured.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Japan, fisheries’ product has decreased since the 1980s, and the government amended the fisheries law in 2020 to shift to managed fisheries. However, awareness of seafood sustainability is still low. This study identifies the reason for the low awareness and states the necessary actions to increase sustainable seafood consumption. The proactive stakeholders in seafood supply were surveyed to determine the current status of sustainable seafood sales. Marine Stewardship Council-certified fishers and MSC’s Chain-of-Custody certification holders answered the questionnaires. Fishers showed a positive attitude, citing proactive sales channel expansions and contributions to sustainability. Distributors were primarily passive, mainly because they obtained the certification at the request of their clients, and about half of them did not disseminate information between consumers and suppliers. Both fishers and distributors expect the government to promote campaigns and education. The stages of the awareness of producers, intermediary trade, and retailers are different and did not align. Therefore, if the supply chain stakeholders proactively educate themselves, choose sustainable products from the fishers, and pass the sustainability information to the consumers, sustainable seafood consumption would progress.</jats:p>"

The results indicate that the incoming flow rate and the storage water level have a great influence on the propagation time of the sediment peak, and the incoming flow rate has a large influence on the attenuation rate of the sediment peak while the storage water level and the incoming suspended sediment concentration have a small effect on the attenuation rate of the sediment peak. An empirical formula based on inflow rate, water level elevation, water depth and length and storage capacity of reservoirs was established to predict the lag time between the flood and sediment peaks. The asynchronous movement between the incoming flood and sediment peaks has a clear influence on the propagation characteristics of the sediment peak. The hysteresis effect of the flood and sediment peaks can be fully utilized by reservoir managers to reduce reservoir sedimentation and improve sedimentation distribution.</jats:p>",

This leads to a decrease in the strength properties of the soil and its support-coupling properties under the DM running systems and, as a result, leads to a violation of the irrigation process, which was the purpose of this study. To eliminate this drawback, the possibility of using and further using an improved flow regulator (membrane type) of the Valtec VT.085 brand is justified, for stable maintenance of the flow rates of sprinklers, trolleys and cantilever parts, within 1.8- 2.0 l/s, which corresponds to the technological process of watering this type of machines. The results of the study showed that the calculated control accuracy, namely the deviation from the steady-state pressure value at the outlet of the improved modification of the Valtec VT.085 flow regulator, is in the range of ± 5%, which meets the requirements of the irrigation process. It is noted that the experimental studies carried out to determine the throughput of the calculated water flow rate depending on the pressure indicated by the control devices, with outlet openings of different diameters, allowed us to establish that the most satisfying requirements for regulating the flow of sprinklers of the latest trolleys and the console part of the DM \"Kuban-LK1\" is an improved membrane-type control device. At the same time, the pressure regulator under study provides indicators for flow (Q = 1.6 – 1.7 l/s) and outlet pressure (P = 0.30 – 0.50 MPa) l / s, while maintaining the overall characteristics of its serial modification.</jats:p>",

The results revealed that the concentrations of heavy metals in surface water were much lower than the quality standards for surface water in China, and there were no significant differences in the natural reaches, center and tail of the reservoir. Cd in surface sediments was at a heavy contamination and high risk level, and the heavy metal pollution levels in the main streams and tributaries differed greatly, especially in the graded reservoirs with a gradual accumulation trend. This may be related to the fact that there were many fine-grained sediments in the reservoir center near the dam. Factor analysis-multiple linear regression (FA-MLR) revealed that heavy metals mainly come from natural factors and anthropogenic input, with anthropogenic inputs mainly coming from mining activities in the tributaries and industrial and agricultural activities in the main stream.</jats:p>",

The results demonstrate that the increase of pump head can be divided into two stages: lagging behind the increase of impeller speed and rapid increase of pump head. There is apparent interference between the two pumps, which not only affects the internal flow field distribution of the prefabricated pump station but also severely impacts the pump's performance. The transient impact during the pump start-up threatens the safety of the components of the prefabricated pump station, and the interaction between the pumps causes the pump to deviate from the design working condition. The investigation of results of the complex flow in the prefabricated pumping station during start-up is of great reference to improving the design of the prefabricated pumping station.</jats:p>",

New product development trajectories should consider the complexities of daily life eating situations. The creation of immersive contexts of a product with varying levels of appropriateness could be a useful tool for product developers in evaluating the extent to which context may influence food acceptance and eating behavior. This study explored virtual reality (VR) as an efficient context-enhancing technology through evaluations of protein-enriched rye breads and compared the effects of a VR-simulated congruent (VR restaurant) and incongruent (VR cinema) contexts on the acceptance in older consumers. A total of 70 participants were immersed in the two VR contexts and a neutral control context in a randomized order. The responses indicating the desire and liking for rye breads were measured, and the extent of immersion during context exposure was assessed by levels of the sense of presence and engagement. Immersive VR induced positive sensations of presence and a heightened level of engagement. The VR restaurant and neutral contexts were perceived as more appropriate for consuming rye breads and induced higher desire and liking for rye breads, which supported the notion of the alignment of congruent contexts with food desire and liking. The study provides new perspectives, practical methodologies, and discoveries in regard to the creation and application of VR-immersed contexts in food product evaluation. Moreover, it focused on a consumer segment (older consumers) that has seldom been investigated in previous relevant studies. The findings suggest that immersive VR technology, as a tool for evaluating contextual factors, is important for new product development. The good user experience among older consumers further indicated the potential value of VR as a context-enhancing tool for product development.</jats:p>"

This paper starts with land supply as an institutional source factor and discusses the impact of the regional differentiation of land supply on total factor productivity in China. Based on the panel data of 273 cities in China from 2003 to 2017, this paper measures total factor productivity (TFP) using the DEA-Malmquist index, decomposes it into technical progress (TE), pure technical efficiency (PE) and scale efficiency (SE), and analyzes the effect of the regional differentiation of land supply on TFP using the spatial Durbin model and mediating model. This study finds the following: (1) At the national level, the tilting of land supply to the central and western regions leads to a contradiction between land supply and demand, which hinders TFP by suppressing TE, PE and SE. (2) At the regional level, the reduction in land supply in the eastern region expands the technological substitution rate, induces the substitution effect of enterprise innovation, and thus promotes TE, but inhibits PE and SE under the resource constraint and congestion effect, which hinders the improvement of TFP. The estimates for the central and western regions are generally consistent with the national results; again, as land supply increases, this hinders TFP by suppressing TE, PE and SE. (3) In terms of the mechanism of influence, the decrease in land supply in the eastern region promotes TE and TFP by promoting urban innovation and inhibiting SE through productive services agglomeration; the increase in land supply in the central and western regions hinders TE and TFP by inhibiting urban innovation, and hinders SE through manufacturing agglomeration. The conclusion of this paper has great significance for deepening the structural reform of land supply and promoting high-quality economic development.</jats:p>"

The DEMATEL-ISM method, which combines Pythagorean fuzzy sets, was utilized to analyze the factors. The effectiveness of this framework was then verified via a case study. The results showed the following: the top six elements in terms of centrality were risk management level, inventory management, emergency response plan, visibility, environmental risk, and information technology level; all factors were divided into six levels: (1) factors in level 1 are surface direct influence factors, (2) factors in levels 2 to 5 are intermediate transfer factors, and (3) factors in level 6 are deep root factors. There are 4 root factors, namely, supplier level, environmental risk, information technology level, and visibility.

Recent earthquakes in Japan have prompted focus on the use of groundwater or disaster emergency wells (DEWs). Water supply networks are vulnerable to earthquakes because they comprise long-distance pipelines that are not always earthquake-resistant. Groundwater, however, can usually be found directly below an area where water is required and can serve as an alternative water source. Although previous studies discussed the importance of groundwater in relation to natural disasters, with special reference to drought, little attention has been given to the use of groundwater following earthquakes. In this study, two questionnaire surveys were conducted of DEW owners and welfare facilities for elderly people in Kumamoto (Japan), which was struck by an Mw 7.3 earthquake in 2016, to identify the advantages and disadvantages of using groundwater as an emergency water supply and ascertain policy issues to be resolved for making DEWs effective. Results showed that not only 30 DEWs but also at least 25 privately owned wells not registered as DEWs were open to the public in the early restoration stage, improving people’s access to water and decreasing the burden on the Kumamoto city government’s emergency water supply. However, it was revealed that groundwater might not always be potable owing to quality concerns. Additionally, only a limited number of welfare facilities used the available adjacent DEWs and DEW recognition level remains low. These findings indicate that improving information disclosure regarding emergency groundwater use is a policy issue to be resolved.</jats:p>",

Compared with the model defining water supply and ecological flow requirements as constraints, a novel long-term multi-objective scheduling model in complex parallel reservoir system (LTMOSCPRS) is developed to assess and achieve win–win and sustainable development for energy, water supply, and ecological benefits. The suitable and ideal ecological water requirements are calculated based on the requirement level index. Afterward, the novel multi-objective shuffled frog leaping algorithm (NMOSFLA) including renewed frog grouping, local search, and external elite frog set mutation strategies is proposed. Results indicate that three optimization objectives expose a mutual competing relationship. The benefit of the river ecosystem will increase at a loss of PG and water supply guarantee rate (WSGR). Therefore, the parallel reservoir system should be adjusted to improve the benefits of WSGR and ecological water spill and shortage (EWSS) with minimizing the loss of PG, simultaneously. Finally, the NMOSFLA is verified to outperform other compared methods at the solution diversity and convergence which is evaluated by multiple indicators. Overall, the NMOSFLA provides efficient reservoir operation schemes for decision-makers to select optimal trade-off schemes and feasible ways to solve the LTMOSCPRS.</jats:p>",

To provide scientific support for the land-use planning and regional ecological restoration to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the Loess Plateau from 1992 to 2015, this study proposes an integrated assessment framework for assessing the supply – demand match and equilibrium of ES combining potential relationships between landscape alterations, ES, and sustainable development at the county and regional scales. Results show that more than 85% of local counties have a supply – demand mismatch in terms of ecosystem services. Supply – demand distributions for provisioning and supporting services were relatively balanced compared to cultural services, which were imbalanced. Although the overall supply – demand relationship is relatively balanced because of the significant influence of ecological restoration, it shows an increasing trend toward imbalance as human – land conflict is prominent in some regions. SDGs emphasize on specific ES information such as ecosystem conservation, sustainable agriculture, and urban construction. Furtherly, positive impacts from landscape dynamics can improve the supply capacity of the ES and contribute to regional sustainability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rapid urbanization in mega-urban agglomerations disturbs the balance of carbon storage supply and demand (CSD) and constrains the achievement of sustainable development goals. Here, we developed a socio-ecological system (SES) framework coupled with ecosystem services (ES) cascade and DPSIR model to systematically analyze the impacts and responses of urbanization affecting CSD. We quantified urbanization and CSD using multi-source remote sensing data, such as land use and night lighting, together with related socio-economic data, such as total energy consumption, population and GDP. We found that from 2000 to 2020, the urbanization of Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) led to a decrease of 2.75% in carbon storage supply and an increase of 226.45% in carbon storage demand. However, carbon storage supply was still larger than carbon storage demand, and the spatial mismatch of CSD is the most important problem at present. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the response measures from the comprehensive perspective of SES. We identified key ecological conservation areas using a Marxan model to protect the carbon storage capacity in ecological subsystems, and promoted a carbon compensation scheme based on both the grandfather principle and the carbon efficiency principle, reconciling the contradiction between ecological conservation and socio-economic development in the social subsystem. Finally, this study quantified the threshold of urbanization based on the carbon neutrality target at which CSD reaches an equilibrium state. This study proposed a SES framework, and a set of methodologies to quantify the relationship between urbanization and CSD, which will help mega-urban agglomerations to promote harmonious development of urbanization and ecological conservation and to achieve the carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets proposed by the Chinese government.</jats:p>"

Several species of this family are known for their pharmacological and beneficial properties to human health, mainly attributed to flavonoids. The objective of this work was to carry out an integrative review in order to identify the main flavonoids found in some plant parts belonging to the Annona genus: araticum tree (Annona crassiflora Mart.), graviola tree (Annona muricata), atemoya tree (Annona cherimolia Mill × Annona squamosa L.), pinha tree (Annona squamosa), bananinha tree (Annona leptopetala), and marolinho tree (Annona coriacea). Only articles published between the years 2016 to 2021 that answered the guiding question were considered, in order to obtain recent data. Then, search strategies were designated for each database used: Science Direct, CAPES Periodicals, and Scielo. Most of the studies retrieved from the databases are related to fruits. The results showed that the number of flavonoids identified varies according to the analytical methodology used to identify and quantify the compounds. Quercetin was the most commonly found compound in all fruits of the Annona genus studied, and epicatechin, rutin, and kaempferol were also found to a lesser extent. The presence of these compounds in Annona makes the fruit promising, with potential applicability in the pharmaceutical and food industry.</jats:p>"
