Formerly it was not easy to control AC voltage and current as vector quantities. In AC power supplies called variable-voltage constant-frequency (VVCF) or variable-voltage variable-frequency (VVVF), only one or two AC quantities are controlled. The control was a scalar control, and its application was mostly limited to AC motor speed control. Advancement of the semiconductor inverter has made it possible to control variables of the AC power supply as vector quantities. As a result, AC motor control has made remarkable progress. In the preceding chapters, the analysis and control theories of AC motors, which had been considerably lacking, have been treated and supplemented. Now AC power supply will be explained.</jats:p>",

It is used as a foundation for the analysis of a typical supply chain for a personal computer. Attention is focused on the published dynamic behavior associated with the electronic components echelon. The shortage/surplus behavior characteristic of the echelon and exemplified by the “bookings‐to‐billings” ratio is explained using a causal loop model. A pragmatic approach to the reduction in on‐costs achieved by redesign is presented and illustrated by comparing the relative merits of a number of suggested improvement strategies. Many of the features highlighted are applicable to the majority of electronic product supply chains; particularly the prominent role of multinational companies and the global nature of material supply. The establishment of much improved buyer‐supplier relationships is seen as an essential component in achieving improved supply chain design and operations.</jats:p>",

Thirty‐four diverse genotypes were grown for two seasons (1984–1985 and 1985–1986) at three locations varying in water supply, in northern Syria and Lebanon. At one location (Tel Hadya, Syria), the crop was given two supplementary irrigation regimes.

This characterization technique utilizes p-polarized light incident at the Brewster angle, which virtually eliminates the bulk contribution of the reflected light. It was found that the reflection intensity varied by several percent depending on the source gas supply sequence. This reflection intensity was constant during continuous GaCl supply, which corresponded to the self-limiting mechanism of chloride ALE. Optical reflection spectra were measured in the range of 300–800 nm during the flow of each source gas. The normalized spectra of reflection difference between GaCl and AsH3 supply depended on the incidence azimuth, which showed the existence of anisotropic surface bonds. By comparing these spectra to the reference data using triethylgallium as a Ga source, the GaAs surface under GaCl exposure was assumed to be a Ga-stabilized surface at 520 °C.</jats:p>",

Decomposition of sediment organic matter was evaluated under varying levels of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Bulk sediment samples obtained from a hypereutrophic lake in central Florida were incubated in stirred microcosms at 25°C for 100 d at four O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> levels.

Redox potential (Eh) measurements indicated that the two highest O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> levels (i.e., 2.0 and 20.0% O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) resulted in oxidizing conditions (Eh &gt; 400 mV), whereas the lowest O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> levels (0 and 0.2% O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) resulted in reduced conditions (Eh &lt; −300 mV).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A new method has been developed for the feedback stabilization of a microwave power supply, with the intent to reduce emission noise in microwave-induced plasma atomic emission spectrometry (MIP-AES). The control method would be applicable to any microwave generator whose output power is affected by the input ac line voltage. In the feedback process, the effective line voltage is adjusted by means of a controllable inductance placed in series with a variable transformer at the input of the generator. In turn, this inductance is controlled by selecting the dc current in the primary winding of an auxiliary transformer, so the inductance in its secondary winding is altered. The long-term stability of the feedback-controlled system is verified and the range of stabilization is examined. Noise in the power output of the microwave generator is shown to be reduced at frequencies below 1.5 Hz. Although stable microwave power generation does not necessarily result in stable emission from a microwave-induced plasma source, an emission-based feedback signal is shown to improve the stability. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Policies for energy and the environment in Europe were previously the preserve of national governments, but the Commission of the European Community has gained a role in both policy areas in the past few years. This was due to the 1987 Single European Act which, in effect, extends the writ of competition law throughout the energy and other previously \"excluded\" sectors, the desire to reduce acid rain and greenhouse gas emissions, and reaffirms Europe's renewed concern for long-term oil and gas supply security after the Gulf War and the disintegration of the USSR. The Commission's proposals for the unified internal energy market were driven by concern for competition and free market forces, and seemed to exclude any scope for long-term policy considerations. This paper argues that the implementation of those proposals will be uneven and protracted, and that the Commission's more recent proposals for reducing CO2 emissions and the European Energy Charter appear to mark positive steps towards a long-term strategy for a clean environment, energy efficiency, and oil and gas supply security. </jats:p>",

This study was conducted to evaluate the cultivar differences of spring barley (<jats:italic>Hordeum vulgare</jats:italic> L.) in CGR and GD in respect to a varied N supply and seeding rates. Ten randomly chosen two rows spring barley cultivars were tested in field studies at three levels of nitrogen fertilization (0 to 130 kg N/ha) and each three sowing rates (200 to 500 caryopses m<jats:sup>‐2</jats:sup>) in 1986 to 1988. The field studies were conducted on a sandy loam at Hohenschulen, Northern Germany. Beginning from three and four leaf stage, respectively, to physiological maturity, plant samples were harvested on a twice‐weekly basis. From fitted cubic polynomial equations the CGR and GD were calculated. Cultivars showed significant differences in GD while the observed differences in CGR were not significant. Within the tested variation of N‐levels an increase of N resulted in an increase of CGR, while increasing seeding rates led to decreasing CGR. GD differences were not detected for the N‐levels and seeding rates. Regarding all interactions the cultivar × year and cultivar × N × year interactions (except GD) were important. Biomass and grain yield of cultivars were correlated to GD and not to CGR.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Zusammenfassung</jats:title><jats:p>Wachstumsraten und ‐dauern von Sommergerstensorten unter Berücksichtigung von N‐Düngung und Aussaatstärken</jats:p><jats:p>Der Ertrag kann neben einer Aufteilung in die Ertragskomponenten auch als Produkt von Ernteindex mal oberirdischer Biomasse aufgefaßt werden. Die Biomasse wiederum läßt sich als Produkt von durchschnittlicher Wachstumsrate mal Wachstumsdauer darstellen. In dieser Untersuchung wurde die genetische Variation in der Wachstumsrate und Wachstumsdauer anhand von Sortenunterschieden bei Sommergerste unter Berücksichtigung von variierten N‐Düngungsmengen und Aussaatstärken erfaßt. Zehn zufällig ausgesuchte zweizeilige Sommergerstensorten wurden in Freilandversuchen unter drei N‐Düngungsmengen (0 bis 130 kg N/ha) und jeweils drei Aussaatstärken (200 bis 500 Karyopsen m<jats:sup>‐2</jats:sup>) von 1986 bis 1988 geprüft. Die Versuche wurden auf Ho‐henschulen, einem Standort mit sandigem Lehm in Norddeutschland, durchgeführt. Beginnend von dem 3‐ bzw. 4‐Blattstadium wurden bis zur physiologischen Reife zweimal wöchentlich Proben gezogen. Die Wachstumsraten und ‐dauern wurden von den Gleichungen der durchgeführten Polynomapproximation dritten Grades errechnet. Es bestanden signifikante Sortenunterschiede in den Wachstumsraten, während für die Wachstumsraten die beobachteten Unterschiede nicht abgesichert werden konnten. Steigende N‐Düngermengen führten zu steigenden Wachstumsraten. Dem‐hingegen sanken die Wachstumsraten bei steigenden Aussaatstärken. Unterschiede in der Wachstumsdauer wurden für die N‐ und Aussaatstärkenvariation nicht festgestellt. Von den Interaktionen waren die Sorten X Jahres‐ und Sorten X N X Jahres‐(Ausnahme Wachstums‐dauer)‐Interaktionen bedeutend. Die Biomasse und der Karyopsenertrag der Sorten war mit der Wachstumsdauer, aber nicht mit der Wachstumsrate korreliert.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
