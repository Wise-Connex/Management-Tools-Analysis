The climate change contributes to the acuteness of the problem, with dryer areas in some parts of the world and severe floods and rains in other parts. The European Water Supply and Sanitation Technology Platform (WSSTP) is an industry driven organisation aiming to strengthen the potential for technological innovation and the competitiveness of the European Water Industry but is also a response to global challenges and regional demands to ensure safe, secure and sustainable water and sanitation services for the benefit of industry, the society and the environment. The supply of electrical energy has to be carefully considered as a pre-requisite for water supply and sanitation. The production of biogas can be significantly increased by using instrumentation and control. The use of monitoring and control has wide consequences for safe and reliable water supply and sanitation.</jats:p>",

To see regional differences in water supply, a cross-country comparison based on five benchmarking projects of Austria and different German federal states was done. It was verified that the influencing factors on costs are mainly related to regional and structural parameters, causing the crosscountry differences. Besides the age of the mains, urbanity is one of the major influencing factors on burst rates, leakage, and also on mains rehabilitation. The survey on the benefits of benchmarking suggests that it more than pays for itself. Most participants found opportunities to optimize operation and efficiency. No company stated higher costs than benefits. Benchmarking does not only optimize efficiency, but more importantly, quality, reliability and sustainability of supply services.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A number of natural coagulants from plants or animal origin can be effectively used for the treatment of drinking water. Some are used at household levels in traditional systems using crude (non-purified) extract. In the crude extract form, natural coagulants release organic and nutrient loads to the water resulting in poor treated water quality. In such cases it becomes necessary to purify the coagulant component from the crude extract before using it for water treatment. This paper discusses an effective and simple purification of the coagulant from Moringa oleifera seed using an ion exchange method that would overcome the drawbacks of natural coagulants. The impact of the purification process on reducing organic and nutrient release was studied. Adsorption and elution parameters of the ion exchange process were optimised. The study indicated that the purified protein has effective coagulation activity and it did not release organic and nutrient loads to the water. Compared to other purification methods used in previous studies, this is simple and of comparatively lower cost. This purification method can be readily scaled up and applied even in remote parts of developing countries. This work suggests that the concerns of natural coagulants can be overcome by simple purification and this is believed to promote their use in drinking water treatment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The meaning of money supply in an arrow sense is currency and demand deposits. In Oman, it has increased very slowly till 1970 and then started to increase broadly till now. This increment is due to the development of the oil exports, so that the share of its currency becomes more than 50% of its money supply in the narrows sense during the period 1973‐2000. But this percentage started decreasing since 2001 compared with demand deposits. The econometric analysis concluded that there is a ppositive relationship between money supply and such independent variables as gross domestic production, government deficit, international reserves and oil export. It was also concluded that there is a positive relationship between money supply in the wide sense and oil export. The monetary indicators showed that the net domestic credit allowed to the private sector and the net foreign assets of the banking system are the main factors that positively affect money supply. It was also noted that the quasi money such as time deposits, saving deposits, capital account and reserve account has negatively affected money supply during the period 1974‐2003.</jats:p>",

Molecular ozone reacts at unsaturated sites of natural organic matter (NOM) to produce smaller oxygenated molecules including carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. The elucidation of the nature and precise identity of these ozonation by-products is hindered by two complicating factors. The first is the inherent aqueous solubility of many of these compounds, which renders their efficient extraction from water difficult to achieve. Second is the lack of established identity of specific potential by-products, which complicates targeted analytical approaches. To address these challenges, we have approached the task of by-product identification by methods involving aqueous functional group-specific derivatisation reactions. A range of carbonyl byproducts were identified during laboratory-scale testing. These ranged in size from formaldehyde up to 7-carbon species with multiple carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups.</jats:p>",

Since then many studies have been undertaken to investigate the removal of MTBE from water. Other ethers which are under discussion as substitutes for MTBE have lately been developed and have to be assessed for their relevance for drinking water production. The present study shows that ethers used as oxygenates in fuel are not easily eliminated by advanced treatment technologies. Neither pure ozonation nor UV irradiation results in a significant concentration decline. The formation of highly reactive OH radicals is necessary to yield a decisive removal of the ethers from water. The application of combined UV/H2O2 or UV/ozone showed in all cases good results. The findings of the lab-scale experiments are verified by measurements in waterworks which have trace concentrations of MTBE in their raw water. Though the elimination process is better with the ethers under discussion as substitutes for MTBE, the removal efficiency is still very low compared to many other substances. A small improvement could be achieved by the substitution but in the end no real progress is made. Therefore, from the point of view of water suppliers the use of other ethers as a substitute for MTBE is posing the same problems as with MTBE.</jats:p>",

In this respect, the virtual enterprise approach and a holistic view of an enterprise's supply chain come into play. Nowadays, a company is as reliable and efficient as the weakest link in its supply chain. An unhampered product and information flow among the supply chain nodes and a capability for backtracking are required, raising the need for Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), Business-to-Business (B2B) integration and interoperability in between the intra-enterprise and trans-enterprise heterogeneous information systems. This paper suggests how the increasingly important role of South and East Asian markets in the globalization era can be amplified by the use of the latest EAI technologies that facilitate the bonding of even the most diverse information systems. In turn, European markets already adopting such technologies can benefit and forge closely-knit relationships with their South and East Asian counterparts.</jats:p>",

The decentralized water strategies including science, regulations, training, government policies, and funding for some of the developing countries in Asian region are reviewed. There are two primary ways or paths of meeting water-related needs; one the “hard” path, and the other “soft” path that complements mainly decentralized and open decision-making, application of efficient technology, and environmental protection. One of the soft path decentralized solution being implemented in many developing countries of Asia is small scale rainwater harvesting and management and both government and non-government sectors are promoting the practice on a regional community and family basis. Overall, the paper aims to contribute to the ongoing development of environmentally sound and economically viable approaches to water management in the developing world.</jats:p>",

Current urban water management concepts and practices cannot adequately respond to these changes. There is need for water professionals to change the way they manage water resources in urban areas if we are to ensure economic and environmental sustainability. In addition to consideration of supply-side options, we need to apply water demand management (WDM) tools both on the utility and end-user sides. This paper describes the basic concepts of WDM, provides a case study of their application in Bahrain, and briefly introduces the five-year EU-funded SWTCH Project that aims at creating a paradigm shift in urban water management practices.</jats:p>",

Innovative research sampling methods were selected to great effect. The method selected was saturation surveying, a process whereby all identifiable target respondents are surveyed. Instead of selecting between sampling techniques, the option of saturation surveying, cheaply available electronically, removes the focus from the decision to either sample probabilistically or not. Instead, as the entire universe can be contacted in a cost effective manner, the sampling frame becomes of paramount importance. Thus, the focus then shifts from accurately selecting respondents from the sampling frame towards enhancing the sampling frame itself. The sampling frame was improved through guidance from the literature. Findings: The paper demonstrates that this research approach was successful in that it generated a high response rate, suggesting great involvement amongst the supplier population in the topic at hand. It also indicates a lessening of non-response bias, as the response rate is more than double that of previous research into the area. Implications: This paper presents a comprehensive approach to researching ethics in buyer-seller relations. It further promotes the effective use of new sampling methods enabled by the Internet when directed towards selective populations. Originality/Value: The novel approach of sampling frame enhancement twined with saturation surveying has exciting implications for business research. The expansion of the sampling frame to a wider audience of suppliers has long been noted as necessary although not actioned. Furthermore, in terms of the little-studied nature of buyer-seller relations, the verification of the scale developed by Bendixon and Abratt (2007) affirms the robustness of this measure for ethics research. </jats:p>"

This development has made it</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>possible to rationalise design and production of knitted garments so that today it is</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>possible to make a knitted garment, almost ready made, directly in the knitting machine,</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>with a minimum of processes, such as cutting and sewing. The objective of this paper is</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>to explain and give examples of how this new knitting production technology could be</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>implemented in a fast fashion logistic system. The method for this paper is an inductive</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>approach based on a literature survey. The new technical achievements have not meant</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>the great breakthrough that was expected. Why? Many companies moved their</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>production to development countries where the costs ofproduction, mainly labour costs</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>are lower than in western countries. Another reason is that it is not enough to invest in</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>new machinery and then use the machines in the same production system as before. To</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>gain the benefits of this technique the production processes in the company have to be</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>changed and adapted to these new conditions. The lack of knowledge in supply chain</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>design and a one-sided perspective on production costs, instead of a customer orientated</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>one, is one explanation. This, in a business (fashion) where the demand is changing dayby-</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:italic>day and the short time to market is vital to a company’s ability to be competitive.

This suggests serious distortion of water cycle which can be attributed to urbanization. Feasibility analysis of reuse scenarios such as rainwater use and wastewater reuse was then performed to examine their influences on improving the water cycle.

Hence there is a need for inexpensive and easy methods to purify drinking water. The objective of this research is to screen different plant seeds to find a primary natural coagulant able to reduce the turbidity of the drinking water. The protein from 21 different seeds was extracted with water and salt solution and coagulation properties in synthetic clay solution were studied. The crude extract of Moringa oleifera (MO) showed the same coagulation activity as that of alum. The protein from red bean, sugar maize and red maize were promising in having coagulation activity, compared with a known coagulant protein from MO. These seeds were selected and purified to homogeneity with fast flow Sepharose ion exchange chromatography and the properties of the purified proteins were characterized. The characteristics of these coagulant proteins are different from MO protein based on molecular weight and ionic determinations. The coagulant proteins were temperature tolerant and can withstand temperature of around 85 °C and maintain the coagulation activity. The seeds identified as a coagulant source could be used as an alternative to chemicals for drinking water clarification.</jats:p>",

A short-term production-planning model can aid in formulating an operational policy that satisfies contractual rules and customer requirements while simultaneously meeting specified production levels. Such an operational planning model with two components, an infrastructure model and a contractual model, is presented in this work. The infrastructure model is a representation of the physical system that incorporates nonlinear pressure-flowrate relationships for wells and pipelines, multiple qualities of gas in the trunkline network and models of facilities. The contractual model is a mathematical representation of the complex production-sharing contracts, associated operational rules and customer requirements. The model features and requirements are inspired by the Sarawak Gas Production System (SGPS) in East Malaysia. The final formulation is a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program and is solved with GAMS/BARON to global optimality. A hierarchical multi-objective case study is also presented.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Natural gas demand has been rising rapidly in recent years with the increasing energy needs of an expanding global economy, especially in emerging markets. The primary drivers for this growth are industrial use and electricity generation. Also, high oil prices have made Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) an attractive option for exploiting remote fields.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Natural gas production forecasting tools tend to be concerned with quite different issues than oil production. Natural gas is inherently difficult to store and transport, requiring extensive pipeline networks for transport and natural geological formations to store or, alternatively, massive capital investment in the form of LNG facilities for liquefaction, transport, storage and regasification. This has led to the practice of extensive contractual arrangements between producers and consumers to reduce risk. However, this has been achieved at the expense of increased complexity in production system operations. The involvement of multiple parties in ownership of fields and facilities further complicates operations because, in such a situation, several parties have a share in the products. This coupled with the fact that natural gas networks directly handle products that are to be shared (as opposed to oil production systems) imply that any production-sharing scheme explicitly affects network operations.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In this work, we use the Sarawak Gas Production System in East Malaysia to demonstrate the operational issues associated with natural gas production systems. The paper is organized as follows. A brief introduction to the SGPS is presented. The nature of the mathematical programming problems that arise from natural gas production-planning models is then briefly discussed, followed by the salient model requirements. The production-forecasting model is then summarized. Finally, numerical solution of the model and an application to a hierarchical multi-objective situation that frequently arises in such systems are discussed.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Previous Works</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The oil and natural gas industry has been one of the pioneers in the use of mathematical programming for planning and forecasting applications.

Experiments with submerged membranes (lab- and pilot- scale modules) showed that there was a clear correlation between DOC concentration of the feed and the flux decline: when the DOC-concentration increased, the flux decline increased. Additionally, the presence of calcium led not only to an important flux decline but to high adsorption of NOM on the membrane surface. Iron concentrations in the micromolar range resulted in a considerably decline of flux. Filtration of SFBW revealed that the decline of permeability is mainly determined by DOC, calcium and iron concentrations.

They affect the growth rate through three channels ‐ total factor productivity, investment and aggregate demand. We find that apart from government investment, all government expenditures have negative marginal effects on productivity and GDP growth. In particular, a 1 percentage point increase in the share of government consumption in GDP reduces the equilibrium GDP growth rate by 0.216 percentage points, while the same increase in government investment raises the growth rate by 0.167 percentage points. This suggests that a reallocation of 1 percentage point of government consumption to government investment can raise the growth rate by 0.38 percentage points.</jats:p>",

In terms of innovation type, purchasing managers reported much more activity on ecological process innovation than on product or organisational innovation. Few purchasing managers initiate ecological innovation in supply themselves, although they can play a range of supporting roles, not least lobbying for internal acceptance of supplier innovations. Among the motives for undertaking such initiatives, cost advantages, corporate reputation, supply chain pressure and legal requirements dominate. While making a significant contribution, the role of purchasing managers in ecological innovation is thus, at the same time, somewhat limited. To an extent, these limitations can be explained by a lag between the technological innovations purchasing managers can induce in their supply chains and a lack in organisational innovation in the rules and practices that govern their own work.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study conflict and cooperation issues in supply chain manufacturing. Consider an assembly system where suppliers provide parts to a manufacturer. A product cannot be delivered until all its parts have been supplied. The manufacturer performs nonbottleneck operations, for example, outsourced assembly, packaging, and delivery for each product. Two classical scheduling objectives are considered: minimization of the total completion time and of the maximum lateness. We analyze how far from optimal the best schedule for a suppliers' scheduling problem can be for the corresponding manufacturer's problem, and vice versa. To resolve these conflicts, we consider four alternative scenarios for the relative bargaining power of the suppliers and the manufacturer, and in each case describe a practical mechanism for cooperation between the decision makers. Evaluating the cost of conflict and the benefit of cooperation in these scenarios requires the solution of various scheduling problems by the suppliers, the manufacturer, and the overall system. For all these scheduling problems, we provide either an efficient algorithm or a proof of intractability. Moreover, for two problems that we show are intractable, we describe heuristics and analyze their worst case performance or demonstrate asymptotic optimality of their solutions. We demonstrate computationally that the cost saving realized by cooperation between the decision makers is significant in many cases. Extensions of our models to consider bottleneck operations at the manufacturer and transportation times are also developed. </jats:p>",

Black water reuse through ‘sewer mining’ or onsite treatment, proposes to be one initiative that may possibly offer a viable and sustainable alternative approach to water provision in many contexts. However, despite the potential benefits of black water reuse, its feasibility is not yet fully understood. In particular, there is much uncertainty surrounding the following issues: (1) community acceptance, (2) policy complexities, (3) performance impacts of these localised systems, and (4) environmental balance over the full life cycle. This paper outlines research needs surrounding black water reuse with a focus on these four major issues. The paper presents a research agenda to address these important issues. This research agenda involves two Australian commercial case studies: the Council House 2 building in Melbourne, and the Bendigo Bank building in Bendigo.</jats:p>",

The evolution in TMP could be modeled using a simple exponential relationship that incorporated the impact of the air sparging intensity, the membrane module configuration and the backwash cycles on the evolution in TMP. The extent of reversible fouling was a function of the operating permeate flux and the hydrodynamic conditions in the membrane system and could be characterized based on the difference between the operating permeate flux and the critical permeate flux. Reversible fouling could be eliminated during each backwash cycle. The extent of irreversible fouling was relatively low and was expected to be a function of the diffusion and adsorption tendency of foulants within the membrane pores.</jats:p>",

The supply network has two basic building blocks: The dynamics in a supplier is governed by a PDE and the behavior inside a queue is described by an ODE. The network model provides a framework to couple these equations at nodes. We introduce controls at so‐called dispersing nodes and discuss suitable cost functionals leading to optimal control problems which we solve by a projected gradient method. The gradient information can be obtained from adjoint equations which we derive in the context of our supply network model. (© 2008 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim)</jats:p>",

Known as “power by the hour” in the private sector and as “performance-based logistics” (PBL) in defense contracting, it aims to replace traditionally used fixed-price and cost-plus contracts to improve product availability and reduce the cost of ownership by tying a supplier's compensation to the output value of the product generated by the customer (buyer). </jats:p><jats:p> To analyze implications of performance-based relationships, we introduce a multitask principal-agent model to support resource allocation and use it to analyze commonly observed contracts. In our model the customer (principal) faces a product availability requirement for the “uptime” of the end product. The customer then offers contracts contingent on availability to n suppliers (agents) of the key subsystems used in the product, who in turn exert cost reduction efforts and set spare-parts inventory investment levels. We show that the first-best solution can be achieved if channel members are risk neutral. When channel members are risk averse, we find that the second-best contract combines a fixed payment, a cost-sharing incentive, and a performance incentive. Furthermore, we study how these contracts evolve over the product deployment life cycle as uncertainty in support cost changes. Finally, we illustrate the application of our model to a problem based on aircraft maintenance data and show how the allocation of performance requirements and contractual terms change under various environmental assumptions. </jats:p>",

Due to soil characteristics and agricultural activities in the catchment area, pH of lower than 5.5 is common to the river, particularly in the stretch where the water intake point is located. However, at times, Bekok River registered low pH of less than 3.5 and hence caused problems to the treatment plants. The cost to neutralise the water increased and treatment scheduling became more complicated. A preliminary laboratory scale study has been conducted to determine the viability of using an open limestone channel as an in-situ pH treatment in the river. Two sets of experiments using synthetic and actual raw waters with various sizes and amount of limestone were carried out. Results indicate the viability of the process. Depending on the initial pH and acidity of the raw water, the pH can rise to 6.0 within 30 minutes of contact time. The amount and size of limestone was found to play an important role in minimising the contact time.</jats:p>",

Water from the Guadalquivir River dock, which circulates through this network, is meant for irrigation of the green areas and for the air conditioning of the buildings in the Cartuja 93 Science and Technology Park. The results of this study have highlighted that in the biological colonization of the distribution network three exotic invasive species are involved: the bivalves Mytilopsis leucophaeata and Corbicula fluminea, along with the hydrozoan Cordylophora caspia. The colonization is principally registered at the beginning of the network in the pumping station facilities. The C. caspia and M. leucophaeata have experienced the biggest growth, and the hydrozoan has had the biggest effect on the distribution network. The biological growth in the network has been tackled in two ways: (1) eliminating the existing colonization i.e. acting on the adult specimens while manually cleaning the larger diameter pipes and (2) preventing new outbreaks by using a non-oxidizing and fast hydrolysing biocide and using a TBT-free anti-fouling paint.</jats:p>",

It also aims at clarifying the factors contributing to the disruption of the policy formulated by the Japanese and the Filipinos on the island. It is apparent in this study that the political and social characteristics in the province as well as the agricultural depression inherited from the American colonisation period brought about an outcome, which was different from the policy implemented in Manila.</jats:p>",

This paper brings together some of the limited examples of evaluation studies undertaken, providing details of both the statistical analysis method used and the findings of such studies undertaken by the Institute for Sustainable Futures (ISF) on behalf of water utilities. The studies include measurement of water savings in the residential and non-residential sectors and economic assessment of implemented programs. The paper highlights the importance of evaluation and need for embedding evaluation into the water planning process. It also highlights additional research currently being undertaken in this field associated with pressure reduction and energy usage when implementing DM programs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In modern water distribution systems, pumping accounts for a large portion of the costs; therefore, water utilities need to reduce the pumping cost. The purpose of this study was to reduce and optimize the pumping costs. The study area was composed of one filtration plant, five reservoirs and 3 pumping stations. The IP (Integer programming) method used for the optimization, as it gave a global solution, with the pump controlled as either on or off. It is necessary to correctly forecast the hourly water demand to obtain an IP solution as both the optimized pumping schedule and low limitation of the reservoir are dependent on this factor. Therefore, three methods (time index, multiple regression + time index &amp; Fourier series + transfer ARIMA) were compared to forecast the hourly water demand. As a result of these comparisons, the multiple regression + time index model was selected. The low limitation of the reservoir was also determined depending on the correction of the hourly water demand model. The optimization of pumping in the water distribution system had previously been simulated for 3 months using the IP. As a result of this simulation, it was found that the pumping cost could be reduced by 12.2%∼38.7%.</jats:p>",

However, the fouling potential by organic matter should also be accurately evaluated as the productivity loss by organic fouling is often more severe than particle fouling, despite its low concentration in feed water. This study was performed to investigate the influence of organic characteristics and feed water solution chemistry on the membrane fouling index, such as the silt density index (SDI). The results showed that the feed solution chemistry (i.e. pH, ionic strength and hardness) affected the SDI values of organic rich feed water to some degree. In addition, Aldrich humic acid (AHA) exhibited higher fouling potential by SDI than Suwannee river humic acid (SRHA), emphasising the importance of organic properties. Lastly, it is shown that although SDI values measured were the same, the degree of NOM fouling was significantly different for the membranes with different surface properties.</jats:p>",

Water consumption patterns were analyzed to configure the water demand trends for social and cultural factors. Economic factors such as monthly income and the area of the floor plan were investigated to determine the impact of resident wealth on the patterns of water consumption. Water use data collected by a public water resources management firm in Korea, Kwater, had been filtered using both physical and probabilistic criteria to improve the credibility of the analysis. Both the Mann-Kendall and Spearman's Rho tests were used to perform the trend analysis. Distinct factors in the patterns of water consumption can be determined to cause both increasing and decreasing trends in water use.

This paper presents the findings from a Delphi study where experts were asked to contribute their opinion. The Delphi study allows an aggregation of these opinions and extracts underlying topics in a structured manner. Four major topics were identified, which are (1) pressures and incentives for sustainable supply chain management, (2) identifying and measuring impacts on sustainable supply chain management, (3) supplier management (particularly addressing issues at the supplier–buyer interface) and (4) supply chain management (dealing with issues across all companies involved in the supply chain).

To this end, 36 indicators of the condition of Korean wastewater utilities were chosen, and then divided into four categories, namely: facilities, maintenance, management efficiency and environmental effects. The wastewater utilities of 48 Korean cities were allocated scores for each category based on their pertinent conditions. Through a cluster analysis, these cities were then subdivided into eight groups based on their individual scores for each category. From the cluster analysis, V and IV groups were found to be very good in all categories, I and II groups were average, III and VII groups required a bigger budget in the facilities category, IV group required a bigger budget in the maintenance category, and VIII group needed a bigger budget for both the facilities and maintenance categories.

This study used a genetic algorithm(GA) to accurately reflect the SWMM output of each parameter set for the parameter optimization and to reduce the possibility of local optimum solution. To integrate the SWMM and GA, subroutines in the SWMM source code were modified. A developed program was applied to the Jangcheon catchment in Youngrang Lake watershed. Parameters that sensitively affected the runoff flow and water quality calculation were determined using the GA. For runoff flow calculation, eight parameters in the runoff block and one parameter in the transport block were calibrated. Four parameters in the runoff block were also calibrated for the water quality calculation. The validated SWMM then estimated the runoff pollutant loads flowing into Youngrang Lake discharged from the Jangcheon catchment.</jats:p>",

The interconnected growth of contracting, multiple food retailers, imposition of private standards and foreign direct investment have contributed to the internationalization of agri-food markets in the CEE–CIS region. The restructuring of supply chains is profoundly affecting the opportunities available to farmers in CEE and the CIS. The paper advocates that public support to the agricultural sector should be geared to enabling domestic farmers to have access to restructured food supply chains, in contrast to much of the assistance to develop market infrastructure in the 1990s, which was geared to commodity spot markets, which in many cases are now in decline. </jats:p>",

Applying these techniques to data from the National Electricity Market in Australia reveals statistically significant evidence of output‐dependent marginal costs within and across half‐hours of the day, but no evidence against the hypothesis of expected profit‐maximizing behavior. These cost function estimates quantify the economic significance of output‐varying costs and how forward financial contract obligations impact the amount of these costs the generation unit owner incurs. This supplier's existing obligations imply average daily production costs that are 8% lower than the profit‐maximizing pattern of output with no forward contract obligations.

Although ozonation and granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption have been practiced in water-treatment plants to remove these compounds effectively, two major problems associated with the application of these processes – formation of stringently regulated bromate ions by ozonation and unhygienic invertebrate colonisation of GAC filters – are still to be resolved. This research advanced the process of adsorption by powdered activated carbon (PAC) by reducing its particle size to the submicrometre range for microfiltration pretreatment. Adsorption pretreatment by using this super (S)-PAC removed the geosmin with vastly greater efficiency than by normal PAC. Removal was attained in a much shorter contact time and at a much lower dosage. The S-PAC was also beneficial in attenuating the transmembrane pressure rises that occurred between both physical backwashings and chemical cleanings.</jats:p>",

Exciting phenomena occurred during fouling removal, the backwashing force and crossflow shear caused cake expansion followed by fluidisation of the fouling layer. While solution turbidity remains a limiting factor in its application, this non-invasive direct observation technique offers significant potential for further MBR studies, such as filtration of activated sludge, and effects of filtration mode and of bubbling.</jats:p>",

An analysis of the relationship between two provides the basis for probing the role of complaint management (CM) in the closed-loop supply chain to help it perform more efficiently and effectively through the application of advanced technologies. This paper considers how CM can be computed combining computer communication and information technologies. This computing process involves collection, evaluation and disposal. Using computer telephone integration technology, an integrated multi-channel system is designed; complaint and production evaluated through an intelligent decision support system; and CM processing system established to implement corresponding disposal which reflects the utility of CM. This research on the process of incorporating CM into our studies has significance for computing business service in the future. Based on exergoeconomics theory, the closed-loop supply chain is discussed, and the metric about “system negative environment effect” is introduced to system performance in terms of energy expenditures; a case study illustrates the efficacy of the process</jats:p>",

This method is therefore robust to a wide range of assumptions about labor allocation decisions in the presence of uncertainty, market frictions, locational preferences, etc. We illustrate the method using data from rice producers in Côte d'Ivoire. These data, like previous studies, reveal significant systematic differences between shadow wages and the marginal revenue product of family farm labor. We demonstrate how one can exploit systematic deviations, in the present case related to household characteristics such as the land/labor endowment ratio, to control for both unobservable wages and prospective allocative inefficiency in labor allocation in structural household labor supply estimation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Manufacturing firms are increasingly using advanced enterprise-level information systems to coordinate and synchronize externally oriented functions such as marketing and supply chain and internally oriented activities such as manufacturing. In this paper, we present a model of manufacturing performance that simultaneously considers the effects of a firm's integrated IS capability in conjunction with interfunctional and interorganizational coordination mechanisms. Consistent with the complementarity perspective, we view this specific form of IS capability as enhancing manufacturing's coordination with marketing and supply chain functions to drive manufacturing performance. Additionally, the theoretical model presented here introduces manufacturing-IS coordination, a form of coordination not considered in past research, as a key antecedent to integrated IS capability. The research thus provides a comprehensive framework for examining manufacturing performance in contexts that have been transformed by the use of advanced information systems. The theoretical model is tested using primary data collected from manufacturing firms and matched with objective manufacturing performance data from secondary sources. Results show that a firm's integrated IS capability, as well as the complementary effects of IS capability with manufacturing, marketing, and supply chain processes, are significant predictors of manufacturing performance. These findings are robust to concerns of endogeneity, unobserved heterogeneity, and alternative model specification. </jats:p>",

The rejection of the negatively charged molecules on the fouled membrane slightly decreased and the rejection of the positively charged molecules slightly increased. These trends can be explained by a decrease of the repulsion of negative compounds and a decrease of the attraction of positive compounds by the fouled membrane.

An unresolved issue concerns how histone dynamics are coordinated with fork progression to maintain chromosomal stability. Here, we characterize a complex in which the human histone chaperone Asf1 and MCM2–7, the putative replicative helicase, are connected through a histone H3-H4 bridge. Depletion of Asf1 by RNA interference impedes DNA unwinding at replication sites, and similar defects arise from overproduction of new histone H3-H4 that compromises Asf1 function. These data link Asf1 chaperone function, histone supply, and replicative unwinding of DNA in chromatin. We propose that Asf1, as a histone acceptor and donor, handles parental and new histones at the replication fork via an Asf1–(H3-H4)–MCM2–7 intermediate and thus provides a means to fine-tune replication fork progression and histone supply and demand.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Bone vascular canals occur irregularly in tetrapods; however, the reason why a species has or lacks bone canals remains poorly understood. Basically, this feature could depend on phylogenetic history, or result from diverse causes, especially cortical accretion rate. The Varanidae, a monophyletic clade that includes species with impressive size differences but similar morphologies, is an excellent model for this question. Cortical vascularization was studied in 20 monitor species, on three bones (femur, fibula, and tibia) that differ in their shaft diameters, and in the absolute growth speed of their diaphyseal cortices. In all species smaller than 398 mm SVL (133–397 mm in sample), bone cortices lack vascular canals, whereas all larger species (460–1,170 mm in sample) display canals. The size 398–460 mm SVL is thus a threshold for the appearance of the canals. The distribution of vascular and avascular bone tissues among species does not precisely reflect phylogenetic relationships. When present, vascular canals always occur in the femur and tibia, but are less frequent, sparser, and thinner in the fibula. Vascular density increases linearly with specific size but decreases exponentially during individual growth. In most species, canal orientation varies between individuals and is diverse in a single section. No clear relationship exists between canal orientation and vascular density. These results suggest that: a) the occurrence and density of bone vascular canals are basically dependant on specific size, not phylogenetic relationships; b) vascular density reflects the absolute growth rates of bone cortices; c) the orientation of vascular canals is a variable feature independent of phylogeny or growth rate.

The objective of this study is to gather performance data to provide a scientific basis for organisations to safely scale-up and implement the CSF technology. Filters from three production locations are included in this study: Cambodia, Ghana and Nicaragua. The microstructure of the filter material was studied using mercury intrusion porosimetry and bubble-point tests. Effective pores were measured with a mean of 40 μm, which is larger than many pathogenic microorganisms. The removal efficiency of these microorganisms was measured by using indicator organisms; total coliforms naturally present in canal water, sulphite reducing Clostridium spores, E.coli K12 and MS2 bacteriophages. The removal of these organisms was monitored during a long-term study of several months in the laboratory. Ceramic silver impregnated pot filters successfully removed total coliforms and sulphite reducing Clostridium spores. High concentrations of Escherichia coli K12 were also removed, with log(10) reduction values consistently higher than 2. MS2 bacteriophages were only partially removed from the water, with significantly better results for filters without an impregnation of colloidal silver. During this study the main deficiency of the filter system proved to be the low water production; after 12 weeks of use all filter discharges were below 0.5 Lh−1, which is insufficient to provide drinking water for a family</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Filtration is a common unit operation in a water treatment plant. The effectiveness of granular filter media in treating surface water and removing suspended solids is already well established. However, less effort in the mathematical modeling towards the design of the filtration unit is observed. The current study involved head loss performance evaluation and development of a mathematical model to correlate maximum service time of filter at a maximum allowable head loss with various effective sizes and flow rates. Sand and burnt oil palm shell (BOPS) used as filter media in single and dual media filters were subjected to different effective sizes and flow rates. The average influent water turbidity for each filter (at specific effective size and flow rate) before entering the filtration unit was from 1 to 5 NTU. This was a pilot a study on settled water that was conducted in a Malaysian water treatment plant. Results suggest that all filters are capable of producing water with acceptable turbidity unit (&amp;lt;1 NTU). The total running time and filtrate water quality produced by BOPS/sand dual media filter was much better (i.e. the running time of BOPS/sand was four to nine times greater than sand single media filter) than BOPS and sand single media filters. The experimental data were well represented by a newly developed model and results of fitting show a high correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.991. The maximum allowable head loss was selected as 240 cm with an acceptable filtrate water quality (less than 1 NTU). In addition, the current results will be a supplementary tool for engineers in designing a proper filtration unit.</jats:p>",

To preserve the water quality, several water management policies had been adapted but they had been not successful because of focusing only on point source pollutants. With the establishment of the special act for four major rivers in 2002, which defined four watersheds, the watershed management was regularized. A Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) management system was introduced to control point and non-point source pollutants, and has been implemented for three major river watersheds from 2002 except the Han-river watershed, which is adopting the system voluntarily. This paper provides an overview of TMDLs management system and the implementation process and its progress in Korea. Also the next step for improving the management system is discussed.</jats:p>",

A survey of 167 farmers and 84 firms in Jiangsu Province, P.R. China provides the data for empirical study based on a structural model. The results demonstrate that guanxi networks in China significantly improve small-scale farmers' compliance with buyers' delivery requirements based on formal contracts, which eventually improves farmers' market performance. Vegetable firms, on the other hand, place more emphasis on formal contracts in order to improve suppliers' compliance with delivery requirements and thereby improve their own profitability. The results reveal that personal relationships and contracts have different impacts on farmers and firms.</jats:p>",

Virus removal increased with filtration time: the rate of virus removal was 4 log at the beginning of filtration and gradually increased to 6 log over 5 h, probably because of the growth of a cake layer that accumulated on the membrane surface. Quantification of the virus particles in the MF compartment by a combination of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and a plaque forming unit (PFU) method revealed that most of the virus (&amp;gt;99.999%) in the MF compartment was entrapped in the aluminium floc and then located in the solid phase; most of the virus (&amp;gt;99.9%) in the solid phase was inactivated. The rate of recovery of virus particles from the MF compartment decreased with filtration time: after 3 h of filtration approximately half of the virus particles in the MF compartment were not recovered by hydraulic backwashing, indicating that the virus might have been retained on the MF membrane as part of an irreversible foulant.</jats:p>",

Our main results provide necessary and sufficient conditions for local indeterminacy. First, we show that the consumption good sector needs to be capital intensive at the private level and labor intensive at the social level. Second, we prove that under this capital intensity configuration, the existence of sunspot fluctuations is obtained if and only if the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption is large enough but the elasticity of the labor supply is low enough. In particular, we will show on the one hand that when the labor supply is infinitely elastic, the steady state is always saddle‐point stable, and on the other hand that when the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption is infinite, labor does not have any influence on the local stability properties of the equilibrium path.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> By the time a European consumer eats a Costa Rican mango, the product has been traded in several transactions between producers, traders, retailers and consumers. This paper investigates the position of Costa Rican smallholders in the mango supply chain in terms of bargaining power and revenue distribution. It examines data derived using a specially developed research tool: the Mango Chain Game (MCG), a gaming simulation that mimics the negotiation conditions in the Costa Rican mango supply chain. The MCG defines roles for all agents in the chain and records transaction attributes. Five sessions with the MCG were played with different groups of mango producers, resulting in a data set of 82 transactions and 43 bargaining power positions. Bargaining power was assessed at a 10-point Likert scale. Revenue distribution was measured in terms of value added. The results show that self-perceived bargaining power was dependent on negotiation skills, wealth and good partnership of the negotiators, but independent of market imperfections. Revenue distribution was related to the bargaining power of the trading partner, risk perception and the duration of the contract. Conclusions include that using a gaming simulation as data source can help identify less tangible issues in supply chain research, which is a new field of application for gaming simulations. Agency cooperation, skills and being able to bear risks play a role for improving the efficiency of the mango supply chain in Costa Rica as seen from a producers' perspective. The gaming results indicate that initiatives for improving the bargaining power of producers are more promising if they focus on improving skills and relations in trade rather than on solving market imperfections. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Disturbances in supply chains may be either exogenous or endogenous. The ability automatically to detect, diagnose, and distinguish between the causes of disturbances is of prime importance to decision makers in order to avoid uncertainty. The spectral principal component analysis (SPCA) technique has been utilized to distinguish between real and rogue disturbances in a steel supply network. The data set used was collected from four different business units in the network and consists of 43 variables; each is described by 72 data points. The present paper will utilize the same data set to test an alternative approach to SPCA in detecting the disturbances. The new approach employs statistical data pre-processing, clustering, and classification learning techniques to analyse the supply network data. In particular, the incremental k-means clustering and the RULES-6 classification rule-learning algorithms, developed by the present authors' team, have been applied to identify important patterns in the data set. Results show that the proposed approach has the capability automatically to detect and characterize network-wide cyclical disturbances and generate hypotheses about their root cause. </jats:p>",
