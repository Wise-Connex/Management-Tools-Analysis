      "abstract": "<jats:p>The network perspective is rapidly becoming a lingua franca across virtually all of the sciences from anthropology to physics. In this paper, we provide supply chain researchers with an overview of social network analysis, covering both specific concepts (such as structural holes or betweenness centrality) and the generic explanatory mechanisms that network theorists often invoke to relate network variables to outcomes of interest. One reason for discussing mechanisms is to facilitate appropriate translation and context‐specific modification of concepts rather than blind copying. We have also taken care to apply network concepts to both “hard” types of ties (e.g., materials and money flows) and “soft” types of ties (e.g., friendships and sharing‐of‐information), as both are crucial (and mutually embedded) in the supply chain context. Another aim of the review is to point to areas in other fields that we think are particularly suitable for supply chain management (SCM) to draw network concepts from, such as sociology, ecology, input–output research and even the study of romantic networks. We believe the portability of many network concepts provides a potential for unifying many fields, and a consequence of this for SCM may be to decrease the distance between SCM and other branches of management science.</jats:p>",

Energy costs are a function of real consumption and the daily energy tariff.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper presents a model of optimization to guarantee the delivery of enough water to populations, for each day. Although, in order to achieve that, energy for pumping is needed, representing the main cost for the companies that operate the systems. The model, developed in MATLAB®, provides the best solution to take in each time step. Simultaneously the population water consumption must be guaranteed, and the hydraulic system restrictions fulfilled. The definition of optimal pumping schedules allows the reduction of operation and maintenance costs associated with pumping energy, as well as the increase of global hydraulic system efficiency. The rules are subsequently introduced into a hydraulic simulator (EPANET), to verify the system behaviour along the simulation period. In addiction, a water turbine is introduced in one of the system's branches. The economical benefits from the generated energy from the water turbine can not be neglected and the wind complementary turbine for pumping supply provides also significant economical savings.</jats:p>",

To mitigate this situation the El Prat Desalination Plant, a seawater reverse osmosis (RO) facility, is scheduled to come into operation during 2009. The network management project foresees supply in the southern area of the city of a blend of desalinated seawater and water from the River Llobregat. The latter could be treated in two ways: by conventional treatment consisting of the predioxychlorination, clarification, sand filtration, GAC filtration and postchlorination stages, or by means of this same process with an additional electrodialysis reversal (EDR) stage prior to postchlorination. In this study, an estimation of the organoleptic characteristics of the blends was carried out by trained and untrained sensory panels. The water samples for tasting were RO desalinated seawater (Tordera Plant), treated water from the Llobregat (Sant Joan Despí water treatment plant working under adequate conditions for the study), and the effluent from an EDR pilot plant. The results of the ranking, scoring and triangle difference tests indicated that the quality of the 50/50 blends improved in relation to the water from the Llobregat, although without reaching the level of quality of the water from the Ter basin, Barcelona's other important resource (North area).</jats:p>",

However, “social” pressures and standards are still not commonly used and there is a lack of implementation in the entire supply chain in the industry. The main reason for adopting CSR standards is to identify risks and problems in the supply chain, and to avoid or at least reduce the consequences for the final manufacturer. Although most manufacturers in the Korean electronics industry demand certified environmental standards such as ISO 14001 from their suppliers, there is generally a lack of integration of social standards in supplier management or requirements.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Companies today face a growing number of restrictions from national legislations and international standards influencing the environment, labour standards, and human rights issues. Within the Korean electronics industry as a whole there appears to be consensus that it is not easy being “socially responsible”. Vague notions about CSR issues for supply management practices have not provided suppliers with adequate guidance as they seek to improve their performance <jats:italic>vis‐à‐vis</jats:italic> company standards. The development of evaluation standards to assess suppliers can be a critical factor in improving a firm's performance. Another critical factor is documenting all CSR activities for external requirements such as auditors.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This study is the first empirical attempt to explore CSR adoption and implementation in supply management in the Korean electronics industry.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In order to manage the integration challenge, firms have a number of tools, varying from centralization and formalization to cross‐locational teams. In this paper, we focus on explaining how and why to integrate in different circumstances. The aim of this paper is to complement prior research on global sourcing organizations, which is still rather scarce and more exploratory in nature. By extending the arguments of the information processing perspective of organizations to the global sourcing context, we seek to propel a theoretical discussion on integration in the global sourcing organization. Based on the results of 12 case studies in three MNCs, we propose that integration approaches in global sourcing organizations vary depending on the three contingencies of category characteristics, supply environment characteristics and interdependence of the purchasing units.</jats:p>",

Within the domain of innovation, relationship‐specific proactive improvement by LSPs may play a vital role because in logistics outsourcing relationships, the problem of ex post adaptation exists (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#b67\">Rindfleisch and Heide 1997</jats:ext-link>). So far, however, it remains unclear to what extent LSPs may utilize their proactive improvement to create customer loyalty and whether a focus on either cost or performance improvements is preferable. The present study analyzes 298 logistics outsourcing relationships using a survey method and structural equation modeling to assess the effect that proactive cost improvement and proactive performance improvement have on customer loyalty. Additionally, the moderating effects of “service complexity” and “length of contracting period” on the base effects are analyzed. The results reveal that proactive cost improvement and proactive performance improvement are both strong drivers of all core dimensions of loyalty (retention, extension, and referrals). However, this finding is a composition of two different patterns. Cost improvement, and thus efficiency is the main driver of customer loyalty when the outsourced services are simple and the contracting period relatively short. A clear shift of importance is observable when services increase in complexity and the contracting period lengthens. In such settings, customer loyalty is primarily driven by proactive performance improvement and thus, effectiveness, while cost improvement plays a subordinate role.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Once an oil exporter, California now depends on imports for more than 60% of its oil supply. This paper examines the oil production outlook for each of California's major oil sources, including California itself. Oil production trends, published geological and engineering reports, and proposed developments in California's supply area are reviewed to define supply trends, especially for the medium-to-heavy, sour crudes that are processed in California's refineries. Refinery upgrading capacity is already highly developed in California, thus it is assumed that a competitive advantage in heavy, sour crudes will continue, although refining heavy oil releases more carbon dioxide.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>About a quarter of California's imports are from Alaska, the rest from foreign sources including Saudi Arabia, Ecuador and Iraq. Before foreign sources became so important, California's refining industry processed California's own crudes and Alaska's North Slope crude. Like those crudes, oil from northern Saudi Arabia, southeast Iraq, and Ecuador is also sour and medium to heavy, ranging from 16 to 35° API and from 2 to more than 3% sulfur by weight. By far the most important sour crude development in California's supply area is Saudi Arabia's 900,000 BOPD Manifa project, originally slated for completion in 2011 but now facing delays. Manifa contains oil that ranges from 26 to 31° API and from 2.8 to 3.7% sulfur. Over the longer term, Alaska will continue to play an important supply role if the Chuckchi and Beaufort Seas live up to expectations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Middle East production is not increasing, yet oil cargoes from the Middle East have to pass growing Asian markets to reach California. Alaska and Mexico also supply oil to the Pacific Basin, but are facing production declines. The effect of rising Asian demand on Pacific Basin oil markets is already visible, with significant amounts of oil coming to California from Atlantic Basin sources such as Angola, Brazil, and Argentina.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The US West Coast pipeline system is separate from the integrated East Coast, Gulf Coast and Midwest system, so energy security issues for the West Coast may differ from those of the country as a whole. There are policy options that could affect California's oil supply security, including increased oil development in Alaska or offshore California, development of additional oil pipeline outlets on Canada's Pacific Coast or substituting natural gas for oil if possible. All of these policy options are currently the subject of political debate.</jats:p>",

The technique of using CT has been explored before and the subject has been covered in previous SPE papers1.

In most cases, deck space, loading constraints and operational factors such us seabed, heave, or current direction, fixed have posed significant challenges. These challenges have been addressed in some specific cases for production platforms, jack-up boats, or dynamically positioned (DP) monohull vessels. However, traditional coiled tubing intervention will not always provide a feasible solution.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A particular operationally challenged subsea pipeline intervention exists in the Congo delta.

It is considered the key foundation of the world's first trillion-dollar industry and the principal item in the balance of payments and exchanges between nations. To truly appreciate the significance of this precious commodity, just imagine the day when all of the world's transportation systems and factories cease to function when the world has consumed its last drop of oil. This brings us to the main and crucial question: How long will oil last?</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Crude oil is the lifeblood of the 12 member-nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which produces 40% of the world's oil supply and holds three-quarters of the proven reserves. Reaching oil production peak can be alarming to OPEC members, where oil revenue is the main feeding stream of the gross national product (GNP).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Many researchers, in the past decades, tried to find an answer to this crucial and critical question. Unfortunately, crude oil supply forecasting is a challenging endeavor.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper presents our forecast for the OPEC countries supply of crude oil to years beyond 2050. We applied the \"multi-cyclic Hubbert\" approach that accurately models the oil-production history of OPEC countries, which are virtually most of the world's crude oil supplier.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The analysis indicates that the OPEC ultimate oil recovery is about 1.137 trillion barrels. Of this amount, about 0.9117 trillion barrels remain to be produced by the end of 2080, where the peak is expected to be in 2025 at the production rate of 90 million barrels per day. OPEC has 77% of the world's remaining reserves. Furthermore, most OPEC countries will peak between 2020 and 2030, and they will remain the world main supplier of crude oil for the next 200 years.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this investigation, high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was used to characterise organic matter in treated drinking water at key sampling locations along two selected distribution systems (chlorinated and chloraminated). Other water quality parameters such as colour, UV254, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and assimilable organic carbon (AOC) as measured by bacterial regrowth potential (BRP), were also determined. One of the aims of this work was to develop new tools to monitor organic character change along the distribution system in order to identify impacting factors and develop management strategies based on water quality change. This study used samples from two contrasting distribution systems with different disinfection regimes and organic characteristics together with samples generated from laboratory simulations. System 1 is a chlorinated distribution system and generally requires elevated chlorine dosage to meet the demand due to the high DOC level. System 2 is a chloraminated system with stable water quality, low DOC and low chloramine dose (mild oxidation). Molecular size distribution determination using HPSEC is a very informative technique in assessing treatment processes and in this study the appearance of a molecular peak at 1,700 Da that can be used as an indicator of biological activity in distribution systems was confirmed. The use of BRP values, for upstream and downstream samples in the distribution system, was found to be a good approach to assess biological impacts on water stability. The observed biological impact from the biofilms between the studied systems were particularly useful in confirming the organic characterisation results.</jats:p>",

The first portion of the paper examines large shifts in property tax burdens induced by an unusual school finance reform in the state of New Hampshire. The estimates suggest that, in most of the state, communities with a reduced tax burden experience a large increase in residential construction. In the area of the state near the region&amp;amp;#x27;s primary urban center (Boston), however, the shock clears through a price adjustment -- i.e., by capitalizing into property values. The differing responses are attributed to differing housing supply elasticities. Furthermore, the shock induced communities with a lowered tax burden to enact more stringent land use regulations. The second portion of the paper uses a national sample and exploits variation in education spending levels arising from 1980s era school finance reforms. The results confirm the findings from New Hampshire -- fiscal amenities have a significant impact on the location of residential capital and the impact is largest outside of dense, urban areas. These results, which are interpreted through the lens of a simple theoretical model, have important implications for a host of issues, including the equity and efficiency of local public goods provision, assessing who bears the burden of local taxation, and land use issues such as the location and pace of residential development and the causes of land use regulation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This paper shows practical example in the direction of building \"holistic regional depletion plan\" by applying \"fully holistic\" and \"fully probabilistic\" modeling at the cost of the classic \"precision\" modeling that tends to include more physics. The approach came as a result of the oil industry low return on investment (ROI) that averaged at 7%. Deterministic methods usually ignore the full uncertainties distribution, associated risks, the diversification effects, and the interdependencies among the chosen assets. In addition it loses the proper interaction between the technical and the commercial value drivers. As a result, many rated oil companies fall since 1990 until near future.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To achieve more realistic results, decision and risk analysis (D&amp;RA) approach together with a \"holistic strategy\" (based on the Nobel-Prize wining portfolio theory that has shaped the financial markets over the past four decades and recently introduced to E&amp;P) are applied instead of the conventional deterministic method and the \"hole-istic strategy\" that may lead to suboptimal solutions. Assets in the Nile Delta of Egypt were chosen to apply more modern modeling techniques by using less model \"precision\" for more comprehensive modeling of uncertainties and more integrated technical and business modeling. Full probabilistic methods that closely integrate technical and commercial data and tie that to the decision-making process are used to preserve more relevant information. This allowed the pertinent uncertainties to be exploited better and risks to be quantified when compared to the traditional deterministic methods. Optimization was carried out within the whole \"value chain\" at different \"hierarchical levels\" instead of optimizing parts separately that may destroy the whole value chain.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>With the current volatile oil market and the 2008 international financial crisis, integrating the endogenous factors (local uncertainties such as geology) and the exogenous factors (global uncertainties such as geo-economics) reduces the risk of the volatile oil prices and the political events. Proper risk evaluation and quantification for many assets enables to build reasonable efficient frontier (EF) that a firm can use to decide its optimum situation depending on the firm willing and to avoid misallocation of capitals.</jats:p>",

We demonstrate in our analytical model that a firm must also actively manage information flows within the supply chain, which translates to controlling what it knows, as well as what its competitors and suppliers know. In our model of horizontal competition between an informed and an uninformed firm with a common upstream supplier, material and information flows intersect through leakage of demand (order) information to unintended recipients. As a result, the informed firm's drive to control information flows within the supply chain can trigger operational losses through material flow distortion. These losses can be so severe that the firm may prefer not to acquire information even when it is costless to do so. Our results underscore the importance of strategic information management—actively managing the supply chain's information flows, and making trade-offs with material flows where appropriate, to maximize profits. </jats:p>",

Here, three hypotheses from a resolution model of POC were tested using data on sickness histories and mother–infant interactions from 24 Karo Batak women and their young children from two rural villages in North Sumatra, Indonesia. First, as predicted, offspring with greater need (measured as age and propensity to illness) tended to fuss more often. Second, as expected, observed fussiness predicted the number of suckling occurrences observed during sampling periods. Third, contrary to the prediction, the duration of fussing observed after breast-feeding occurrences was longer than the duration of the breast-feeding occurrences themselves. Parental decisions were made based on offspring-supplied information about need, but offspring failed to garner resources in excess of the parental optimum. This suggests that a POC interpretation is unnecessary to account for these results.</jats:p>",

Subsequently, the evaluation of photocatalytic oxidative (PCO) properties of TiO2 nanotubes are compared with the commercial TiO2 P25 (i.e. TiO2 powder) in PCO batch reactor. The TiO2 nanotubes show excellent performance with complete photodegradation of humic acid (HA) in comparison with the 97.7% removal efficiency of P25. The TiO2 nanotubes are also tested in membrane filtration for verification of catalyst separation and recovery. The TiO2 nanotubes were totally separated and recovered with membrane filtration. Lastly, its stability is tested in repeated reuse experiments. No catalyst deactivation is observed after five consecutive PCO experiments of newly added HA.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Corporate responsibility has become an important issue for management to address. The responsibility of the organization for the public environment (ecological, social and economic aspects of the environment) has become a matter of management attention referring to the entire organization and all major stakeholders. Therefore safe, environmentally sound, and economically viable energy production and supply should be essential part of management issues. The anticipated closure of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant at 2009 will change the situation of electricity generation in Lithuania significantly. The costs of electricity generation and distribution are the most important criteria shaping decisions in the energy production and supply companies. Sound energy and environmental accounting must be the basis of any strategic decision making in order to keep up with the increasing complexity of energy and environmental problems. Efficiency, equity, ecological integrity, and technological change are introduced as fundamental aspects that need to be considered in a comprehensive sustainable energy production and supply framework. Since these issues cannot be suitably included within the frame of a single model, a combination of ecological, economic, technological and social measures for different aspects of Lithuanian energy system and sustainable development are analysed.\n\n\nSantruka\n\n\nImoniu atsakomybe už aplinka (socialiniu, ekologiniu, ekonominiu aspektu) yra vienas svarbiausiu klausimu nustatant imoniu veiklos prioritetus ir priimant veiklos sprendimus.

These are results of natural processes in the water body and of the water's quality entering and leaving the reservoir. Long term quality changes are due to management of catchment areas, but also to a considerable extent by external impacts like climate change. Short term quality changes are impacted by extreme events like rain storms after drought periods, which might also be a result of climate change. Furthermore, short- and mid-term quality changes are impacted by reservoir management, which also influences the ecological state of rivers downstream the reservoir. The purpose of our work is to develop a decision support tool for reservoir management which takes into account short-, mid- and long-term factors for water quality change. With the tool it is intended to simulate not only water quality, but also management impact on flood risk prevention and drinking water quality (treatment efficiency and costs) and to assist decision making for reservoir management.</jats:p>",

This study evaluated the plausible future scenarios of water availability and use under conditions of various cropping patterns, and with the explicit inclusion (for the first time) of environmental water requirements for one of the links of the NRLP: from the Godavari River at Polavaram to the Krishna River at Vijayawada—the ‘Polavaram Project’. The scenarios were evaluated using the WEAP (Water Evaluation and Planning) model. The study generates information for use in managing emerging trade-offs. The importance of explicit accounting for monthly variability in description of water supply and demand, in the monsoon-driven climate conditions of the region, is advocated. Such detailed scenario simulations and inclusion of previously unaccounted for factors/uses can help to create awareness of potential future problems, inform water management practices and suggest management alternatives. Results show that the proposed water storage and transfer will reduce water deficit within the project command area and significantly reduce dry slow river flow into the Lower Godavari Delta.</jats:p>",

The replenishment lead times from each source are stochastic, representing congestion and disruption. We develop performance evaluation and optimization tools for a family of reasonable order policies. These policies take into account real-time supply information, which can be obtained through tracking technologies such as global positioning systems and radio frequency identification. Performance evaluation of such state-dependent policies is generally hard. The main thrust of this paper is to show that, under these policies, the supply system becomes a network of queues with a special routing mechanism called an overflow bypass. The solution has a simple product form. Thus, we obtain closed-form performance measures. These results reinterpret and extend the existing analysis of a system with two sources having deterministic lead times. We further extend the analysis to batch ordering policies, non-Poisson demand processes, and multiple demand classes. </jats:p>",

The continuous flow of tap water through the reactor resulted in the formation of biofilms which were in a quasi-stationary state after 14 days with average total cell counts of approximately 1.2 × 109 cells per cm2 and heterotrophic plate counts of about 1.0 × 108 colony-forming units (cfu) per cm2. After introduction of P. aeruginosa, these bacteria persisted in the drinking-water biofilms for at least 7 days and 5 weeks under stagnant and flow conditions, respectively. At the same time, P. aeruginosa was detected in the water phase, indicating detachment of cells from the biofilms. The extracellular polysaccharide alginate and cell-bound lectins LecA and LecB, which are known to be involved in monospecies P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, had no significant influence on the colonisation of established drinking-water biofilms. From a health perspective, drinking-water biofilms can thus act as a reservoir for P. aeruginosa and have to be considered as a source of contamination in water distribution systems.</jats:p>",

The kinetics of Al ion hydrolysis, interaction of hydrolyzed species of Al and NOM, and hydraulic power condition in coagulation process are investigated by programmable jar test, photometric dispersion analyzer and ferron assaying. After the coagulant dosing, Al ion would hydrolyze very quickly, and then monomeric Al and small polymeric Al would further hydrolyze to form larger polymer and precipitate, based on pH condition, while the further hydrolyzed process is relative slow. Although complexation between NOM and Al appears to be several orders of magnitude slower than hydrolysis of monomeric forms of Al, it would be faster than further polymerization and precipitation of Al during aging. However the further polymerization of fresh Al would benefit to Al-NOM complex aggregation and settlement. Therefore, PACl, with stabile preformed polymer shows significantly different performance in NOM removal compared with AlCl3. Although the hydraulic power condition plays significant role in collision frequency and efficiency of particles removal, the process of the aggregation to form larger floc to settle down is relative slower than interaction of Al and NOM, and it is not very correlative to the performance of NOM removal if only it can provide enough mixture.</jats:p>",

The main aim of the study was to create a prediction tool for the determination of the EDCs adsorbabilities at low ng.L−1 level. Single solute solution adsorption isotherms at high concentrations, for prediction purposes, and low concentrations, for verification of the prediction, were performed for one EDC/PAC couple. Over the whole range of concentration, results showed that the Langmuir-Freundlich model better suits the adsorption phenomenon than the Freundlich or Langmuir model. Kinetics experiments were carried out on the same EDC/PAC couple. HSDM modelling of single solute adsorption kinetics at high concentration allowed determining the kinetic coefficients kf and Ds; both were shown to dominate the mass transfer mechanism. Competitive adsorption isotherms at high and low concentrations showed that downward extrapolation of low concentration adsorption capacities from solely high concentration information results in acceptable error compared to the total range isotherm. The IAST-EBC approach combined with the Langmuir-Freundlich single solute model, for the target compound, and the Langmuir model, for the EBC, appears as an acceptable global model.</jats:p>",

Significant amounts of forest residues are potentially available within the study area: approximately 2.8 million dry tons in North Carolina, 1.8 million dry tons in South Carolina, and 1.3 million dry tons in Virginia. These quantities are sufficient to satisfy regional biomass electricity production requirements only through 2012 under a hypothetical national Renewable Portfolio Standard and Renewable Fuels Standard, after which changes in the biomass resource stream will be necessary. Supply curves generated for multiple regions in each state indicate that forest residues vary regionally in both supply and price, and exceeding the supply of forest residues could be accompanied by a dramatic spike in resource pricing, with implications for timberland owners and users of the forest resource base.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the incentives of a manufacturer and a retailer to share their demand forecasts. The demand at the retailer is a linearly decreasing function of price. The manufacturer sets the wholesale price first, and the retailer sets the retail price after observing the wholesale price. Both players set their prices based on their forecasts of demand. In the make‐to‐order scenario, the manufacturer sets the production quantity after observing the actual demand; in the make‐to‐stock scenario, the manufacturer sets the production quantity before the demand is realized. In the make‐to‐order scenario, we show that sharing the forecast unconditionally by the retailer with the manufacturer benefits the manufacturer but hurts the retailer. We also demonstrate that a side payment contract cannot induce Pareto‐optimal information sharing equilibrium, but a discount based wholesale price contract can. The social welfare as well as consumer surplus is higher under the discount contract, compared with under no information sharing. In the make‐to‐stock scenario, the manufacturer realizes additional benefits in the form of savings in inventory holding and shortage costs when forecasts are shared. If the savings from inventory holding and shortage costs because of information sharing are sufficiently high, then a side payment contract that induces Pareto‐optimal information sharing is feasible in the make‐to‐stock scenario. We also provide additional managerial insights with the help of a computational study. </jats:p>",

A two‐stage stochastic linear programming approach is proposed within a multi‐period planning model that takes into account the production and inventory levels, transportation modes, times of shipments, and customer service levels. To investigate the potential improvement by using stochastic programming, we describe a simulation framework that relies on a rolling horizon approach. The studies suggest that at least 5% savings in the total real cost can be achieved compared with the deterministic case. In addition, an algorithm based on the multi‐cut L‐shaped method is proposed to effectively solve the resulting large scale industrial size problems. We also introduce risk management models by incorporating risk measures into the stochastic programming model, and multi‐objective optimization schemes are implemented to establish the tradeoffs between cost and risk. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic models and decomposition algorithms, a case study of a realistic global chemical supply chain problem is presented. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2009</jats:p>",

This fact is currently not widely reflected by research on decision making in sourcing contexts. However, supply managers are aware of the judgment and decision challenges that result from existing and increasing levels of uncertainty in the external, upstream supply chain, and deploy decision supporting strategies for debiasing their judgments. The analysis of supply management decisions using 441 data units from 133 embedded cases from 15 buying organizations revealed high levels of such debiasing strategies. However, the seemingly most effective mitigation strategy recommended in the general debiasing literature ‐ creating awareness of the underlying mechanics causing decision biases ‐ was only employed by one buying organization, indicating a need to further investigate debiasing strategies specifically in supply management contexts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of temporary transfers, such as options and leases, has grown as utilities attempt to meet increases in demand while reducing dependence on the expansion of costly infrastructure capacity (e.g., reservoirs). Earlier work has been done to construct optimal portfolios comprising firm capacity and transfers, using decision rules that determine the timing and volume of transfers. However, such work has only focused on the short‐term (e.g., 1‐year scenarios), which limits the utility of these planning efforts. Developing multiyear portfolios can lead to the exploration of a wider range of alternatives but also increases the computational burden. This work utilizes a coupled hydrologic‐economic model to simulate the long‐term performance of a city's water supply portfolio. This stochastic model is linked with an optimization search algorithm that is designed to handle the high‐frequency, low‐amplitude noise inherent in many simulations, particularly those involving expected values. This noise is detrimental to the accuracy and precision of the optimized solution and has traditionally been controlled by investing greater computational effort in the simulation. However, the increased computational effort can be substantial. This work describes the integration of a variance reduction technique (control variate method) within the simulation/optimization as a means of more efficiently identifying minimum cost portfolios. Random variation in model output (i.e., noise) is moderated using knowledge of random variations in stochastic input variables (e.g., reservoir inflows, demand), thereby reducing the computing time by 50% or more. Using these efficiency gains, water supply portfolios are evaluated over a 10‐year period in order to assess their ability to reduce costs and adapt to demand growth, while still meeting reliability goals. As a part of the evaluation, several multiyear option contract structures are explored and compared.</jats:p>",

Melons and other types of produce reach their peak value at the time of harvest; product value deteriorates exponentially post‐harvest until the product is cooled to dampen the deterioration. Using the product's marginal value of time (MVT), the rate at which the product loses value over time in the supply chain, we show that the appropriate model to minimize lost value in the supply chain is a hybrid of a responsive model from post‐harvest to cooling, followed by an efficient model in the remainder of the chain. We also show that these two segments of the supply chain are only loosely linked, implying that little coordination is required across the chain to achieve value maximization. The models we develop also provide insights into the use of a product's MVT to develop supply chain strategies for other perishable products. </jats:p>",

The ambiguous effects of these contracts on foreclosure, investment and consumer welfare in the long term made them logically become a priority for antitrust enforcement. However, due to the lack of precedents and the on–going modernization of EC competition law, the legal uncertainty currently perceived in the market place is strong. By analyzing the recent decisions of community and national competition authorities across energy industries, this article comes up with four conclusions. First, a new methodology to assess foreclosure effects in a market building context is emerging. Second, legal uncertainty in electricity is largely overstated as antitrust enforcement aligns across energy industries and quickly converges with enforcement in sectors where competition is more mature. Third, the European Commission is increasingly taking a unifi ed approach under Articles 81 and 82 EC for long term exclusive dealing in energy. Fourth, the antitrust strategy of the European Commission demonstrates both the limits of the application of a rule of reason in energy and the importance of the politics of liberalization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most drinking water production plants use rapid sand filters for the removal of manganese from groundwater. The start-up of manganese removal on newly installed sand media is slow, taking several weeks till months. Reducing this period in order to prevent the loss of water during this phase has become an issue of concern. In this study pilot and bench scale experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanism, influence of operational conditions (e.g. filtration rate, manganese loading) and measures that enhance manganese removal capacity of the sand media. Other filter media were investigated with the objective of finding suitable substitutes for the sand. The development of the adsorptive/catalytic coating the sand media in a pilot plant was very slow, notwithstanding the relatively high pH of 8. Low manganese concentration and more frequent backwashing resulted in a longer start up period of the manganese removal. It can not be excluded, that nitrite has a negative effect as well. Measurements in the lab and bench scale tests show that the rate of adsorption/oxidation of manganese in the top layer of the filter bed is too low to explain the complete manganese removal in the filters. It is likely that the adsorptive catalyst in the top layer has partly been covered with ferric hydroxide. From the Freundlich's isotherms determined for 6 different filter media, a crushed medium consisting of mainly manganese dioxide and some silica, iron and aluminium (Aquamandix) followed by iron oxide coated sand, containing some manganese, demonstrated highest adsorption capacities at pHs 6 and 8. These materials can therefore be potential substitutes for sand in situations of slow start-up of manganese removal.</jats:p>",

Various characterizing techniques have been applied to evaluate the quality of the resulting poly‐Si layers, including crystallinity, integrity and doping level caused by residual Al atoms. We emphasize the fact that Al atoms driven to the outermost surface by thermodynamical reasons form, besides an overlayer, a depth profile into poly‐Si, thus excessive Al supply both causes a heavy p‐type doping and imperils the surface compactness in subsequent etching procedure. A critical amount of Al is nevertheless required to achieve a satisfying crystallinity of the poly‐Si layer. With an Al‐layer over 200 nm and annealing at 500 °C, compact and well crystallized poly‐Si layers were obtained the grain size of which is only limited by layer thickness – the fingerprint Raman peak shows a full‐width‐at‐half‐maximum as small as 3.69 cm<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>.

Despite a substantial surge in interest in this topic over the past 20 years, a lack of distinction among unique manifestations of spatial concentrations of similar firms threatens continuing progress in this stream of research. We argue that agglomerations of related firms that draw benefits from the supply‐related externalities of increased access to specialized labour, specialized inputs, and knowledge spillovers are fundamentally different from those that draw benefits from heightened demand realized through reduction in consumer search costs. Extending agglomeration theory, we explicate the differences between these distinct phenomena, discuss how the nature of key theoretical relationships varies across these agglomeration types, and demonstrate significant implications for research. We discuss how the differences affect a host of theoretical relationships and empirical research decisions.</jats:p>",

However, the length and the complexity of the distribution network can lead to consumer complaints in some areas of the water distribution system. In order to improve the organoleptic quality of distributed water, the water supplier wants to get a better understanding of potential taste and odour formation and to succeed in controlling it. Since 2006, activities have been taken with targeted analyses and sensory evaluation of water, taking into account both the consumers' private networks and the citywide distribution network. The first results were focused on the occurrence of bromophenols along the water distribution system, the understanding of the mechanisms of formation of such compounds, as well as their incidence on taste-and-odour events at the consumer's home.</jats:p>",

Recent reforms are designed to significantly enhance the capability and status of the organisations responsible for commissioning health care services and, in so doing, to address some of the perceived problems of a historically provider/supplierled health system. In this context, commissioning organisations are being encouraged to draw on concepts and processes derived from commercial procurement and supply chain management (SCM) as they develop their expertise. While the application of such principles in the health sector is not new, existing work in the UK has not often considered the role of health care purchasers in the management of health service supply-chains. This paper describes the status of commissioning in the NHS, briefly reviews the procurement and SCM literature and begins to explore the links between them. It lays the foundations for further work which will test the extent to which lessons can be extracted in principle from the procurement literature and applied in practice by health care commissioners.</jats:p>",

A resulting DHA depletion has been demonstrated in PKU children and may account for detectable subtle neurological deficits that are not explained by variation in plasma phenylalanine concentrations. We supplemented 36 children with PKU ages 1 to 11 years for 3 months with encapsulated fish oil providing a daily dose of 15 mg DHA/kg body weight. DHA supplementation resulted in significantly faster visual evoked potential latencies, indicating more rapid central nervous system information processing. In addition, DHA significantly improved outcomes in a test of motor function and coordination. No changes over time were seen in age‐matched healthy controls. Because the PKU children had a good supply of the omega‐3 precursor alpha‐linolenic acid, these observations lead us to conclude that endogenous conversion of alpha‐linolenic acid is not sufficient to provide adequate amounts of DHA that support optimal function, and hence DHA appears to be a conditional essential substrate for children with PKU. Because early treated PKU children are healthy, with normal fatty acid turnover, these data may indicate a need to supply some DHA to children in general. Further studies are ongoing aiming at establishing quantitative DHA requirements in children.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To date, little research has been done on managing the organizational and political dimensions of generating and improving forecasts in corporate settings. We examine the implementation of a supply chain planning process at a consumer electronics company, concentrating on the forecasting approach around which the process revolves. Our analysis focuses on the forecasting process and how it mediates and accommodates the functional biases that can impair the forecast accuracy. We categorize the sources of functional bias into intentional, driven by misalignment of incentives and the disposition of power within the organization, and unintentional, resulting from informational and procedural blind spots. We show that the forecasting process, together with the supporting mechanisms of information exchange and elicitation of assumptions, is capable of managing the potential political conflict and the informational and procedural shortcomings. We also show that the creation of an independent group responsible for managing the forecasting process, an approach that we distinguish from generating forecasts directly, can stabilize the political dimension sufficiently to enable process improvement to be steered. Finally, we find that while a coordination system—the relevant processes, roles and responsibilities, and structure—can be designed to address existing individual and functional biases in the organization, the new coordination system will in turn generate new individual and functional biases. The introduced framework of functional biases (whether those biases are intentional or not), the analysis of the political dimension of the forecasting process, and the idea of a coordination system are new constructs to better understand the interface between operations management and other functions. </jats:p>",

Our findings provide evidence supporting the asymmetric effect of positive and negative money supply shocks on real output and inflation in China. That is, real GDP growth in China responds to negative money supply shocks but not positive money supply shocks. In addition, inflation responds to positive money supply shocks but not negative money supply shocks. We conclude that the People's Bank of China's policy of steady monetary growth appears to be appropriate. Our study offers important policy implications for China.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this study, we seek to better understand the value of information technology (IT) in supply chain contexts. Grounded in the resource-based theory in conjunction with transaction cost economics, we develop a conceptual model that links three IT-related resources (backend integration, managerial skills, and partner support) to firm performance improvement. The model differs from previous studies by proposing a moderating effect of competition on the resource-performance relationships. Using data of 743 manufacturing firms, our analysis indicates significant contribution of IT to supply chains, which is generated through development of the digitally enabled integration capability and manifested at the process level along the supply chain. The technological resource alone, however, does not hold the answer to IT value creation. In fact, managerial skills, which enable adaptations on supply chain processes and corporate strategy to accommodate the use of IT, are shown to play the strongest role in IT value creation. Furthermore, backend integration and managerial skills are found to be more valuable in more competitive environments. While commodity-like resources have diminishing value under competition, integrational and managerial resources become even stronger. Overall, our results shed light on the key drivers of IT-enabled supply chains, and provide insights into how competition shapes IT value. </jats:p>",

Agreement or disagreement with the statement “I feel there are enough doctors in my community” constituted the principal outcome. Weighted chi‐square analysis and a generalized estimating equation (GEE) assessed the strength of association between perceptions of an adequate physician workforce and county PtP ratios, individual characteristics, attitudes about and experiences with medical care, and other county characteristics. <jats:bold>Findings:</jats:bold> Forty‐nine percent of respondents agreed there were enough doctors in their communities, 46% did not agree, and 5% were undecided. Respondents of counties with higher PtP ratios were only somewhat more likely to agree that there were enough local doctors (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.09, P &lt; .001). Multivariate analyses revealed that perceiving that there were enough local physicians was more common among men, those 65 and older, whites, and those with lower regard for physician care. Perceptions that the local physician supply was inadequate were more common for those who had longer travel distances, problems with affordability, and little confidence in their physicians. Perceptions of physician shortages were more common in counties with higher poverty rates. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> County PtP ratios only partially account for rural perceptions that there are or are not enough local physicians. Perceptions of an adequate local physician workforce are also related to how much people value physicians’ care and whether they face other barriers to care.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Distributed or decentralised generation (DG) using advanced fossil fuel and renewable energy technologies is an attractive alternative to traditional electricity generation. Over 75% of new generating capacity installed in the Australian state of Victoria between 2000 and 2010 will be DG from gas turbines and wind farms. However, it is uncertain if this new capacity will be sufficient to maintain historic levels of electricity supply reliability. The contribution of DG to Victoria’s electricity supply in 2010 has been assessed, through analysis of modelled supply and demand data and comparisons with data from 2000. While it was assumed that new gas turbines will provide peak load and emergency generation, the role of wind farms was evaluated by considering their equivalent firm capacity estimated using statistical and probabilistic methods. Results show that all DG from gas turbines will contribute to Victoria's electricity supply in 2010, but only 4-30% of installed wind farm capacity can be considered firm or reliable. Technical performance indicators suggest that the new generating capacity will be unable to satisfy increased demand with adequate reliability. Additional base load capacity and demand reduction measures are required to ensure Victoria’s electricity supply reliability is maintained in the future. </jats:p>",

This is a unique development project in which the Tenganan people have identified their own needs and developed their own conceptual solution to the problem. For the first time, EWB is undertaking the design phase for the water system by an off-shore design team and project assistance team (PAT) based in Australia. This allows EWB to draw on resources and experience of EWB members and their employing companies in Australia. It also enables young engineers to develop skills and experience in development work without having to leave the country. However, the innovative approach also presented significant challenges to the project members, particularly in establishing appropriate design criteria and the co-ordination of simultaneous activities across Australia. This paper describes the approach taken by EWB and makes a preliminary assessment of the benefits and limitations inherent in this approach. The overall aim of the project is to produce a successful “bottom-up” development action that will deliver a sustainable solution to the Tenganan community.</jats:p>",

The material was collected at <jats:italic>Goiás Carnes</jats:italic> Freezer Warehouse in Goiania, Goias. It was found that the deep lingual artery penetrated the lower lateral region of the prominence of the dorsal area of the tongue, advancing rostrally between the hyoid bone and the hypoglossal muscle. In the intravisceral initial third, the artery represents the deep, sinuous continuation branch of the lingual artery, in which path the sublingual artery was stressed in the ventral plan. Then, the artery deepened in the interior of the hypoglossal muscles and genioglossal, supplying dorsal branches (from three to nine) for the lingual torus; from one to five dorsal collateral branches for the lingual cavity; and one or two ventral collateral branches. At the lingual apex, the artery undergoes bifurcation supplying collateral, dorsal and ventral branches with anastomoses between the parallel vessels in the same antimere and between branches of lower caliber hierarchy between opposite antemeres. The large presence of microvessels indicates a significant blood supply to the organ. These results, in comparison with those found in literature, suggest a peculiar vascular pattern for this cattle breed of Indian origin.</jats:p>",

These infrastructures are exposed not only to natural hazards, but also to technical failure and terrorist attack. The effects of such events extend beyond direct users as they upset the performance of other systems. During a crisis, other infrastructures, like hospitals and other emergency systems, may be unable to respond. Economic losses may ensue in industrial facilities or power generation and distribution. Decision-makers therefore have to decide how infrastructures can be strengthened and operated to cope with hazardous situations. This paper discusses the technical and scientific challenges faced in building and applying decision models that include risk/uncertainty issues for the planning, design and management of urban water infrastructures. </jats:p>",

Knowledge of these costs is critical for the design of conservation‐payment programs. Estimating these costs accurately is difficult because the minimum acceptable payment to a potential supplier is private information. We describe how an auction of payment contracts can be designed to elicit this information during the design phase of a conservation‐payment program. With an estimate of the ecosystem‐service supply curve from a pilot auction, conservation planners can explore the financial, ecological, and socioeconomic consequences of alternative scaled‐up programs. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in Indonesia, where soil erosion on coffee farms generates downstream ecological and economic costs. Bid data from a small‐scale, uniform‐price auction for soil‐conservation contracts allowed estimates of the costs of a scaled‐up program, the gain from integrating biophysical and economic data to target contracts, and the trade‐offs between poverty alleviation and supply of ecosystem services. Our study illustrates an auction‐based approach to revealing private information about the costs of supplying ecosystem services. Such information can improve the design of programs devised to protect and enhance ecosystem services.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

Significant differences were found in the vitamin C concentrations of fresh strawberries at various stages of the supply chain but not in their moisture content. The ascorbic acid concentration decreased with time spent in the supply chain in all trials but the absolute vitamin C content differed from trial to trial.

In this study, <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> BL(21) harboring a new constructed plasmid (pEHUb‐hGH) was used for producing recombinant human growth hormone (r‐hGH) in 5‐L and 30‐L scale fermentors by supplying air and high purity oxygen, respectively, where the high purity oxygen was produced from a vacuum pressure swing adsorption (PSA). The impact of oxygen supply modes, i.e., air and high purity oxygen, on cell growth and r‐hGH production was investigated in different scale fermentors. In the case of high purity oxygen supply, the final cell density and r‐hGH concentrations were 63.0 and 4.8 g/L in the 5‐L fermentor, 51.6 and 4.0 g/L in the 30‐L fermentor, respectively. In addition, the productivity of r‐hGH was doubled in the 5‐L fermentor, and increased 4‐fold in the 30‐L fermentor, compared to the results obtained in the case of the air supply. The supply of high purity oxygen eliminated the oxygen limitation and acetate formation effectively, and apparently, did not affect the degradation of r‐hGH.

However, the total cardiac membrane n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition remained unchanged after 2 months. This delay could be due to a specific reorganization of the different subcellular membrane PUFA profiles. This study was designed to investigate the evolution between 2 and 6 months of diet duration of the fatty acid profile in sarcolemmal (SL), mitochondrial (MI), nuclear (NU) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane fractions.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 3 dietary groups (n = 10/diet/period), either n-3 PUFA-free diet (CTL), or ALA or DHA-rich diets.

The diet duration increased SFA and decreased PUFA in SL, whereas NU remained constant. The SR and MI enriched in n-3 PUFA exhibited a decreased DHA level with ageing in the DHA and CTL groups. Conversely, the n-3 PUFA level remained unchanged in the ALA group, due to a significant increase in docosapentaenoic acid (DPA). N-3 PUFA rich diets lead to a better PUFA profile in all the fractions and significantly prevent the profile modifications induced by ageing.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>With the ALA diet the n-3 PUFA content, particularly in SR and SL kept increasing between 2 and 6 months, which may partly account for the delay to achieve the modification of adrenergic response.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article deals with the problem of optimal system energy management for combined heat and power production (CHP) with a heat pump. To generate steam and electric power by applying internal sources, an analysed energy system inside its power plant uses a steam boiler, an extraction steam turbine, and a heat pump. Electric power is also purchased from external sources, such as a grid. This leads to the decision problem of determining the economically optimum energy-mix for a given set of conditions. In this article, to select the energy inputs, an optimization method of mixed-integer linear programming is used. Depending on the unit cost of different types of energy the optimal cost-region diagram for the system can be found. This diagram presents a recommendation for the use of an optimum energy consumption of particular composition yielding the minimum energy-operating costs for a CHP system with a heat pump. </jats:p>",

Two distinct and predictable supply mechanisms were resolved. One mechanism consisted of the rapid downwelling of surface water caused by hydraulic control of tidal flow that transports particles from the surface to the corals in less than an hour. The rapid downwelling was recorded on the reef top as a pulse of warm, fluorescent, and relatively clear water at the onset of the flood and ebb tides. The pulse was strongest after flood tide and lasted for up to 3 h. The second mechanism consisted of advection onto the reef of deep bottom water with a high suspended matter load. This advection occurred during peak tides and was combined with topographical current acceleration on the reef top, enhancing delivery of particles to the corals.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The inventory management of the different types of inventory along a supply chain is a complex problem that, in most of the cases of the Colombian and international industry, is dealt through the implementation of inventory software. However, the decision to implement such software is, in many cases, constrained by the financial capacity of investment and by the lack of knowledge of the available software in Colombia. This work presents a review of the inventory software available in Colombia in order to give support to the companies that face the decision of implementing this kind of software. First, we present the state of the art in which we identify the result of the literature review and the use of the inventory software in the Colombian industry. Then, we present the characterization of the inventory software available in the country. This characterization allows the identification of the general configuration of the products included in the study; the management modules, the integration options with other informatics tools, and the general information of prices and installation are also included in the review. Finally, we present the conclusions of the study and identify future research opportunities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The development of radio frequency identification (RFID) systems in recent years has enabled the application of this technology in critical areas such as tracking items of interest, reinforcing greater data security, and providing product authentication. However, the major drawback of RFID technology is its inability to detect the direction of movements, i.e. whether the tags are coming towards the read point and from which side. Hence, the reading obtained for each occasion is basically an indication of the ‘presence’ of the item only. A method of discriminating the direction of the RFID tag movement from returned signals of the RFID system has been developed. This paper describes the series of field measurements, that were conducted to assess the characteristics of the data streams, for the development of directional discrimination system. </jats:p>",
