This concept was developed from the application of discovery process modeling, which was discussed in Chapters 6-8, and from the theory of the exploration play, which was discussed in Chapter 4. Exploring for crude oil and natural gas within an exploration play is an economic activity that progressively attacks the parent population of undiscovered oil and gas fields that occur under the fairway of the play. The exploration process deals with large risks that arise from the uncertainties associated with the amounts of crude oil and natural gas found when a new discovery is made that starts a play, as well as with the number of wildcat wells needed to make additional discoveries in the early phase of an exploration play.</jats:p>",

The two procedures evaluated were word supply and sentence repeat. The teacher supplied the reader with the correct word immediately after each student error during the word-supply condition. During the sentence-repeat condition, the teacher supplied the correct word immediately after each student error, required the student to repeat the correct word, complete reading the sentence, and then reread the entire sentence. Both word-supply and sentence-repeat procedures were effective in reducing oral reading errors when compared to a no-intervention control condition, but sentence repeat was superior to word supply. In addition, a similar relationship was found between the two procedures when the students were tested for retention on the same reading passages a week later. These results show that sentence repeat is more effective than is the commonly used word-supply procedure in remediating the oral reading errors of students with moderate mental retardation. </jats:p>",

This is because neither of the major components of the integrated models offer an adequately specified supply side. Integrating two demand-driven models does not produce a model with supply and demand interaction. The prospects that integrated models will improve on this score, particularly at the subnational level, are not high. Rather, it is suggested that the integrated modeling strategies be skipped over and a computable general equilibrium modeling strategy be adopted. </jats:p>",

The scheme provided a safe supply of clean drinking water to 85 000 people based in 18 village centres.</jats:p>",

Graphs of nitrogen fixed versus available soil nitrogen had a reverse linear‐plateau shape with a plateau at lower soil nitrogen levels that broke sharply in a linear decline as available soil N surpassed a minimum threshold. Such a two‐phase response suggests that nitrogen fixation by the clover was limited by soil N supply above this threshold and by other limiting factors at low soil N levels, perhaps genetic traits controlling carbon assimilation or environmental limitations other than nitrogen. Seasonal nitrogen process patterns showed abundant nitrogen fixation by the clover after it had depleted most of the soil nitrogen supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the early part of this century, August Krogh proposed a model of oxygen transport in capillaries that assumes that all oxygen is delivered to the capillaries by convection from small terminal arterioles and lost from these capillaries by diffusion. This model and its consequences have been used extensively to interpret whole organ oxygen transport data in terms of diffusion between capillaries and tissues and to relate changes in microvascular hemodynamics to alterations in oxygen transport. We evaluated the appropriateness of such extrapolation by measuring oxygen saturation at discrete locations along the lengths of individual capillaries in the hamster cheek pouch retractor muscle. Our results indicate that the amount of oxygen lost from individual capillaries can be markedly affected by the presence of larger microvessels that frequently cross the capillary path. These larger vessels act either as a diffusive supply of oxygen for the red blood cells within the capillary or as an additional sink for the oxygen depending on the direction of the oxygen tension gradient. This transfer of oxygen between larger microvessels and capillaries attenuates the importance of capillary hemodynamics in oxygen exchange. Therefore, conclusions about local oxygen exchange that utilize only hemodynamic data from whole organ or microvascular experiments and the Krogh model will generally be invalid and should be viewed with caution. </jats:p>",
