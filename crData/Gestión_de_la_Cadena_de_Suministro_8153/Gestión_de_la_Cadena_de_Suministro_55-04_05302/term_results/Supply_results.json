      "abstract": "<jats:p>THE Press was recently given the opportunity of seeing some of the more modern aerodynamic research facilities of the Ministry of Supply at R.A.E. Farnborough and N.A.E. Bedford. The Bedford establishment is administratively part of the R.A.E., and is concerned at present primarily with aerodynamic research on high‚Äêspeed aircraft. Later, work on engines will also be done there. It lies on the borders of three wartime R.A.F. airfields, the original intention being to build a runway which would enable jet aircraft to take off and land again within its length. The establishment has grown up from nothing since the war, and this is reflected in the attractive and orderly disposition of the buildings, their pleasing contemporary architecture, and the general impression of clean design. The site is still in the hands of the contractors, but it can be seen that when it is complete it will be a fine example of what such an establishment should look like. Credit for this must be shared between the Ministry of Supply, the Ministry of Works, and the contractors, who have allowed imagination to play its part in design, without it leading to extravagance. Particularly attractive are the colour schemes in the main administrative block, and the use of colour on the engineering plant itself.</jats:p>",
