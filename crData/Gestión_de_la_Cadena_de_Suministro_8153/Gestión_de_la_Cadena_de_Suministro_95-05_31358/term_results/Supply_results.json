Acclimation of leaves and upper stems before the August test, in most cases, was not stimulated by reduced water content, while the response of lower and middle stems was cultivar- and location-specific. The lower water content treatment after 30 Aug. generally increased freeze tolerance of all plant parts regardless of the previous watering regime. The higher water content treatment after 30 Aug. either prevented or delayed acclimation. This study demonstrated that the reduced water supply provided a feasible means of promoting acclimation of evergreen azaleas in late summer.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Effects of oxygen supply on development rates of embryos in gelatinous masses were tested with natural masses of three species of opisthobranch gastropods and artificial masses made with embryos of a sea urchin and agarose gel. When diffusive exchange was restricted for embryos in such masses, increased oxygen alone was sufficient to maintain development rates of embryos. Diffusive supply of oxygen is therefore a limiting factor for embryos clustered in gelatinous masses. Development rates were constant over a wide range of experimentally altered oxygen concentrations but retarded with oxygen below about 10% of air saturation. Some opisthobranch embryos exposed to low oxygen concentrations hatched with shorter shells. Delayed hatching and shorter shells at hatching were both associated with a central position in the globose gelatinous mass of one of the opisthobranch species, even in air-saturated and vigorously stirred water. The pH near the centres of the masses was lower when embryos were at more advanced stages; thus the intracapsular stirring caused by cilia of embryos at later stages does not compensate for their greater metabolic rates. The pH in some egg masses was about seven or lower, and this pH affected development in separate experiments. The masses approach limits for removal of wastes, although oxygen becomes limiting for rates of development before accumulation of wastes becomes limiting. Embryos of opisthobranchs that are normally aggregated and embryos of sea urchins that are normally dispersed were similarly tolerant of low oxygen concentrations and low pH. In respect to tolerance of hypoxia and accumulating wastes, embryos in many clades are preadapted for aggregation into masses, but there are limits on the size of the aggregation. Egg masses are commonly at those limits.</jats:p>",

Information on borehole depth, well‐easing depth, distance to nearest pesticide mixing area, types of pesticides used, and distance to nearest field application was obtained for each site. Four herbicides [alachlor, 2‐chloro‐2′‐6′diethyl‐N‐(methoxymethyl)‐acetanilide; atrazine, 2‐chloro‐4‐ethylamino‐6‐isopropylamino‐<jats:italic>s</jats:italic>‐triazine; metolachlor, 2‐chloro‐N‐(2‐ethyl‐6‐methylphenyl)‐N‐(2‐methoxy‐1‐methylethyl) acetamide; trifluralin, α,α,α‐trifluoro‐2,6‐dinitro‐N,N‐dipropyl‐p‐toluidine] were detected in the samples, with detection frequencies of 8.8, 8.2, 3.6, and 1.8%, respectively. About 15% of the samples contained at least one of these herbicides, with resampling indicating persistence throughout the year. Only alachlor concentrations were in excess of maximum contaminant levels (MCLs; 2.0 μg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) or Health Advisory Levels (HALs; 0.4 μg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Neither atrazine nor alachlor detection exhibited statistical correlation with well depth, although both were rarely detected in wells &gt;100 feet deep. Atrazine concentrations and detection frequencies did not correlate with distance to nearest application site, while alachlor had a significantly greater detection frequency for wells further from the nearest application site. For nearly one‐half of the wells with detectable atrazine and alachlor, there was no reported usage of either herbicide on the same farm during the previous three years, possibly indicating herbicide transport in groundwater or long times before degrading. No statistically significant relationships were observed between the presence of alachior or atrazine, and distance from the well to the nearest pesticide handling and storage area. Although inconclusive by itself, this indicates that at least some contamination originated from other than point‐source spills. Nitrate‐N concentrations in well water were poor predictors for atrazine and alachlor presence in this study.</jats:p>",

The activation of glucose oxidation via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), induced by exposure of cells to 200 μmol/l H2O2 for 1 h, was reduced by 50% (P &amp;lt; 0.01) in cells cultured for 5–7 days in 33 mmol/l D-glucose (HG) versus those cultured in 5.5 mmol/l D-glucose without (NG) or with (HR) 27.5 mmol/l D-raffinose. The intracellular NADPH content in HG cells, but not in NG or HR cells, was decreased by 42% (P &amp;lt; 0.01) by exposing cells to 200 μmol/l H2O2. The decrease in NADPH was dependent on D-glucose concentration in the medium and was prevented in glutathione (GSH)-depleted cells. The latter observation suggests that the decrease in NADPH is associated with activation of the GSH redox cycle. In the presence of 200 μmol/l H2O2, lactate release into the medium, NADH/NAD ratio, and phosphofructokinase activity in HG cells were 56, 53, and 68% greater, respectively, than in the NG group, which indicates that inhibition of glycolysis by H2O2 is less marked in the HG group compared with NG group. These results indicate that activation of the PPP was impaired in endothelial cells cultured under conditions of high-glucose and oxidative stress, resulting in a decreased supply of NADPH to various NADPH-dependent pathways, including the GSH redox cycle.</jats:p>",
