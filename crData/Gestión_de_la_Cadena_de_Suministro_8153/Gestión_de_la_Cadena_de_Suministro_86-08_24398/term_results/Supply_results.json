In this article it is suggested that individuals'decisions on whether to participate in criminal activity depend on perceived sanction levels that depend in turn on sanction levels realized in past periods. With decisions made in this manner, crime rates and sanction levels are not determined simultaneously, and the identification problem in its usual form does not arise. Our econometric results are consistent with this view; arrest and imprisonment sanctions have little contemporaneous effect on burglary, larceny, and robbery rates. Lagged effects, although greater than contemporaneous effects, are statistically significant only in the case of robbery. </jats:p>",

However, appears to be less certain towards the year 2030.Emerging global trends for the supply of and demand for industrial roundwood suggest a shift in the production, consumption and trade. This shift is predicated on a number of supply and demand factors. The key demand factor is the slowing down of population and economic growth in the developed countries which implies a lesser rate of growth in consumption of forest products. The key supply factor is the rate of establishment of plantations of fast growing species in the tropical and sub-tropical regions which implies shift in the comparative advantage of producing industrial wood away from the northern hemisphere. The implications for Canada are significant and suggest more dynamic interpretation of where our comparative advantage in forest products lies.

Yet, phytoplankton are often observed to be responsible for only a very small fraction of the total planktonic community uptake of orthophosphate. Is this uptake of orthophosphate by algae nonetheless sufficient to meet their metabolic needs? To answer this question, I have compared the specific doubling rates of C and of P through orthophosphate uptake in the phytoplankton community of Lake Memphremagog. Orthophosphate uptake during the growing season supplied only a very small portion of the P required to support algal growth. Presumably, the phytoplankton obtained their P from some source other than orthophosphate uptake. Similar patterns of orthophosphate uptake in other P-limited lakes suggest that this phenomenon may be widespread.</jats:p>",

Drouet 625 (=<jats:italic>Synechococcus</jats:italic> Naeg. 6301) in the presence (gross rate) and absence (net rate) of an inhibitor of protein synthesis, and on the rate of repair of photoinhibitory damage, are analysed. The analysis makes assumptions about the relationship between changes in the efficiency of photosynthesis and changes in the number of undamaged photoreaction two reaction centres, the number of photoreaction centres of photoreaction two per unit cell volume, and the <jats:italic>M<jats:sub>r</jats:sub></jats:italic> of the photodamageable polypeptide associated with photoreaction two. With this background, the rate of protein synthesis (mol amino acid incorporated (m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> cell volume)<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) which is required to just balance the rate of protein destruction in gross photoinhibition, or to support the rate of protein synthesis in repair, is computed. The conclusions drawn from this analysis are:</jats:p><jats:p>(1) Repair of (gross) photodamage which is known to be submaximal requires rates of protein synthesis up to 1/10 of the rate of net protein synthesis at the μ<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> of <jats:italic>Anacystis nidulans</jats:italic>, and about 1/50 of the maximum possible capacity for protein synthesis deduced from the RNA content of <jats:italic>Anacystis nidulans</jats:italic> and the RNA‐based protein synthesis capacity of <jats:italic>Escherichia coli.</jats:italic></jats:p><jats:p>(2) The rates of protein synthesis computed in (1) use up to 1/5 of the ATP production rate from oxidative phosphorylation in darkness and up to 1/10 of the ATP production rate (including photophosphorylation) at an incident photon flux density of 5 μmol photon (400 to 700nm)m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup></jats:p><jats:p>(3) Cells subject to photoinhibitory damage, and its repair, have an additional requirement for protein synthesis and ATP generation over cells not subject to photoinhibition. These additional requirements may limit both μ<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> and the efficiency of light‐limited growth.</jats:p>",
