      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The automotive parts supply chain measures its success in terms of parts availability and stock required to achieve the availability target, measured as allocation fill rate (AFR). The supply chain strives to achieve an AFR target of 95.5% while maintaining low levels of stock.Objective: The first objective of this study is to evaluate the current inventory management approach, namely the maximum inventory position (MIP) method, to understand the difference between the theoretical derivation and the actual implementation. The second objective is to develop and compare the performance of a new stock target setting (STS) method relative to the MIP methods.Method: The theoretical and actual equations behind the MIP and STS methods are derived for steady state as well as stochastic conditions. A system dynamics simulation model (SDSM) was developed to describe both the local and imported supply chains. The SDSM was used to simulate and confirm the parameters for the STS method. It was also used to compare the three inventory management methods against a theoretical environment and actual data sets.Results: The STS method requires a damping factor (DF) to ensure it does not cause the bullwhip effect. The SDSM was used to determine that a value equal to the lead time ensures effective damping. In the theoretical environment, the MIPTheory method requires the lowest stock, but also has the lowest AFR. MIPActual achieves the highest AFR, but with significantly higher stock holding. The STS method improves on the AFR achieved by the MIPTheory method, with lower stock holding than the MIPActual method. With the actual demand data sets, the results vary by parts movement type. With fast moving parts, all methods achieve the AFR target, the MIPActual method has a higher stock holding for all cases, and the STS method results in reduced stock holding for 7 of 12 cases. With medium moving parts, the MIPActual method improves on the AFR in all 15 cases, but with significantly higher stock. The STS method increases the AFR in 7 of 15 cases and reduces the stockholding in 11 of 15 cases. With slow moving parts, both the MIPActual and STS methods improve the AFR with increased stock holding. The increase in stock holding for the STS method is significantly lower. With erratic moving parts, the MIPActual method improves on the AFR in all 17 cases, but requires significantly higher stock holding. The STS method achieves lower AFR values in 10 of 17 cases, but also requires lower or equal stock holding in 10 of 17 cases.Conclusion: The STS method provides a new approach to inventory management in the automotive supply chain. It provides improved performance for lower stock holding than the implemented MIP method (MIPActual). The results for the different movement category suggest that there is further research to be done to confirm the effectiveness of the various methods with other demand distributions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Designing and implementation of reverse logistics (RL) network which meets the sustainability targets have been a matter of emerging concern for the electronics companies in India.Objectives: The present study developed a two-phase model for configuration of sustainable RL network design for an Indian manufacturing company to manage its end-of-life and endof-use electronic products. The notable feature of the model was the evaluation of facilities under financial, environmental and social considerations and integration of the facility selection decisions with the network design.Method: In the first phase, an integrated Analytical Hierarchical Process Complex Proportional Assessment methodology was used for the evaluation of the alternative locations in terms of their degree of utility, which in turn was based on the three dimensions of sustainability. In the second phase, the RL network was configured as a bi-objective programming problem, and fuzzy optimisation approach was utilised for obtaining a properly efficient solution to the problem.Results: The compromised solution attained by the proposed fuzzy model demonstrated that the cost differential for choosing recovery facilities with better environmental and social performance was not significant; therefore, Indian manufacturers must not compromise on the sustainability aspects for facility location decisions.Conclusion: The results reaffirmed that the bi-objective fuzzy decision-making model can serve as a decision tool for the Indian manufacturers in designing a sustainable RL network. The multi-objective optimisation model captured a reasonable trade-off between the fuzzy goals of minimising the cost of the RL network and maximising the sustainable performance of the facilities chosen.</jats:p>"

We draw upon resource dependence theory and transaction cost economics to suggest that variation in risk management strategies is dependent upon both the complexity of the procured product or service and the extent to which it is mission critical. In this preliminary study of public‐sector supply chains, we find evidence based on an analysis of over 240,000 buyer–supplier contracts that when both mission criticality and service complexity are low, suppliers tend to bear most of the disruption risk by agreeing to fixed‐price contracts. When mission criticality is high, we find that the federal government is more likely to share risk with suppliers by utilizing incentive contracts. Evidence suggests that cost‐reimbursement and incentive contracts are preferred when service complexity is high.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Early research on buyer–supplier relationships was based on two cornerstones: relational governance mechanisms and superior value creation for the whole supply chain. Relational governance mechanisms, based on trust and informal safeguards, can lead to higher value creation, while lack of trust and opportunism can be controlled by contractual governance mechanisms. To date, however, few studies have investigated the role of power asymmetry in collaboration and how the total value is distributed between buyer and supplier. The amount each partner appropriates depends on their relative power in the relationship, which has further implications in governance and relationship continuation, yet that has not been thoroughly explored in the literature. To fill this gap, this study investigates the influence of power asymmetry on governance and value appropriation in collaborative relationships, from both the buyers’ and suppliers’ perspectives. This article contributes to the buyer–supplier literature by exploring the gains of both the stronger and weaker partners in the dyad. Based on in‐depth case studies with buyers and suppliers of the personal care and cosmetics (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PC</jats:styled-content>&amp;C), and food and beverage (F&amp;B) industries in Brazil, we found insights concerning the influence of power asymmetry and interdependence on governance mechanisms, as well as the complementarity of value appropriation inside and outside the dyad. We also propose a framework to represent the interplay between perceived justice and power asymmetry in long‐term relationships.</jats:p>",

The results of an analysis of 3,638 buyer–supplier relationships provide support for the hypothesized direct effects of focal firm financial dependence and supplier financial dependence on firm financial performance. Our results also support our hypothesis regarding the moderating effect of dependence asymmetry on the relationship between lean inventory strategies on financial performance.

Indeed, new digital technologies will foster the emergence of the connected supply chain as a critical element for risk management. Supply chain connectivity is defined as the seamless flow of materials, information, and financial resources along the supply chain, enabled by two factors: information systems connectivity and physical connectivity. This paper analyzes both factors and how new technologies can improve them. It also discusses the barriers that prevent the achievement of a connected supply chain and, with it, improved risk management.

When a buyer exerts power on a supplier, the supplier response can be either simple compliance or commitment at a deeper level. Theoretically, the latter pertains to a supplier's intrinsic motivation. Building on cognitive evaluation theory, our model proposes the distinctive yet interactive nature of reward power and coercive power, commonly considered together as mediated powers. It also posits that nonmediated powers (expert, referent, and legitimate) amplify the influences of reward and coercive powers. An empirical investigation, based on large‐scale multinational survey data, provides support for our theoretical arguments.

Recent studies show that this region is experiencing increasing trends in total precipitation and extreme precipitation events. To assess the impact of this and other possible climatic changes on the water supply, there is a need to develop future climate scenarios that can be used as input to hydrological and reservoir models. Recently, stochastic weather generators (SWGs) have been used in climate change adaptation studies because of their ability to produce synthetic weather time series. This study examines the performance of a set of SWGs with varying levels of complexity to simulate daily precipitation characteristics, with a focus on extreme events. To generate precipitation occurrence, three Markov chain models (first, second, and third orders) were evaluated in terms of simulating average and extreme wet days and dry/wet spell lengths. For precipitation magnitude, seven models were investigated, including five parametric distributions, one resampling technique, and a polynomial-based curve fitting technique. The methodology applied here to evaluate SWGs combines several different types of metrics that are not typically combined in a single analysis. It is found that the first-order Markov chain performs as well as higher orders for simulating precipitation occurrence, and two parametric distribution models (skewed normal and mixed exponential) are deemed best for simulating precipitation magnitudes. The specific models that were found to be most applicable to the region may be valuable in bottom-up vulnerability studies for the watershed, as well as for other nearby basins.</jats:p>",

Thus, we theorize that exchange diffusion in power‐advantaged firms will limit their ability to use their power. Furthermore, and perhaps less intuitively, we argue that diffusion in weaker firms will also limit the ability of the stronger firm to use its power. In other words, we theorize that exchange diffusion “disarms” the stronger firm—regardless of whether self‐ or partner‐inflicted. Our key contribution is to offer theorizing centered on power nonuse.

The first 24-48 hours of shock seem to be critical. Monitoring of global RBF and its intrarenal distribution is not possible in current clinical practice. The only way for optimization of renal blood supply is optimization of macrohemodynamics. In volume-responsive AKI, fluid therapy restores kidney function. Many clinical signs and parameters can be of use in determining the volume status. The accuracy of the assessment may be improved with the help of tools quantifying the clinical parameters (e.g. hypovolemic index – HVI). The basis of intravenous fluid therapy are crystalloids, and their effect is reported to be shorter than 120 min. Every form of hydroxyethyl starch has been shown to be harmful for patients at risk of impaired renal function. In sepsis, the boundary between volume-responsive and volume-unresponsive AKI is blurred. Fluid responsiveness can be lost in the course of AKI as early as on the first day of sepsis. According to the results of the ARDS Network study, the conservative approach in fluid therapy resulted in a shorter time of mechanical ventilation and did not affect the renal function, except for a slight increase of the serum creatinine level. Fluid overload is to be avoided, as renal venous and lymphatic congestion can limit the urine filtration rate, further worsening edema.</jats:p>"

The main aims of this study to use building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system beside its functions that has mentioned above, to reduce the energy consumption from the cooling load of buildings in warm climate regions.  The paper investigated the optimum integration of the photovoltaic system into the building envelope that could produce a reasonable power output and minimizes the heat gains in warm climate regions. The simulation software Autodesk Ecotect Analysis was used to simulate three main PV integrations, window sunshade, roof screen and double skin façade into an assumed office-building model located in the city of Benghazi, Libya. The simulations provided good information for analyzing the potential contribution of the BIPV system on the energy saving according to the PV thermal performance and the power supply generated from the sun, and the final discussion results in choosing the sunshade PV integration as the optimum integration that could produce a reasonable power output and minimizes the heat gains in warm climate regions.</jats:p>"

A reduction in the experience premium is a fundamental driver of declines in upper-tail (90/50) inequality, while a decline in the education premium is the primary determinant of the evolution of lower-tail (50/10) inequality. Relative labor supply is important for explaining changes in the skill premiums. Relative demand trends favored high-skilled workers during the 1990s, shifting in favor of low-skilled workers during the 2000s. Changes in the minimum wage, and more importantly, commodity-led terms of trade improvements are key factors behind these relative skill demand trends.</jats:p>"

Data from the performance measurement system should cause an increase of cooperation and help in taking right decisions about changes at the operational level, and on the other hand, are an important information when redefining strategies. This will allow for the development of the supply chain based on knowledge, in which the scope of cooperation is literally unlimited (including green aspects). There are two basic approaches to measuring the performance of supply chains: a comprehensive measurement that measures the results of the entire chain (which can be divided into individual tiers and levels) and partial measurement when we measure only certain aspects. Often, in practice, only measurement of separately operating companies is practiced by companies, not throughout chains. And the problem is even more evident when it comes to measuring performance of green activities in integrated supply chains. The paper presents the possibilities of evaluation of GSCM performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban wastewater and storm management has a long history which coincides with the appearance of the first organized human settlements (ca. 3500 BC). It began in prehistoric Crete during the Early Bronze Age (ca. 3200 BC) when many remarkable developments occurred in several stages known as Minoan civilization. One of its salient characteristics was the architecture and function of its hydraulic works and especially the drainage and sewerage systems and other sanitary infrastructures in the Minoan palaces and other settlements. These technologies, although they do not give a complete picture of wastewater and stormwater technologies in ancient Greece, indicate that such technologies have been used in Greece since the Minoan times. Minoan sanitary technologies were transferred to the Greek mainland in the subsequent phases of Greek civilization, i.e. in the Mycenaean, Classical, Hellenistic, Roman, and present times. The scope of this article is the presentation and discussion of the evolution of waste- and stormwater management through the long history of Greece, focusing on the hydraulic characteristics of sanitary infrastructures. Also, the present and future trends of wastewater and stormwater management are considered. Practices achieved in prehistoric Greece may have some relevance for wastewater engineering even in modern times.</jats:p>",

Teluk Ambon dengan nilai terbesar yaitu 3,5. setelah dilakukan perhitungan terhadap faktor tangibel dan intangibel maka diperoleh nilai terbesar yaitu 3,5. Aksesibilitas perusahaan masih tergolong cukup baik. Avaibilitas atau ketersediaan bahan baku untuk seluruh perusahaan masih menjadi permasalahan, yang disebabkan oleh pengaruh faktor iklim, musiman ikan  dan lainnya. Ditinjau dari segi cost untuk harga beli perusahan terhadap harga beli dan harga jual perusahaan untuk wilayah Kota Ambon tidak mengalami kesenjangan harga yang begitu besar.

Producer service markets are driven by the need for specialized expertise that often cannot easily be produced in‐house by purchasers. Niche market positions characterize most producer service firms. The demand for producer services as inputs in the production process has expanded due to the growing need for specialized expertise and expanded government regulations. Face‐to‐face meetings are important aspects of the production process for producer services, supplemented by digital means of communication.</jats:p>"

Here we set out to better understand the repeatability of evolution, which is a necessary condition for predictability. We explored experimentally the effect of mutation supply and the strength of selective pressure on the repeatability of selection from standing genetic variation. Different sizes of mutant libraries of an antibiotic resistance gene, TEM-1 β-lactamase in<jats:italic>Escherichia coli,</jats:italic>were subjected to different antibiotic concentrations. We determined whether populations went extinct or survived, and sequenced the TEM gene of the surviving populations. The distribution of mutations per allele in our mutant libraries—generated by error-prone PCR—followed a Poisson distribution. Extinction patterns could be explained by a simple stochastic model that assumed the sampling of beneficial mutations was key for survival. In most surviving populations, alleles containing at least one known large-effect beneficial mutation were present. These genotype data also support a model which only invokes sampling effects to describe the occurrence of alleles containing large-effect driver mutations. Hence, evolution is largely predictable given cursory knowledge of mutational fitness effects, the mutation rate and population size. There were no clear trends in the repeatability of selected mutants when we considered all mutations present. However, when only known large-effect mutations were considered, the outcome of selection is less repeatable for large libraries, in contrast to expectations. Furthermore, we show experimentally that alleles carrying multiple mutations selected from large libraries confer higher resistance levels relative to alleles with only a known large-effect mutation, suggesting that the scarcity of high-resistance alleles carrying multiple mutations may contribute to the decrease in repeatability at large library sizes.</jats:p>"

Examples are given of applications which aimed at the storage of water for drinking and other purposes such as irrigation, achieving environmental goals and disposal of wastewater. Applications aiming at drinking water production usually faced issues related to the quality of the abstracted water not meeting drinking water standards with respect to various elements, such as iron, manganese and arsenic. Storage of water in brackish aquifers was complicated by buoyancy effects making part of the recharged water irrecoverable. Recharge of water with the purpose of recovering declined groundwater tables and fighting seawater intrusion was hindered by clogging of the injection well while the disposal of wastewater was limited to aquifers of lower groundwater quality.</jats:p>",

Developments in the supply chain design and analysis have helped coal mining and coal trading companies expand their businesses, but at the same time, have forced them to consolidate their assets and downsize any underused storage facilities. In the coal mining industry, the problem of consolidation and downsizing becomes much more complicated due to the variety in quality parameters (hence many coal grades) involved, locational zones and different number of market players. Furthermore, for the last decade, the storage allocation and assignment problem has received a great deal of attention within the Logistics and Operation Research (OR) area. Yet, little attention has been given to the modeling of coal supply chains and the issue of strategic supply chain planning of coal-producing and coal-trading companies. Similar to the generic warehouse consolidation problem (WCP), in specific cases of coal-producing and coal-trading companies, storage facilities that are redundant or underutilized can be eliminated without causing a negative impact on customer and service levels. In this context, this paper discusses the background of the problem and proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model mainly intended for storage and distribution network reconfiguration of a coal-producing or trading company. The model, which can be implemented in a high-level mathematical modelling system such as GAMS or AIMMS, captures the essential methodological features of a warehouse restructuring and/or consolidation problem and can be applied in practice.</jats:p>",

When credit condition deteriorates, the former has no choice but borrow at the very short end of the maturity spectrum, whereas the latter evades refinancing risk more readily by borrowing at the end. Taken together, these findings indicate a vital role of capital supply in determining debt maturity.</jats:p>"

This solution is based on energy profiles which were derived from the analyses and measurements, and on applying appropriately modified hybrid supply sources. Catalogue data are often used in support of an analysis of performance of electronic appliances. For a user, documents prepared by a manufacturer are the main source of information concerned with the amount and quality of electric energy sources required for the appliance to work properly. Investigations carried out in real conditions often verify this data, which provides a base for seeking alternative solutions in the course of designing new sources of power, e.g. such as the ones proposed in the article.</jats:p>",

The model consists of a matrix transformation method using data on demography, education, labour market statistics from survey and administrative sources and gross value added from the National Accounts. This framework is used to quantitatively assess the economic impact of specific labour market policies, such as those pertaining to education and re-training, active labour market policies and inflows or outflows of workers from the labour market.</jats:p>"

The basic methodology in creating projections on the labor market in the Republic of Serbska (RS) is statistical extrapolation of trends in demand and supply of labor at the level of the RS. Data for this study were standard reports of statistical institutions (Statistical Yearbook, Labor Force Survey, etc.), as well as special reports generated for the specific needs of this research. The results show that in the next 6 years, the number of working-age population will shrink by a further 59,000 people with 867,000 to 808,000. Out of the total working-age population, ie the active population. labor force (the sum of employed and unemployed) is will not change greatly, while the level of the inactive population, ie. working-age population not seeking employment will drop significantly. On the other hand, our projections show that, even in terms of the decline in the working-age population, the demand for labor will continue to grow. Also, according to projections, the number of unemployed ie. the excess of supply over demand of the labor force will decrease in the period 2017-2021. All this will not be without impact on wage levels. Total average gross wages will rise by 2021, but wage growth in the manufacturing industry will be much more pronounced. Therefore, it is essential to increase productivity and added value of companies because it is the only way to compensate for this increase in wages.</jats:p>",

Latvia farmers have seasonal milk production with peak every summer and through every winter, to produce milk at as low a cost as possible. Between 2002 and 2015 milk production supply is increased twice or from 384871.4 to 807572.1 ton. In 2002 the average milk production supply price in Latvia was 135.7 EUR per ton and between 2002 and 2008 milk price was increased till 338.9 EUR per ton. Milk prices in 2015 were, on average, around 25-29% lower than in 2014 and was in average 135.7 EUR per ton. Therefore, after the abolition of milk quotas in the European Union, the cow milk production in Latvia has increased continuously and increased by 3176 tonnes (0.4%) in 2015 compared to 2014. According to the analysis of covariance milk supply amount is influenced by milk products consumer price index (CPI) and year, and milk products CPI depends on milk production supply price and year. There is significant interaction effect between factors; the effect of milk products CPI on milk supply and production supply price on milk products CPI is different for different years.Keywords: milk suplly and demand; milk products consumer price index; time series models</jats:p>"

Given that Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a known methodology used for analysing engineering systems, the approach is usually conducted using known failure data. But most offshore operations are conducted in a challenging and uncertain environment and the failure data of some of these systems are usually unavailable requiring a flexible and yet robust algorithm for their analysis. This paper therefore seeks to analyse the complex structure of Offshore Supply Vessel (OSV) collision with platforms by incorporating a Fuzzy Fault Tree Analysis (FFTA) method. Fuzzy set theory provides the flexibility to represent vague information from the analysis process. The methodology is structured in such a manner that diverse sets of data are integrated and synthesized for analysing the system. It is envisaged that the proposed method could provide the analyst with a framework to evaluate the risks of collision enabling informed decisions regarding the deployments of resources for system improvement.</jats:p>",

FSO/PMC was synthesized by a co-precipitation–impregnation method and characterized using scanning electron microscope, N2 adsorption–desorption, X-ray fluorescence, and pHpzc measurements. Results showed that the FSO/PMC/O3 process obviously improved total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency from 32.3% (using sole ozonation) to 73.3% in 60 min. DCF mineralization in various oxidation processes was found to follow a two-stage pseudo-first-order kinetics. The presence of FSO/PMC effectively improved the mass transfer of ozone from gas to liquid phase and increased the efficiency of ozone decomposition, which results in the formation of •OH radicals. The ozonation of DCF generated large amounts of the ozone-refractory carboxylic acids, and these compounds were found to be continuously removed in the FSO/PMC/O3 process due to the catalytic activity of FSO/PMC. The synergetic effect between ozonation and FSO/PMC adsorption indicated that FSO/PMC is a promising catalyst for the ozonation process.</jats:p>",

The reason is that the ratio between impedance and distance to the fault point is not linear in these electrification systems, unlike in 1 × 25 kV power systems. Therefore, the location of ground faults represents a complicated task in 2 × 25 kV railway power supply systems. Various methods have been used to localize the ground fault position in 2 × 25 kV systems. The method described here allows the location of a ground fault to be economically found in an accurate way in real time, using the modules of the circulating currents in different autotransformers when the ground fault occurs. This method first needs to know the subsection and the conductor (catenary or feeder) with the defect, then localizes the ground fault’s position.</jats:p>"

Six isolates from the river showed the same ERIC pattern of the cattle, of which four expressed the same AMR profile. E. coli isolates from water were represented in A, B1, C, and D phylo-groups. Phylo-groups A, B1, and E were more prevalent in the cattle isolates and B2 was absent in both sources. Three of the water isolates with the same ERIC-type and AMR to cattle isolates showed the same phylo-groups. Genetic characteristics, AMR, and phylo-groups of the isolates from the river are diverse and complex.

In addition, given that the labor choice for private- and public-sector hours is made in succession, the insurance market for public emloy- ment needs to open once the other insurance market has closed. This segmentation and sequentiality of insurance markets operation is a new result in the literature and a direct consequence of the double non-convexity, and the sequential nature of the sectoral labor supply decision.</jats:p>"

The effect of parameters influencing the extraction efficiency such as sample pH, concentration of surfactant, incubation temperature and time, concentration of NaCl and sample volume were investigated and optimized. The effect of potentially interfering ions on the recovery of iron was also examined. Under optimum conditions, the detection limit (3σ) was 0.95 μg L−1 for Fe using a sample volume of 10 mL. A preconcentration factor of 20 was achieved. The accuracy of the method was checked through the analysis of certified reference materials (SLRS-5 river water, SPS-SW2 Batch 127 surface water) and spiked water samples. The percentage recovery values for spiked water samples were between 92% and 101%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effort to control sediment yield at watershed scale is an ongoing challenge that needs to take into account trade-offs between two conflicting objective functions, i.e. economic and hydrologic criteria. Therefore, researchers have coupled hydrologic and multi-objective optimization models to find Pareto-optimal solutions. However, very limited studies have been conducted to analyse the cost-effectiveness (C/E) of scenarios obtained in the Pareto-front optimal. This could provide new information leading to effective watershed management. Therefore, in the present study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate sediment yield under different combinations of best management practices (BMPs) and was coupled with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). The model attends to providing the Pareto-optimal solutions by minimizing the costs of BMPs and maximizing sediment reduction. The results of the application of the cost-effective optimization model in Mehran watershed, Iran, showed that the solutions in the Pareto-optimal front reduce sediment yield between 2% and 40.5% from baseline at costs of between $6,500 and $72,100, respectively. Finally, comparison of four sediment reduction solutions (i.e. 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%) showed that the total cost and C/E ratio of solutions increased as the sediment reduction criteria increased.</jats:p>",

The second model is based on artificial neural networks (hereinafter referred to as ANN models). Both the models have been applied to three case studies, representing water distribution systems managed by HERA S.p.A., characterized by very different numbers of users served, and consequently very different average water demands, ranging from 900 L/s for the first case study (CS1) to about 8 L/s and1.5 L/s for the second (CS2) and third (CS3) case studies, respectively. The results show that in general, both the models, Patt and ANN, provide good accuracy for the CS1. The performances of both the models tend to decrease for CS2 and, particularly, for CS3. In particular, in the validation phase, the Patt model is more accurate than the ANN model for the CS1; for the CS2, the accuracy of the two models are very similar, and for the CS3 the accuracy of the ANN model is slightly higher than that of the Patt model.</jats:p>",

Three elements of supply chain integration (company integration with suppliers, cross functional integration within a company and company integration with customers) and three elements of supply chain flexibility (adaptability, alignment and agility) were subjected to analysis. The results indicate that supply chain integration and supply chain flexibility exhibit significant correlation with firm performance. Supply chain integration and supply chain flexibility have high correlation with ‘financial performance’ followed by ‘logistic performance’ and then ‘operational performance’. Also, the results demonstrate that four supply chain integration surrogates; ‘production data integration’, ‘going after customers for feedback’, ‘periodic connection with customers’ and ‘real time search of inventory’ and two supply chain flexibility proxies specifically ‘technology’ and ‘supply network strategies’ are crucial as they exhibit the most noteworthy influence on firm performance. Results of this study offer remarkable demonstrations of the effects of integration and flexibility in enhancing performance of businesses and greater attention must be paid to those proxies of supply chain integration and flexibility that exhibited the most significant impact on firm’s performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Arctic regions face a unique vulnerability to shifts in seasonality, which influences the summer recharge potential of freshwater reservoirs caused by decreased precipitation and increased evaporative stress. This pressure puts small remote northern communities at risk due to limited existing freshwater supply. The lack of baseline knowledge of existing supply, demand, or reservoir recharge potential increases this risk. We therefore address this knowledge gap through a water resource assessment of municipal supply over a 20 year planning horizon in two communities in Arctic Canada using a novel heuristic model and existing data sources. We generated climate and demand scenarios to identify the mechanisms of drawdown as well as examine the influences on replenishment. We found a pronounced vulnerability to reduced winter precipitation and (or) increased ice thickness of reservoirs. Our heuristic supply forecasts indicate an immediate need for freshwater management strategies for northern communities in Canada. </jats:p>",

In order, 59 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for various anions and cations. Result shows that, mineral weathering, ion exchange and anthropogenic activity are the main hydrochemical processes controlling urban groundwater chemistry. The evaluation of groundwater geochemistry in the flow path beneath the urban area shows that, due to land use changes, the hydrochemical change occurs predominantly in electrical conductivity (EC), Cl− and NO3–. The EC is increased in the direction of groundwater flow and in the last decade in industrial areas. According to the groundwater quality index values, most of the samples fit into the good quality class and samples with poor quality are located in the old residential, parks and agricultural areas of the city. The calculation of the irrigation water quality indices (Na%, sodium adsorption ratio, permeability index, residual sodium carbonate), and industrial water quality indices (Ryznar stability index, Langelier saturation index, Larson–Skold, Puckorius scaling index) indicated that the quality of water for irrigation purposes could be classified in the excellent to permissible categories. However, as for the industrial uses, the results also revealed that most of the samples could be classified in the aggressive and very aggressive categories.</jats:p>",

To achieve the objectives, several composites were prepared with different combinations of Al, Ce and Fe at different temperatures. The fluoride removal by different composites was evaluated, and the best performing composite was selected for further study. Equilibrium sorption experiments and kinetic tests were carried out. The effect of pH and the presence of different co-ions on the removal of fluoride were assessed. Based on the performances, the composites can be ranked as AC-Ce &amp;gt; AC-AlCe &amp;gt; AC-CeFe &amp;gt; AC-AlCeFe &amp;gt; AC-AlFe. The maximum sorption capacity by the AC-Ce composites is in the range of 4.1–4.6 mg/g. The equilibrium sorption follows the Freundlich isotherm model whereas the kinetics is better explained by a pseudo-second-order kinetics model (0.018–0.029 g/mg/min). The presence of bicarbonate and phosphate has a significant effect on fluoride removal efficiency. The novel AC-Ce composites have a strong buffering effect under a wide range of pH, which can make it suitable for treating drinking water.</jats:p>",

Yet, a review of how decision makers in supply chain contexts can benefit from using their intuition demonstrates that our discipline lacks a unifying conceptualization and operationalization of the complex intuition construct. Our study addresses this opportunity by following an extensive mixed‐method approach, in which we first use qualitative content analysis and quantitative testing to conceptualize intuition as a multidimensional construct consisting of experience‐based, emotional, and automatic‐processing dimensions. We then operationalize and empirically assess multidimensionality using a multiple study format, and perform an inferential analysis to begin to assess nomological validity. Our reconceptualization of intuition allows for a richer understanding of this key facet of supply chain management decision making, and our accompanying scale provides evidence of its multidimensionality and efficacy in making decisions in the uncertain and time‐constrained environments that supply chain managers often face.</jats:p>",

The supply chain consists of farms, abattoirs and retailers. The purpose of this paper is to determine a cost-effective trade-off decision obtained from a developed multi-criteria optimization model based on three objectives. These objectives include customer satisfaction in percentage of product quantity as requested by customers, product quality in numbers of meat products and the total implementation cost.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The costs incurred in the provision of products and services across the supply chain are on the rise in many industries, including the mobile phone industry. Despite this, there is limited information in South Africa on the perceptions of supply chain players regarding cost reduction in the mobile phone industry. Furthermore, there is currently no framework for reducing supply chain costs in the South African mobile phone industry.Aim: The purpose of this study is to explore supply chain costs in the South African mobile phone industry, and to develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry.Setting: This study explores supply chain costs in four mobile phone companies operating in the South African mobile phone industry, of which three mobile network operators and one mobile retailing group. It uses semi-structured interview data collected in 2011.Method: This study adopted a qualitative case study design to understand supply chain costs and develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry. Eight semi-structured interviews with managers of mobile phone companies were conducted. The data were analysed with the help of Atlas.ti, using an adapted three-phased analytical framework as suggested by Miles and Huberman (1994) and O’ Dwyer (2004).Results: The study found that consolidation of strategic relationships through collaboration and strategic alliances between MNOs and other supply chain players is one of the ways to drive costs down across the supply chain. Outsourcing of some of the support activities and retailers’ direct purchasing transactions from device manufacturers were also found to be other avenues for reducing supply chain costs in the industry.Conclusion: The study suggests that mobile network operators (MNOs) need to consolidate their strategic relationships by increasing the share of the network infrastructure, and emphasising the need to strive for operational efficiencies. This combined effort should result in significant cost reductions across the supply chain. The findings of this study provided some avenues that managers of mobile-phone companies could consider to drive costs down supply chain-wide and service end-users at lower rates. The findings of this study could also help regulating authorities to get insights into supply chain cost reduction and develop appropriate mobile phone policies in South Africa.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Gray markets are created by unauthorized retailers selling manufacturer's branded products. Similar to international gray markets, domestic gray markets are a growing phenomenon whose impact on supply chains is not clear. We consider a supply chain with one manufacturer and several authorized retailers who face a newsvendor problem and a domestic gray market. While a gray market provides an opportunity for retailers to clear their excess inventory (inventory‐correction effect), it also can be a threat to their demand (demand‐cannibalization effect). We first characterize the emerging equilibrium by assuming an MSRP environment. Comparing a decentralized and centralized system, we show that a wholesale pricing contract is quite efficient in a gray market environment; we explain the underlying mechanism and note some of the operational decisions that could hurt that efficiency. We show that the gray market price determines the degree of both the negative effects of demand‐cannibalization and the positive effects of inventory correction, which in turn determines the net impact of gray markets on the retailer's stocking choice and, ultimately, the manufacturer's profit. We then study the authorized retailers' problem as a price‐setting newsvendor. We observe that the gray market creates price competition between the authorized and unauthorized retailers, causing a drop in the primary market price. However, this price competition can be counteracted by the authorized retailers' stocking decision. Finally, we extend our model to consider the cases where the demand can be correlated across retailers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, a novel idea to drive SRM from single‐phase AC supply is presented. Each stator winding is connected in series to thyristor to form one branch. All branches are connected in parallel to an AC supply. Thereby, a magnetic flux is generated between each pair of stator pole portions when a current is supplied to stator coil and repeated many cycles as long as the rate of change of inductance of stator phase is positive. The number of cycles of phase current depends on the ratio between rotor speeds to the supply angular frequency in radian per second. A magnetic attractive force occurs between rotor and stator pole portions as they approach one another, which produces motoring torque controlled by controlling switching delay angle of the switch. The advantage of this drive is its lower cost because the usage of simple shaft encoder and one thyristor per phase and its associated firing circuit, while the disadvantage of this drive is the more torque ripple and the deterioration of torque at high speed, and like most machine drives the supply current has high total harmonic distortion. A simulation model is presented and verified by experimental rig for two‐phase SRM.</jats:p>",

Our main findings suggest that the variables shaping the organization of a bank in its lending to non‐financial firms have a complex impact on its ability to expand credit. Banks that made substantial use of credit scoring techniques actually reduced their credit expansion during the economic downturn. At the same time, banks that delegated more power to their branch managers were likely to expand loans at a higher rate. Finally, contrary to the evidence from the pre‐crisis period, we find that longer branch manager tenure in the same branch is detrimental to the credit growth rate.

It was determined that there is an optimum speed of a heat carrier to which minimum total cost of electricity for heating system in a whole corresponds when using vertical probes for heat pump heating system. The correlation between the characteristics of vertical ground heat exchanger (depth of the well, the intensity of selection of heat from the soil pipe diameter, the velocity of a heat carrier) in its optimal working conditions was found. It is shown that the optimum velocity of a heat carrier in the lower circuit depends on the depth of the well, the heat exchanger tube diameter, and is almost independent of temperature conditions works of heat pump systems. It is found that the higher velocity observed at the beginning of the heating period in view of energy storage in the ground. Optimum coolant velocity should decrease until the end of the heating season to ensure minimum specific energy expenditure at HPS. Also noted that an optimum velocity increases with increasing depth of the well and with decreasing diameter of the heat exchanger tube. The established correlation may be used when determining the optimum operating conditions of the vertical ground heat pump heat exchanger low-temperature heating systems with a plan to maximize their energy efficiency.

Projection pursuit technology can achieve automatic index selection and index weight confirmation. When used to assess water resources carrying capacity, the subjectivity and uncertainty of index weights can be avoided. Meanwhile, it can also be used to optimize the index system, and can improve the accuracy of evaluation results and discrimination. In this paper, the projection pursuit grade model of water resources carrying capacity is established. The evaluation criteria are determined by combining the theory with practice. Grades I to IV indicate that the water resources capacity declines gradually. This is the first study of water resources carrying capacity in four municipalities in China. The results show that the water resources carrying capacity of the four municipalities in 2012 belong to the third level, Chongqing is close to the second level and Tianjin is close to the fourth level.</jats:p>",

According to the 2014 FSMB Census of Licensed Physicians, 32% of actively licensed physicians are female. Less attention, however, has been given to the location of medical school graduation and its association with the growing population of female physicians. This study examines physicians who were issued their first license in the United States by gender and by where they graduated from medical school. Using data from the Federation of State Medical Boards' (FSMB) Physician Data Center, the authors measured the percentage of first-time licenses issued between 1990 and 2014 to females and by where they graduated from medical school — that is, either a United States medical graduate (USMG) or an international medical graduate (IMG). Key findings indicate that between 1990 and 2014, first-time licenses issued to IMG females have increased from 25% to 45% (31% to 47% for USMG females). Furthermore, the percentage of first-time licenses issued to female IMGs increased among international regions with the highest number of licensed physicians in the U.S. The findings support that a greater percentage of first-time licenses issued to IMGs have been to females over the past two and half decades. Analyzing the trend of first-time licenses issued to physicians by gender and location of medical school graduation adds to better understanding the physician pipeline and physicians' transition from medical school to the practicing medical community in the United States.</jats:p>",

In the study, an appropriately prepared data set was used for training an artificial neural network (ANN) in the form of a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Further comparison between the responses of the trained MLP and the decisions made by human experts showed satisfactory consistency, although 15% of the database records produced certain discrepancies. The presented method can help create an expert system capable of supporting failure-free operation of a water distribution system.</jats:p>",

With the construction of reservoirs in mountainous areas and the recurrent seepage problems of dams, reservoir seepage might become another type of mountain-front recharge. This study identified the recharge sources of groundwater beneath Huangbizhuang Reservoir on the North China Plain (NCP). Hydrochemical data and the stable isotopic compositions (δ18O and δD) of water were employed to determine the occurrence of Huangbizhuang Reservoir seepage recharge to groundwater in the mountain-front area. Then, the relative percentages of ‘reservoir seepage’ to total recharge were quantified using end-member mixing analysis (EMMA). The results suggest that the recharge sources beneath the reservoir are mountain block recharge, local precipitation and reservoir seepage. Using D and δ18O values, EMMA revealed that the mean contribution ratio of reservoir seepage to groundwater beneath the reservoir is 36% ± 4%, while that of mountain block recharge is 33% ± 11% in consideration of the uncertainty. Reservoir seepage accounts for a large proportion of mountain-front recharge and should be included in the calculations of mountain-front recharge on the NCP, which is currently ignored.</jats:p>",

Firms compete in a differential game setting over supply schedules, which encompasses a continuum of imperfect competition equilibria from Bertrand to Cournot. Although production generates environmentally damaging emissions, firms can undertake R&amp;D that has the sole purpose of reducing emissions. In addition to characterizing the optimal policy, we examine how the optimal tax and subsidy, and the optimal level of abatement, change as competition intensifies, as the dynamic parameters change, and as the investment in abatement technology changes. In this setting, competition increases welfare through its impact on the final goods price. However, lower prices result in larger quantities and more pollution. Our key contribution is to show how the impact of increased competition on welfare depends on the extent of the market and the nature of preferences and technology.</jats:p>",

Endeavours towards financial inclusion of the underserved SMEs could rationalize why we should allow for or encourage FinTech innovations exemplified by the online supply-chain financing mentioned above. What would be an adaptive regulatory regime for such innovative FinTech-enabled financial services as the online supply-chain financing? Within our conceptual framework to regulate the FinTech industry at the early stage, rather than rigorous rules traditionally placed on large financial institutions, a principles-based strategy should be adopted to strike a balance between financial stability and access to financial services advanced by disruptive innovations. As a necessary complement, regulatory sandboxes would be needed to spur a shift in institutional philosophy to a principles-based regulatory regime. In other words, the regulatory attitude of FinTech regulation should be humble and light-touch to promote innovation for improving digital financial inclusion, albeit on the premise of containing potential systemic risk and protecting consumer interest in the meantime.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Precipitation over Southwest China (SWC) has significantly decreased during 1979–2013. The summer months from July to September contributed the most to the decrease of precipitation. By tracing moisture sources of summer precipitation over the SWC region, it is found that most moisture originates in the monsoon region. The major moisture contributing area is divided into an extended west region, SWC, and an extended east region. The extended west region is mainly influenced by the South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM) and the westerlies, while the extended east region is mainly influenced by the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). The extended west, SWC, and extended east regions contribute 48.2 %, 15.5 %, and 24.5 % of moisture for the SWC precipitation, respectively. Moisture supply from the extended west region decreased at a rate of −23.6 mm decade−1 whereas that from the extended east increased at a rate of 4.2 mm decade−1, resulting in an overall decrease of moisture supply. Further analysis reveals that the decline of summer precipitation is mainly caused by change in the stationary component rather than the transient component of the moisture transport over the SWC region. The dynamic process (i.e. change in circulation) rather than the thermodynamic process (i.e. specific humidity) is dominant in affecting the stationary moisture transport. A prevailing easterly anomaly of moisture transport that weakened moisture supply from the Indian Ocean is to a large extent responsible for the precipitation decrease over the SWC region.\n                        </jats:p>"

This paper begins with a literature review indicating the themes from which we developed our conceptual framework. Structural equation modeling based on a cross-section (n = 260) of 5 years of supply chain business data (2009–2013) in Greater China was conducted. We concluded that firm market orientation and service innovation exert significantly positive effects on business performance. In addition, the results supported our model that market orientation is mediated by the effect of service innovation on business performance. Market orientation and service innovation had a stronger combined effect on business performance than market orientation alone did. This paper provides implications for how firms can be more effectively synergized amid challenges and gain a competitive advantage in the global supply chain.</jats:p>"

We analyze an intervention by Nike, Inc., to promote the adoption of lean manufacturing in its apparel supply chain across 11 developing countries. Using difference-in-differences estimates from a panel of more than 300 factories, we find that lean adoption was associated with a 15 percentage point reduction in noncompliance with labor standards that primarily reflect factory wage and work hour practices. However, we find a null effect on factory health and safety standards. This pattern is consistent with a causal mechanism that links lean to improved social performance through changes in labor relations, rather than improved management systems. These findings offer evidence that capability-building interventions may reduce social harm in global supply chains. </jats:p><jats:p> Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2369 . </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy. </jats:p>",

In this study, ten surface water samples and eight groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for pollution with Fe, Mn, As, Cr, Cd, Pb and Cu. The samples were collected randomly according to the topographic locations and accessibility. The surface water is suitable for both drinking and irrigation use according to its salinity (total dissolved solids, TDS &amp;lt; 500 mg/l) and content of major ions. Unfortunately, some samples contain concentrations of As, Cd, Cu and Pb higher than the WHO drinking water guidelines. The groundwater samples have TDS ranging from 204 to 2,100 mg/l. Also, the groundwater contains higher concentrations of Fe, Mn and As than surface water. The highest concentrations of heavy metals As, Cd and Pb were recorded in the desert fringes and close to the industrial complexes indicating the role of geological sediments in the transportation and migration of pollutants. The unconfined part of the Quaternary aquifer in the desert fringes is more vulnerable to contamination. The results of this study reflect the role of human and industrial activates in polluting water resources with heavy metals, which puts the aquatic environment in the study area under stress.</jats:p>",

The study assumes that the current process flow and layout of the centre remains fixed; the entering and exiting routes to and from the centre and the centre itself are located optimally within the network and the models have base times of one and seven days respectively. Performance measures have been analysed through utilization states of equipment and labour, queue contents versus time and average throughput times of each of the parcel categories. The findings in this paper can create a positive trigger for improvement within the distribution centre as equipment and labour can be downsized to decrease costs and improve safety and benefit the company through the alignment of a network of distribution centres that each applies modified relevant versions of the modelling logic conveyed in this paper.</jats:p>"

A droop control method based on load current feed-forward is adopted to realize the load distribution between the reversible converter and the existing 12-pulse diode rectifiers. The direct current (DC) short-circuit characteristics of the reversible converter is studied, then the relationship between the peak fault current and the circuit parameters is obtained from theoretical calculations and validated by computer simulation.

In this study, we conducted high-frequency, synchronous field observations of meteorology, hydrology, and water quality to determine the relationship between sediment release rate and wind speed in the central region of Lake Taihu. We combined these results with our previous findings from other regions to establish the temporal–spatial variation in sediment release patterns for this lake. We then calculated the annual total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) release fluxes. We constructed an environmental fluid dynamics code (EFDC) model; we then loaded the temporal–spatial variation parameters and simulated the effects on different TN and TP concentrations. Overall, the following results were observed: (1) the critical wind speed at which sediment was first suspended in the central region of the lake was 4 m/s, and the fitted curve of the sediment release rate and wind speed was r = 144.7x−100 (R2 = 0.851); and (2) the annual TN and TP release fluxes of Lake Taihu were approximately 3,086 and 740 tons, respectively.

We denote some retailers as strategic in the sense that given the supplier inventory information, they will implement the optimal stocking policy by incorporating such information. On the other hand, some retailers are denoted as naïve in the sense that they ignore supply information and resort to a simplistic ordering policy. Naïve retailers learn the optimal policy over time and adjust their orders accordingly. We study the dynamics of this game and investigate the impact of such strategic and naïve retailers on the cost, ordering pattern and stocking policies of all parties. We analyze the supply chain under two scenarios: the centralized supply chain where the objective is to minimize the total supply chain cost, and the decentralized supply chain where each self‐interested player minimizes its own cost in a Stackelberg game setting. We fully characterize the optimal policies under both centralized and decentralized scenarios and show that, surprisingly, the supply chain might be better off by virtue of naïve retailers. The result is driven by the fact that strategic and naïve players’ decisions shift the positioning of inventory in the supply chain with its final impact being determined by the relative costs of different retailer‐types. Our results also offer managerial insights into how access to supply information can improve supply chain performance. </jats:p>",

Maintenance support is very important and challenging in such remote areas. A platform supply vessel (PSV) is an essential part of maintenance support. Hence, the acceptable level of its availability performance is high. Identification of critical components of the PSV provides essential information for optimizing maintenance management, defining a spare parts strategy, estimating competence needs for PSV operation, and achieving the acceptable level of availability performance. Currently, there are no standards or guidelines for the criticality analysis of PSVs for maintenance purposes. In this paper, a methodology for the identification of the critical components of PSVs has been developed, based on the available standard. It is a systematic screening process. The method considers functional redundancy and the consequences of loss of function as criticality criteria at the main and subfunction levels. Furthermore, at the component level, risk tools such as failure modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA), and fault tree analysis (FTA) will be applied in order to identify the most critical components. Moreover, the application of the proposed approach will be illustrated by a real case study.</jats:p>",

Its origin dates back to 3,000 years ago in the area known today as Armenia, and it had spread widely throughout Persia by 600 BC. The expansion of Islam spread this technique from China to the Iberian Peninsula, where it has received various local names. In Madrid, the technique was widely used for water supply from the ninth century until the mid-twentieth century, and in recent centuries received the name \"Viajes de agua\".\r\nHowever, the geological and socio-economic environment of the Sierra de Guadarrama in Madrid is not, and has never been, appropriate for the implementation of this type of water catchment. This is why the qanat supply of the former Charterhouse of Santa María de El Paular (Rascafría), which shows a very similar typology to the \"Viajes de agua\" modified or constructed in Madrid between the 17th and 19th centuries, is so original. Three \"capirotes\" (hoods) and a \"distribution ark\" have been located \"in situ\" in the vicinity of the Monastery and another \"capirote\" is used as an ornamental element in the courtyard of the old Hotel El Paular.\r\nIn this paper, we present the results obtained in the field study and files on this \"Viaje de agua\", its context within the old Monastery supply, its water quality, and various hydrological and hydraulic considerations. Its builders must have been \"plumbers\" from Madrid in the seventeenth century, and it underwent several modifications during the eighteenth century.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a high-frequency isolated online UPS system for low power applications. The proposed UPS consists of a single-stage AC-DC converter, boost DC-DC converter, and an inverter. The single-stage AC-DC converter provides galvanic isolation, input power factor correction, and continuous conduction of both input and output current. The low battery bank voltage is stepped up to high dc-link voltage by employing a high voltage gain boost converter, thus allows the reduction of battery bank to only 24 V parallel connected batteries. Operating batteries in parallel improves the battery performance and resolves the issues related to conventional battery banks that arrange the batteries in series combination. The inverter provides regulated output voltage to the load. A new cascaded slide mode (SM) and proportional-resonant (PR) control for the inverter has been proposed, which regulates the output voltage for both linear and non-linear loads. The controller shows excellent performance during load transients and step changes. Besides, the controller for boost converter and AC-DC converter is presented. Operating principle and experimental results of 1 kVA laboratory setup have been presented for the validation of proposed system.</jats:p>"

We determine the optimal negative correlation between option and exercise prices as well as closed‐form formulas for the optimal supply orders. The results show that in the optimal menu of contracts either the option or the exercise price may be omitted from the menu, whereas the supply orders should always be customized for each supplier type. We show that in this problem, optimal profit assignment between contract partners under put and bidirectional option contracts is the same as call option contract studied.

Although there is a growing enthusiasm for replacing cellular offices with A-FOs, the effects of such changes on office workers are still unclear. Within this three-wave longitudinal study, we investigated the changes (time lag of 1 and 8 months after the redesign) in perceived need–supply fit, distraction, interaction across teams, and workspace satisfaction during relocation from a cellular office to an A-FO. Moreover, as previous case studies indicated individual differences in the use of A-FOs, we considered participants’ perceived need–supply fit as a moderator indicating an appropriate use of A-FO supplies. We found a linear increase of perceived need–supply fit, a decrease in distraction, and a significant interaction effect where workspace satisfaction and interaction across teams increased more strongly for participants reporting a better perceived need–supply fit. </jats:p>",

In the committed pricing scenario, the firm makes the pricing decision before the supply uncertainty is resolved. In the responsive pricing scenario, the firm's pricing decision is made after the supply uncertainty is resolved. For the committed pricing scenario, we develop a condition on supply uncertainty that guarantees the unimodality of the firm's objective function. By comparing the firm's optimal diversification decisions in the two pricing scenarios, we examine the interplay of supply diversification strategy and responsive pricing strategy in mitigating supply uncertainty. While both strategies are effective in mitigating supply uncertainty, we show that they are not necessarily substitutes. The relationship between these two strategies depends on two adverse effects caused by supply uncertainty: the lost‐revenue effect and the lost‐goodwill effect. More specifically, when the lost‐revenue effect dominates the lost‐goodwill effect, these two strategies are complements; otherwise, they are substitutes. Furthermore, we examine the impact of market size, price sensitivity, supplier reliability, and failure rebate on the interplay between these two strategies, and discuss the implications of our results. Finally, we extend our analysis to the case of two unreliable suppliers and show that the insights regarding the interplay between diversification and pricing continue to hold. </jats:p>",

It is shown that polysaccharides in the composition of Jerusalem artichoke of MHS-drying undergo less crystallization and hence drying is carried out under milder conditions than these components during convection method. We established capacity for the dispersing of dried Jerusalem artichoke in a traditional ball mill depending on the duration, which makes it possible to obtain dried products for various technological purposes. We demonstrated a capacity to swell in the resulting powder made from Jerusalem artichoke, which predetermines the formation of advanced capillary-porous structure. Results of the tensometric method of studies revealed that the formed structure of powder made from Jerusalem artichoke of MHS-drying is characterized by small pores at temperature 50 °С and by 1.2...1.5 times larger – at 70 °С, which must be considered when they are rehydrated. We examined a complex of basic functional-technological properties of powder made from Jerusalem artichoke: coefficient of water absorption (CW), water-retaining (WRC), fat-retaining (FRC) and emulsifying capacities (EC). During mathematical processing of the results received, we obtained a conceptual model that describes a dependence of the comprehensive indicator of technological properties of powder made from Jerusalem artichoke (by the defined weight coefficients: for CW – 0.2; WRC – 0.2; FRC – 0.3; EC – 0.2) depending on the temperature of MHS-drying and dispersibility.</jats:p>",

We present time‐series and cross‐sectional evidence that these supply‐side policies, in particular the 40‐hour law, contributed to French stagflation. These results are inconsistent both with the standard one‐sector New Keynesian model and with a medium scale, multisector model calibrated to match our cross‐sectional estimates.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As water demands continue to grow, South Africa is starting to consider seawater desalination as a potential future supply source, and it is currently being investigated at a feasibility level in a number of coastal cities, including Cape Town. Desalination is different to conventional surface and groundwater supply sources in that it is climate-resilient, having an assurance of supply of essentially 100 percent. However, the increased reliability comes at a great cost. This paper presents a methodology developed for modelling a proposed desalination plant as an integrated component of the Western Cape Water Supply System, in order to optimise system operating rules and cost. The modelling entailed short-term and long-term system analyses in the Water Resources Yield Model and Water Resources Planning Model, and estimation of first-order capital and operating costs in order to calculate and compare Unit Reference Values. The maximum increase in yield was found to occur when the seawater desalination plant is used as a base supply, operational all the time. There was little benefit, in terms of system yield, in using the desalination plant as an emergency supply source only. Unit reference values for the desalination plant decrease as the percentage supply from the plant increases, meaning that the lowest possible cost per cubic metre of water supplied is when the desalination plant is used as a base supply. It was also apparent that the unit reference values decrease with an increase in desalination plant capacity, suggesting that, from an economic perspective, the optimal solution would be to have one large desalination plant operational immediately.</jats:p>",

In general, existing methodologies for sectorization of WSNs are limited to assessment of the impact of its implementation over reduction of background leakage, underestimating increased capacity to detect new leakage events and undermining appropriate investment substantiation. In this work, we raise this issue and put in place a methodology to optimize sectors' design. To this end, we carry out a novel combination of the Short Run Economic Leakage Level concept (SRELL- corresponding to leakage level that can occur in a WSN in a certain period of time and whose reparation would be more costly than the benefits that can be obtained). With a non-deterministic optimization method based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs) in combination with Monte Carlo simulation. As an example of application, methodology is implemented over a 246 km pipe-long WSN, reporting 72 397 $/year as net profit.</jats:p>"

However, here we show that this widely held assumption fails to capture a more fundamental pattern in river channel geometry. Our findings provide evidence that river channel geometry and grain size are inherently linked to the supply of sediment transported from upstream. Threshold channels may therefore simply reflect settings with low sediment supplies, while high sediment supply channels are adjusted to transport large volumes of material during bankfull floods. Thus, an understanding of sediment supply is key to interpreting, predicting, and restoring bankfull geometry in rivers.</jats:p>",

Specifically, an important goal of the present study was the comparison of a curvilinear grid model with a rectilinear grid model. The MIKE 21C model has been developed to simulate 2D flows and morphological changes in rivers by using either an orthogonal curvilinear grid or a rectilinear grid. The MIKE 21C model comprises two parts: (a) the hydrodynamic part that is based on the Saint-Venant equations and (b) the morphological change part for the simulation of bank erosion and sediment transport. The difference between the curvilinear and the rectilinear grid is that the curvilinear grid lines follow the bank lines of the river, providing a better resolution of the flow near the boundaries. The water depth and sediment results obtained from the simulations for the two different grids were compared with field observations and a series of statistical indicators. It was concluded that the curvilinear grid model results were in better agreement with the field measurements.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Standard procedures to assess P availability in soils are based on batch experiments with various extractants. However, in most soils P nutrition is less limited by bulk stocks but by strong adsorption and transport limitation. The basic principle of root‐phosphate uptake is to strip phosphate locally from the solid phase by forming a radial depletion zone in the soil solution, optionally enhanced by release of mobilizing substances. Microdialysis (MD), a well‐established method in pharmacokinetics, is capable to mimic important characteristics of P root uptake. The sampling is by diffusional exchange through a semipermeable membrane covering the probes with their sub‐mm tubular structure. Additionally, the direct environment of the probe can be chemically modified by adding, <jats:italic>e.g</jats:italic>., carboxylates to the perfusate. This study is the first approach to test the applicability of MD in assessing plant available phosphate in soils and to develop a framework for its appropriate use.We used MD in stirred solutions to quantify the effect of pumping rate, concomitant ions, and pH value on phosphate recovery. Furthermore, we measured phosphate yield of top‐soil material from a beech forest, a non‐fertilized grassland, and from a fertilized corn field. Three perfusates have been used based on a 1 mM KNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> solution: pure (1), with 0.1 mM citric acid (2), and with 1 mM citric acid (3). Additionally, a radial diffusion model has been parametrized for the stirred solutions and the beech forest soil.Results from the tests in stirred solutions were in good agreement with reported observations obtained for other ionic species. This shows the principal suitability of the experimental setup for phosphate tests. We observed a significant dependency of phosphate uptake into the MD probes on dialysate pumping rate and on ionic strength of the outside solution. In the soils, we observed uptake rates of the probes between 1.5 × 10<jats:sup>−15</jats:sup> and 6.7 × 10<jats:sup>−14</jats:sup> mol s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in case of no citrate addition. Surprisingly, median uptake rates were mostly independent of the bulk soil stocks, but the P‐fertilized soil revealed a strong tailing towards higher values. This indicates the occurrence of hot P spots in soils. Citrate addition increased P yields only in the higher concentration but not in the forest soil. The order of magnitude of MD uptake rates from the soil samples matched root‐length related uptake rates from other studies. The micro‐radial citrate release in MD reflects the processes controlling phosphate mobilization in the rhizosphere better than measurements based on “flooding” of soil samples with citric acid in batch experiments. Important challenges in MD with phosphate are small volumes of dialysate with extremely low concentrations and a high variability of results due to soil heterogeneity and between‐probe variability. We conclude that MD is a promising tool to complement existing P‐analytical procedures, especially when spatial aspects or the release of mobilizing substances are in focus.</jats:p>",

The study further sought to determine the extent to which these challenges impact the logistics and physical distribution of goods and informed managerial practices.Methodology: The study employed a qualitative research design. The study targeted all the senior managers at Director Levels at the GSC and the RSC and all the senior operational staff from supply chain and service delivery pillars in three (03) large Field Missions. These field missions are namely United Nations Stabilization Mission in Congo (MONUSCO); United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS); and the United Nations Support Office for AMISOM (UNSOA). This study used purposive sampling technique. The researcher purposively sampled fifteen (15) personnel; with three (03) participants each from the GSC, RSC, and three (03) participants each from the three (03)  Field Mission. Primary data was obtained from the original sources using questionnaires and interview.Findings: The results revealed that DFS did face various challenges in the implementation of lean strategies and that the operational difficulties experienced within its operations across field missions resulted in reduced customer satisfaction, increased supplier lead time and increased operational costs. The respondents indicated that they experienced a lack of understanding of the complexity of supply chain at the senior leadership level whereby most initiatives are tainted with personal agenda as a consequent the biggest hurdle to overcome is gaining enthusiasm and trust of the staff. They also indicated that there is a high risk of asset waste and loss due to assets remaining in stock for over one year without use. Further, they indicated that there are weaknesses in the management of construction or “self-constructed” projects; and weaknesses in the restructuring of the department of peacekeeping operations.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that     DFS should foster a continuous performance improvement mindset among staffs through planning, doing, checking and taking corrective actions on a balanced scorecard that integrates and aligns staff motivation and interest to the objectives of the organization. Also, objective and fair work plan and performance management are an ingredient to foster continuous improvement</jats:p>"

With computer‐aided self‐learning capability, we simulate three models for manual‐, barcode‐, and RFID‐enabled precast construction supply chain. The results of 100 precast wall‐panel construction in a two‐echelon precast construction supply chain reveal that the knowledge‐based RFID system could generate 62.0% saving of operational costs, which is 29.0% higher than that of a barcode‐based system. As a result, the computer‐aided adaptive learning mechanism based on RFID is verifiable to improve the overall operational performance by reducing lead time, operational errors, and costs.

We analyze here how to address these in the case of the forest industry, which in emerging economies such as Argentina is subject to high logistic costs and faces problems of biological and economic sustainability. In this work, we analyze a management model covering from the schedule of harvesting activities and the transportation of raw materials to the final transformation at several industrial plants. Since this involves more than one objective, single-criterion mathematical programming methods are not appropriate. Here, instead, we introduce an extended goal programming formulation of the problem, able to yield good solutions in a computationally efficient way. We consider four goals: the maximization of the net present value of the production, the minimization of interannual variations in harvests, the maximization of carbon capture in the form of forest biomass, and the minimization of variations in the mean annual distance covered in transportation to the industrial plants. We apply this theoretical model to derive solutions for an actual Argentinean company. We show that the model reaches the target levels of the different goals, except for carbon balance, which is negative in all of the scenarios under evaluation. </jats:p>",

Water demand accounting for the nature of the consumers using the water supply network was subject to analysis. The influence of changes in the distribution of water within a day for the basic categories of recipients was accounted for. The EPANET 2.0 program for the simulating water supply network operation, made available by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency through a public-domain licence, was used to construct the model of the system. The obtained results of the simulation allowed for indicating the main problems with the use of the analysed system. Subject to analysis was the pressure pattern in characteristic nodes of the network from which mining companies, industrial plants and residential households were supplied. Usefulness of the developed simulation model in preparing the assessment of future modernization works was confirmed, allowing for the effects of their implementation to be assessed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the managerial challenges in using lean techniques in designing a comprehensive characterization of the organization logistics and physical distribution system. The study further sought to determine the extent to which these challenges impact the logistics and physical distribution of goods and informed managerial practices.Methodology: The study employed a qualitative research design. The study targeted all the senior managers at Director Levels at the GSC and the RSC and all the senior operational staff from supply chain and service delivery pillars in three (03) large Field Missions. These field missions are namely United Nations Stabilization Mission in Congo (MONUSCO); United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS); and the United Nations Support Office for AMISOM (UNSOA). This study used purposive sampling technique. The researcher purposively sampled fifteen (15) personnel; with three (03) participants each from the GSC, RSC, and three (03) participants each from the three (03)  Field Mission. Primary data was obtained from the original sources using questionnaires and interview.Findings: The results revealed that DFS did face various challenges in the implementation of lean strategies and that the operational difficulties experienced within its operations across field missions resulted in reduced customer satisfaction, increased supplier lead time and increased operational costs. The respondents indicated that they experienced a lack of understanding of the complexity of supply chain at the senior leadership level whereby most initiatives are tainted with personal agenda as a consequent the biggest hurdle to overcome is gaining enthusiasm and trust of the staff. They also indicated that there is a high risk of asset waste and loss due to assets remaining in stock for over one year without use. Further, they indicated that there are weaknesses in the management of construction or “self-constructed” projects; and weaknesses in the restructuring of the department of peacekeeping operations.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that     DFS should foster a continuous performance improvement mindset among staffs through planning, doing, checking and taking corrective actions on a balanced scorecard that integrates and aligns staff motivation and interest to the objectives of the organization. Also, objective and fair work plan and performance management are an ingredient to foster continuous improvement</jats:p>"

Although radioscopes and gamma ray cameras have been developing to visualize radioactive species or contamination, it is not necessarily a simple matter to locate sources of contamination under high levels of background radiation. However, supramolecular approaches for environmental sensing of analyses are useful in the design of high-resolution molecular sensors. Here, we have developed an optical imaging technique for cesium ions involving an optode system in environmental water. An optode membrane was prepared incorporating a calix[6]arene derivative, which showed excellent selectivity toward cesium ions in aqueous solutions, even in water supplied for domestic use or seawater. Furthermore, this membrane was fabricated using nanoparticles with a diameter of ca. 100 nm. The nano-optode also gave an excellent response to cesium ions. Therefore, this optode provides a higher spatial resolution than existing radioscopes and gamma ray cameras under high level radioactive environments.</jats:p>",

However, during water treatment NOM does affect water quality specifically during the disinfection step, where if NOM is present it reacts with disinfectants resulting in the formation of disinfection by-products. To emphasize the importance of NOM monitoring during potable water treatment this study aimed to characterize NOM and evaluate NOM removal by a conventional water treatment plant considering seasonal trends. NOM was characterized by making use of NOM polarity and specific ultraviolet absorbance. NOM removal was monitored with high-performance size exclusion chromatography, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254 analyses. The polarity rapid assessment method indicated that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic NOM fractions within the surface water increased during a period of heavy rain when floods occurred, but conversely decreased during an average rain season. Although NOM character showed variability during the 5-year study period, seasonal relationship during high and low flow seasons between aromatic NOM and total trihalomethane (TTHM) formation was not evident. Aromatic NOM was not the only precursor to TTHM formation, which stresses the need to implement advanced NOM characterization techniques during NOM monitoring to study reactivity of the individual NOM fraction with the disinfectant used at the water treatment plant.</jats:p>",

This reform is expected to significantly restructure the energy sector and boost and diversify the energy production. Moreover, changes in the energy sector and production might lead to structural changes in the rest of the economy and ultimately generate significant economic benefits for the country. Nevertheless, the fundamental role of the energy sector in this oil producing country makes the potential impacts of the reform complex to forecast. The objective of the study is to analyze the current state, evolution, and driving factors of the total primary energy use in Mexico in 2003–2012 (prior to the implementation of the reform) as a precedent for future analyses of impacts of the energy reform. The results show three driving factors of the evolution of primary energy use: final non-energy demand, direct energy intensity, and economic structure. Also, it was found that the energy sector has been in a precarious situation regarding its structure and efficiency. However, this situation had a small effect on the evolution of primary energy use.</jats:p>"

This study considers the integration of smallholder organic farmers in vertically coordinated supply chains and factors influencing them. The article draws transaction costs economics (TCE) to develop a model explaining potential TC attributes influencing farmer’s decision to participate in supermarket supply chains (SMSC) compared to spot market (SM) in Karnataka, India. This article uses data collected from 127 smallholder organic farmers through face-to-face interviews to identify factors that significantly influence the farmer’s decision. A binary logistic regression model was employed within the TC framework. Seven TC attributes were evaluated on farmer’s decision. The results revealed that farmers have a strong marketing preference towards SMSC. Attributes such as pre-arranging price, quantity, frequency, and access to market information and finance have significant positive influence on farmer’s decision to participate in SMSC. However, attribute payment mechanism has a negative influence. Furthermore, there are significant differences between SMSC and SM supplying groups with reference to variables distance to the market, the general state of the road and age. The results have a policy and managerial implication towards the development of organic food market in the Karnataka state, India. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Big data ability helps obtain more accurate demand signal. However, is better demand signal always beneficial for the supply chain parties? To answer this question, we investigate a remanufacturing supply chain (RSC), where demand uncertainty is significant, and the value to reduce environmental risk is large. Specifically, we focus on a licensed RSC comprising an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a third‐party remanufacturer (3PR). The latter pays a unit license fee to the former, and can be risk averse to the demand of remanufactured products. We show that the OEM and the risk‐neutral 3PR always have incentives to improve their big data abilities to increase their profits. However, when the 3PR is risk averse, big data might hurt its profit: the value of big data is positive if its demand signal accuracy is sufficiently low. Interestingly, we find that while information sharing hurts the 3PR, it benefits the OEM as well as the supply chain. Thus, if costly information sharing is allowed, a win–win situation can be achieved. We also find that information sharing generates more valuation when the 3PR is risk averse than that when the 3PR is risk neutral. More importantly, we find that the 3PR's risk attitude and demand signal accuracy can significantly mitigate the negative environmental impact (measured by the amount of the waste): (1) the more risk neutral the 3PR is, the better the environment is; (2) the more accurate demand signal is, the better the environment is.</jats:p>",

The 113 ha Anjeni watershed was established in 1984 and <jats:italic>fanya juu</jats:italic> terraces were installed in 1986. Runoff and erosion data are available from three different plot sizes and at the watershed outlet. The objective of this study was to investigate how erosion processes and sediment rating parameters vary with plot size and the progression of the rainy monsoon phase. We analyzed runoff and sediment loss data from 40 plots and the watershed outlet. The dataset included erosion data from 24 newly constructed plots (3 m length) during the rainy monsoon phase of 2012 and 2013, and 16 long‐term plots (with 12, 16, 22, and 24% slopes and 3, 15 and 30 m lengths) and the watershed outlet during the period between 1986 to 1990. Sediment concentration (<jats:italic>C</jats:italic>) was fitted to runoff (<jats:italic>Q</jats:italic>) using a power regression equation (<jats:italic>C</jats:italic> = <jats:italic>aQ</jats:italic><jats:sup><jats:italic>b</jats:italic></jats:sup>). Sediment concentration and yield increased with increasing plot length from 3 m to 15 m, but sediment yield decreased as plot length increased to 30 m.The coefficients (<jats:italic>a</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>b</jats:italic>) were affected by plot size and the progression of the rainy monsoon phase. As plot size increases, the <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> value increased, while the <jats:italic>b</jats:italic> value decreased. Greater <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> values were observed during the beginning of the monsoon phase, while values of <jats:italic>b</jats:italic> were greater towards the end of the monsoon phase. Overall findings suggest that erosion from cultivated fields is primarily controlled by transport limitations at the beginning of the monsoon phase, while towards the end of the monsoon phase, as surface covers emerge, sediment availability will be reduced, and thus sediment source would be a limitation.

The Nile Delta has highly intensive irrigation canal networks that share yearly about 35.5 km3 of water. In this study, an integrated three-dimensional groundwater model is built considering the actual condition of the irrigation canals and their recharges of the Nile Delta aquifer. The model was calibrated for estimating the vertical and hydraulic conductivity. The model was run for three scenarios: (1) reduction of water depth in canals, (2) increasing pumping discharge from the aquifer and (3) combination between the first and second scenarios. Results reveal that the effect of increasing the pumping discharge on groundwater level in the Nile Delta is more significant than decreasing the water depth of the canals network due to the fact of the existence of the upper clay layer which reduces the amount of water penetrating and reaching the groundwater in the aquifer. The last scenario presents the worst case as the average drawdown reached 1.26 m, 1.7 m and 1.35 m in the western, central and eastern parts of the Nile Delta respectively. The study results should be taken in account for studying the saltwater intrusion and climate change impacts on the Nile Delta region.</jats:p>",

Therefore, not surprisingly, the number of scientific publications concerning the evaluation of resource criticality has increased in recent years. However, it was noticed that currently published methodologies are too complex to be applied by industrial companies on a daily basis. For this reason, the need to develop a methodology that would allow not only assessing resource criticality, but could also be integrated into widely applied methodological frameworks as an additional driver to improve resource efficiency was identified. Geostrategic supply risk and economic importance were chosen as key indicators to analyze and assess relative resource criticality. The developed methodology was field tested by applying it to a resource‐intensive nitrogen fertilizer production company. Five scenarios for resource efficiency improvements, consisting of cleaner production and industrial symbiosis measures, were investigated. If all the proposed measures were implemented, consumption of natural gas would decrease by 3.552 million cubic meters per year (0.3% of the total consumption). However, not all identified measures contribute to a reduction of the overall criticality of resources for the production company. Nevertheless, the integration of criticality assessments into the widely applied methodologies for development and implementation of resource efficiency innovations is a valuable addition and should be included in the analysis for sustainable innovations and development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Alluvial river estuaries consist largely of sand but are typically flanked by mud flats and salt marshes. The analogy with meandering rivers, that are kept narrower than braided rivers by cohesive floodplain formation, raises the question how large-scale estuarine morphology and late Holocene development of estuaries are affected by cohesive sediment. In this study we combine sand and mud transport processes and study their interaction effects on morphologically modelled estuaires on centennial to millennial time-scales. The numerical modelling package Delft3D was applied in 2DH starting from an idealised convergent estuary. The mixed sediment was modelled with an active layer and storage module with fluxes predicted by the Partheniades-Krone relations for mud, and Engelund-Hansen for sand. The model was subjected to a range of idealised boundary conditions of tidal range, river discharge, waves and mud input. The model results show that mud is predominantly stored in mudflats on the side of the estuary. Marine mud supply only influences the mouth of the estuary whereas fluvial mud is distributed along the whole estuary. Coastal waves stir up mud and remove the tendency to form muddy coastlines and the formation of mudflats in the downstream part of the estuary. Widening continues in estuaries with only sand while mud supply leads to a narrower constant width and reduced channel and bar dynamics. This self-confinement eventually leads to a dynamic equilibrium where lateral channel migration and mud flat expansion are on average balanced. However, for higher mud concentrations, higher discharge and low tidal amplitude the estuary narrows and fills to become a tidal delta.\n                        </jats:p>"

We searched eight electronic databases up to 10 September 2016 for relevant terms and included only original English language peer-reviewed journal articles with a prospective design. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Seven articles met inclusion criteria, six of which used analytic methods allowing for meta-analysis. In all seven studies, the follow-up period was ≥12 months and attrition ranged from 3% to 15%. Parental supply of alcohol was associated with subsequent risky drinking (odds ratio = 2.00, 95% confidence interval = 1.72, 2.32); however, there was substantial risk of confounding bias and publication bias. In all studies, measurement of exposure was problematic given the lack of distinction between parental supply of sips of alcohol versus whole drinks. In conclusion, parental supply of alcohol in childhood is associated with  an increased likelihood of risky drinking later in adolescence. However, methodological  limitations preclude a causal inference. More robust longitudinal studies are needed, with particular attention to distinguishing sips from whole drinks, measurement of likely confounders, and multivariable adjustment.</jats:p>"

The goal of the research is to ascertain the influence of run workloads in a mixed energy supply mode on the functional preparedness of students aged 17–21 with a «high» content of the body mass fat component. Research findings. Run workloads in a mixed energy supply mode with a three times per week periodicity have an efficient influence upon the functional preparedness of students with a «high» content of the body mass fat component. After 8 weeks of training the females’ aerobic productivity level rose to «excellent», and it improved up to «satisfactory» level in males after 16 weeks of their training. Irrespective of sex, probable enhancement of the threshold of anaerobic metabolism relative indicators was registered after 16 weeks since the training sessions’ start. Such run workloads did not influence the females’ anaerobic productivity, while the males’ volume indices of the anaerobic lactate energy supply processes improved. Exercises with stimulation of anaerobic lactate energy supply processes furthered the body mass fat component content decrease from «high» to «normal» level, and the muscle component increase – from «normal» to «high» both in the females and males. Conclusions. Stimulation of anaerobic energy supply processes during run trainings irrespective of a person’s sex is likely to enhance the aerobic energy supply processes capacity in the maximum oxygen consumption indicators, as well as the aerobic energy supply processes volume in the threshold of anaerobic metabolism indices. Training sessions by the run workloads program conducted in a mixed energy supply mode didn’t cause probable changes in the females’ anaerobic productivity indices, while in the males they enlarged the volume of anaerobic lactate energy supply processes. Under the influence of such exercises as a whole the body mass fat component content gets reduced, while the muscle component content increases.</jats:p>"

To understand the spill’s impact on hospital operations, we surveyed representatives from 10 hospitals in the affected area during January 2014. We found that the spill-related loss of potable water affected many aspects of hospital patient care (eg, surgery, endoscopy, hemodialysis, and infection control of <jats:italic>Clostridium difficile</jats:italic>). Hospital emergency preparedness planning could be enhanced by specifying alternative sources of potable water sufficient for hemodialysis, <jats:italic>C. difficile</jats:italic> infection control, and hospital processing and cleaning needs (in addition to drinking water).

Intermediate-frequency vacuum arc experiments were carried out in interrupters with a diameter of 41 mm and CuCr50 alloy contact material. The results show that, as the frequency and peak value of the current increase, both the peak value and rise rate of the intermediate-frequency vacuum arc voltage also increase, and the interruption ability decreases. However, compared to the power frequency current at the same value, the erosion of the contacts is weaker over a shorter arc period. When the vacuum arc reignites, metal droplets are emitted from the contacts. The drive force is from the center of the contact to the edge. If the density of the plasmas and metal vapors and the number of the metal droplets reaches a certain level, the arc may break down, which will cause the interruption to fail.</jats:p>"

This has allowed the forest industry to diversify its product portfolio and maximize the economic returns from feedstock, while simultaneously working towards sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based products. Although previous research has explored industrial-scale production opportunities, many challenges persist, including the cost of woody biomass and its supply chain reliability. While numerous studies have addressed these issues, their emphasis has traditionally been on bioenergy, with little focus on biochemical, biomaterials, and bioproducts. This review seeks to address this gap through a systematic study of the work recently reported by researchers. A lot of work has been published from United States and Canada with an emphasis on bioenergy production (84.8%), 4.6% of the work is focused on biomass to materials and chemicals, and 10.6% addressed both. Between 2012 and 2015, the majority of published research focused on biomass to materials and chemicals and both biomass to energy and biomass to materials and chemicals. This fact highlights recent interests in diversified biorefinery portfolios. However, further work concerning forest biomass supply chain optimization and new high-value bio-based materials and chemicals is necessary.</jats:p>",

After the huge amount of systems that have been tested in the last forty years, the advent of nanotechnology and a careful design at molecular level, allow to obtain attractive activity, even using pure visible light. At the same time we are approaching reasonable photocatalyst stability in laboratory test, and the attention is paid to identify cost‐effective photocatalysts that might find real applications. This Review provides a broad overview of the elementary steps of the heterogeneous photocatalytic H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> production, including an outline of the physico‐chemical reactions occurring on semiconductors and cocatalysts. The use of different renewable oxygenates as sustainable sacrificial agent for the H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> production is outlined, in view of a transition from fossil fuels to pure water splitting. Finally, the recent advances in the development of photocatalyst are discussed focusing on the current progress in organic and hybrid organic/inorganic photocatalysts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A low-cost regulator insensitive to temperature and supply voltage variations for power management units of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag chips and other batteryless devices is proposed in this paper. The commonly used regulator has poor temperature rejection ratio (TRR) and poor voltage rejection ratio (VRR). By using combination resistors and long channel transistors, the bias and regulator circuits are improved over temperature variations. A power supply rejection (PSR) enhancement branch is also added to suppress the supply noise and stabilize the bias current. The regulator is designed and fabricated in the HJTC 0.25[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m CMOS technology. Simulation results show that this regulator achieves 0.044[Formula: see text]mV/[Formula: see text]C TRR when temperature varies from [Formula: see text]C to 70[Formula: see text]C and 1.1[Formula: see text]mV/V VRR while the supply voltage of the regulator ranges from 4 to 12[Formula: see text]V. The PSR is nearly [Formula: see text]100[Formula: see text]dB at DC. The area of this regulator is 0.102[Formula: see text]mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> including the bias circuit. The measurement results meet simulation results well and this regulator is successfully applied in HF passive tag chips within voltage deviations of [Formula: see text] of 2.5[Formula: see text]V. </jats:p>",

However, only 30–50% of applied fertilizer nitrogen are usually utilized by the plant. In this study, four soft red winter wheat genotypes (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L., IL07‐4415, MD05W10208‐11‐8, OH06‐150‐57 and Sisson) were grown under three different nitrogen regimes (high, medium, and low) in a greenhouse, and grain yield, grain protein concentration, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and their associated traits were evaluated. Among the four genotypes, a high‐yielding cultivar, Sisson, exhibited superior performance in terms of grain weight plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and NUE for yield (NUEY) at low nitrogen due to maintained grain number spike<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and harvest index. Significant yield losses due to nitrogen limitation were attributable to reduced spike number plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and grain number spike<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the other genotypes. Interestingly, a linear relationship between NUEY and NUE for grain protein (NUEP) was detected at high (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.67) and low (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.42) nitrogen; both of these traits were positively correlated with grain number spike<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, 1000‐seed weight, and harvest index under nitrogen‐limited conditions (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.35–0.48). These results suggest that simultaneous improvement of NUEY and NUEP could be achieved through the selection of the three yield components (grain number spike<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, 1000‐seed weight, and harvest index) at low nitrogen.</jats:p>",

We derive isolate-specific, genetic distance-based estimates of epidemic success, and we represent success-related time-dependent concepts, namely epidemicity and endemicity, by restricting analysis to specific time scales. The method is applied to analyze a surveillance-based cohort of 1,641 tuberculosis patients with minisatellite-based isolate genotypes. Known predictors of isolate endemicity (older age, native status) and epidemicity (younger age, sputum smear positivity) were identified with high confidence (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). Long-term epidemic success also correlated with the ability of Euro-American and Beijing MTBC lineages to cause active pulmonary infection, independent of patient age and country of origin.

Here, highly efficient Al‐ion intercalation into W<jats:sub>18</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>49</jats:sub> nanowires (W<jats:sub>18</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>49</jats:sub>NWs) with wide lattice spacing and layered single‐crystal structure for electrochemical storage is demonstrated. Moreover, a freestanding composite film with a hierarchical porous structure is prepared through vacuum‐assisted filtration of a mixed dispersion containing W<jats:sub>18</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>49</jats:sub>NWs and single‐walled carbon nanotubes. The as‐prepared composite electrode exhibits extremely high areal capacitances of 1.11–2.92 F cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> and 459 F cm<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> at 2 mA cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>, enhanced electrochemical stability in the Al<jats:sup>3+</jats:sup> electrolyte, as well as excellent mechanical properties. An Al‐ion‐based, flexible, asymmetric electrochemical capacitor is assembled that displays a high volumetric energy density of 19.0 mWh cm<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> at a high power density of 295 mW cm<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>. Finally, the Al‐ion‐based asymmetric supercapacitor is used as the power source for poly(3‐hexylthiophene)‐based electrochromic devices, demonstrating their promising capability in flexible electronic devices.</jats:p>",

Most existing approaches for event recognition purely employ either logical methods that do not handle uncertainty, or probabilistic methods that can hardly manage the representation of structured information. To overcome these limitations, especially in the situation where the uncertainty of sensing data is dynamically changing over the time, we propose a multi-level information fusion model for sensing data and contextual information, and also present a corresponding method to handle uncertainty for event recognition based on Markov logic networks (MLNs) which combine the expressivity of first order logic (FOL) and the uncertainty disposal of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). Then we put forward an algorithm for updating formula weights in MLNs to deal with data dynamics. Experiments on two datasets from different scenarios are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach. The results show that our approach (i) provides an effective way to recognize events by using the fusion of uncertain data and contextual information based on MLNs and (ii) outperforms the original MLNs-based method in dealing with dynamic data.</jats:p>"
