      "abstract": "<jats:p> Intertemporal timber supply models typically assume perfect capital markets and perfectly inelastic supplies of land. Using a dynamic model of U.S. timber and agriculture markets, we examine (i) borrowing limits or capital constraints, in which investment in forest management on nonindustrial private ownerships is restricted, and (ii) a nonzero elasticity of land supply. Results suggest that alternative treatments of supply conditions for these factors influence the flexibility of the simulated market system to adapt to changes over time and across policy scenarios. Supply restrictions limit adjustment options in management activities and force greater change in other endogenous elements such as price and consumption. Implications drawn from any policy analyses also differ with input supply assumptions. Policy impacts were found to be largely transitory in the cases without investment limits and essentially permanent when limits exist. Recognizing a price-sensitive land supply, at least as this process is represented in the present model, partially compensates for the imposition of borrowing restrictions, moving projections closer to behavior observed in the perfect capital market cases. Access to additional land as potential afforestation investments provides additional private investment flexibility. Typically, however, this linkage is neither explicit nor endogenous in forest sector models. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Limitations in energy supply is a classical hypothesis of muscle fatigue. The present paper reviews the evidence available from human studies that energy deficiency is an important factor in fatigue. The maximal rate of energy expenditure determined in skinned fibres is close to the rate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) utilisation observed <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> and data suggest that performance during short bursts of exercise (&lt;5 s duration) primarily is limited by other factors than energy supply (e.g. <jats:italic>V</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub> of myosine adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), motor unit recruitment, engaged muscle mass). Within 10 s of exercise maximal power output decreases considerably and coincides with depletion of phosphocreatine. During recovery, maximal force and power output is restored with a similar time course as the resynthesis of phosphocreatine. Increases in muscle store of phosphocreatine through dietary supplementation with creatine increases performance during high‐intensity exercise. These findings support the hypothesis that energy supply limits performance during high‐intensity exercise. It is well documented that pre‐exercise muscle glycogen content is related to performance during moderate intensity exercise. Recent data indicates that the interfibre variation in phosphocreatine is large after prolonged exercise to fatigue and that some fibres are depleted to the same extent as after high‐intensity exercise. Despite relatively small decreases in ATP, the products of ATP hydrolysis (Pi and free ADP) may increase considerably. FreeADP calculated from the creatine kinase reaction increases 10‐fold both after high‐intensity exercise and after prolonged exercise to fatigue. It is suggested that local increases in ADP may reach inhibitory levels for the contraction process.</jats:p>",

Currently no tritium-supply facility exists in the US, and due to the decay, the tritium inventory will fall below the required reserve level in 2011. To decide how to fill this projected gap, the US Department of Energy assessed 10 tritium-supply alternatives, including several types of new reactors, an accelerator, and the use of commercial reactors. The DOE compared the alternatives with respect to three objectives: production assurance, cost, and environmental impacts. We combined a dynamic production-simulation model and probabilistic assessments of schedule, production capacity, and availability risks to predict the production behavior of each alternative over 40 years. We also assessed the cost and environmental risks. The secretary of energy decided to pursue both the commercial-reactor and accelerator alternatives, based, in part, on the results of this analysis. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A new oxygen supply method to biofilm is proposed for simultaneous organic carbon removal and nitrification. The main feature of the method is use of hydrophobic porous membrane or oxygen enrichment membrane as substratum of biofilm. In the biofilm formed on oxygen permeable membrane, oxygen is supplied from the bottom to the surface of the biofilm through the membrane while organic pollutants are supplied from the surface to the bottom of the biofilm. The oxygen supply method allows nitrifiers near the bottom region to grow with less competition from BOD oxidizers. The microbial population was investigated in the biofilm formed on hydrophobic microfilter. Nitrifiers grew mainly in the bottom region while denitrifiers grew in the middle region of the biofilm formed on the membrane. Simultaneous organic carbon removal and nitrification were carried out successfully by the biofilm. Furthermore, the potential of the new oxygen supply method was demonstrated with the biofilm formed on an oxygen enrichment-type biomass carrier in a single-stage treatment of domestic wastewater. The nitrification rate was about 1.9 g/m2d and was comparable to that in the conventional biofilm process designed especially for nitrification.</jats:p>",

This fact has put high demand on the police, who are not only expected to reduce the availability of drugs but also to take part in the effort to affect the students' demand for drugs. The aim of this study was to analyze what impact students' demand for and perceived availability of illicit drugs in the seventh grade have on their attitudes towards and experience with drugs in the eigth grade. Moreover, the purpose was to investigate to what extent a specific police-led school-based drug prevention program, the project DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), affects students' attitudes and experiences regarding drugs. </jats:p><jats:p> As a part in an ongoing evaluation of the Swedish DARE program (called VÅGA) about 1 800 students in 22 Swedish junior high schools on three occasions anonymously answered questions about their attitudes towards and experiences with drugs. Contextual analysis was used to estimate the significance of various student-level risk-factors (such as family bonding, school involvement, and peer activity) and school aggregated contextual factors. </jats:p><jats:p> The results show that students' curiosity and perceived availability of illicit drugs at the school-level have statistically significant effects on drug-related attitudes and experiences at the individual-student level. The attitudes towards and experiences with drugs in the eigth grade of students who participated in the DARE program in the seventh grade were not different from those of students who did not participate in the program. A brief discussion of what measures the police should conduct in order to block the availability of drugs and what their role in schools should be are finally presented. </jats:p>",

        "Fig. 12 Radial (Rushton) type impeller. blade angle, it is best to work closely with the manufacturers of the mixer to specify an optimum design for the process. The preceding discussion of axial- and radial-flow turbines has been a very cur-sory survey of what can be a very involved and detailed study. As mentioned above, a large amount of research on these types of mixers is available [13,14]. A detailed dis-cussion of this subject would be beyond the scope of this work. If a blending or sus-pension problem occurs in large production batches, consultation of the references on mixing included at the end of this chapter or, even better, consulting the experts at the major manufacturers of this type of mixer, would be the best place to start. 3. Anchor Mixers An often overlooked mixing device, which is low speed and considered low capabil-ity, is the anchor agitator, so named for its anchorlike shape, as illustrated in Fig. 13. However, this slowly moving agitator makes it possible for many dispersion and emul-sification processes to be accomplished without overshear, aeration, and heat transfer problems. The anchor agitator is a slow (up to 50 rpm) device whose sole function is to rotate the contents of a batch in a radial direction without providing any significant shear. These are high-torque devices that must be designed sturdily to withstand the forces of the high viscosities. Anchor agitators are typically designed to be able to withstand a maximum viscosity beyond which they might actually bend or break. That is, the an-chor itself is built of materials strong enough to withstand the drag of the viscous liq-uid as it passes by the mixer. In addition, the motor has to supply the very high torque requirement that arises when the anchor is stirring viscous materials. When designing the mixer it is important not to understate the viscosity. This is especially important if there is a point in the process where the anchor must be stopped. If this happens, in the case of shear thinning materials, the agitator has to start up from rest in a viscosity much higher than that normally occurring during the process. Products exhibiting pseudoplastic or Bingham plastic behavior are very difficult to move when at rest."
