Half-maximal oxidation of cytochrome c occurred at 2.0 microM O2 in treated cells incubated under State 3 conditions, whereas in intact cells it was 6.0 microM and in isolated mitochondria (State 3) 0.69 microM. the intermediate value for treated cells indicates that both the geometry of mitochondrial packing and the intracellular diffusion coefficient are important in determining intracellular mitochondrial O2 dependence. Analysis of intracellular diffusion, assuming that the mitochondrial clustering increases the effective mitochondrial radius, indicates that an intracellular diffusion coefficient of between 10(-6) and 4 X 10(-6) cm2 . s-1 and an effective mitochondrial radius of approximately 2 micron would account for the observed intracellular O2 dependence of mitochondrial function. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Eighteen dogs were divided into three groups, each containing three volvulus and three control dogs. The stomachs of the volvulus dogs were rotated 360°, sutured in position, and kept decompressed by a Foley catheter placed in the fundus. Control dogs underwent the same manipulation, except that the stomach was replaced to normal position. One dog in each group was evaluated at 4, 8, and 12 hours. Evaluation consisted of SC<jats:sup>46</jats:sup> microsphere injection to determine percent cardiac output to various stomach regions, and gross and microscopic changes in the stomach and other tissues drained by the portal system. Cardiac output to the control stomachs exceeded the volvulus stomachs by fivefold. Time was not a significant factor. Edema was present throughout the volvulus stomach. The most severe histologic changes, such as hemorrhage, were seen in the greater curvature of volvulus stomachs. Other portal tissues were grossly and histologically normal. Three additional dogs were evaluated 1 week after creation and reduction of a 12 hour volvulus; the stomachs were normal indicating reversibility of pathologic changes. This study demonstrates abnormal blood flow in rotated nondistended stomachs. Anatomic repositioning should take place as soon as possible in the treatment of gastric dilation volvulus.</jats:p>",
