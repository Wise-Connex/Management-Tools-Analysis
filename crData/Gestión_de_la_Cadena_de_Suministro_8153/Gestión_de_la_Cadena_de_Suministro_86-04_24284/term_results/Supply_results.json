So, ultimately, investment returns derive from rent, and successful investment will depend on an understanding of the principles and forces which explain the market's determination of rental value. This paper explains the significance of supply elasticity to the determination of rental value and investigates the probable elasticities of the four main types of investment property. It concludes that, due to the very inelastic supply of farmland and prime High Street shops, trends in rental growth will reflect the profitability of occupation whereas, in general, the rental value of office and industrial property will tend to reflect development costs, due to their relatively elastic supply. The article investigates how far such predictions appear to be supported by evidence and briefly discusses the relative impact of obsolescence on the four property types.</jats:p>",

The demand functions are derived by maximizing a utility function characterized by weak inter‐temporal separability. Utility in each period is assumed to be of a generalized CES type with housing services and consumption goods as arguments. The estimating demand relation is transformed into a relatively simple form by focusing on the relative demand of housing to consumption goods. It is found that the intra‐temporal elasticity of substitution between housing and consumption goods is unitary. The maximum likelihood estimates of the other parameters of the elementary utility function are also presented. Finally, it is noted that by estimating the structure of individual preferences a basis is established for the calculation of long‐run efficiency gains of a change in the tax treatment of housing.</jats:p>",

Factors affecting supply for each country are (i) product price, (ii) wood density, and (iii) amount of forest resources. Demand (for each country) is modelled from per capita consumption and explaining variables are (i) product price and (ii) per capita income. The system is estimated in its reduced form with data from 35 countries. The study produced three main conclusions. (i) Production of timber is roughly proportional to each country's forest resource, (ii) The overall demand elasticity with respect to per capita income is negative, which implies that total demand for wood declines as income increase. This is explained by the fact that the demand for fuelwood declines faster than the demand for industrial roundwood increase when per capita income increase. (iii) The supply elasticity with respect to cost is around 2, which implies that an increase in cost by 1% might be expected to lead to decline in the supply of timber by 2%. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Milk supply response was estimated for Pennsylvania using three different levels of structural aggregation. The base level involved the estimation of milk production in a single equation. Under the second method, production was the product of two equations: milk per cow and number of milk cows. The third method factored production into three equations: milk per cow, number of dairy farms, and number of cows per farm. As expected, the greater the degree of disaggregation the more was learned about the structural aspects of milk production. At the same time, predictive accuracy generally decreased, but the differences among models was slight.</jats:p>",

It is peculiar in the use of the terms that the value of reliability is equivalent to the cost of unreliability. In attempting to identify and measure this cost, researchers have drawn a distinction between different types of cost, particularly short- and long-term costs. In this paper, we examine this distinction to clarify what may be a source of confusion. </jats:p>",

Here we explore two additional proposed descriptions of reservoir performance: the maximum shortfall from the target (system vulnerability) and the maximum number of consecutive periods of deficit during a record (system resilience). The larger the maximum shortfall, the greater the vulnerability. The shorter the maximum length of deficits, the more resilient the system. Using multiobjective mixed‐integer, linear programming, the tradeoffs between reliability, vulnerability, and resilience are examined. It is found that as reliability is increased or as the maximum length of consecutive shortfalls decreases (resilience increases), the vulnerability of the water system to larger deficits increases.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The breeding of the Wedge‐tailed Eagle <jats:italic>Aquila audax</jats:italic> was investigated in four areas of the arid zone of Western Australia from 1968 to 1976, with some supporting data from the adjacent Mediterranean zone. Breeding was dependent on, and geared to, the occurrence of a minimum level of available prey. In the arid zone the seasonally most regular occurrence of the low rainfall, combined with greatest diversity of vegetation and prey, was associated with the most regular breeding and the greatest annual productivity of young per pair. At the other extreme, where an identical mean annual rainfall was distributed more erratically between seasons and years and was combined with a less diverse flora, the prey available to eagles was restricted to virtually one species–the introduced European rabbit <jats:italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</jats:italic>. In this situation there were gaps of up to 4 years between the breeding of eagles, because of major fluctuations in the size of the population of its rabbit prey. Their density was actually greatest in those areas where the widely fluctuating food supply occasionally allowed them to breed with considerable success; however, this did not compensate fully for the irregularity of breeding. Where the prey available was thus restricted to a single species and was least stable, the area may have been unable to support a population which could maintain itself without recruitment from outside.</jats:p><jats:p>Breeding success in the Mediterranean zone was higher than in the arid zone. The Wedge‐tailed Eagle's breeding strategy is conservative (with ’k‐selected‘ characteristics), but this study shows that it is ecologically successful in both zones, although least so where the climate is extremely erratic.</jats:p>",

Surveillance of pharmacy sales of antidiarrheal medicines suggested that the outbreak was confined to Greenville and its immediate vicinity. Surveys demonstrated that the gastrointestinal illness attack rates inside and outside the city limits were 56 per cent (72/128) and 9 per cent (7/77), respectively (relative risk (RR) = 6.2); consumption of city water was associated with illness (RR = 12); and as water consumption increased, the attack rate also increased (p less than 0.001). Four adults were hospitalized and one outbreak-related case of Guillain-Barre' syndrome was identified. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from specimens from 11 ill persons; serologic studies showed the development of Campylobacter-specific antibodies. Fecal coliforms were found in water samples, but Campylobacter was not recovered from water. The city water plant, a deep well system, had numerous deficiencies including an unlicensed operator, a failure of chlorination, and open-top treatment towers. Birds were observed perching on the open-top treatment tower. Of 38 birds trapped seven weeks later, 37 per cent harbored C. jejuni; however, plasmid and serotyping studies showed that strains were not the same as the common strain from ill persons. This outbreak suggests that water systems that are unprotected from contact with birds may become contaminated and a source of outbreaks of human campylobacteriosis. </jats:p>",
