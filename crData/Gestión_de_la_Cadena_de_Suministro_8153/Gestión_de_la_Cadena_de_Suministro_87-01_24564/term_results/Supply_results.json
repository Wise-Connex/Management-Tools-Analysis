      "abstract": "<jats:p>The review begins with a look at the interlending of audiovisual materials. The main obstacles in this area are fear of damage in transit and packaging problems, costs of transportation, copyright and contractual restrictions, the lending/reference conflict, and problems of incompatibility of technical equipment. The general problems are discussed and also the situation in the United Kingdom and Australia. The interlending of music is examined with a critical look at an ambitious scheme for combining ILL and publication on demand by using telefacsimile. A continued growth in the volume of interlending traffic is detected by analysing figures from Canada, the USA, the German Democratic Republic, and the UK. The administration of ILL systems is critical for their efficiency and the questions of staffing and finance are examined. The nature of ILL work has changed so as to require more qualified staff and it is necessary to look at all the components of interlending work to estimate what elements, if any, should be charged to the system itself and what are overheads for general library use. Finally the value of grandiose networking schemes in Third World countries is questioned in the light of experiences from the Arab World, India, and Brazil.</jats:p>",

The constraints imposed by the arid climate have obliged Libya to place great reliance on the exploitation of groundwater reserves and in the most populous, northern regions these are becoming seriously depleted. The long-term safeguarding of the water supply and its possible augmentation to meet rising demand depends on current, expensive, investment. The most ambitious scheme is for a ‚Äòman-made river‚Äô in which water from the country's southern underground reserves will be carried in pipelines to the northern coastal region. Further investment is also being made in desalination plants, whilst additional improvements are recommended in the metering and maintenance of water supply installations. The degree of success of these ventures have vital implications for Libya's future agricultural and urban development.</jats:p>"

Statistical and background information is provided for a variety of library types: university, public, special, and the major library networks. Special attention is paid to the National Diet Library where a Library Co‚Äêoperation Department is seen as addressing some of the major problems. The view of the library in Japan as being an isolated unit with services available to a select group of patrons, is changing, the slow development of interlibrary co‚Äêoperation giving way to a growing awareness of the need for increased diffusion and availability of information.</jats:p>",

Plants grown outdoors in sand and a vermiculite/perlite mixture (V/P) gave relative weights of 75 and 100 in the presence of nitrate and 3 and 38 in its absence. In a growth chamber similar treatments produced values of 95 and 100 with nitrate, and 28 and 58 without nitrate. Soybeans in V/P flooded by preventing outflow (ST) or normally drained (D), gave relative weights in the ST and D treatments of 76 and 100 in the presence of nitrate, and 27 and 55 in its absence. Averaged over 21 cultivars, treatments of ST and D with nitrate, and of ST and D without nitrate gave values of 111, 100, 66 and 85. Differences between cultivars in reaction to flooding were small. Soybeans were also grown in V/P flooded by immersing pots in buckets of nutrient solution filled to the top of the pot (FB) or to a constant high water table, 85‚ÄÇmm below the pot surface (HB). Relative plant weights of 22, 100, 45 and 198 were obtained with nitrate, and 17, 79, 10 and 138 with no nitrate for ST, D, FB and HB treatments. All five experiments suggest that reduced availability of oxygen because of fine structure of the substrate or because of direct flooding has a more deleterious effect on soybean growth in the absence of combined N than in its presence. A high water table benefited soybean growth in comparison with normally watered and drained plants. The effects of respiration rate on speed of development of anoxic conditions, and the effects of nitrate on ATP production in both nodules and root tissue are discussed.Key words: Soybean, Glycine max (L.)

This hypoglycemia is totally reversed 1 h after the intragastric injection of an amount of galactose corresponding to the one ingested daily by the suckling newborns. This results from an active gluconeogenesis from galactose, which bypasses the site of inhibition by 3-MPA. However, this amount of galactose is not sufficient to maintain a normal blood glucose concentration for a long time, since 3 h after galactose injection, the blood glucose concentrations of newborn rabbits return to hypoglycemic values. When hepatic fatty acid oxidation is inhibited by 2-[6-(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate (POCA), 24-hour-old fasting rabbits become rapidly hypoglycemic secondary to a decrease in liver gluconeogenesis. The rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis is totally restored by giving medium-chain triglycerides, and the 24-hour-old rabbits become normoglycemic.</jats:p>"

This paper describes glasshouse experiments to vary the level of B supply to clover grown on soils low in B. On a soil farmed in a cereal clover rotation, herbage yields of clover increased by 25% with applied B, but seed yields, negligible without B, increased 21-fold. On two other acid soils, from pastures, there were also large responses to B in seed yield (1.5- and 5.1-fold respectively); liming increased the responses (8- and 55.2-fold). However, herbage production was less responsive to B (25% and 1.7-fold with liming); on the unlimed soils, application of B depressed yield (- 1 and -21%). This is attributed to there being enough B to sustain herbage growth, but inadequate for seed formation. These results show that herbage yield, conventionally employed in the past, is not a satisfactory index of B status for total performance in subterranean clover. The response to B in seed yield was associated with increases in: numbers of seed set (75% to 22.6-fold, depending on the particular combination of soil and liming); size of seed (10% to 1.2-fold); proportion of buried seed (20%-70%). It is suggested that these favour establishment and persistence of clover and that clover decline may well involve deficiency of B. It was shown that concentration of B in the plant does not necessarily relate predictably to yield of herbage and that reduction in seed yield may not be heralded by foliar symptoms, since seed requirement exceeds that of herbage.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the metabolic alterations following surgery, glucose is not completely oxidized but is converted into glycogen and lipids. Therefore we analysed 2 groups of 15 patients following surgery. They received parenteral nutrition with identical nitrogen (N = 0.28 g/kg/d) and lipid (1.5 g/kg/d) intake, whereby only the composition of carbohydrates was varied. Group I received exclusively glucose = 0.22 g/kg/h, and group II the combination fructose-glucose-xylitol in a proportion of 2:1:1 at the same infusion rate. The study lasted approximately 10 days. We found decreased exogenous insulin requirements and an increase in the NEFA levels with a maximum on the 3rd and 4th day in group II. There were no significant differences in the levels of either albumin, prealbumin or retinol-binding protein, nor were any hepatic or renal alterations related to the xylitol infusion observed. Xylituria was 6.13 ¬± 3 % of the amount infused. In our opinion, the partial substitution of glucose in group II led to a better utilisation of the infused energy supply, and to less insulin stimulation, which facilitated the mobilization of endogenous energy sources such as fatty acids, although we did not succeed in increasing the protein synthesis.</jats:p>"

Response to this treatment and to various oxygen concentrations was assessed by short-term acetylene reduction assays. Decreases in oxygen partial pressure reduced nitrogenase activity substantially in unstressed soybean nodules and even further in nodules of nitrate- or dark-stressed plants. Increasing oxygen concentrations from 21 to 60% severely restricted nitrogenase activity in control plants, but stimulated activity in soybeans exposed to 10 mol m-3 nitrate or darkness for 2 days. Less stressed plants (treated with 7.5 mol m-3 nitrate) were stimulated less by high oxygen tension. Soybeans deprived of light for 4 days were symbiotically inactive and did not respond to raised O2 concentrations. Bacteroids isolated from these plants had lost their autonomous activity but recovered in the presence of succinate, indicating substrate deprivation. The data presented suggest that suboptimal oxygen concentration near the bacteroids is an important factor limiting nitrogenase activity in nitrate-or dark-stressed soybeans.</jats:p>"

Not only have female‚Äêheaded households increased significantly as a proportion of all households in recent years, but these households are also more likely to be in poverty than are other households. Yet, the determinants of labor supply for this increasingly important demographic group still are largely unknown. Analyses are performed on a sample of employed female and male heads and wives from the 1976 Survey of Income and Education. We examine the effects of wages, unearned income, number of children, and several other variables on hours worked per year, allowing for race interactions. We find that female heads and wives are similar in the effects of wages on their labor supply, while female and male heads are similar in the positive effect of children. We conclude that although financial need, as evidenced by low wages and children, increases female heads‚Äôlabor supply, employment in more advantaged, non‚Äêfemale dominated jobs and core industries is needed to promote their full participation in the labor force.</jats:p>",

A free vehicle grab respirometer and <jats:italic>Alvin</jats:italic>‚Äêmanipulated grab respirometer were used to measure SCOC. Paired particle interceptor traps (PITs) were used to collect sedimenting small POC at 100 and 600 m above the bottom. SCOC decreased across the transect from the eutrophic coastal areas off southern California to the oligotrophic central Pacific gyre. These rates were generally highest in June and lowest between fall and early spring across the transect with a recurrent pattern in the magnitude of rates measured during the same months but different years. Flux of POC into the benthic boundary layer decreased across the transect from the eutrophic eastern to the oligotrophic central Pacific. No consistent temporal trends were evident in POC flux across the transect, possibly because of small sample sizes, high intra‚Äêstation variability, and short‚Äêterm deployments (‚â§7 d). Comparison of concurrently measured supply of POC with organic carbon demand of the sediment community as estimated from SCOC reveals a supply deficit across the transect for all seasons measured. For one nearly synoptic sampling period across the transect in June 1982, the supply‚Äêto‚Äêdemand ratio is lowest at the two nearshore stations where current speeds are highest. A predictive equation for SCOC with a least‚Äêsquares regression analysis and log‚Äêtransformed data revealed that POC flux as the independent variable accounted for only 59% of the variability in SCOC. Direct coupling between SCOC and POC flux is not confirmed by these results, which may be attributed to the limitations of the measurements or other organic carbon sources.</jats:p>",

A thermal ceiling (a low‚Äêtemperature radiator suspended above the bed and providing radiant heat (n = 35)) significantly increased the measured temperatures, which were restored to normal earlier than those in the controls.

With a combination of radiant heat and heated, humidified gases (n = 50), the postoperative heat balance was improved somewhat further.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A combine-sown crop of Calrose rice was grown on an alkaline self-mulching grey clay soil. Prilled urea (50 kg N ha-1) was broadcast at four different times: sowing, before permanent flood, after permanent flood and panicle initiation. Field microplots received 5 atom % 15N-labelled urea at the same times. Plant recovery of 15N applied at sowing was only 3.8%, with 80% unaccounted for. The data are consistent with the poor performance of rice fertilised at sowing (Part I) and the disappearance of mineral N from the top 20 cm of soil during the flushing period (Part II). Plant recovery of 15N applied after permanent flood was also relatively low (28%) with a loss of 45%. Even where fertiliser was used most efficiently in producing more grain (application before permanent flood and at panicle initiation), substantial losses were incurred (25-40%), with plant recoveries up to 41%. The lack of significant amounts of excess 15N in the soil at depths below 10 cm was consistent with the suggestion that leaching was not an important loss mechanism and that losses may be reduced by deep placement of the fertiliser (Part II). The majority of the nitrogen in the plant tops was derived from soil nitrogen, even where fertiliser nitrogen was used most efficiently, thus emphasising the importance of the rate and pattern of release of the soil N supply. Fertilisation increased soil nitrogen uptake by up to 7 kg N ha-1.</jats:p>"
