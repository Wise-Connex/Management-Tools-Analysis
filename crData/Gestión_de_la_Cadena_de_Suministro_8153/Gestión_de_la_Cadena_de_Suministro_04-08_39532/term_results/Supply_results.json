      "abstract": "<jats:p> Background Computer-controlled systems are commonly used in clinical trials to control dispensing and manage site inventories of trial supplies. Typically such systems are used with an interactive telephone or web system that provide an interface with the study site. Realizing the maximum savings in medication associated with this approach has, in the past, been problematic as it has been difficult to fully estimate medication requirements due to the complexities of these algorithms and the inherent variation in the clinical trial recruitment process. </jats:p><jats:p> Methods We describe the traditional and automated methods of supplying sites. We detail a simulation approach that models the automated system. We design a number of simulation experiments using this model to investigate the supply strategy properties that influence medication overage and other strategy performance metrics. </jats:p><jats:p> Results The computer-controlled medication system gave superior performance to the traditional method. In one example, a 75% overage of wasted medication in the traditional system was associated with higher supply failure than an automated system strategy with an overage of 47%. In a further example, we demonstrate that the impact of using a country stratified as opposed to site stratified scheme affects the number of deliveries and probability of supply failures more than the amount of drug wasted with respective increases of 20, 2300 and 4%. Medication savings with automated systems are particularly significant in repeat dispensing designs. We show that the number of packs required can fall by as much as 50% if one uses a predictive medication algorithm. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusions We conclude that a computer-controlled supply chain enables medication savings to be realized and that it is possible to quantify the distribution of these savings using a simulation model. The simulation model can be used to optimize the prestudy medication supply strategy and for midstudy monitoring using real-time data contained in the study database. </jats:p>",

Its main conclusion is that it is labour productivity which determines international competitiveness in the long run. However, appropriate economic-policy measures are required to prevent the erosion of relative international competitiveness by increasing labour costs and the real appreciation of the national currency.</jats:p>",

It is shown that the presence of monopolistic competition influences the size of all comparative static results. The paper also shows that the size of the elasticity of substitution between leisure and consumption of the final good plays a crucial role in determining the impact of changes in the supply of capital on utility‐maximising labour supply and welfare. Specifically, it is shown that capital mobility has no impact on optimal labour supply if the elasticity of substitution is equal to unity. The impact of a small capital inflow on welfare can be negative if the elasticity of substitution is sufficiently larger than unity.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

In this paper it is argued that conventional organisational structures and forecast‐driven supply chains are not adequate to meet the challenges of volatile and turbulent demand which typify fashion markets.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Within recent years, various concepts have arisen in environmental management that directly address the flow of material (and information) along life cycles or supply chains and thereby relate to inter‐organizational management aspects. These include industrial ecology (IE), life‐cycle management, closed‐loop supply chains, integrated chain management and green/environmental or sustainable supply chain management. It is not clear how these concepts relate to each other and whether or how they are different. Starting with sustainable development three criteria are identified that allow the comparison of the four concepts. Building on definitions the concepts are discussed and analysed using the three criteria while also identifying a distinctive feature of each approach. The criteria reveal that the concepts take a specific approach to study material flows in their particular system boundaries. This also relates to the time frame usually applied within the concept as well as the relevant actor network taken into account. Beyond these differences, it arises that the concepts have their strengths on different levels, which leads to a framework for the interrelation of the concepts.

In this paper, climatic and other regional influences on the costs of water supply in the USA are explored using multivariate analysis of water supply costs from water supply utilities located throughout the USA. Results showed that over 90% of the variation in present water supply capital and operating costs for surface and ground water systems can be explained by variations in quantity of water delivered, with other variables, particularly regional climate, playing a negligible role. An analysis of the historic development of water supply in the USA showed that capital expenses for water supply systems are a relatively small component of the present total annual costs because: (1) the original capital expenditures were reduced for utilities due to large public subsidization; (2) repayment of capital expenditures is now complete owing to the long time period since the original investments; and (3) new policies encourage demand management instead of supply expansion. Therefore, the present costs of water supply are not related to climate and thus are not a useful guide to future costs in studies that evaluate climate change impacts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper theoretically and empirically examines the conventional wisdom in procurement management that often portrays supply inspections and supplier plant inspections as substitutes. We develop a theoretical model that focuses on potential internal spillover costs of the buyer receiving low-quality inputs and external spillover costs should low-quality inputs go undetected. Key to our analysis is the condition of whether a buyer can commit to the intensity of supply inspection. If a buyer cannot commit, supply inspections and plant inspections are substitutes, as widely believed. The two types of inspections, however, may become complements when a buyer is able to commit to the intensity of supply inspection. Complementarity is especially likely when (a) external spillovers are smaller than expected internal spillovers, which depends on the level of buffer inventory, (b) when knowledge sharing between buyer and supplier becomes more effective as the supplier allocates more resources to learning for quality improvement, or (c) when hiding aspects of the production processes is easier for suppliers. We empirically evaluate our model with a new data set drawn from a large biotechnology manufacturer. Empirical results provide broad support for theory, which, we argue, might help to explain variation in inspection practices across industries. Our theory and empirical analysis contribute to the literatures on strategic management, organizational economics, and procurement management by highlighting the organizational and strategic use of inspection practices. </jats:p>",

The authors consider two alternatives: extensive expansion of the school system (i.e., bringing education to the poor), and subsidizing investment in education by the poor (i.e., bringing the poor to the education system). To this end, the authors evaluate PROGRESA, a large poverty‐alleviation program recently introduced in Mexico, which subsidizes education. Using double‐difference regression estimators on data collected before and after the program for randomly selected “control” and “treatment” households, the relative impacts of the demand‐ and supply‐side program components are estimated. Combining these estimates with cost information, it is found that the demand‐side subsidies are substantially more cost‐effective than supply‐side expansions.</jats:p>",

Supercapacitors are new and powerful components for energy storage. Compared with batteries, the amount of energy supercapacitors can store is low and does not allow large vehicle autonomy. Because supercapacitors have the property to be re-loadable in a few seconds, a sequential supply system has been developed, considering repetitive feeding at the stops. To solve the problem of the high power amount needed to reach short refill times, a solution is proposed, which consists of using an intermediary supercapacitive tank placed at fixed stations, which is refilled between the bus arrivals with a much lower power. In addition to the description of the needed power electronic converters, theoretical and experimental results are presented, defining the controlled profile of the instantaneous power level, in order to achieve a fast energy transfer between two supercapacitive tanks. </jats:p>",

Postischemic and postnecrotic gliosis of the spinal cord tissue in segments C6-Th2 was confirmed at MRI examination. The location of the postischemic medullar lesion did not have the typical “pencil-like” appearance usually present in the impairment of arterial supply. Instead, the lesion had an atypical distribution of ischemic changes in the ventral marginal part of the spinal cord near the sulcomarginal incisura suggesting impairment of the venous drainage system. After low-molecular heparins and antibiotic treatment, the patient made a very good recovery with functional restitution. Spinal MR-angiography showed a normal arterial blood supply. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Carotenoids are isoprenoid pigments that function as photoprotectors, precursors of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), colorants and nutraceuticals. A major problem for the metabolic engineering of high carotenoid levels in plants is the limited supply of their isoprenoid precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), formed by condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) units usually synthesized by the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids. Our earlier work with three of the seven MEP pathway enzymes suggested that the first reaction of the pathway catalyzed by deoxyxylulose 5‐phosphate synthase (DXS) is limiting for carotenoid biosynthesis during tomato (<jats:italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</jats:italic>) fruit ripening. Here we investigate the contribution of the enzyme hydroxymethylbutenyl diphoshate reductase (HDR), which simultaneously synthesizes IPP and DMAPP in the last step of the pathway. A strong upregulation of <jats:italic>HDR</jats:italic> gene expression was observed in correlation with carotenoid production during both tomato fruit ripening and <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic> seedling deetiolation. Constitutive overexpression of the tomato cDNA encoding HDR in <jats:italic>Arabidopsis</jats:italic> did not increase carotenoid levels in etioplasts. By contrast, light‐grown transgenic plants showed higher carotenoid levels and an enhanced seed dormancy phenotype suggestive of increased ABA levels. The analysis of double transgenic <jats:italic>Arabidopsis</jats:italic> plants overproducing both the enzyme taxadiene synthase (which catalyzes the production of the non‐native isoprenoid taxadiene from GGPP) and either HDR or DXS showed a twofold stronger effect of HDR in increasing taxadiene levels. Together, the data support a major role for HDR in controlling the production of MEP‐derived precursors for plastid isoprenoid biosynthesis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The influence of fluid‐dynamic conditions on the yield of <jats:italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</jats:italic> microalgal cultures was analyzed in two stages: first, the influence of air flow rate; second, the influence of using fluid‐moving pumps for recirculating the culture. With respect to the air flow rate, the yield of the cultures increased with the aeration rate up to values of 2.0 v/v/min, then stress was observed and the yield of the cultures decreased. With respect to the influence of mechanical power supply for liquid impulsion, three different types of pumps—centrifugal, pulse, and peristaltic—were essayed at different power supplies. The cultures were stressed for the three types of pumps essayed. For each pump, the higher the power supply the lower was the Fv/Fm value and the higher was the stress at which cells were exposed. The highest measured stress was when the culture was moved with the centrifugal pump. Despite measured stress, for all the experiments stable steady states were reached, thus indicating that cells reduced their yield but did not die, as was verified by cell viability measurements. It was observed that the increase of the power supply improved the frequency of light exposition thus enhancing the yield of the cultures. However, the higher the power supply, the lower the microeddy length scale; therefore, stress could appear. Data demonstrated that the microeddy length scale was always much higher than cell size and therefore the turbulence was not responsible for stress. Also, the mass transfer was discarded as responsible for yield reduction. It was concluded that the shear rate was the factor determining the existence of stress phenomena. The evaluation of these shear rates demonstrated that values above 30–80 s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> damaged the cells strongly. These data were verified in an outdoor pilot‐scale tubular photobioreactor that was implemented with the same type of pumps, thus demonstrating the necessity to take into account this factor in the design and scale‐up of microalgal photobioreactors. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",
