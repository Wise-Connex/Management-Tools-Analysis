      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates how knowledge diffusion occurs in a globally dispersed supply network, wherein buying firms and suppliers often do not have strong relationships and competitive tensions prevail. We elaborate the Network of Practice (NoP) view by examining a global supply network in the food sector that is as an exemplar of high global dispersion. This paper provides several novel insights into global knowledge diffusion. We introduce the NoP concept of<jats:italic>homophily</jats:italic>into the field of supply chain management to explain knowledge diffusion within global supply networks. We take a longitudinal perspective to show that although prior contractual ties (<jats:italic>relational homophily</jats:italic>) and co‐location (<jats:italic>location homophily</jats:italic>) initially drive knowledge diffusion, in the long‐term, shared practices (<jats:italic>practice homophily</jats:italic>) are the principal driver of knowledge diffusion. We demonstrate that buying firms’ assurance of<jats:italic>procedural justice</jats:italic>, together with the predominance of geographically dispersed suppliers and the emergence of<jats:italic>nexus members</jats:italic>, can help dampen supplier resistance to knowledge diffusion. The study shows that knowledge diffusion in a global supply NoP occurs in two complementary forms—broadcasting forums and action groups—which vary in breadth, depth, and tie diversity. Ultimately, we present vertical (buyer‐supplier), horizontal (suppliersupplier), and diagonal (non‐competitive) relationships as important refinements of the NoP view that characterize a global supply NoP. Overall, our findings offer a path for buying firms to establish adequate online infrastructure to support the emergence of decentralized and self‐organized knowledge diffusion in a globally dispersed supply network.</jats:p>",

Digital transformation (DT) is the use of digital advances to change customer relationships, internal processes, and value propositions [2]. The biggest future impact on revenue and EBIT growth can be generated through the digitization of supply chains [3]. In this context, the present paper proposes to apply digital transformation to supply chain, and especially to “order to cash” cycle, through an experimentation of the “Supply Chain Urbanization” model (SCU) [4, 5]. We will start in this paper by presenting the “order to cash” cycle according to various references; we will next emphasize Digital transformation before highlighting the “Digital transformation in “order to cash” cycle. We will after illuminate the different phases of the “Supply Chain Urbanization” model (SCU) [4, 5], and then experiment this model on supply chain digital transformation. The \"Order to Cash\" cycle will be the main link in the supply chain studied in our article.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Продовольственная безопасность стран и регионов, продовольственное обеспечение населения территорий и управление логистической цепочкой поставок продовольствия являются ключевыми приоритетными областями во всем мире. Цепочка поставок продуктов питания охватывает деятельность, связанную с сельскохозяйственным производством, переработкой аграрной продукции, складированием, транспортировкой и распределением. Несмотря на жизненно важную роль системы продовольственного обеспечения для устойчивого развития любого региона, развивающиеся арктические регионы Российской Федерации сталкиваются с множеством проблем логистического характера. Наиболее сложной проблемой в этом отношении является обеспечение населения продовольствием не только в необходимом количестве, но также требуемого качества и своевременно. Актуальность исследования определяется отсутствием современных моделей логистических систем продовольственного обеспечения. К числу подобных проблем, оказывающих негативное воздействие на эффективность функционирования системы продовольственного обеспечения, можно отнести поставки с многократной перевалкой грузов, отсутствие погрузочных и разгрузочных площадок, плохое состояние транспортных средств, неправильное обращение с перевозимыми продуктами, а также плохую обработку. Неадекватная логистическая инфраструктура, плохое управление спросом, неэффективная система хранения и распределения, низкая покупательная способность  вот лишь несколько причин дефицита питательных веществ в продовольствии, которое доступ но жителям арктических территорий. В исследовании предпринята попытка формирования концептуальной модели на основе теории критического фактора успеха как комплексной основы для внедрения логистической схемы распределения продовольствия путем отслеживания продовольственных потоков.

The food supply chain covers activities related to agricultural production, processing of agricultural products, warehousing, transportation and distribution. Despite the vital role of the food supply system for the sustainable development of any region, the developing Arctic regions of the Russian Federation face many logistical challenges. The most difficult problem in this regard is providing the population with food not only in the required quantity, but also in the required quality. Such problems that have a negative impact on the functioning of the food supply system include supplies with multiple transshipment of goods, lack of loading and unloading platforms, poor condition of vehicles, improper handling of transported products, and poor handling. Inadequate logistics infrastructure, poor demand management, an inefficient storage and distribution system, and low purchasing power are just a few of the causes of food shortages that are available to residents of the Arctic. The study attempted to formulate a con ceptual model based on the theory of the critical success factor as an integrated basis for the introduction of a logistic scheme of food distribution by tracking food flows. The model is based on the identification and classification of various critical factors necessary for the formation of a conceptual model.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Australia’s expensive housing market is claimed to be primarily the result of a shortage of supply due to town planning constraints, leading to political pressure on councils and state governments to remove planning regulations, regardless of their planning merit. We argue that this supply story is a myth and provide evidence against three key elements of the myth. First, there has been a surplus of dwellings constructed compared to population demand, rather than a shortage. Second, planning approvals typically far exceed dwelling construction, implying that more approvals or changes to planning controls on the density and location of development cannot accelerate the rate of new housing supply. Third, large increases in the rate of housing supply would have small price effects relative to other factors, like interest rates, and come with the opportunity cost of forgone alternative economic activities. Indeed, if the story were true, then property developers would be foolishly lobbying for policy changes that reduce the price of their product and the value of the balance sheets, which mostly comprise undeveloped land.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>With countries moving towards reaching the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goal to achieve HIV epidemic control, there are going to be an unprecedented number of persons tested, treated, and regularly monitored for viral suppression. However, most of the countries with the greatest burden of HIV/AIDS experience regular stock outages which could be detrimental to reaching these targets. Antiretroviral therapy and other commodities such as HIV test kits and laboratory supplies need to be readily and consistently available in order to achieve these targets.\nMedical Access Uganda Limited implemented several interventions as part of a procurement and supply chain strengthening project with the ultimate goal of supply chain improvement for access to HIV medicines. These interventions were evaluated using performance-monitoring-indicators from 2011-2016. We tested for the significance in the change in scores of performance-monitoring-indicators using the test for difference in proportions. Health facilities were scored on six categories and accredited as bronze, silver, or gold based on their total scores. Kaplan Meier estimates were computed for time to silver and gold ranking and Cox proportional hazards models were computed for time to gold ranking.\nThe 13 sites with a baseline score &lt;50 achieved a final score of (Unranked=0,Bronze(50-69)=2,Silver(70-89)=8,Gold(≥90)=3), 44 sites with a baseline score 50-69 achieved a final score of (U=0,B=0,S=26,G=18), 106 sites with a baseline score 70-89 achieved a final score of  (U=0,B=3,S=62,B=41) and 31 sites with a baseline score ≥90 achieved a final score of  (U=0,B=1,S=10,G=20). We observed a significant reduction in reported stock outs from 46%-4% (p&lt;0.001). Accurate stock card inventory rose from 79%-91% (p&lt;0.001); adequate stock levels from 54%-71% (p=0.002) and stock reporting rates from 91%-100% (p&lt;0.001). The stock order fill rate improved from 93%-97% (p=0.375). Patient load (medium vs low adjusted hazard ratio (aHR):2.19,p=0.026; high vs low aHR:2.97,p=0.034) and number of support supervision visits (6-10 aHR:3.33,p=0.024; &gt;10 aHR:5.78,p= 0.003) were associated with better stock management ranking scores.\nImprovements in supply chain management in countries committed to achieving the 90-90-90 goals are crucial to achieving HIV epidemic control. Health system strengthening and mentorship investments in Uganda were feasible and are essential for sustainable disease control efforts.</jats:p>"

By collecting data from the Blue Maritime Cluster and the Norwegian central company register one is able both to trace the fall in the activity due to the crisis and measures of financial strength. The study approaches the data by using a structural time series analysis in order to map cycles as deviations from polynomial trends.The findings ascertain that financial instability was dominant within the Blue Maritime Cluster during its boom before the crisis. Debt ratios and thereby gearing (leverage) were high. Thus, the companies could not meet their obligations when the crisis hit.The paper also finds that narrow focused supply chain management made the cluster fall deep into the abyss. Companies with a more diversified portfolio were able to meet the hard years better than others.</jats:p>",

In each experiment, children saw scenarios about sandwiches from different shops, which varied in supply (number of sandwiches produced for the day) and demand (number of customers attracted). In Experiments 1 and 2, 5- to 6-year-olds gave higher desirability ratings for sandwiches from shops with greater than lesser demand when supply was held constant. In Experiment 3, 5- to 7-year-olds gave higher desirability ratings for sandwiches from shops with less than more supply when demand was held constant. Finally, in Experiment 4, 5- to 6-year-olds were more likely to judge that sandwiches came from a good shop (rather than from a bad one) when demand exceeded supply than when supply exceeded demand. Together, the findings reveal a way that children can infer how desirable resources are, without needing to incur the costs that would normally be required to obtain and sample the resources themselves.</p>"

Third, the paper seeks to investigate the ability to yield the Coleman rent in the triadic supply chains with the structural hole, although this type of rent is typically linked to another arrangement called closure.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Given the increasing attention paid to the role of social capital within supply chains, this study investigates how relational embeddedness can be used by the manufacturer, sitting on the structural hole and running the network governance mechanism, to yield the Coleman rent in the triadic supply chain.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

In the process of each supply chain, risks will always be encountered. The risks in each tier of shallot supply chain certainly need to be identified and analyzed. The categories of each of these risks will determine the appropriate supply chain risk management steps based on the risk categories obtained. This study was conducted to analyze the risk of shallot supply chains in the three largest shallot producing sub-districts. The Rapid Agricultural Supply Chain Risk Assessment (RapAgRisk) method is used to carry out risk analysis, and the sampling method used was purposive sampling and snowball sampling. The results show that the farmer is the tier with most risks faced compared to the others. Excessive stock is the risk that requires adequate priority to manage, and it is faced by all levels of the shallot supply chain. Meanwhile, farmers are the weakest supply chain actors in bargaining power, and the small traders are the most vulnerable actors in the face of risks associated with quality damage and slow sales rate.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study is to assess the application of time-periodic supply velocities to enhance mixing in mixing ventilation cases to reduce heating and cooling energy demands. This paper presents computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a generic mixing ventilation case, in which the time-averaged velocities and pollutant concentrations from a reference case with constant supply velocities were compared with those obtained from a case with time-periodic supply velocities (sine function). The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) CFD simulations indicate that the use of time-periodic supply velocities can reduce high pollutant concentrations in stagnant regions, reduces the overall time-averaged pollutant concentrations and increases contaminant removal effectiveness with about 20%. The influence of the period of the sine function was assessed and the results showed that for the periods tested, the differences are negligible. Finally, the URANS approach was compared with the large eddy simulations (LES) approach, indicating that URANS leads to very similar results (NMSE &lt; 3.2%) as LES and can thus be regarded as a suitable approach for this study. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Mixed integer linear programming is frequently applied to identify promising design solutions of energy supply systems. However, application-relevant optimization models are often associated with complicating model features, e.g. numerous discrete design candidates or a large time horizon of the optimization. So, even state-of-the-art solvers may be confronted with major challenges to find satisfying solutions within reasonable time. In this paper a systematic multi-stage optimization approach is proposed that is intended to support the available algorithms in solving these complex problems. The basic idea of the approach is the distribution of the original problem into two major levels. On the first level, promising design candidates are generated using simplified optimization models. These simplifications are achieved through time series aggregation and the relaxation of operational binary variables. In the second stage, the objective values of the design candidates for the original problem are determined. The division of the problem into two stages leads to a significant reduction in required optimization time but simultaneously leads to an uncertainty regarding the quality of the found solution. Therefore, in a subsequent step, it is checked whether the objective value is within an acceptable distance from the theoretically best solution. If this is not the case, the first two steps are iteratively repeated. The proposed multi-stage approach is applied to the optimization of an energy supply system located in Germany. The results show a superior performance regarding required optimization time over conventional methods.</jats:p>",

Group wide initiatives such as development and roll-out of Labour Rights and Worker Welfare Standards, were supported at site by a ‘labour rights toolkit’ that included: Supply chain training to highlight why we need to get these issues right.Monitoring across our projects to understand the extent of the issues.Implementation arrangements drawn up collaboratively with our supply chain partners to establish protections for migrant workers, andA programme of oversight to assure compliance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To date we have seen a progressively improving picture of both awareness and management of the issues on our projects. The Employer Pays Principle is being implemented down the supply chain, ensuring employing companies (not workers) pay for the cost of recruitment, thereby reducing the debt workers incur in their search for work. Retention of passports only occurs with worker consent, and workers have unrestricted access to their documents and freedom of movement. Employment contracts are also in a language workers understand (or that has been properly explained to them), so they are aware of the terms of their employment and more able to assert their rights.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The programme is currently being rolled out across Petrofac. We are increasing our engagement with industry to share good practice and are committed to working in partnership with our clients and supply chain to ensure human rights are respected across our business and we continue to set our projects up for success.</jats:p>",

We show that there is a negative relationship of the premium with the relative supply of German sovereign bonds, which is more pronounced for higher maturities and when risk aversion proxied by bond market volatility is high.

While product service systems are well established in many manufacturing industries, it has barely emerged in the fragmented and project-based organisation of construction. The objective of this study is to identify and critically review examples of product service systems in construction supply chains, with the purpose of describing how it challenges prevailing business systems and organisation of construction work. The study rests upon two case studies carried out at Gyproc Saint-Gobain in Denmark and Celsa Steel Service in Sweden. The findings reveal significant challenges related to the implementation and marketing of the product service systems provided. Companies that develop and expand their business offers by providing new product service systems tend to find themselves operating in two parallel market segments, i.e. the traditional market of construction components and the new market of product service systems. The PSS-offers reviewed in the case studies show a strong focus and emphasis on the development of the offer and the operational platform, while the companies’ market positions remain unchanged. Thus, the case study companies organise and operate their businesses and market relations as before the implementation of the product service system. The conclusion is that development and implementation of product service systems in construction supply chains requires awareness in the companies’ offer of products and services, well-established operational platforms, and particularly, a renewed market position.</jats:p>"

The grid is used as secondary or backup source to run the motor in case solar panel fails to provide sufficienct energy. The proposed system helps to supply continuous amount of power to the motor which can be used for irrigation. The energy from the solar panel is used to store energy in the battery which in turn is used to run the motor.A simulation of the proposed system is carried out to demonstrate the applicability of the system.</jats:p>"

However, its study is relatively rare in the literature on SC collaboration and sustainability management research, despite its advantages in sustaining connectivity and reliability among SC partners. This study investigates how the use of blockchain in SC activities can influence (increase or decrease) SC partnership efficiency and growth, thereby affecting SC performance outcomes. Specifically, this study empirically validates a measurement and structural equation model with 306 SC experts from various industries. The findings show that the blockchain technology characteristics (information transparency, information immutability, and smart contracts) have significant positive effects on partnership growth and marginal effects on partnership efficiency. Though partnership growth has a positive effect on firm performance, partnership efficiency shows a negative effect.</jats:p>"

Modern supervised and unsupervised machine learning systems were implemented to classify the obtained results. The results of the research showed that on the basis of the established empirical exponent in the systems in which the pressure is reduced at night, it is possible to qualify the operating conditions of the water supply system in the DMA with accuracy of up to 90%.

Data were sourced using both structured and semi-structured questionnaire survey consisting of 140 SMEs registered with the Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB).Research outcomes revealed that supply chain collaboration is a precursor of SME performance. Whereas, internal management, use of information communication technology and innovation were proven to be statistically insignificant predictors of SME performance.The analysis of the study is deterministic and findings are hypothetical. The research design prohibits studying SME performance using exploratory views. In addition, data collection tool was standardized questionnaire design, and operationalised using quantitative procedures. Application of an in-depth interview could have given profound insights of the studied phenomenon.The practical effects of this study are that: owners and/or Managers of SMEs should improve performance by engaging in collaborative approaches such as long term contracts and interdependence. Scholarly presentations on the effects of supply chain management practices on the performance of SMEs in Arua Municipality, Uganda have attracted little scholarly attention in the past years.

The analysis (1) identifies and describes design practices that the company initiated to support service innovation (including new products, processes and business models) (2) identifies challenges in adopting and institutionalising such practices. The results show that the company supports both externally and internally oriented design practices – and loosens the boundary between the two – through the activities in the Fung Academy and a new innovation hub, Explorium, with a particular focus on utilising digital technologies. Specifically, the study demonstrates how the company empowers and involves a variety of stakeholders (individuals, groups, and organisations) in value co-creating practices involving absorptive, collaborative, and adaptive practices that aim to challenge or disrupt current practices. The study uncovers that some of the major challenges in such aspirations lie in the adaptation of design thinking organising logic and mindset to specifics of the Chinese socio-cultural context.</jats:p>"

The development of CBTIs as a form of community social enterprise is considered important because the company is expected to foster economic, socio-cultural and environmental harmonization. Development of tourist destinations in the village of Bejiharjo is the opposite. Based on an analysis of the performance of tourist supply chain (TSC) management, the level of citizen participation, the number of tourists, and tourism income increased dramatically in the beginning of the growth. However, in recent developments, the level of participation is no longer in line with the number of tourist visits and income. In fact, social companies operate on limited, inefficient management performance, poor tourism services, and tourist disaffection. This is due to the weakness of social companies in managing TSC. The company faces various scarcities and weaknesses in developing strategies and management of each chain. This can be seen from the weak source of empowerment strategy, enterprise management, development and innovation of tourism products and tourist services. Government policies tend to be ineffective, have unclear rules, and are accompanied by difficulties in establishing rules and agreements between companies. The entire process of TSC management has made social companies face conflict among enterprise and landlord and the performance fell sharply. Furthermore, this condition might marginalize and disadvantage the destination. This is a big challenge for the process and purpose of the community social enterprises</jats:p>"

Supply chain optimisation (SCO) has been used to help other industries and can be used to boost biomass industry viability. Biomass supply chain models frequently average the biomass yield of large tracts of land in their calculations. However, there can be large variation in the biomass yield within those tracts, losing useful information. This work presents a biomass SCO framework which approximates the available quality of land by piecewise linearly approximation of the biomass yield distribution, and incorporates this information into the optimisation. The linear estimates of the biomass yield distributions allow the SCO model to make more informed decisions about quantity and location of biomass growth operations, affecting all downstream decisions. A case study of mainland Great Britain has been examined using the framework to illustrate the impact of retaining biomass yield information in the optimisation, versus averaging the yield across tracts of land. The case study found that using biomass yield linear estimates reduced the overall land usage by 10%. Further, it improved biomass output, which increased the quantity of bio-products produced. All of this led to an increase in the overall profit.</jats:p>",

To solve this problem, a reconfigurable equalization circuit with an additional power supply is proposed. By replacing the cell with the additional power supply, the purpose of stabilizing the voltage of the battery pack is achieved. Aiming at the additional power supply, this paper puts forward a method that the additional power supply participates in the charging (discharging) process when the SOC (state of charge) of the battery pack is not lower (higher) than the additional power supply while the battery pack is charging (discharging), to make the charge and discharge capacity of the additional power supply always better than the battery pack. The experimental results show that the proposed equalization circuit can not only retain the advantages of the traditional reconfigurable equilibrium circuit but also maintain the voltage of the battery pack in the equalization process.</jats:p>",

Experiments were performed with probes for 10 months with copper guards; PVC guards coated with paint mixed with copper powder; and a water jet mechanism. Previous studies focused on the use of one antifouling method, using biocides such as copper and silver and mechanical cleaning, such as air jets, mostly on single parameter probes. The present work looks at multi-parameter probes and compares different antifouling options. Additional periods of reliability were verified with all alternatives. For the conductivity parameter, an additional period of up to 29 days (48%) with copper guards was observed, 26 days (43%) with water jets, and 37 days (61%) with copper powder paint mix. For dissolved oxygen, an additional period of up to 23 days (38%) was observed with copper guards, 29 days (48%) with water jets, and 60 days (100%) with copper powder paint mix. For pH, monitoring was reliable for 90 days (100%) with copper guards, and 60 days (67%) with copper powder paint mix. For turbidity, an additional period of up to 7 days (12%) was observed with copper guards, 3 days (5%) with water jets, and 57 days (95%) with copper powder paint mix.</jats:p>",

A novel design of a cylindrical air gap membrane distillation module is presented. The module is fabricated in a way similar to a shell and tube heat exchanger. A PTFE hydrophobic membrane is used and is formed in a cylindrical shape. Design of experiments (DOE) is used to design the experiments statistically and to identify the significant operating parameters. Experiments were performed according to the Taguchi design approach using an L16 orthogonal array. Optimization of the whole process is performed by response surface methodology. It is shown that the feed temperature and feed flow rate have a positive effect, whereas the salinity has a negative impact on flux. The maximum value of flux achieved with this system is 3.6 kg/m2 hr. A high value of flux of 2.6 kg/m2 hr was achieved under optimum conditions at a temperature of 45 °C and a flow rate of 1.5 lpm with a salinity of 5 g/litre.</jats:p>",

When sanitation problems arise in dense residential areas that are not well ordered and are also not handled in a way that is not sanitary, it will pollute the surrounding environment. Changes in community behavior to be more environmentally friendly do not just happen, but through the process of forming behavior that has a background and motivation. The motivation then raises behavior that influences the actions and efforts of the community towards the sustainability of the activity. So that this study will also analyze the role of the community and other involved stakeholders in the mechanism of improving the sanitation of the slum environment. MCK management activities are part of the practice of community behavior in improving sanitation. The government of the North Kembangan village has tried to improve this condition through programs to improve the settlement environment with the concept of community empowerment, this program involves community participation starting from the planning, implementation to the utilization and maintenance stages. It is expected that with this community participation a sense of ownership of development outcomes can be achieved so that the sustainability of the program can be achieved.</jats:p>"

The current study presents an innovative technique, termed grouping, for the removal of these suspended particles based on physical flow manipulation, which causes the particles to aggregate. Previous results showed that gentle oscillation in a cylindrical container facilitates simultaneous flocculation and sedimentation in the same reactor over shorter periods of time than are possible using the conventional treatment approach. This finding may confer marked improvements on the processes used today by enabling the use of both smaller reactors and less energy. Based on the findings with the cylindrical vessel, here the grouping technique is further examined in a rectangular container and over a range of different initial turbidities. The results indicate that the removal efficiency is higher in the rectangular container under the different initial turbidities tested. In addition, the removal efficiency was shown to remain robust with the decreases in initial turbidity and alum concentrations that occur during treatment. The positive results of our previous study taken together with this finding hint at the strong potential of the grouping technique to improve common flocculation processes.</jats:p>",

Supply Chain Management is the management of various activities in order to obtain raw materials, followed by transformation activities so that they become products in the process, then become finished products and forwarded to delivery to consumers through the distribution system. The purpose of this study is to improve the welfare of fishermen as fish producers in order to be given equal opportunities in competing to get consumers directly, as well as to provide convenience to consumers who buy fish in accessing information on the location of fish marketing institutions and the selling price of fish. The fish marketing system that has been going on so far have to pass several stages. With such marketing system, consumers do not buy directly from producers. This can be caused by a lack of consumer information on the location and location of fish producers in their environment. By purchasing directly from producers, it can also increase the economy of fishermen as fish producers. Based on this reason, this research creates a model to cut the supply chain of fish sales distribution. The method used is the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) model and rule based and action Research. The result of this study is the use of the Supply Chain Management model in the One Stop Fish Marketing Information System, which is expected that fishermen will have their own target markets that can directly buy fish from fishermen as the main producers of fish.</jats:p>",

In this context, countries such as Colombia have promoted policies and incentives for the implementation of energy projects with non-conventional sources of energy. One of the main energy alternatives available is related to the use of residual biomass left by agribusiness supply chains, such as sugarcane. In Colombia, sugar cane is grown and harvested all year round, due to the local tropical climate. The model we propose addresses the question of the selection of the plots whose crop residue will be transported for energy production on a given day. We built a Mixed-Integer Programming model to decide which plots to harvest on a given day. Although no additional energy is generated in the model, the results show that it is feasible to replace all coal used in the boilers with sugarcane crop residues (SCRs) for power cogeneration.</jats:p>"

The application of dynamics systems is aimed to provide a holistic view of the system and to identify how interrelationship affects the system as a whole. System dynamics approach is used to analyze the efforts to improve performance. Besides being used as an analysis related to the model, system dynamics can also be used to formulate effective policy related to the profit distribution in case study of bell pepper supply chain. In this study, several scenarios were used as references to improve bell pepper supply chain performance in Regency X. The stake holders in the supply chain were farmer, middleman, and wholesaler. There were three sub-models used in system dynamics, namely the sub-model farmer, middleman, and wholesaler. The model in the system dynamics was then developed to find out the best scenario in improving the performance of bell pepper supply chain. The scenario developed consisted of 4 scenarios in which scenario 1 became the basic scenario as the comparison of simulation results. Then, Scenario 2 was a Supply-Demand arrangement to reduce losses obtained at the level of middleman and wholesaler. The policy of Scenario 3 was warehouse procurement, which was a model improvement scenario in Scenario 3. Lastly, Scenario 4 was an increase in the level of demand / market expansion without an increase in the number of production. The highest total supply chain profit from the four scenarios was in Scenario 3, while the lowest was Scenario 2.   </jats:p>"

Water Mission follows a unique design approach that uses conventional but relatively unique engineering specifications in terms of hydraulics, power requirement, water treatment and distribution, having tested them in different geographical environments. Water Mission incorporates a community-managed sustainability model into the design to ensure a longer life span for the project by promoting a well-defined maintenance and sustainability plan. This approach was applied to ten projects in 2015 in Kasungu, Lilongwe and Blantyre districts where installation, monitoring and evaluation were done and subjected to Water Mission's standards for qualification to hand them over to the beneficiary communities at the end of one year post installation. The paper is a review and discussion of the steps that Water Mission follows in its design process to come up with a sustainable project with solar energy. The paper also illustrates the non-compromise stand by Water Mission when it comes to the hand-over criteria for its projects by following and respecting the results of the prescribed evaluation test. It highlights detailed advantages and disadvantages of the design approach and presents recommendations. It is concluded that the approach can be replicated elsewhere in Malawi as a solution to water supply.</jats:p>",

Uncertain lead time can lead to increased inventory costs and unstable service levels, which will directly affect the overall operation performance of the supply chain. While considering environmental performance in supply chain, it is important to understand how an uncertain lead time will affect sustainable performance. In this paper, we constructed a supply chain model with stochastic lead time and explored the relationship between uncertain lead time and supply chain performance. We considered carbon cost, inventory cost, and service level as a supply chain performance. System dynamics methodology was employed to observe and explore the dynamic change trend of the overall performance in the complicated supply chain model. This was done under both different levels of lead time standard deviation and different order policies. The results demonstrate how stochastic lead times can significantly increase inventory costs and carbon costs. Therefore, we propose appropriate ordering policies which mitigate the negative impacts of stochastic lead times.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we analyzed the JIT model, a transportation network that ensure agile responses and delivery of goods in a supply chain, which reduces inventory costs. We then compared two return vehicle transportation scenarios. In the first, goods were transported from the central warehouse to the distribution base, and the return vehicle delivered recyclable packaging materials back to the central distribution warehouse. In the second scenario, goods were transported from the manufacturer to the distribution center (warehouse) more frequently, leading to reduced inventory.

It is of great significance to design and construct the sponge airport with low impact development (LID) facilities. In this paper, we take catchment N1 of Beijing Daxing International Airport as a case study. The LID facilities are designed and the runoff process of a heavy rainfall in catchment N1 is simulated before and after the implementation of LID facilities. The results show that the total amount of surface runoff, the number of overflow junctions and full-flow conduits of the rainwater drainage system in catchment N1 of Beijing Daxing International Airport are significantly reduced after the implementation of the LID facilities. Therefore, the application of LID facilities has greatly improved the ability of the airport to remove rainwater and effectively alleviated the risk of waterlogging in the airport flight area. This study provides theoretical support for airport designers and managers to solve flood control and rainwater drainage problems and has vital practical significance.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, with the development and expansion of large-scale retail enterprises, the power structure of supply chain channels is showing a tendency towards diversity as well. However, few studies on closed-loop supply chains (CLSC) have considered both recycling modes and channel power structures. We aim to explore the influence of different recycling modes and channel power structures on the optimal decisions and performance of a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC), considering three recycling channels including manufacturer recycling, retailer recycling and hybrid recycling of retailer and manufacturer and two dominant modes including manufacturer-led and retailer-led. We construct six closed-loop supply chain models under different combinations of three recycling channels and two dominant modes. We analyze the effect of different recycling channels on company decision-making under the same dominant mode, whether participating in recycling has an impact on company decision-making under different dominant modes, and the effect on supply chain members and supply chain system under different dominant modes and recycling channels. The results show that the hybrid recycling strategy is always optimal for both supply chain members; the sub-optimal recycling strategies are both recycled by the subordinate enterprise, and the worst recycling strategies are both recycled by the leading enterprise. Moreover, it is always the worst strategy for manufacturer to participate in a closed-loop supply chain dominated by retailer and recycled by retailer; participating in a closed-loop supply chain dominated by manufacturer and recycled by manufacturer is always the worst strategy for retailer. From a system point of view, system efficiency is the highest under hybrid recycling, and system efficiency is the lowest if leading company recycles separately.</jats:p>"

Several logistical and supply chain challenges have already been identified, including uncertainty about the nature, amount, and quality of forest residues. In this context, this paper presents a summary review of estimation methods and techniques for managing forest and woody residue along the timber supply chain. The review examines both the opportunities and the challenges evident in the international forest residue estimation methods within each supply chain for primary and secondary forest resources. The review also discusses techniques for supply chain and management planning and highlights the limitations of existing information and communication technology (ICT) implemented for forest biomass research.</jats:p>"

A considerable amount of literature has been published on SFSCs, which mainly deal with the benefits and detriments of this kind of cooperation. Being regarded as the aim and focal point of this current scrutiny, SFSCs are especially studied in the context of producing and selling local products and whether they can be viewed as the most favorable way of distributing locally generated (food) products. Within that category major emphasis should be placed on farmer markets and community supported agriculture systems considering both consumers and producers. It has been put forth that the number of such organizations would indicate an increasing tendency in Hungary in line with their growing role in the trade of local products. Relying on data from multiple databases, both traditional and neo-traditional forms of SFSCs have been shown to be viable in Hungary, although, as in other Central and Eastern European countries in terms of numbers, traditional SFSC types play a decisive role, in particular local farmer markets. As a result of the study, besides these forms, the formation and aid of neo-traditional organizations is considered to be useful for stakeholders in order to exploit the potential of short supply chains.</jats:p>",

However the implementation thereof has rested in the hands of private sponsored agencies working in the region .One of this includes Bordeless West Africa. Programmes has also been instituted to favour port to hinterland trade even though the implementation has been very poor. Proper implementation of trade facilitation programmes in the region thus require immense study of trade movements, supply chain analysis with a view to improving the logistics and transport components of the entire process. Given the above, it makes sense therefore to sensitize the human element components of the logistics sub sector who also are the drivers of the distribution networks in the region on trade facilitation best practices worldwide. With respect to the port sector, the subject of port regulation though new in Nigeria places emphasis on the knowledge sector. The role of the regulator here is to prevent the new oligopolistic ports from acts that reflects monopoly. In this perspective a study that will reduce the port operators monopolistic instincts becomes always necessary. In such a study the port operators will be made to present areas where they have actually adopted inclusiveness policies by outsourcing such activities as tug operations and similar contracts to local operators, in the presence of stakeholders. The other aspect of trade facilitation relative to ports has to do with the role of river ports on the facilitation of hinterland intermodal traffic flow. This aspect is currently referred to as regionalization. In this perspective the regulation of river ports when concessioned and desirable qualities that river port concessionaires should possess will come into play.</jats:p>"

In order to solve the problem of high power consumption and unstable output of linear circuit in the process of energy conversion, this paper proposes a stable switching power supply based on SG3525 control. The constant voltage source USES PWM control principle to control the duty ratio of the switch tube to achieve the output voltage of 24V. Since the switch power supply design is usually based on the ideal state of the device, SABER simulation software is used to verify the feasibility of the circuit. At the same time, through physical verification, the circuit performance when the input voltage fluctuates. And test the load capacity and work efficiency of the circuit.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, there is a decline in integration among manufacturing organizations and their supply chain partners. Furthermore, investigations in the literature have been one-dimensional toward the relationship between practice and performance. It is obvious that current studies pointing toward energy-efficient practice to achieve eco-efficient supply chain integration but it is insufficient. Thus, this study objective is to investigate the impact of eco-efficient supply chain integration on environmental protection and proposing improvement for future research. This study has proposed an extended eco-efficient supply chain integration management model based on the gap in the literature and industry. This study elaborates on the importance of manufacturing organizations achieving environmental protection while understanding that organizations especially from developing countries cannot afford to move from economic and operational performances.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, green supply chain management (SCM) practices are increasing among firms to adopt green practices and reduce the negative effects of supply chain operations on the environment. Firms such as manufacturing, mining, and agriculture have to improve their capacity in green SCM practices because environmental regulations force them to consider these issues. However, green practices are new and require comprehensive study to determine this problem. This study has taken the case of three garment manufacturing firms for the evaluation of green SCM practices in the context of Pakistan. The green SCM requires multi-dimensional techniques; therefore, fuzzy-based multi-criteria decision analysis approaches must be adopted while assessing green SCM practices of firms. This is because fuzzy-based methods obtain a significant solution for complex, vague, and uncertain multi-attribute problems in fuzzy environment. Therefore, in this study, a hybrid decision model comprised of Delphi, and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodologies is proposed for assessing the green SCM practices of firms in terms of green design, green purchasing, green production, green warehousing, green logistics, and reverse logistics. The Fuzzy AHP method results reveal that “green purchasing,” “green design,” and “green production” are ranked the most important green indicators. Further, results reveal the ranking of manufacturing firms (alternatives) in the context of green SCM practices. This study shall help industries to focus on green SCM practices and adopt the green manufacturing process.</jats:p>"

Seed germination is a sensitive and low water stage in plants. A pot experiment was designed to test the effect of dew-irrigation on seed germination percentage of fennel, flax, and fenugreek. Irrigation treatments included dew-irrigation and control (non-irrigation). Results showed that dew-irrigation increased seed germination compared to control. Treatment of dew-irrigation had seed germination of 92.7%, 78.7% and 63.5% for flax, fenugreek, and fennel, respectively. But none of the seeds of control treatment germinated. Among plants studied, flax which is a cold season plant had the highest percentage of germination by dew-irrigation, and the plants that are the most heat-sensitive, such as fenugreek and fennel, had the lowest germination percentage. Results of this experiment determined that the moisture content in the air is capable to provide the necessary moisture for seed germination of the plants studied. In conclusion, dew-irrigation, due to supply low water, is better to be used at stages with lower water requirement such as germination. The ability of water supply by dew-irrigation at whole plant stage can be studied in the next experiments.</jats:p>",

The machine learning technique, namely, One-Class support vector machine, is used for anomaly detection, and a detailed analysis of the features of anomalies is also provided. Experiments on three situations, namely, one dimensional situation, three dimensional situation and seven dimensional situation are carried out to analyse the features of anomalies. The experiment results revealed that the cases with entries of large values more than 10 times of median, zero entries together with some large values and ascending or descending sequences tend to have high abnormality scores.</jats:p>",

However, because of inaccurate loading and undesired recirculation of fine sediment in the usual short laboratory flumes, such experiments are often unrepeatable and unreliable. In this technical note, we propose a new sediment feeder, to load dry sediment sample at the inlet, and a pressurized sediment filter, to screen the sediment out at the outlet, to implement a clear-water supply system for the flumes. It can improve fine sediment experiments not only by accurate loading but also through preventing undesired sediment recirculation, which can interfere and even modify the designated upstream input conditions. These devices have been constructed and tested, shown to be practical, simple and effective. Using them together can also provide a way to reclaim all the samples of experimental sediment that are of crucial importance for repeat and multiple tests for different contamination with a given sediment without losing the prescribed composition and other properties. This implementation is especially suitable for simulating fine particle affinity contaminant transport in fluvial turbulent flows in low sediment concentrations.</jats:p>"

This study aim is to analyze the efficiency of supply chain of small-scale layers’ farming. This research is conducted in April-October 2017 in Blitar Regency, in East Java; Sidrap Regency, in South Sulawesi; and Kabupaten 50 Kota, in Payakumbuh City and Pariaman Regency, in West Sumatra. The number of respondents used are 139 people consisting of officers in related institutions, poultry shop entrepreneurs, traders, breeders association farmers, supermarket managers, hotels, restaurants and caterings. The data collected is analyzed using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The results concludes that traders naturally seek efficient supply chains so that their business can be endured. Factors that influence supply chain efficiency are share farmer, profit and marketing cost ratio, and number of actors involved. The higher the farmer share, and the profit-to-cost ratio, and the fewer marketing channel in a supply chain, the more efficient the supply chain system. Large capital farmers are advised to be able to shorten the supply chain by marketing directly to consumers such as hotels, supermarkets, restaurants, hospitals and caterings. The egg supply chain can also utilize the Indonesian Farmer Shop (TTI) developed by the Ministry of Agriculture so that it can increase farmer’s income and stabilize prices.</jats:p>",

ANC and delivery services at health facilities, however, have been underutilized in Kenya. One potential strategy to increase the demand for ANC services is to provide health interventions as incentives for pregnant women. In 2013, an integrated ANC program was implemented in western Kenya to promote ANC visits by addressing both supply- and demand-side factors. Supply-side interventions included nurse training and supplies for obstetric emergencies and neonatal resuscitation. Demand-side interventions included SMS text messages with appointment reminders and educational contents, group education sessions, and vouchers to purchase health products.\n\n\n\nMethods : To explore pregnant mothers’ experiences with the intervention, ANC visits, and delivery, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) at pre- and post-intervention. A total of 19 FGDs were held with pregnant mothers, nurses, and community health workers (CHWs) during the two assessment periods. We performed thematic analyses to highlight study participants’ perceptions and experiences.\n\n\n\nResults : FGD data revealed that pregnant women perceived the risks of home-based delivery, recognized the benefits of facility-based delivery, and were motivated by the incentives to seek care despite barriers to care that included poverty, lack of transport, and poor treatment by nurses. Nurses also perceived the value of incentives to attract women to care but described obstacles to providing health care such as overwork, low pay, inadequate supplies and equipment, and insufficient staff. CHWs identified the utility and limitations of text messages for health education.\n\n\n\nConclusions : Future interventions should ensure that adequate workforce, training, and supplies are in place to respond to increased demand for maternal and child health services stimulated by incentive programs.</jats:p>"

This study considers the effects of government whitefish (cod, haddock, and others) supply controls on the effectiveness of the Norwegian Seafood Council (NSC) whitefish export promotion program. We use an econometric simulation model to measure the effectiveness and returns to NSC whitefish export promotion under a range of possible export supply control conditions.

This approach allows finding the optimal frameworks of territorial areas of district heating while fulfilling the necessary requirements for thermal-hydraulic modes in heat networks and for reliability of heating to consumers. Methodology for solving the formulated problem is based on bi-level programming methods, models of Theory of hydraulic circuits, nonlinear optimization methods, nodal reliability indices (availability factor, failure-free operation probability), Markov random processes models and other methods and models.

The elements of the time series were determined by means of the Census X11 method, while cyclicality was separated from the trend employing the Hodrick–Prescott filter. Data included quarterly information about the supply (volume) and prices (value) of the timber sold by the State Forests in the years 2005–2018. Analyses were performed for tree species with the greatest economic significance, that is, pine, oak, spruce, beech, birch, and alder, and for their most popular assortments: general purpose large-diameter timber (W0) and medium-diameter timber (S2A). Time series decomposition of quarterly timber production volume and prices revealed irregular, seasonal, and cyclic fluctuations. Within an annual time horizon, irregular fluctuations accounted on average for 6.7% and 28% of overall variability in timber prices and supply, respectively; they exhibited low amplitudes (+5%, −25%, respectively). Cyclical fluctuations were primarily found for prices and were characterized by substantial variations in cycle length (2–4 years) and change amplitude (3–27 Euros). Cyclical fluctuations in timber prices and supply were usually negatively correlated with each other: the upper turning points of price cycles fell near the lower turning points of supply cycles (with a shift of 1 to 3 quarters). The seasonality of prices was also inversely correlated with supply: quarters with low supply exhibited higher prices and vice versa. Seasonal fluctuations were more pronounced for timber supply (36%) as compared to timber prices (20.3%). Different seasonality patterns were found for hardwood and softwood. The lowest supply of softwood was found in the first quarter and the highest in the third quarter (spruce) or fourth quarter (pine). The supply of hardwood was the highest in the first quarter and the lowest in the third quarter.</jats:p>"

Naples was perhaps unique in relying on a vast and tortuous underground network of reservoirs, cisterns, channels and conduits, accessed by well shafts, all fed by an ancient aqueduct. The present study outlines and evaluates the Neapolitan water supply as it existed in the period, analysing the archival records of the municipal tribunal responsible for the city’s infrastructure, the ‘Tribunale della Fortificazione, Acqua e Mattonata’, and its various ‘Appuntamenti’ (proposals), ‘Conclusioni’ (decisions) and edicts. This is interwoven with reference to pertinent printed accounts, from contemporary guide books to medical regimens and health manuals. We examine both water quantity, in terms of availability and accessibility (by looking at the structure and its management, and the technicians responsible for its maintenance) and water quality (by looking at contemporary attitudes and perceptions). In the process we are able to question the widespread view of early modern Naples as chaotic and uncontrolled, governed by a weak public authority, as well as widely held assumptions about the “inertia” of the pre-modern hydro-social system more generally.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, techniques of process management have been scarcely used to improve the forest supply chains in many parts of the world. In this study, for both Romanian state and private forests, the processes of the timber supply chain – from the harvest site to the forest-based industry plant – are mapped and analyzed. The main objectives of this work were to identify process optimization potentials and to redesign processes in order to improve the performance of the Romanian timber supply chain. Results show that particularly inter-organizational processes offer great saving potentials, mainly due to the existing multi-level hierarchy and multi-level control obligations. Therefore, introducing a web-based platform to enhance a collaborative workflow can considerably decrease the time needed for providing harvest sites or logs to customers via auctions. Further process optimization can be reached by the empowerment of lower level hierarchies facilitating the reduction of hierarchy levels of involved state organizations.</jats:p>",

However, drained peat can increase nitrogen concentrations even without fertilization and farming activities.

Replacement of micro-turbines instead of dropping pressure valves in urban-water pipelines may assist in supplying energy to the electrical grid. The understanding of turbine design and its operational characteristics can help for efficient energy harvesting in these cities. The aim of this work is to design a cheap and versatile hydrokinetic vertical axis spherical turbine for extracting energy from water pipelines of 800 mm in diameter. The turbine runner is based on a NACA0018 airfoil. Performance prediction is obtained by implementing a double multiple stream tube (DMST) based model. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis are used for performance and design improvements. Based on the analysis, the turbine can generate an output power of approximately 1.71 kW with a dropping pressure head of 0.4 m and an internal flow velocity of 2.07 m/s with an efficiency of approximately 42.7%. The proposed method allows determining the available energy of 390 kW in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador.</jats:p>",

Finally, the initial benefit distribution model of prepayment financing model is constructed by combining the maximum entropy method, and the initial benefit distribution model is modified by the risk value faced by each member company, and the rational distribution of the interests of each member enterprise is realized.</jats:p>",

In DCSC, a consumer may switch easily from one channel to another which can make a conflict between both channels because they have the same potential consumer. This study aims to examine the factors that cause consumers to switch shopping channels in the DCSC structure. Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) is applied to investigate consumer channel switching behaviour that is implemented in a service company. Push variable includes information searching behaviour, perceived service quality, satisfaction, and perceived price. The pull variable includes switching cost, attitude toward switching, subjective norm. Additionally, mooring variable comprises of alternative attractiveness and responsiveness. The findings indicate that all three variables have a significant effect on switching intention. However, neither of mooring factor on the relationship between push and switching intention nor between pull and switching intention show moderating effects. Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) is applied to analyse survey data from 250 respondents. The result of the interrelationship among variables could be potentially applied in determining operational and tactical strategies to anticipate the volatilities in consumer behaviours.</jats:p>",

This study used descriptive analysis method. The Head of the Procurement Section in planning the determination of the number of raw materials that must be held for production activities sometimes has difficulty in determining the right amount of raw materials to be held and ordered to suppliers so that the stock of raw materials in the warehouse is deficient or sometimes excessive. The result was a problem that occur in the Upstream which has an impact in the downstream, namely the Head of Distribution Division. The distribution activities has difficulty in scheduling distribution. It can be concluded that Single Moving Average is a type of forecasting method that can be used in completing the determination of raw materials that must be held in procurement activities, while the company’s business processes can be used in making the distribution schedule.</jats:p>",

Reverse supply chain (RSC) is considered a potential way for e-waste management. Over the last two decades, RSC has received significant attention from industries, governments, experts, and researchers. A large number of studies have been published in the field of e-waste RSC. Most of the existing review papers concentrated on the general RSC models for all types of returned products. However, the review papers focusing on specific products, such as e-waste, are quite limited. To fill this gap published papers in the area of RSC for a specific product, e-waste, from 1999 to 2019 have been selected for review and analysis in this study. E-waste RSC studies have been divided into four main groups, namely, factors of implementation, performance evaluation and decision making, foresting product returns, and network design. Finally, some potential directions for e-waste RSC models have been suggested for future research.</jats:p>"

The extensive work done for urban smart homes neglects the unique constraints of homes at remote mountain tops and deserts and rural village homes. The purpose of this paper is to propose a smart energy management system for a self-sustained home of any type situated in any geographical location with the availability of renewable energy sources like solar, etc. The purpose is mainly to highlight the importance and advantages of direct current (DC) homes with DC loads rather than a conventional alternating current (AC) home with both AC and DC loads. An attempt has been made to evolve a multi-agent coordinated control for the low voltage direct current (LVDC) smart home system.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>LVDC supply systems with <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> power generation are providing an efficient solution for the energy needs of a DC smart home. The individual sub-systems of the LVDC system have their unique functions and priorities and hence require both coordinated and independent control. The entire DC smart home system is modeled in the Matlab and codes are implemented for each agent of the home. LVDC grid is operating either in battery connected mode or utility grid-connected mode, and the DC link voltage is held constant in both the cases. Energy imported from the utility grid is minimized by load shedding during the rectifier mode of the bidirectional converter. In addition, load shedding is also done when the battery is discharging to increase the discharge time of the battery. Load shedding is done on the basis of a fixed priority of loads. A 48 s simulation is performed on the Matlab model to bring out the 24-hour operation of the proposed system. Various modes are simulated and the corresponding actions of the agents are tested.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>A new control strategy with agents for each sub-system of the LVDC system is presented. Each individual agent works in tandem with other agents and meets its own control imperatives without compromising the requirements of the overall system. Unlike the centralized control system, the proposed control strategy is a distributed control system. The control algorithm for each of the agents is developed, and the pseudo code is presented. The results of the simulation of the proposed scheme are presented to confirm the usefulness of the new control approach.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The multi-agent concept for an energy management system is less addressed and thus its potential for efficient home energy management is presented. The proposed multi-agent strategy for a complete DC smart home with exclusive DC loads is not done earlier and is reported for the first time. The success of this strategy can be extended to other DC micro-grid systems like telecom power systems, ships, aircraft, datacentres, server rooms, residential complexes and commercial malls.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

The authors assess the directive as a welcome step in raising consumer protection on the Digital Single Market, especially as the initial primacy of subjective conformity criteria has been given up and mandatory objective criteria of the digital content/services have been introduced. This gives European consumers a mandatory protection regime shielding them from the widely used liability restriction clauses. The provisions on remedies have been improved and fine-tuned, starting from the flexible hierarchy of the remedies and ending with deletion of the much-criticized maximum harmonising damages provision. The new directive puts liability for the digital content to the retail sector: it is the traders, the contractual partners of the consumer who are liable for the supply and defects of the digital content even if the digital content is provided by third parties (usually the copyright holders). Whereas the directive is maximum harmonising in principle, several important questions such as the liability periods, obligations of the consumer as well as the remedies of the trader are still left to national law. Finally, as the directive is not based on standard contract typology, the transposition could turn out to be challenging for Member States with civil codes where rules on contractual remedies depend upon contract type.</jats:p>",

The study showed that there is no significant difference between demand and supply of the products in the study area. The study further revealed that a dual-channel was adopted in marketing the selected cassava products in the area. Further analysis of the study showed that in the last three (3) years, the demand and supply of garri was higher than that of abacha and akpu. Based on this, it is hereby recommended that there is need for off-takers of both abacha and akpu products to help increase the economic status of those rural stakeholders that engage these enterprises</jats:p>",

The proposed principle of energy control provides highly reliable and a flexible charging station even with a simplified system of automatic control and fault protection. A prototype charging station is developed and built to supply an inductive power transfer system that delivers 30–35 kW power over an air gap between transmitting and receiving parts measuring 50–200 mm and with a horizontal misalignment of ±200 mm. The results showed that the system can transfer the specified electrical power with about 82–92% efficiency and that the IPT module and its dynamic matching during charging exhibited a high degree of stability under a misaligned (x-y-z) condition and battery state of charge.</jats:p>"

Supply chain management however, requires alignment between the supply chain partners at the tactical level. As a first step towards achieving this goal, current study presents a model that incorporates the activity level planning at the focal firm in a supply chain. This paper presents a new mixed integer programming model that incorporates optimization of production planning at the focal firm while optimizing the strategic alignment of the supply chain entities. The model represents a four step, multi-echelon supply chain including supplier, warehouse, manufacturer, and retailer. The manufacturer in this network represents the focal firm.

The first method is to act on the supply side by integrating alternative means of power generation, such as renewable energy generators, having a relatively low levelized cost of energy. Whereas, the second methodology focuses on the management of the load to minimize the overall paid cost for energy. Thus, this article highlights the importance of demand side management by comparing it to the supply side management having, as criteria, the total achieved savings on the overall annual energy bill of a residential microgrid supplied by two power sources and equipped with an electric vehicle. The optimization takes into consideration the cost of kWh that is paid by the prosumer based on an economical model having as inputs the outcomes of the energy model. The adopted energy model integrates, on the demand side, an intelligent energy management system acting on secondary loads, and on the supply side, a photovoltaic (PV) system with and without battery energy storage system (BESS). The outcome of this work shows that, under the right circumstances, demand side management can be as valuable as supply side control.</jats:p>"

Above all, high-speed control of the high voltage generator to control the X-ray output is a very important issue. A Cockcroft-Walton circuit (CW circuit) is one of the method to generate the high voltage output. However, it has problem of the long time delay in the output response due to the huge capacitive component of the CW circuit. Therefore, it is required to achieve the stable output voltage with a quick transient response, which can be obtained by the time delay compensation technique of the CW circuit. This paper proposes an application of a Smith method to compensate for the time delay of the CW circuit output to reduce the undesirable excessive radiation exposure. AS a result of verification through the computer simulation, it has been confirmed that the overshoot of the output voltage can effectively be suppressed and that the optimal response can be realized without sacrificing the high-speed response. The paper indicates some possibilities of further improvement of the CW circuit output response by introducing the more precise compensation technique to the X-ray computed tomography.</jats:p>",

The salinity-responsive mechanisms have been well-studied in differentiated organs (e.g., leaves, roots and stems), but not in unorganized cells such as callus. High-throughput quantitative proteomics approaches have been used to investigate callus development, somatic embryogenesis, organogenesis, and stress response in numbers of plant species. However, they have not been applied to callus from monocotyledonous halophyte alkaligrass (Puccinellia tenuifora). Results: The alkaligrass callus growth, viability and membrane integrity were perturbed by 50 mM and 150 mM NaCl treatments. Callus cells accumulated the proline, soluble sugar and glycine betaine for the maintenance of osmotic homeostasis. Importantly, the activities of ROS scavenging enzymes (e.g., SOD, APX, POD, GPX, MDHAR and GR) and antioxidants (e.g., ASA, DHA and GSH) were induced by salinity. The abundance patterns of 55 salt-responsive proteins indicate that salt signal transduction, cytoskeleton, ROS scavenging, energy supply, gene expression, protein synthesis and processing, as well as other basic metabolic processes were altered in callus to cope with the stress. Conclusions: The undifferentiated callus exhibited unique salinity-responsive mechanisms for ROS scavenging and energy supply. Activation of the POD pathway and AsA-GSH cycle was universal in callus and differentiated organs, but salinity-induced SOD pathway and salinity-reduced CAT pathway in callus were different from those in leaves and roots. To cope with salinity, callus mainly relied on glycolysis, but not the TCA cycle, for energy supply.

Time-series models were developed to predict the changes in WS out to 10 years. Regressive methods and the GSL water level data were used for the depiction of decadal variability of the Colorado River WS. Various time-series models suggest a decline in the 10-year averaged WS since 2013 before starting to increase around 2020. Comparison between this WS prediction and the WS projection published in a 2012 government report (derived from climate models) reveals a widened imbalance between supply and demand by 2020, a tendency that is confirmed by updated WS observation.

Overall, the review reveals a wide variation among water consumption indicators. Hospitals in Italy have a reported use of 458 m3/bed/year, the highest indicator reported; the lowest CI among the reviewed articles was for German public hospitals at 103 m3/bed/year. Not surprisingly, higher water tariffs tend to reduce consumption, while higher per capita income increases consumption. Yet overall CI values tended to reflect a variety of causes, including activity level, laundry arrangements, water costs, the application of sustainable practices, environmental certification and other considerations. Given the high indicator values identified for Brazilian hospitals, future research might consider a more detailed study of how their water consumption might be better managed.</jats:p>",

Herein, we hypothesized that sugarcane plants supplied with more NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> as a source of N would produce more NO under water deficit. Such NO would reduce oxidative damage and favor photosynthetic metabolism and growth under water limiting conditions. Sugarcane plants were grown in nutrient solution and received the same amount of nitrogen, with varying nitrate:ammonium ratios (100:0 and 70:30). Plants were then grown under well-watered or water deficit conditions, in which the osmotic potential of nutrient solution was −0.15 and −0.75 MPa, respectively. Under water deficit, plants exhibited higher root [NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>] and [NO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>] when supplied with 100% NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>. Accordingly, the same plants also showed higher root NR activity and root NO production. We also found higher photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance in plants supplied with more NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>, which improved root growth. ROS accumulation was reduced due to increases in the activity of catalase in leaves and superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase in roots of plants supplied with 100% NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> and facing water deficit. Such positive responses to water deficit were offset when a NO scavenger was supplied to the plants, thus confirming that increases in leaf gas exchange and plant growth were induced by NO. Concluding, NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> supply is an interesting strategy for alleviating the negative effects of water deficit on sugarcane plants, increasing drought tolerance through enhanced NO production.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background: Salinity has obvious effects on plant growth and crop productivity. The salinity-responsive mechanisms have been well-studied in differentiated organs (e.g., leaves, roots and stems), but not in unorganized cells such as callus. High-throughput quantitative proteomics approaches have been used to investigate callus development, somatic embryogenesis, organogenesis, and stress response in numbers of plant species. However, they have not been applied to callus from monocotyledonous halophyte alkaligrass (Puccinellia tenuifora). Results: The alkaligrass callus growth, viability and membrane integrity were perturbed by 50 mM and 150 mM NaCl treatments. Callus cells accumulated the proline, soluble sugar and glycine betaine for the maintenance of osmotic homeostasis. Importantly, the activities of ROS scavenging enzymes (e.g., SOD, APX, POD, GPX, MDHAR and GR) and antioxidants (e.g., ASA, DHA and GSH) were induced by salinity. The abundance patterns of 55 salt-responsive proteins indicate that salt signal transduction, cytoskeleton, ROS scavenging, energy supply, gene expression, protein synthesis and processing, as well as other basic metabolic processes were altered in callus to cope with the stress. Conclusions: The undifferentiated callus exhibited unique salinity-responsive mechanisms for ROS scavenging and energy supply. Activation of the POD pathway and AsA-GSH cycle was universal in callus and differentiated organs, but salinity-induced SOD pathway and salinity-reduced CAT pathway in callus were different from those in leaves and roots. To cope with salinity, callus mainly relied on glycolysis, but not the TCA cycle, for energy supply.</jats:p>"

The fuzzy-based controller algorithm is employed in the PV inverter control system to optimize the duty cycles of the insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and to enhance the inverter outputs with lower harmonic contents and unity power factor. The developed fuzzy-based PV inverter controller is implemented in the MATLAB/Simulink models and experimentally tested in a dSPACE DS1104 process controller. The obtained simulation result of the developed fuzzy-based PV inverter controller is validated with experimental results under different performance conditions. It is seen that the experimental results of the switching signals, inverter voltage and current, control parameters, and total harmonic distortion (THD) of load current and output voltage of the PV inverter are closely matched with that of the simulation results. To validate the inverter performance, the proposed fuzzy-based PV inverter controller outperforms other studies with a voltage THD of 2.5% and a current THD of 3.5% with unity power factor.</jats:p>"

In the present paper, the LED current is sensed and used to implement a feedback control loop instead of the simplified feedforward scheme used in this previous reference. To design the control, a novel, simplified small-signal model is presented. This model is used to analyze the converter behavior as a function of the output power. The proposed approximation is significantly simpler than the multifrequency averaging technique normally used to analyze resonant converters. The feedback control loop is designed to reduce the LED low frequency current ripple while providing dimming control. Both the model and the control are verified by simulation and laboratory experimentation and the results obtained are in good accordance with the expected values.</jats:p>"

Models that allow for a large short‐run price elasticity of oil supply imply a larger response of oil prices and a larger, longer lived contraction in US real GDP. We find that, if we condition on a range of supply elasticity values supported by microeconomic estimates, the differences in the oil price responses diminishes. We also examine the role of lag length, of using pre‐1973 data, alternative measures of real economic activity and using the median response function instead of the modal structural model.</jats:p>",

Groundwater is the major source of domestic and drinking water for urban inhabitants. In this study, the major ion chemistry and a water quality assessment of groundwater were studied using geochemical methods and fuzzy comprehensive assessment. Groundwater was classified as slightly alkaline soft and hard freshwater, and the influence of anthropogenic activities on groundwater was relatively weak. The dominant cations and anions were Ca2+ and Mg2+ and HCO3− and SO42−, respectively. Overall, the mean concentrations of major ions in groundwater increase gradually over time, except for NO3−; however, the mean value of pH decreases over time. Most groundwater samples belong to the type of HCO3-Ca, and the groundwater has a trend of evolution from HCO3-Ca to the mixed type. Rock weathering was the main hydrogeochemical process controlling groundwater hydrochemistry, and the dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals were the primary contributors to the formation of the major ion chemistry of groundwater. Major ions of groundwater in the urban area of Shigaze are below the standard limits, and the groundwater is excellent for drinking according to the fuzzy comprehensive assessment.</jats:p>",

The research was conducted during 6 months and it was divided into three field stages. The first stage identified and quantified the multiple uses of water during milk production, using water meters. In the second stage, reduction measures were implemented to reduce the water use. Finally, in the third stage, a series of educational and structural measures were elaborated with the validated measures. The average water disappearance (intake + waste) measured was 98 L·cow−1·d−1, decreasing to 83 L·cow−1·d−1 and 91 L·cow−1·d−1 at the second and third stages, respectively. The modification of the cleaning and disinfection process was the most efficient measure, saving 8.5 litres per day. The potential saving of all the measures combined was 17 L·cow−1·d−1. Seeking to increase even more the water economy, the resulting series of recommended measures covered the whole cycle of water disappearance in the milking process.</jats:p>",

Consequently, the pressure on companies to discover new ways to create and provide quality to their customers has increased much more. More specifically, customer service has become a key tool for diversification, as culture and customer demands are constantly increasing. Greece stands on a strategic crossroad for the development of transportation in the greater region of Europe, Asia and Africa. Its geographical position renders it highly attractive for investments in logistics and transport to take advantage of these increasing trade flows in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In this paper, we carried out a quantitative research in Greece using a questionnaire to analyse the importance and effectiveness of the application of logistics in businesses with regard to customer service, which serve as a critical source of sustainable competitive advantage. By applying this method, a business will have its customers satisfied, thereby giving them the motivation to remain loyal and faithful to their purchasing practices within the company.</jats:p>"

However, there are still large uncertainties regarding how the atmospheric inputs of dissolved Fe (DFe) influence the seawater DFe concentrations and thus net primary production (NPP). Here, we use an atmospheric chemistry model and two ocean biogeochemistry models with high (Model H) and low (Model L) sensitivities to atmospheric sources of DFe to explore the responses of ocean biogeochemistry to different types of atmospheric inputs of DFe: mineral dust and combustion aerosols. When both Fe content in mineral dust of 3.5% and Fe solubility of 2% are prescribed in sensitivity simulations, the ocean models overestimate DFe concentration in the surface ocean downwind from the North African and East Asian dust plumes. Considering different degrees of atmospheric Fe processing reduces the overestimates of DFe concentration in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. The two ocean biogeochemistry models show substantially different magnitudes of responses to the atmospheric input of DFe. The more detailed Model H shows a much higher sensitivity of NPP to the change in combustion aerosols than to mineral dust, regardless of relative inputs of the sedimentary sources. This finding suggests that pyrogenic Fe-containing aerosols are more important sources of atmospheric bioavailable Fe for marine productivity than would be expected from the small amount of DFe deposition, especially in the Pacific and Southern oceans.</jats:p>",

Primary data obtained through a questionnaire and interview methods. Data processing method that used in this research were Promethee method for risk analysis, and descriptive statistical methods at risk response. From this research, it is known that the identification of risks at supply chain in construction projects can be seen from the potential failure of achievement of Key Performance Indicators in Supply Chain Management (SCM). From risk analysis with Promethee method, it is known that the highest risk in SCM is the change of price from sub-contractors.

The implementation of thematic village activities is facilitated by the government in the form of human resource development, improvement of facilities and infrastructure, and environmental improvements within a period of one year. After the end of the thematic village program the sustainability of management and development is carried out by the community in self-management. Kampung Jawi is one of thematic villages with the theme of Javanese culture which still runs consistently and develops as a tourist area. The potential of cultural tourism in Kampung Jawi is in the form of traditional arts, community life, cultural events, and Javanese-themed environments. Kampung Jawi which is currently in the early stages of development as a tourist area has obstacles in the form of still lack of supporting facilities for tourism, promotion and service. This study aims to identify the suitability of demand and travel offers. In achieving the research objectives, qualitative and quantitative methods are used with descriptive analysis techniques. Based on the results of the analysis, there are incompatibilities in demand and tourism offerings in the form of limited resources for the community of Kampung Jawi in developing tourism, lack of funding, lack of tourism support facilities, and limited tourism services by the community in responding to requests from the end. </jats:p>"

A sediment flushing study of the Thakot D-3 Hydropower Project reservoir after construction of the Dasu dam on the Indus river is presented in this paper. HEC-RAS 5.0.6 numerical model has been employed to check the sediment removal during flushing and to assess the model's applicability and limitations. Dasu reservoir sediment discharge data of 20 years were used to evaluate the sediment load with different transport functions under no-flushing (FSL 656 m asl) and flushing conditions. Without flushing, the river bed would be raised 56.1 m at the dam site and the low-level spillway and power intake would be filled in 2–5 years' time. It was observed that reservoir sediment flushing is economically realistic for this dam and the HEC-RAS sediment simulation model is encouraged for reservoir flushing modeling. If the Thakot D-3 HPP is commissioned a number of years after Dasu, a coarser sediment load will also be reached in the reservoir which could pose a serious challenge for the Thakot D-3 reservoir life. It is recommended that without construction of the Bhasha-Diamer storage dam, sedimentation not only is a complicated issue for Dasu HPP and Thakot D-3 HPP, but will also have drastic impacts on other downstream run-of-river energy projects.</jats:p>",

To increase productivity, company needs a conducive effort to optimize the work system. Supply chain management (SCM) is one form of competitive advantages that is applied to every industrial system. There are many factors which can influence the supply chain performance (SCF).Ergonomics is deemed to be one of significant drivers for SCF. This paper proposes and discusses the concepts related to ergonomics which is considered as macro ergonomics in supply chain system. SCM has been seen as macro ergonomics concerning on organization, people, technology, information and resources. This paper shows the importance of ergonomics at the inbound logistics (includes receiving, storing, inventory control and internal distribution management) and outbound logistics (the activites to get the finished product to customer) which are regarded as the critical supply chain activities. A scientific literature review on ergonomics as a critical determinant for SCF is discussed and provided as a theoretical contribution for further research related to the role of ergonomic to support supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

For diesel power plants located in remote areas, the main component of the costs are the cost of imported fuel. For gas piston power plants operating on associated gas, the main problem is to ensure the stabilization of the frequency of alternating current with sudden load changes. The use of electrochemical electricity storage devices as part of power plants largely solves these problems. The article considers the choice of storage capacity for fuel economy, reduction the installed capacity of a power plant and frequency stabilization in the power supply system. It is shown that for diesel power plants, the use of electrochemical accumulators leads to both fuel savings and a decrease in its nominal capacity. For gas piston units, where the specific increase in fuel decreases with increasing load, the use of electrochemical accumulators reduces the installed power, but increases fuel consumption. The accumulator parameters for gas piston units are determined by the allowable overload/discharge of the load, and according to the energy intensity, they are determined by the duration of the maximum load, which is smoothed by the drive operation. We present numerical examples for estimating fuel consumption taking into account the efficiency in the charge-discharge processes of storage batteries. The simulation models show the impact of the electrochemical storage device on the stabilization of the frequency of an autonomous electric power supply system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>Three-phase thyristor switches are designed for pulsed formation of inrush currents of electrical equipment with their subsequent shunting in steady state operation. In transformer substations, they perform a bumpless turning on of a power transformer by connecting its primary winding first to two phases of the network at the moment of zero crossing by the phase voltage of the network third phase, and then to the network third phase at the moment of zero crossing by the line voltage of the other two network phases. In this case, the starting currents of the transformer almost immediately enter the steady state without the appearance of constant components in the magnetization currents and voltage drop. To expand the functionality of thyristor switches, it is proposed, in addition to bumpless turning on of a power transformer, to disconnect it without arcing between the contacts of electrical equipment, as well as to carry out continuous voltage regulation for consumers when voltage in the network changes. The proposed method and structure for its implementation on the basis of two three-phase thyristor reactor keys and a capacitor bank make it possible while changing the network voltage to stabilize the generated reactive power at the input of the substation without creating the current distortions in the power transformer and power transmission simultaneously with stabilizing the substation output voltage. Modeling and research of the start-regulating device as part of a transformer substation was carried out in the MatLab environment. The results of numerical experiments in stationary and dynamic modes of the substation operation showed the feasibility of using the developed technical solutions for the industrial power supply system.<jats:bold /></jats:italic></jats:p>"

In particular, the quality of water available in public places (washing and drinking), such as water bubblers installed in regional parks, schools, rest areas and railway stations, is poorly investigated. This paper discusses the primary and secondary water quality of eight water distribution networks in New South Wales (NSW) regional towns. An analysis of a large number of drinking water samples (more than 11,000) identified that maintaining microbial water quality and the required free chlorine level (&amp;gt;0.2 mg/L) are challenging issues for regional water distribution networks. Sixty-three per cent of the samples collected from the water outlets available in public places of a regional town showed free chlorine levels of &amp;lt;0.2 mg/L, and 30% of samples showed positive results for total coliform. All heavy metal levels of the samples were within the safe level. Water temperature was identified as the most problematic secondary water quality parameter in public water bubblers. Stainless steel was the common material used in bubblers where surface temperatures exceeded 50 °C during summer. This study identifies possible design and operational modifications to improve regional drinking water quality and make public water bubblers more usable.</jats:p>",

The work purpose – to get information about the modern state of natural lands (rural pastures) which a cattle and sheep of individual sector are based on and to offer measures on renewal and maintainance of natural vegetation. Technique and objects of a research. The statistical analysis in dynamics of number of cattle and sheep, including on categories of farms is made. The geobotanical description of  the vegetation is carried out on registration platforms of 100 m² to the O. Drude’s system. Determination of biological productivity of a vegetable cover was carried out by a hay crop in the same place (from 0.5 m² in sixfold frequency). The objects of our research are the village pastures. Results and practical importance. The analysis of a livestock of animals on categories of farms of Stavropol region is shown. For the last 18 years population in an individual sector, including peasant (farmer) farms and farms of the population increased by 1.6 times. Within the studied communities vegetation modifications with the dominating plant species are revealed: Achillea setacea, Artemisia austriaca, Poa bulbosa, etc. They are spatially unhomogeneous, on specific composition poor. The quantity of types on the registration square (100 m²) averages 24, with fluctuations from 17 to 28. An assessment of fodder potential of natural grass stand degradaded, extents of their degradation is given. Grass stand degradaded, has poor quality of a forage. In its structure up to 74 % of the not virgin land species which do not have feeding value: Artemisia austriaca, Convolvulus arvense, Erodium cicutarium, etc. Scientific novelty. Negative consequences of unsystematic pasturage of the cattle on the limited area of the rural pastures which are under authority of municipal units are shown. Restoration of the degradaded areas of rural pastures by method of agrosteppes is recommended. In its basis – use of seeds of wild-growing steppe herbs.</jats:p>",

Impact pressure on the bottom is a serious concern in design safety precautions, however, the quantitative impact pressure distribution in the inverted arch plunge pool is not yet elucidated. In this study, a novel approach is presented to estimate the impact pressure of an inverted arch plunge pool. Impact pressure characteristics are experimentally investigated under different hydraulic conditions. The results detailed the effect of relative discharge coefficient and the deflection angle relative to the vertical central axis of the plunge pool bottom. The predicting formulas of impact pressure distribution are derived within small relative errors, and the proposed approaches have good applicability in three case studies. The achievements of this investigation are used to define issuance parameters relevant for engineering practice.</jats:p>",

Mapping the potential supply of ecosystem services is necessary for continuous monitoring of such services to ensure the sustainable management of natural resources to support decision-making. Therefore, this study presents a multifaceted methodological framework for mapping ecosystem services potential supply surrounding a protected area. We integrate a non-monetary ‘Matrix Model’ assessment with an expert-driven approach to assess the potential supply from a holistic perspective. Experts and stakeholders dealt with Likert scales to weigh multiple land cover supply of ecosystem services. Our study shows that using an integrated approach to map ecosystem services not only minimizes uncertainties but is also important for the evaluation of ecosystem services. The integration process can also be an interactive approach between scientists and stakeholders to improve mutual understanding regarding resource management. The selected services and land cover data can be an effective medium to visually exhibit forest function and the services of a protected area; these can work as scheming tools that can contribute to an effective policy measurement for the sustainable conservation of protected areas.</jats:p>",

Mean monthly air temperature was also increased by 1 °C compared to the last 29 years. A similar trend was observed for humidity, where its mean value of 85.9% decreased to 83.3%. Initially, the catchment area was 474.12 ha, covered by protected forest (98%). However, in 2009 the remaining forest area was only 8.15%. It suggested the decreasing of water storage capacity. It could be explained that the climate change and uncontrolled land use may contribute to the water crisis of Pulai reservoir.</jats:p>",

The study adopted a self-administered questionnaire as a data collection technique, with which data were gathered from 371 supply chain members of various SMEs in the Jordanian industries. Data was then exposed to analysis using AMOS and SEM. The obtained findings showed support for the formulated hypothesis, in that the findings indicated the mediating role of knowledge sharing on the technological factors-SCP relationship at the significance level of 1%. The findings also showed that IT infrastructure and social media usage (technological factors) had no direct significant relationship with SCP but the technological factors had a significant positive relationship with knowledge sharing at the significance level of 1%.</jats:p>"

Transportation efficiency depends not only on the system control strategy but also on the pressure loss (pressure difference between the inlet and outlet) and pressure drop (amplitude of outlet pressure fluctuations) of its structure. In this article, sensitivity analyses of the pressure loss and pressure drop to changes in multi-channel confluent water supply geometry are presented. An experimental set-up was established to validate computational fluid dynamic (CFD) predictions and obtain the boundary conditions for two-channel synchronous switching. The influences of the geometric structure varies by the clustered pipe diameter (40 mm &lt; Dc &lt; 80 mm), main pipe diameter (30 mm &lt; Do &lt; 80 mm), channel pitch (60 mm &lt; L &lt; 400 mm) and number of channels (2 ≤ n ≤ 4); those variables were investigated with the help of CFD simulations. The results showed that configuration “C” can be considered a costless method of decreasing pressure loss (βC(2.05) &lt; βA(2.42) &lt; βB(2.64)) and that the different configurations are insensitive to pressure drop. The variations of the influence of channel pitch and clustered pipe diameter on pressure loss have extremes at L/d = 5 and Dc/d = 2.5, respectively, but the effect on pressure drop is not obvious. The main pipe diameter and the inlet velocity have more significant influences on efficiency. The results can be used to choose the proper geometry of multi-channel confluent water supply to enable energy savings.</jats:p>"

In this study, the vulnerability curve model was established with one highly popular area of research in mind: big data. Web crawler technology was used to extract text information related to floods from Internet and social media platforms. Based on the three indicators of rainfall intensity, duration and coverage area, the heavy rainfall index was calculated, while the comprehensive disaster index was calculated based on the affected population, area and direct economic loss. Taking the heavy rainfall index as an independent variable and comprehensive disaster index as a dependent variable, the vulnerability curve of flood disasters was established, and the performance of this model was validated by comparing it with real-life situations. The results show that the relationship between rainfall and disaster is significant, and there is exponential correlation between the heavy rainfall index and comprehensive disaster index. This model is more than 65% accurate, which demonstrates the discriminative power of the established curve model. The results provide some basis for flood control and management in cities.</jats:p>",

In this study, two different electrolyzer configurations, flow‐through and flow‐by modes, were analyzed for the production of carbon monoxide to resolve the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> mass‐transfer limitation problem at high current densities in gas diffusion electrodes. These two configurations respectively state convective and diffusive flow inside the gas diffusion layer, and their effect was studied on the cathodic performance of the electrolyzer by varying the operating conditions: cathodic potential, electrocatalyst loading, and Nafion content. In flow‐through configuration, a current density of 220 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> could be achieved at a faradaic efficiency of 90 %; whereas, in the flow‐by configuration, the current density was at the same faradaic efficiency limited to 140 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. However, the flow‐through configuration has a few limitations, such as lower energy efficiency, owing to the higher ohmic drop and the faster deactivation caused by crystallization of electrolyte salts inside the gas diffusion electrode. Therefore, flow‐by mode is currently the most adequate configuration for the long‐term operation of electrolyzers for the reduction of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> to CO.

This study aimed to determine the host-specific fecal contamination in two Brazilian watersheds and to predict the possible impacts on human health. Fecal sources were enumerated using host-specific genetic markers to swine (16S rRNA), human and bovine (archaeal nifH), and equine (archaeal mcrA). A single cycling condition was established for four markers aiming to decrease the analysis time. Fifteen samples from São João watershed (75%) and 25 from Guandu (62.5%) presenting Escherichia coli enumeration in compliance with Brazilian guidelines (&amp;lt;1,000 MPN/100 mL) showed the human marker. Furthermore, the bovine, swine, and equine markers were present in 92% (59/64), 89% (57/64), and 81% (52/64) of the water samples, respectively. The molecular markers proposed for qPCR in our study were sensitivity and specific enough to detect host-specific fecal pollution in all samples regardless of E. coli levels reaffirming the low correlation among them and supporting their use in water quality monitoring programs. To our knowledge, this is the first study using this approach for quantification of nifH, mcrA, and rrs gene-associated human and animal fecal pollution in waters intended for drinking water supply in Brazil.</jats:p>",

Collector wells located on the banks in a certain distance from the river creates a pressure head difference between the river and aquifer, which induces the water from the river to flow downward through the porous media into the pumping wells. By applying this system of drinking water extraction, two different water resources are used where surface water from the river percolates towards the well; and groundwater of the surrounding aquifer is utilized. A study on the potential of RBF near the existing intake of Lembaga Air Perak at Sg Kampar was undertaken. Geophysical survey using resistivity traverses was made with 5 lines each on the right and left bank of the river. Three lines perpendicular and 2 lines parallel to Sg Kampar were investigated for possible water potential for RBF. The Wenner-Schlumberger configuration was chosen based on space provided in flatten areas and the depth of penetration interest in order to identify the presence of groundwater, stream-aquifer interaction and subsurface lithologies. Results from 2-dimensional profiles indicated that: (a) permeable soil saturated with water (possible groundwater and terrestrial sediments material) showed the resistivity value ranges of 0-150 ohm.m (b) semi permeable soil and weathered rock showed the resistivity value ranges of 200-1000 ohm.m and (c) impermeable soil and rock (unsaturated zone) showed the resistivity value ranges of 1000-7000 ohm.m.</jats:p>",

In calling attention to this the authors encourage health advocates to consider strategies other than just regulation to curb both the supply and demand for these commodities, by better understanding how neoliberal logic suffuses institutional regimes, and how it might be coopted to alternative ends. The argument is compelling as possible mid-level reform, but it omits the history of the development of neoliberalism, from its founding in liberal philosophy and ethics in the transition from feudalism to capitalism, to its hegemonic rise in global economics over the past four decades. This rise was as much due to elites (the 1% and now 0.001%) wanting to reverse the progressive compression in income and wealth distribution during the first three decades that followed World War Two. Through three phases of neoliberal policy (structural adjustment, financialization, austerity) wealth ceased trickling downwards, and spiralled upwards. Citizen discontent with stagnating or declining livelihoods became the fuel for illiberal leaders to take power in many countries, heralding a new, autocratic and nationalistic form of neoliberalism. With climate crises mounting and ecological limits rendering mid-level reform of coopting the neoliberal logic to incentivize production of healthier commodities, health advocates need to consider more profound idea of how to tame or erode (increasingly predatory) capitalism itself</jats:p>"

Методический подход основан на парадигме ModelDriven Engineering. Суть этой парадигмы заключается в том, что программное обеспечение создается на основе моделей. Знания о системах теплоснабжения, прикладных задачах и прикладном программном обеспечении сохраняются для многократного использования в виде онтологий. Автоматизированное построение программного комплекса осуществляется на основе компьютерной модели системы теплоснабжения, онтологий и современных технологий метапрограммирования. Предложенный подход позволяет успешно решить проблему разделения методов решения прикладных задач и математических моделей элементов системы теплоснабжения. С этой целью методы реализуются в виде программных компонентов, которые не связаны со свойствами и моделями конкретного оборудования. А модели элементов системы теплоснабжения автоматически компилируются в программные компоненты. В процессе построения программной системы программные компоненты, реализующие модели и методы, динамически интегрируются в создаваемую систему. В результате программная система, ориентированная на решение конкретной прикладной задачи, создается в автоматизированном режиме. Разработанный подход использован для реализации программного комплекса СОСНА, который применяется для проектирования городских систем теплоснабжения.</jats:p>",

Other consumer behaviours which affect e-logistics must work more efficiently are the requirement of last miles fast delivery and more competitive pricing. Decentralized supply chain model can handle all these issues and complex logistics activity although it only has one echelon model in the supply chain structure. Decentralized supply chain model doesn’t need a distribution centre but requires inventory sharing policy. Key to success inventory sharing policy is low lead time delivery. In Indonesia, only two transportation type which can handle product in low lead time, i.e., train cargo and aircraft cargo. Train cargo still needs high lead time but has low operation cost. Aircraft cargo can handle product in low lead time but need high operation cost. The trade-off in this condition is e-logistics need low lead time transportation tenant to satisfy demand until last miles delivery but has low operation cost not as expensive as aircraft cargo. Indonesia is developing high-speed train which connects Jakarta to Surabaya. In this research, we will review the level of effectiveness high-speed train in Indonesia to realized decentralized supply chain distribution network for handling e-logistics last miles shipping using dynamic system simulation. The output of this research is efficiency review of Indonesian high-speed railway cargo to support decentralized e-logistics supply chain distribution network, compared by aircraft cargo. After we perform simulation using dynamic system simulation, delivery of products between regions by using fast train is declared feasible to deliver products with fast delivery type if in one day there are six departure time (delivery batch). If less than six departures, the railway is declared unfeasible to deliver products with fast delivery type. However, the train can save about 37% batch delivery when compared to cargo aircraft.</jats:p>",

Presently in Sri Lanka, over 3.6 million villagers face acute water-quality problems, and chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) is also prevalent among this community. Most of the drinking water in these villages is unpalatable due to high hardness and salinity. As an interim measure, reverse-osmosis (RO) water-treatment plants are introduced to provide safe water. However, due to deficient electrolytes, RO-treated water tastes unpleasant to some consumers; hence, people refuse it after prolonged use. The operation, maintenance, and management of RO plants are other major problems. Aimed at providing safe drinking water to the rural sector in a cost-effective manner, in this study, we fabricated an automated drinking-water purification system based on nanofiltration (NF) membrane technology, which can remove divalent cations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pathogens efficiently, and monovalent ions partially, and thus keep electrolytes to some degree. Ten commercial NF membranes were tested in a laboratory, for solute and DOC removal efficiency and robustness. The DF-90 membrane showed the highest removal of DOC and hardness, and it was therefore selected, to design a pilot NF drinking-water treatment plant. The adhered DOC by the membrane can be cleaned by NaOH solution (pH = 12). The pilot NF drinking-water treatment plant has been in use since September 2018, and it shows excellent performance of removing DOC, TDS, hardness, fluoride, and pathogens in groundwater, and the permeate water of the NF plant has been well-accepted by the stakeholders of the society. The dominant genus of source water, and throughout the two processes (NF and RO), is Pseudomonas, and their difference is significant in the concentrates of the NF and RO processes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Governance for sustainable development increasingly involves diverse stakeholder groups, with the promise of enhanced legitimacy and effectiveness in decision-making and implementation. The UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) emphasise the important role of multiple (non-state) actors, including businesses and non-governmental organisations, including in efforts to ensure the sustainability of supply chains, and to reduce tropical deforestation and forest degradation. This paper critically analyses sustainability strategies to examine how the UN SDG agendas related to ‘sustainable supply chains’ and ‘tropical forest protection’ are framed and enacted by two contrasting non-state actors: (1) Instituto Centro de Vida (ICV), an NGO in Brazil working to address deforestation, including by supporting farmers to produce commodities, and (2) Unilever, a global consumer goods manufacturer and major buyer of such commodities. By identifying areas of variability in the discursive techniques used by ICV and Unilever, we unearth particular power dynamics that can shape the processes and outcomes of sustainability strategies. This paper finds that the two organisations use diverse strategies at different levels of governance, both participate actively in multi-stakeholder forums to advance their organisations’ goals, but have divergent framings of ‘sustainability’. Despite being considered ‘non-state’ actors, the strategies of the two organisations examined both reflect, and influence, the structural effects of the state in the implementation of non-state organisations’ strategies, and progress towards the SDGs. Although there is alignment of certain strategies related to tropical forest protection, in some cases, there is a risk that more sustainable, alternative approaches to governing forests and supply chains may be excluded.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Seawater is a valuable water resource in coastal regions. However, during seawater chlorination, a group of halophenols (HPs) may be formed. These HPs have lower odor and taste detection thresholds than other disinfection by-products (DBPs), however these are usually more toxic than most of the abundantly detected DBPs. Hence, an effective approach for control of HP formation during seawater chlorination is required to minimize highly toxic HP formation. Pretreatment using TiO2 photocatalysis was applied in this study to assess its ability for removal of HP precursors. Seawater samples with external addition of 1 mg/L phenol were spiked with TiO2 from 0.1 to 10.0 g/L and exposed under UV light for 2 to 120 min. The UV absorbance at 254 nm and the excitation–emission matrix fluorescence of dissolved organic matter were measured for each treated sample. It was observed that the optimal treatment condition to achieve the highest UV254 removal was 4.0 g/L TiO2 with UV exposure of 30 min. By pretreatment using this method and stated dose and exposure, only two types of HPs were detected during chlorination, compared with four types of HPs formed in the untreated samples. Moreover, the pretreatment greatly reduced the concentration of 2,4,6-TBP from more than 400 μg/L to less than 1 μg/L. The significance of this research study is to identify the effectiveness of UV/TiO2 in reducing DBP formation by analyzing the mechanisms during the process, which indicates the use of UV/TiO2 pretreatment for control of HP formation in seawater during chlorination.</jats:p>",

The article provides an analysis of the energy balance of a power plant in connection with the need to minimize the cost of fuel and electricity for heat supply. New analytical expressions comprehensively characterizing the efficiency of a power plant are developed. The analytical assessment of the impact of energy costs for the boiler needs on the energy balance of thermal power plant is made; methods for constructing schemes of the energy balance of thermal power plant and assessment of fuel efficiency in the boiler are designed. Attention is paid to errors arising from the use of the calculated values of air suction in the gas path of the boiler, and not the actual ones. Therefore, it is proposed to change the method of measuring heat loss with flue gases in order to eliminate or reduce the effect of air suction on the measurement results, taking into account the part of the flue gas heat received by the air in the air heater and returned to the boiler through the burner. The methods increasing accuracy of calculations of energy efficiency of the technological processes which are key in the centralized heat supply of the cities and settlements are developed.</jats:p>",

Vertical co-op advertising is a financial agreement in which a member of the chain pays certain percentage (<jats:italic>i.e.</jats:italic> cooperation rate) of a subsequent member’s advertisement cost. Since increasing the number of echelons and decision variables in supply chain problems increase the modelling and computational complexity, most researchers study vertical co-op advertising in a two-level supply chain including a manufacturer and a retailer. This paper investigates the problem by considering price and quality levels as additional decision variables in a three-echelon supply chain consisting of one supplier, one manufacturer, and one retailer. The ultimate goal is to show supply chain managers the importance of product quality as well the role of local advertisement in positively influencing market demand on top of the traditional approach of speed and efficiency optimization. Using game theory approach, power of the manufacturer is assumed to be higher than or equal to those of others in the chain. Five different relationships between players are considered in five non-cooperative games (named as G1–G5) and equilibrium solutions are extracted for each. The results show that the manufacturer prefers to play Stackelberg with the retailer and the supplier rather than be in conflict with them in Nash game. Such preference can lead manufacturer towards high quality and cost-efficient product/service via efficient advertisement in our complex network of business firms.</jats:p>",

Garment and textile are the most numerous industries in Indonesia, especially in West Java, E-SCM can increased efficiency and effectively for textile or garment companies, but E-SCM development requires high costs and high technology. These are problems when many garment and textile companies in Indonesia have limited capabilities of technology. In this research we design new E-SCM model with Value Chain Analysis approach and used Software Architectural Design to make the model. We divided E-SCM system for garment and textile industry in multiple layers and then we collaborate with two existing E-SCM frameworks, namely E-Supply Chain Management Process and Technology Integration Framework and E-SCM Multi-Agent System Framework. We combine layers components with the relevant layers of the existing E-SCM frameworks. The result is a new E-SCM model for garment and textile industry that can accommodate limitations of technological capabilities.</jats:p>",

This study evaluated the effect of different concentrate-forage ratio on rumen microbial nitrogen supply in Batur sheep. Twelve male Batur sheep aged 10-12 months were given three experimental diets in a one-way design using 14 d adaptation and 7 d collection periods. Experimental diets were concentrate (wheat pollard) and forage (<jats:italic>Pennisetum purpuroides</jats:italic>) offered with ratio of 20:80, 30:70, and 40:60 (w/w, DM basis). Total urine were collected for 24 h during collection period. Samples were analysed for allantoin, uric acid, xanthine-hypoxanthine, and purine derivatives. Feed and feed refusal were analysed for dry matter and organic matter. Concentrate-forage ratio tended to influence allantoin, xanthine-hypoxanthine, and purine derivatives excretions, as well as absorbed purine and rumen microbial protein synthesis. Feeding concentrate up to 40% significantly increased N urinary excretion (P&lt;0.05). It indicated that concentrate level at 30% could fulfil animal protein requirement. Feeding concentrate-forage ratio 30:70 or 40:60 increased purine absorbed and microbial protein synthesis 2-3 fold higher than the ratio of 20:80. It is concluded that Batur sheep was efficient in utilizing degradable dietary N with concentrate: forage ratio of 30:70.</jats:p>",

This provides the basis for accurate calculation of ground subsidence. Traditional equations for vertical deformation, groundwater flow and land subsidence due to surface loading were developed using Jacob's assumptions. This paper derives a skeletal elastic specific storage rate. The new deformation and flow equations are similar to the traditional ones based on Jacob's assumptions except that the pore-water head in the traditional equations corresponds with the margin between the pore-water head and the water-column height given in the proposed equations representing the surface load. The analysis show that increasing the surface loading leads to land subsidence, rise in pore-water head and decrease in elastic water storage capacity. The maximum subsidence is equivalent to the subsidence triggered by lowering the water head to the equivalent water column height. The maximum rise of the water head is also equal to the equivalent water column height. The maximum water released to a specific volume of porous medium is close to that resulting from reduction in the water head by the equivalent column height.</jats:p>",

Supply chain plays a significant role in company’s performance. Companies are challenged to explore ways to meet the customer demands and satisfaction at a manageable cost. To achieve this, business must find which parts of supply chain process are competitive and can be optimized with budget constraints meeting customer demands. In any unit it is mandatory to produce a high quality product with minimal budget successfully. Selection of a suitable supplier is equally important due to budget constraints. There are various methods for making the optimize result. In this research paper collecting the data from different industries and optimize the result by selecting TOPSIS and SAW methods for the solution of this problem.

Statistically designed experiments were performed to ascertain the effect of initial nitrate concentration (40–120 mg/L), growth period (1–12 days) and plant density (20–80 g/L) on nitrate removal. Based on the results of analysis of variance (ANOVA), it was observed that the individual effects (F = 78.04 and P = 0.013) of process parameters influenced the nitrate removal efficiency by money plant stronger than the 2-way (F = 0.2 and P = 0.89) and 3-way interaction effects (F = 0.46 and P = 0.569). In the case of the arrowhead plant, the individual effects significantly affected the nitrate removal efficiency than the 2-way and 3-way interaction effects. Low nitrate concentrations (40 mg/L) and high plant density (80 g/L), showed ∼88% nitrate removal by arrowhead plant, during a growth period of 6 d. On the contrary, under similar conditions, the money plant showed a nitrate removal efficiency of ∼93% during a growth period of 12 d. Concerning the removal kinetics, an increase in the growth period increased the nitrate removal rate for both the plants.</jats:p>",

Jar test experiments were performed on the raw inlet water of the Isfahan water treatment plant (IWTP) in Iran. Response surface methodology was implemented to design and optimize the experiments. The factors considered in the design were coagulant dose, pH, initial turbidity, and temperature. Results showed the acceptable efficiency of natural coagulants in turbidity reduction, so that they meet the potable standard levels. The final water turbidity in the optimum condition for calcium lactate, tannic acid, PACl, and ferric chloride were 0.58, 0.63, 0.56, and 0.76 NTU, respectively. The comparison between the performances of the coagulants showed no significant difference in turbidity removal. However, the sludge volume produced as well as the impact on pH alteration after coagulation–flocculation were lower when using natural coagulants than with conventional coagulants. Also, the residual aluminum for PACl measured was higher than the desired limit according to Iran's drinking water standard. Finally, the simple additive weighting method was used to rank the four coagulants based on the selected criteria. The results showed that the natural coagulants could be preferable to the conventional coagulants if the concerns regarding disinfection by-product formation due to their residual organics were resolved. Since this issue was fixed in the IWTP due to the ozonation process, calcium lactate was proposed as an efficient alternative to PACl.</jats:p>",

We substantiated the relevance of this article and the considered tasks, which depend on the object of study. It has been established that one auxiliary transformer and from eight to ten outgoing lines are connected to one bus section of a power transformer of a field substation. We developed mathematical models of electrical complexes of a field substation with individual transformers of outgoing power lines, as well as with individual, node and centralized compensating units. We obtained new analytical dependencies, taking into account total losses of power and electrical energy in power transformers of field substation and distribution electrical network as a function of supply voltage. The well-known method for calculating the energy parameters of electrical units of field substation and auxiliary equipment has been improved by adding new analytical dependencies of total power losses in power transformers of field substation and distribution network as a function of 35 kV supply voltage. The scientific novelty of this work is obtaining new analytical relationships between total power loss in power transformers of the field substation and distribution network in a function of supply voltage, which take into account external and internal disturbances in the network. This allowed us to improve the well-known method for calculation the energy parameters of electrical installations of a field substation taking into account parameters of individual, nodal and centralized compensating installations.</jats:p>",

In the design of Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning system, air-supply speed (ventilation rate) and air-supply temperature are the two most important parameters. In the current study, numerical simulations and experimental measurements were adopted to investigate the influences of ventilation mode, air-supply velocity and air-supply temperature on indoor thermal comfort as well as building energy consumption in summer. Different ventilation modes (up supply and down exit, ceiling supply and ceiling exit) were considered in modelling. Based on the simulation and experimental results, dimensionless index [Formula: see text] is proposed, which represents the ratio of buoyancy weighting force to inertial force. This index can be used as a pre-evaluation index of indoor thermal comfort in preliminary design of air conditioning. It is an indicator to judge the working conditions in cooling-ventilated rooms. When [Formula: see text], the settlement and diffusion effects of indoor airflow reach a good level, which means that the parameter setting could provide a comfortable indoor thermal environment. The dimensionless number [Formula: see text] is a theoretically based tool in the pre-evaluation of indoor thermal environment, providing guidance for setting of ventilation design parameters. </jats:p>",

This is because of the mounting evidence in favour of global warming and climate change due to human activities. The government is being pressurized by the people and the government in turn pressurizes the industries to adopt green practices. Apart from this there is moral responsibility for the managers of a company to reduce their ecological footprint. Due to these reasons there is a need to implement GSCM practices. As with anything we can observe that there are a lot of barriers that hinder the implementation of green supply chain (GSC) practices. To understand the nature of these barriers a literature survey was conducted on the barriers that affect small and medium scale industries. Fifteen barriers were recognised and literature survey was conducted on the analysis that had previously been done on these barriers. To address these barriers, they have been evaluated using MCDM approaches that are suited for the unique nature of these barriers (i.e., the barriers interact with each other). The effectiveness of removal of each barrier should be considered and should be integrated with a structural model to achieve the goal. For, this purpose SAW, TOPSIS, AHP and ISM have been used.</jats:p>",

The IW2MC → R includes the sustainable treatment of wastewater in industrial parks (IP) to provide reuse water for different purposes. The main objective is to reach the highest possible Industrial Park Reuse Factor (IPRF). The IPRF describes the relation between wastewater inflow to the central wastewater treatment plant and the outflow of reuse water for different applications. The Infrastructure Reuse Factor (IRF), one component of the IPRF, relates to infrastructural reuse applications (e.g. irrigation, street cleaning, toilet flushing). To determine the IRF, a model industrial park is applied. A first calculation resulting in an IRF of ∼25% includes reuse applications for irrigating green spaces, street cleaning, and toilet flushing. In cases when other applications for reuse water are considered (e.g. cooling or firefighting water), the IRF can be higher than 25%. Thus, the IW2MC → R provides a sustainable solution strategy, especially for water-stressed regions, to drive new IP developments by reducing water extraction from natural resources.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study is to highlight pros and cons of two incentive policies, namely (1) incentive on manufacturer’s R&amp;D investment and (2) direct incentive to consumer based on greening level of the product on the optimal pricing and investment decisions in improving used product return and greening level decisions in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). Optimal decisions are derived under manufacturer and retailer-Stackelberg games, and results are compared to explore characteristics of optimal decisions, consumer surplus, and environmental improvement under two marketing strategies of a manufacturer. It is found that the greening level and used product return rate in a CLSC are always higher under retailer-Stackelberg game. If the manufacturer sets a target for greening level, the CLSC members may receive higher profits if consumer receives incentive because of higher consumer surplus. However, environmental improvement may be lower. If the manufacturer sets a product return goal, then CLSC members may compromise with consumer surplus or environmental improvement for receiving higher profits. In the presence of direct incentive to consumers, CLSC members can trade with product at lower greening level for higher profits. Moreover, investment in improving used product return is always less compared to the investment in improving greening level.</jats:p>",

Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of MICP to enable self-healing of biocement, through the injection of nutrients and precursor chemicals required for MICP into degraded biocement. This paper documents the early stages of research into the development of an autonomous self-healing system for biocement, whereby the nutrients and precursor chemicals are provided from within the biocement matrix. This system has the potential to improve the durability and sustainability of geotechnical structures. The effectiveness of a variety of carrier materials for the immobilisation and release of the nutrients and precursor chemicals, also referred to as the cementation medium, has been explored. Materials tested include expanded perlite, diatomaceous earth and natural fibres such as jute and coir. Studies have subsequently been undertaken to investigate the effect of these carrier materials on the MICP process, in aqueous solutions and within the biocement matrix, and thus the potential to enable self-healing. Ureolytic, spore forming <jats:italic>Sporosarcina ureae</jats:italic> has been utilised to induce the precipitation of calcium carbonate.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The impacts of price and sustainability on municipal waste disposal demand have largely been ignored by waste management researchers. This paper considers a waste disposal supply chain that includes a disposal facility and a contractor. Both parties try to improve source sorting for waste collection to reduce the recycling cost at the disposal facility. Improving source sorting requires investment that would increase the price of the waste disposal service, thereby affecting the price-sensitive demand. The relationship between the service price and investments in waste sorting motives is analyzed in this paper via studying the trade-off between the optimal source sorting and the waste disposal service prices. Different scenarios based on the various players’ power structures are developed. Nash and Stackelberg games have been applied in order to find the optimal decision values in each scenario. The impact of cost sharing on optimal supply chain decisions is also studied. The numerical results show that the waste supply chain is more profitable when it is working under an integrated management structure. Moreover, reducing the required investment motivates supply chain players to select higher levels of waste sorting at the source. A numerical example is provided, followed by some managerial insights. </jats:p>",

Therefore, a calibrated water distribution model is helpful to monitor and understand the behaviour of a real water distribution network. However, a comprehensive performance indicator and an integrated method to assess the efficiency of model performance have not been well established in the literature. This study developed a methodology for a model calibration exercise, with consideration of two uncertainty parameters, i.e., Hazen–Williams roughness coefficient of the pipes and Non-Revenue Water (NRW) in each nodal demand. Following this, a statistical color-coded performance indicator was established, based on the Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSEC), the coefficient of determination (R2), the correlation coefficient (r), and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The accuracy of the calibrated model was measured by Discrepancy Ratio (DR) analysis. This study concluded that the model performed well when NRW was added to the nodal demand in zone(s) with suspected water loss activities. The suggested Hazen–Williams roughness coefficient for PVC pipes was between 130 and 140 for pipes aged more than 20 years. The threshold error value to determine the accuracy of the simulated model was proposed to be between –0.05 and 0.05.</jats:p>"

These facts are contradictory in terms of practical implementation because of stochastic nature of wind power plant, solar panels etc. The only solution is the transition from centralized to decentralized development of power industry, which is based on aggregation of distributed energy resources (including renewable energy sources (RES) and the applying the principles of «Internet of Energy», «Virtual power plant », «Microgrid » etc.) The using of this approach for designing isolated power system could reduce high energy cost which was caused by transport component. Pilot operation of the same energy systems without preliminary studies has high technical and economic risks. For that reason, it required a developing of simulation complex modelling system’s work. The article includes scientific and technological solutions for designing simulation complex of isolated power system, which function in “microgrid” and consist of models of sources and energy storage devices. Dependence of energetic parameters for different input parameter have been obtained. The concept of hardware/software solution, which provide opportunity for testing and researching algorithms of control system, have been presented also.</jats:p>",

In operating IGCC, wet desulphurization is used at temperatures below 200°C. The use of hot desulphurization at temperatures around 500°C will significantly improve IGCC efficiency. The preferred sorbent for hot gas cleaning is ZnO. At temperature of 450-500°C, ZnO begins decomposing because of reactions with syngas components (primarily hydrogen). Steam impedes reaction of ZnO with H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and increases ZnO thermal stability. Syngas H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O ratio is determined by gasifier operation mode.

To determine the effect of steam supply to syngas composition, experiments were performed on entrained-flow gasifier (1 MW). Experimental results were processed using thermodynamic analysis to determine idealized syngas composition and CFD-modeling to determine real experiment process parameters.

Results show groundwater, regardless the depth, is slightly alkaline in nature and relatively fresh with the total dissolved solids within 600 mg/L. The hydrochemical facies of phreatic and confined groundwater are dominantly HCO3-Ca·Mg, followed by HCO3-Na. Groundwater in the study area, regardless the depth, is suitable for irrigation with almost no salinity and sodium hazards if proper drainage measures are undertaken. The entropy weight water quality index evaluating results show all phreatic and confined groundwater is suitable for drinking purposes. The overall potential non-carcinogenic risk posed by nitrogen (NO3-N, NH4-N) and heavy metals (As, Zn, Fe, Mn) through drinking water ingestion exists in the southwestern area and a small local area in the central study area, and is higher for children.

To support organic food logistics operations, this work investigates benefits of facilitating real-time product data along delivery and storage processes. By the development of a simulation-based decision support system, sustainable deliveries of organic food from farms to retail stores are investigated. Generic keeping quality models are integrated to observe impacts of varying storage temperatures on food quality and losses over time.

A set of model testing was conducted to evaluate confidence level of the model in representing the evacuation dynamics during post-disaster of 2010 Mount Merapi eruption. Three scenarios of last-mile relief delivery at both strategic and operational levels were examined to evaluate quantitatively the effectiveness of the coordination mechanism and to explore other promising strategies.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Results indicate that the empirically founded agent-based modeling was able to reproduce the general pattern of observable Internal Displaced Persons based on government records, both at micro and macro levels, with a statistically non-significant difference. Low hazard perception and leader-following behavior which refuses to evacuate are the two factors responsible for late evacuation. Unsurprisingly, coordination through information sharing results in better performance than without coordination. To deal with both uneven distribution and long-term demand fulfillment, coordination among volunteers during aid distribution (at downstream operation) is not sufficient. The downstream coordination should also be accompanied with coordination between aid centers at the upstream operation. Furthermore, the coordination which is combined with other operational strategies, such as clustering strategy, using small-sized trucks and pre-positioning strategy, seems to be promising. It appears that the combined strategy of coordination and clustering strategy performs best among other combined strategies.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The significant role of early evacuation and self-evacuation behavior toward efficient evacuation indicates that human factor (i.e. hazard perception and cultural factor) should be considered in designing evacuation plan. Early warning system through both technology and community empowerment is necessary to support early evacuation. The early warning system should also be accompanied with at least 69 percent of the population performing self-evacuation behavior for the effective evacuation. As information sharing through coordination is necessary to avoid redundant efforts, uneven distribution and eventually to reduce unmet demand, the government can act as a coordinating actor to authorize the operation and mobilize the resources. The combination of coordination and another strategy reducing lead time such as clustering analysis, thus increasing responsiveness, is seemly strategy for efficient and effective last-mile relief distribution.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Literature on coordination is dominated by qualitative approach, which is difficult to evaluate its effectiveness quantitatively. Providing realistic setting of the evacuation dynamics in the course of the 2010 Mount Merapi eruption, the empirically founded agent-based model can be used to understand the factors influencing the evacuation dynamics and subsequently to quantitatively examine coordination mechanisms and other potential strategies toward efficient and effective last-mile relief distribution.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

In 2016, 44.7 million tonnes was generated globally, and the amount is estimated to reach 52 million tonnes annually by 2021. The management of this huge quantity of e-waste is a major problem across the world, primarily in developing countries. An effective e-waste management system is linked to the sustainability of e-waste processing plants, and currently it is plagued with different supply chain network (SCN) issues. To address the issues and challenges of SCN, there is a need to prioritize and address the constructs. The study thus combines two multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) tools, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and quality function deployment, to prioritize the constructs identified from literature and supported by field studies. The house of quality (HOQ) has been used for analyzing different stakeholders’ requirements. The degree of importance for HOQ-1 has been derived using the AHP tool. The study revealed the most intriguing issues and challenges of e-waste processing plants considering the requirements of different stakeholders. The results showed formal collection, storage, semi-informal collection, and e-waste quality to be the major issues of processing plants. The findings obtained from MCDM analysis have been validated though two case studies in India and China. If the results obtained are applied to the existing e-waste SCN, a holistic e-waste management system can be achieved for developing countries. </jats:p>",

The results using Vella and Verbeek’s two-step panel estimation reveal the presence of a backward-sloping labour supply curve for rural women from below poverty line households, and an upward-sloping labour supply for rural women from above poverty line (APL) households. This implies the existence of ‘forced’ or ‘need-based’ participation among poor women and justifies why they work long hours in poorly paid hazardous jobs. The article also finds horizontal labour supply among agriculture wage workers and for Adivasi and Dalit rural women to some extent, reflecting limited job options, and surplus unskilled labour who are unable to demand higher wages for their labour supply. On the other hand, when categorised by occupation type, the downward-sloping labour supply for rural women from APL households indicates the dominance of the income effect over the substitution effect, and the socio-cultural factors that gain strength as income levels increase. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Classification: J220, R21, J16, R230, I32 </jats:p>",

The state of information protection and the reliability of computer systems for corporate monitoring and diagnosis of the railway power supply system are analyzed. The main tasks in the intellectualization of component systems are defined, namely traction electric network. The principles of information protection are proposed, which include: active protection of information; convincing protection of information, consisting in the justification of the design and measures to protect the conditions and circumstances. Such a principle as the continuity of the information protection process provides for the organization of the protection of objects at all stages of the development and operation life cycle. A variety of information protection tools provides for the exclusion of patterns at the stage of selecting cover objects and various ways to implement protection, not excluding the use of standard solutions.  The combination of the above principles in the work is called an integrated approach to information security, which is the basis for the creation of computer information protection systems. According to the sphere of information security, this approach complies with international ISO standards, and for the technical protection of information and state standards it complies with the requirements of existing national legislative and regulatory documents.  To ensure the security of information stored and processed in computer systems, the coordinated application of various security measures is necessary.</jats:p>",

Here we present a study applying a DNA‐based root phenotyping method (root DNA density; RDD) for phenotyping the root system of maize. Twenty‐one maize inbred lines were investigated in a rain‐out shelter experiment and 19 maize inbred lines in a greenhouse experiment under well‐watered and drought conditions. Beside other commonly used root traits, agronomic traits of the plants were recorded and compared to RDD. Within root traits, RDD showed high significant genotypic variation and the highest repeatabilities of up to 72.4%. In contrast to most agronomic traits, repeatabilities increased under drought conditions. Values showed also good correlations between rain‐out shelter and greenhouse trial, indicating the potential of this method for obtaining comparable results across different environments.</jats:p>",

Assuming a constant feed speed, distance of the nozzle from the processed raw material, and spray angle of the water jet for six diameters of the water nozzles, the supply pressure value was determined. Supply pressure at which the water stream has enough energy to fully cut the muscle flap is also determined. The tests were carried out on samples obtained from rainbow trout, considering the size of the carcasses and the place of cutting. Analysis of the obtained results showed that both the size of the carcass and the cutting site affect the value of the supply pressure. However, regardless of this, the full cut of the lobe without the skin can be obtained by feeding the jet with a pressure of 3.5 MPa. This amount of pressure can easily be achieved using a Karcher pressure washer. To effectively apply this technology to the fish processing industry, it is necessary to extend the tests with further processing parameters such as the feed speed of the nozzle.</jats:p>",

This article analyses the possibilities of using different types of remediation technologies that include in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) with different oxidants (potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate and sodium persulfate), as well as in-situ bioremediation (ISB), and the combination of both types of treatment. From the results of the analysis it was concluded that the best option for this case was to carry out a pre-treatment of the area by ISCO with sodium persulfate as the oxidant agent and then a further biological treatment.</jats:p>",

Drawing on knowledge management theory, we propose that knowledge transfer plays a mediating role underlying the relationship. On the basis of the stakeholder involvement theory, we argue that partner social responsibility plays moderating roles not only in specific investments—green supply chain innovation performance link—but also in the link of knowledge transfer and performance. We tested the proposed relationships with a sample consisted of 331 questionnaires and validated responses from 187 high‐tech firms in China. The results generally support the proposed hypotheses, and the integrative model—moderated mediation—is also supported. As such, this study contributes to understand about how specific investments affect the performance of green supply chain innovation, providing new insights on stakeholder involvement and knowledge transfer in green supply chain innovation management.</jats:p>",

To this aim, a modeling chain is set up, based on the combined use of regional climate models (RCMs) and water supply system simulation models. The methodology is applied to the Pozzillo reservoir, located in Sicily (Italy), which has experienced several droughts in the past. We use an RCM model that, based on a previous study, has proved to be the most reliable in the area, among those of the EURO-CORDEX initiative. RCM precipitation and temperature monthly time series are used to generate future reservoir inflow data, according to two representative concentration pathways, RCP4.5 (intermediate emissions scenario) and RCP8.5 (high emissions scenario) and a two-step bias correction procedure. Simulation of the reservoir indicated that, due to reservoir inflow reduction induced by climate change, performances of the Pozzillo reservoir are predicted to decrease significantly in the future, with impacts of RCP8.5 generally higher than RCP4.5.</jats:p>"

Most evidence of this relationship is based on dietary intake surveys rather than individual products and varies depending on the food processing classification system used. This study aimed to compare the nutritional quality of more- versus less-processed packaged foods and beverages in Canada, using a large, branded food database and two processing classification systems. Nutritional information for products (n = 17,269) was sourced from the University of Toronto FLIP 2017 database. Products were categorized using the NOVA and Poti et al. processing classification systems. Calories, sodium, saturated fat, total and free sugars, fibre and protein per 100 g (or mL) were examined by processing category using descriptive statistics and linear regression. Overall, the most-processed products under both systems were more likely to be lower in protein, and higher in total and free sugars, compared with less-processed foods (p &lt; 0.05); the direction and strength of the association between other nutrients/components and level of processing were less consistent. These findings demonstrate that calorie- and nutrient-dense foods exist across different levels of processing, suggesting that food choices and dietary recommendations should be based primarily on energy or nutrient density rather than processing classification.</jats:p>"

Many simulation models for sustainable water management, however, lack explanatory and predictive power because the two-way dynamic feedbacks between human and water systems are neglected. With Agent-based Modelling of Resources (Aqua.MORE; here, of the resource water), we present a platform that can support understanding, interpretation and scenario development of resource flows in coupled human–water systems at the catchment scale. Aqua.MORE simulates the water resources in a demand and supply system, whereby water fluxes and socioeconomic actors are represented by individual agents that mutually interact and cause complex feedback loops. First, we describe the key steps for developing an agent-based model (ABM) of water demand and supply, using the platform Aqua.MORE. Second, we illustrate the modelling process by application in an idealized Alpine valley, characterized by touristic and agricultural water demand sectors. Here, the implementation and analysis of scenarios highlights the possibilities of Aqua.MORE (1) to easily deploy case study-specific agents and characterize them, (2) to evaluate feedbacks between water demand and supply and (3) to compare the effects of different agent behavior or water use strategies. Thereby, we corroborate the potential of Aqua.MORE as a decision-support tool for sustainable watershed management.</jats:p>"

In this study, Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets were integrated with Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) to simulate the outlet river discharge in Polroud watershed, located in the North of Iran. Temperature and precipitation products generated by GLDAS were calibrated using regression analysis based on observation data for the period of 2004–2006. Then, river discharge was simulated by using HEC-HMS based on two different datasets (GLDAS meteorological product and gauged data) on the scale of the basin for the same period. The results clearly indicated that the forcing of GLDAS data into HEC-HMS model leads to promising results with acceptable correlation with observed data. Although, in comparison with direct GLDAS runoff products, the proposed approach improved the accuracy of river discharge, the problem of underestimation still reduces the expected accuracy. Because of global accessibility, GLDAS datasets would be a good alternative in ungauged or poorly gauged watersheds.</jats:p>",

To this end, an agent-based model driven decision support system for the agri-food supply chain is presented. Inputs in this research are taken from a case example of a Mexican green coffee supply chain. In this context, the decision support agent serves the purposes of deriving useful knowledge to accomplish (i) the decision regarding the estimation of Cherry coffee yield obtained at the coffee plantation, and the Parchment coffee sample verification decision, using fuzzy logic involving an inference engine with IF-THEN type rules; (ii) the production plan establishment decision, using a decision-making rule approach based upon the coupling of IF-THEN fuzzy inference rules and equation-based representation by means of mixed integer programming with the aim to maximize customer service level; and (iii) the production plan update decision using mathematical equations once the customer service level falls below the expected level. Three scenarios of demand patterns were considered to conduct the experiments: increasing, unimodal and decreasing. We found that the input inventory and output inventory vary similar over time for the unimodal demand pattern, not the case for both the increasing and decreasing demand patterns. For the decreasing demand pattern, ten tardy orders for the initial production schedule, an 88% service level, and nineteen tardy orders from the estimated production results, a 77% service level. This value falls below the expected level. Consequently, the updated aggregate production schedule resulted in ten tardy orders and an 88% service level.</jats:p>"

The collection method was applied for determination of water meter errors. Starting flow rates, error curves and weighted error of water meters were measured in a laboratory setup. Tested volumetric-type water meters have the lowest starting flow rate and the highest accuracy whereas single-jet water meters have the lowest accuracy and the highest starting flow rate.

The J linear programming (LP) software was used to analyse different regional forest strategies in terms of wood supply and transportation costs to multiple market destinations. The analysis revealed clear differences both in wood flows and forest resources between strategies maximizing wood supply or optimizing wood supply to market destinations. In addition, the wood flows appeared responsive to new mill and increased demand. Further, the changes in factory price had a heavier impact on pulpwood supply than on sawlog supply. The same methodology can be applied for analysing the impact of new factories on wood flows from forest to factories and between factories or to support forest enterprises in planning their wood supply over multiple time periods and multiple destinations.</jats:p>",

This is shown in science, where more and more biological processes have been found to be independent. Contemporary work has delineated the independence of yield potential (YP0) and nitrogen (N) response in cereal crop production. Each year, residual N in the soil following crop harvest is different. Yield levels change radically from year to year, a product of an ever‐changing and unpredictable/random environment. The contribution of residual soil N for next years’ growing crop randomly influences N response or the response index (RI). Consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, where it is understood that entropy increases with time and is irreversible, biological systems are expected to become increasingly random with time. Consequently, a range of different biological parameters will influence YP0 and RI in an unrelated manner. The unpredictable nature that environment has on N demand, and the unpredictable nature that environment has on final grain yield, dictate the need for independent estimation of multiple random variables that will be used in mid‐season biological algorithms of the future.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Core Ideas</jats:bold>\n<jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Randomness in biological systems is increasing.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Many biological processes are independent.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Yield levels change from one year to the next.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Environments change over time and are random.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Optimum fertilizer nitrogen rates change dramatically from year to year.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p>",

A secondary aim of this study is to add to the body of knowledge on supply chain risk management practices in a developing economy. A qualitative research methodology involving case studies of four companies operating in the region was adopted. The findings indicate the sectional risk mitigating strategies adopted by the companies to contain the disruptions included a combination of the various options of risk avoidance, retention, reduction and transfer.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Water supply infrastructure planning in groundwater-dependent regions is often challenged by uncertainty in future groundwater resource availability. Many major aquifer systems face long-term water table decline due to unsustainable withdrawals. However, many regions, especially those in the developing world, have a scarcity of groundwater data. This creates large uncertainties in groundwater resource predictions and decisions about whether to develop alternative supply sources. Developing infrastructure too soon can lead to unnecessary and expensive irreversible investments, but waiting too long can threaten water supply reliability. This study develops an adaptive infrastructure planning framework that applies Bayesian learning on groundwater observations to assess opportunities to learn about groundwater availability in the future and adapt infrastructure plans. This approach allows planners in data scarce regions to assess under what conditions a flexible infrastructure planning approach, in which initial plans are made but infrastructure development is deferred, can mitigate the risk of overbuilding infrastructure while maintaining water supply reliability in the face of uncertainty. This framework connects engineering options analysis from infrastructure planning to groundwater resources modeling. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept on a desalination planning case for the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where poor characterization of a fossil aquifer creates uncertainty in how long current groundwater resources can reliably supply demand. We find that a flexible planning approach reduces the risk of over-building infrastructure compared to a traditional static planning approach by 40% with minimal reliability risk (&lt;1%). This striking result may be explained by the slow-evolving nature of groundwater decline, which provides time for planners to react, in contrast to more sudden risks such as flooding where tradeoffs between cost and reliability risk are heightened. This Bayesian approach shows promise for many civil infrastructure domains by providing a method to quantify learning in environmental modeling and assess the effectiveness of adaptive planning.</jats:p>",

Based on a set of explanatory variables selected by the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method, estimation of the Nerlovian model by the system-GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) method yields three key findings. First, while farmers’ previous cultivation decisions on green fodder supply strongly predict their current decisions, without the influence of other drivers, China’s green fodder supply tends to decline over time. Second, among the identified drivers, government policy plays the most significant role—the availability of subsidies for cultivation of green fodder crops raises the sown area of green fodder crops by more than 30 percent. In contrast, farmer’s sown-area decision is only modestly responsive to price incentives. Finally, while the stock of fixed capital inputs (e.g., number of combine harvesters) and natural disasters (e.g., floods) both affect green fodder supply, their impacts are small.</jats:p>"

This case study investigated detailed activities of thirty contracts of an apparel supply chain by considering the manufacturer as a coupling point of upstream (suppliers) and downstream (buyer). The contract frequencies were analyzed based on lead time and quantity. Each contract was analyzed using a time-based process mapping (TBPM). TBPMs of all contracts showed that overall 45% were non-value-added activities throughout the chain. It was also identified that the non-value activities were independent of the contract volume. This study recommends time compression methodology to reduce the non-value-added activities by using advanced manufacturing technologies. The methodology and recommended time compression ways of this study can be applied to other supply chains.</jats:p>"

Along the Quebrada, the Rio Huasamayo, flowing into the Rio Grande, formed a large alluvial fan where the village of Tilcara was built. The final reach of Rio Huasamayo is an artificial channel, embanked by unconsolidated material removed from the riverbed. The village is located in an area at a lower elevation with respect to the riverbed, still in aggradation; so it is affected by an evident hydrogeological hazard. The main cause of the riverbed aggradation is the enormous sediment supply from the slopes of the Rio Huasamayo basin. The aim of the paper is to estimate the soil loss on the slopes and the consequent sediment supply to the main stream, identifying the areas of the basin mostly affected by erosion processes that cause the aggradation of the Rio Huasamayo riverbed. In this case, due to the lack of hydrometeorological stations (monitoring rainfalls, temperature, flow rates, etc.), soil loss and sediment supply to the main stream cannot be estimated through the application of commonly used models in the literature (e.g., USLE, RUSLE, USPED). Here the Gavrilovic method (EPM) was applied in combination with the data of the CORINE Project, allowing the estimation of the volume of material exiting from the catchment. So the main supplying areas (sub-basins of the Rio Huasamayo) can be identified where focused interventions for the control of solid transport could be realized, to mitigate the process of riverbed aggradation.</jats:p>"

We show the features of various power supply systems with typical consumers of electrical energy. As an example, we consider power supply systems of 0.4 kV for detached houses and of 6-10 kV for industrial enterprises with high-power thyristor DC drives. We describe features of generating higher harmonics (HH) of current and voltage in the considered electrical networks, their harmonic composition and the main negative consequences. We consider main technical means of compensating HH of currents and voltages in power supply systems with nonlinear ER, and analysis of various PF types. The influence of frequency properties on HH compensation is presented as one of the main features of PF application in FCD. Special aspects of selection of PF specific types and its parameters are described on the basis of solving optimization problems. The main methods of FCD design optimization are considered. Based on FCD structure optimization, we proposed their most rational designs for various power supply systems, as well as the results of their application.</jats:p>",

Michels in 1966 classified hepatic arterial variations in 10 categories, based on a cadaveric study. Establishment of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) provides useful anatomical information. The purpose of our study is to highlight these variations and to propose of a user‐friendly algorithm when studying a CT examination. We studied 1,520 contrast‐enhanced CTs (16‐row MDCT system) during arterial phase and searched for hepatic arteries and celiac trunk (CTr) variations. CT images were postproccessed using multiplanar reconstruction, maximum intensity projection and volume rendering techniques in axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. Our results were organized according to Michels' classification. Normal anatomy was found in 72.89% of the cases and variations classified in Types II–X in 22.24%. However, 4.87% of the cases could not be classified in Michels' types. A single arterial variation was found in 22.89% of the cases and multiple arterial variations were found in 4.21% of the cases. We examined first the aorta for supernumerary branches and then checked the fissure between right and left liver lobe, following porta hepatis, and finally the CTr and superior mesenteric artery. Hepatic arteries and CTr variations are relatively common (27.11%) and should be identified by the radiologists when studying CTs as their recognition provides better surgical planning, preventing iatrogenic complications. Imaging in coronal plane was helpful for end branches, while sagittal plane was better for aortic branches. Clin. Anat., 33:1091‐1101, 2020. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

Then, the finite volume method was used to simulate the effect of cooling oil temperature on thermal deformation, and the effect of thermal suppression was experimentally studied using a feed system combined with a cooler to improve the positioning accuracy of the machine tool. In this study, the supply oil temperature in the structural cooling channels was found to significantly affect the position accuracy of the moving table and moving carrier. If the supply oil temperature in the cooling channels is consistent with the operational ambient temperature, the position accuracy of the moving table in the Y direction and the moving carrier in the X and Z directions has the best performance under different feed rates. From the thermal suppression experiments of the embedded cooling channels, the positioning accuracy of the feed system can be improved by approximately 25.5 % during the dynamic feeding process. Furthermore, when the hydrostatic guideway is cooled and dynamic feeding is conducted, positioning accuracy can be improved by up to 47.8 %. The machining accuracy can be improved by approximately 60 % on average by using the embedded cooling channels in this study. Therefore, thermal suppression by the cooling channels in this study can not only effectively improve the positioning accuracy but also enhance machining accuracy, proving that the method is effective for enhancing machine tool accuracy.</jats:p>",

The coracoid process (CP) is the main structure of this surgery. However, the blood supply of CP is not fully understood, and the extent of destruction of blood supply of coracoid bone graft after Latarjet osteotomy procedure is still controversial. Five embalmed cadaveric upper limbs specimens were employed for macro observation of the blood supply of CP. The conjoint tendon (CT) and CP interface were dissected for histology. Sixteen fresh frozen shoulder specimens were used for perfusion and micro CT scanning. Eight specimens were used to present the whole vessel structure of CP. The other eight underwent Latarjet osteotomy procedure. The coracoid bone grafts in both groups were scanned to clarify the remnant blood supply. It was found that the CP was nourished by supra-scapular artery (SSA), thoracic-acromial artery and branch from second portion of the axillary artery (AA). After Latarjet osteotomy procedure, no artery from CT was detected to penetrate the CP at its attachment. Only in one specimen the blood vessel that originated from the CT penetrated the bone graft at the inferior side. Therefore, most of the blood supply was destroyed although there is a subtle possibility that the vessels derived from the CT nourished the inferior side of the CP. In a nutshell, CP is a structure with rich blood supply. The traditional Latarjet osteotomy procedure would inevitably cut off the blood supply of the coracoid bone graft.</jats:p>",

The appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D in women’s diet is significant for a proper maintenance of the skeletal system. <jats:italic>Research Aim</jats:italic>. The aim of the research was to assess the calcium and vitamin D supply in a diet among women regularly practicing sport. <jats:italic>Methodology</jats:italic>. The research was completed by 593 women at the age of 18–50 (median 25) who played sports regularly (at least 2 times a week). To assess the calcium and vitamin D intake, short Food Frequency Questionnaires for calcium and vitamin D (VIDEO-FFQ) were used. The examined group was provided with the questionnaires via social media. To assess intake levels, the authors applied the group-based cutoff point method (calcium norm was EAR 800 mg/day; vitamin D norm was AI 15 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>g/day). <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. The median of calcium and vitamin D intake in a diet was 502 mg/day and 5.2 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>g/day, respectively (Q25 and Q75 for calcium was 387 mg/day and 627 mg/day, respectively, and for vitamin D was 3.4 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>g/day and 8.2 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>g/day, respectively). In relation to the EAR norm for calcium and AI norm for vitamin D, 92.0% of the examined participants in a group demonstrated lower than recommended calcium intake levels and 97.3% showed lower than recommended vitamin D intake levels. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was used by 13.1% (in this subgroup, 11.5% of the examined group members did not need it) and 56.8% of the examined women (in this subgroup, 2.4% of the examined group did not need it), respectively. After including the calcium and vitamin D intake, the supply median for the whole group was 535 mg/day and 28.8 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>g/day, respectively (Q25 and Q75 for calcium was 402 mg/day and 671 mg/day, and for vitamin D was 6.3 <jats:italic>µ</jats:italic>g/day and 55.7 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>g/day, respectively); 87.5% of the examined participants did not meet the EAR norms for calcium and 42.0% did not meet the AI norm for vitamin D. Among the women supplementing calcium, 58.9% did not reach the reference intake value; however, all women supplementing vitamin D fulfilled the expected nutritional need. <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. It is important to educate women about the necessity to provide the body with proper calcium and vitamin D intake levels in a diet in order to avoid health problems resulting from the deficit of the nutrients.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Online pharmacies are an important part of the modern healthcare system. They interact with customers through well-designed web interfaces to deliver the healthcare customers need. In addition to well-designed web interfaces, online pharmacies rely on an effective supply chain system to provide medical supplies and services, and especially effective inventory management for supply systems. As green supply chain management (GSCM) becomes increasingly considered by countries, how to develop a sustainable inventory model that takes into account the revenue growth of an online pharmacy while preventing waste and reducing energy costs has become very important. In line with this trend, the study develops a sustainable inventory model that focuses on both economic aspect (profit) and environmental aspect (losses from excessive inventory) within a framework of a single period multi-product inventory model. Specifically, the sustainable inventory model applies the visual-attention-dependent demand (VADD) rate to characterize customer demand in an online trading environment, thereby seeking a profitable marketing strategy and reducing losses due to excessive inventory. Since the complexity of model optimization will drastically increase due to the inclusion of many products in the problem, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based solution procedure is proposed to increase the feasibility of the proposed model in solving real problems. The sustainable inventory model and the solution procedure are illustrated, compared, and discussed with an online pharmacy example. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is formulated to study the influence of model parameters on the model solution, the loss of unsold inventory that results in a waste of resources and energy, and the profit of online pharmacies.</jats:p>"

The research topic is very topical since it contributes to providing the necessary inputs for the planning and use of water resources in order to generate projects that tend to cover the current water deficit. The methodology used to estimate the water supply is based on the precipitation-runoff model proposed by the Soil Conservation Service of the United States of America. In fact, in spite of the annual volume of runoff has been estimated at 9658.83 hm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, against 2388.93 hm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, which is the average annual volume of water to meet the demands, from July to November it can be seen that the deficit reach at 330.27 hm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>.

On the first step we choose isolated areas and villages that have no chances to get connection to natural gas grid. Even if they are connected to power grids, they still have a room for autonomic solutions in producing heat/hot water. In many cases quality of power is not very good. Then on the second step we compare different combinations of traditional (LNG/CNG/LPG/diesel) and renewable (PV panels, solar collectors, wind turbines + heat/power storage units) power sources in order to find the best way of power/heat supply for the village. In the article the approach is shown on two different examples – Dagestan (south of Russia) and Yakutia (north of Russia).

Their work compliments scholarship on other causal mechanisms, including the commercial determinants of health, that have contributed to creating the risk commodity environment and barriers to NCD prevention policy coherence. However, there remain significant gaps in the understanding of how these causal mechanisms interact within a whole system. As such, public health researchers’ suggestions for how to effectively prevent NCDs through addressing the risk commodity environment tend to remain fragmented, incomplete and piecemeal. We suggest this is, in part, because conventional policy analysis methods tend to be reductionist, considering causal mechanisms in relative isolation and conceptualizing them as linear chains of cause and effect. This commentary discusses how a systems thinking approach offers methods that could help with better understanding the risk commodity environment problem, identifying a more comprehensive set of effective solutions across sectors and its utility more broadly for gaining insight into how to ensure recommended solutions are translated into policy, including though transformation at the paradigmatic level.</jats:p>"

The power supply capabilities of two microenergy sources were assessed by analyzing the electrical characteristics and performing continuous energy data collection. The HEH system consisted of two separated power converters and an electronic multiplexer circuit to avoid impedance mismatch and improve efficiency. The feasibility of the self-powered HEH system was verified by consumption analysis of the HEH system, the WSNs, and the data analysis of the collected microenergy. Taking the summation of PV and TEG input power of 1.26 mW (PPV:PTEG was about 3:1) as an example, the power loss of the HEH system accounted for 33.8% of the total input power.

A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was designed for ammoniacal nitrogen removal from the leachate and the economic feasibility and environmental impact of the designed SBR was assessed. From the cost-benefit analysis, capital expenditure (CAPEX) of 33,500 €/year and operational expenditure (OPEX) of 13,521 €/year were estimated. A shadow price concept tool was used to calculate the environmental benefit as 21,000 €/year. The net present value of the project was evaluated to be 19,528 € with an internal rate of return of 21.6%. For environmental assessment, triple bottom line (TBL) analysis on the existing practice of discharging the leachate to a nearby wastewater treatment plant and on-site treatment using SBR was performed. The total score for existing practice was calculated to be 55.1% while for on-site treatment it was 59.6%. Based on the results it was concluded that on-site treatment is both economically and environmentally feasible. A mitigation plan was also prepared for the impacts identified in the environmental assessment.</jats:p>",

We model a single‐period Stackelberg game in which a manufacturer sells new products to a retailer and collects used products with exogenous retail price and collection price via three alternative reverse channels: (a) the manufacturer collects directly from customers, (b) the retailer collects for the manufacturer, and (c) a third party is awarded a collection subcontract from the manufacturer. We carry out a comprehensive investigation under push–pull configurations to observe how reverse channel structures with different gaming sequences of CLSC members influence the worst‐case performance when the demand distribution is over the set of increasing generalized failure rate distributions. From our PoA analysis, we find that the pull system does not always outperform the push system, especially when the retailer is the leader, in contrast to the results for forward supply chains. While the PoA of the push system is dramatically sensitive to the quality condition of used products, the pull system has a constant efficiency loss that is independent of the quality condition. Instead, the PoA of the pull system solely changes with the gaming sequence of the manufacturer. We also find that manufacturer's direct collection is a better reverse channel choice compared to retailer's collection. Additional managerial insights are summarized for discussion.</jats:p>",

Although manual approaches are still frequently used for sensitivity and calibration, they are tedious, time consuming, and require experienced personnel. This paper describes two typical and effective automatic approaches for sensitivity analysis and calibration for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). These included the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) algorithm and Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm. The results show the following. (1) The main factor that influences the simulated accuracy of the Heihe River basin runoff is the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) runoff curve parameters. (2) SWAT performed very well in the Heihe River basin. According to the observed runoff data from 2005 to 2013, the determination coefficient R2 of the simulation and the efficiency coefficient (Ens) of the model was higher than 0.8. (3) Compared with the Shuffled Complex Evolution, the SUFI-2 algorithm provides almost the same overall ranking of the sensitive parameters, but it is found to require less time with higher accuracy. The SUFI-2 provides a practical and flexible tool to attain reliable deterministic simulation and uncertainty analysis of SWAT, it can lead to a better understanding and to better estimated values and thus reduced uncertainty.</jats:p>",

While the political influence that corporations wield stems in part from significant financial resources, it has also been enabled and magnified by what has been referred to as global health’s neoliberal deep core, which has subjected health policy to the individualisation of risk and responsibility and the privileging of market-based policy responses. The accompanying perspective article from Lencucha and Thow draws attention to neoliberalism in the NCD space and the way it has historically structured patterns of thinking and doing that foreground economic interests over health considerations. In this commentary, we explore how shifting from a focus on material power to discursive power creates space to see the NCD agenda as a battle of economic ideas as well as dollars, and consequently the importance of public health engagement in the next vision for the economy.</jats:p>"

Results show that the LSA can generate meaningful values of the nonmarket benefits derived from improving water supply infrastructure, based on the impact that such benefits can have on individuals’ life satisfaction. In addition, these values are not different from those obtained from the CVM. Thus the LSA arises as a useful complement to the more traditional methods while expanding the array of techniques available for the economic valuation of environmental goods in a cost benefit framework.</jats:p>",

The study area is the Wuhan Metropolitan Area. Entropy method, comprehensive index method, opportunity cost method and most suitable regional method were employed. The coefficients for importance of functions, for costs, and for values in production, social and ecological of cultivated land were measured. Significant spatial differences in the effectiveness of multifunctional cultivated land protection were found. According to the effectiveness of multifunctional cultivated land protection, the study area can be divided into the following three regions: the “most suitable region”, where the functions of cultivated land and their costs are matched in most parts of the study area; the “optimization region for functional structure”, mostly located in the Jianghan Plain, where the structure of multifunctional cultivated land needs further optimization; and the “improvement region for functional level”, including the mountainous areas, such as Yingshan and Wuxue in the East, and the municipal districts, such as Wuhan and Ezhou, where the potential for improving level of multifunctional cultivated land is relatively large. The article contributes to firstly introducing value engineering theory into the research of cultivated land protection, linking demand to supply of functions of cultivated land. We suggest that different policies might be implemented to optimize the spatial layout of cultivated land protection, and to manifest and coordinate multiple functions of cultivated land. It is vital to improve the use efficiency of funds for multifunctional cultivated land protection, and in the end to realize effective protection of cultivated land in quantity, quality and ecology at a lower cost in a sustainable way.</jats:p>"

One possible mechanism for these improvements is increased NP supply. Using county-level data, we fit cross-sectional and panel regression models to estimate the association between adopting full NP SOP and NP supply in general, and in rural and health professional shortage area—designated counties in particular. In cross-sectional analyses, we estimated positive associations between NP SOP and NP supply, though these relationships were only statistically significant when analyzing health professional shortage areas. In the panel regression models with county fixed effects, the estimated effects were attenuated toward zero and sometimes switched signs. Our findings suggest that improvements in access to care following adoption of full SOP may not be driven by increased NP supply but rather by increased capacity of NPs and physicians to provide care. </jats:p>",

In this paper an attempt is made to conceptualize a scale for measuring the Sustainable- supply chain management (S-SCM) practices, development of sustainable capabilities of manufacturing firms while evaluating the performance of the organization on TBL. Based on systematic review, the researchersh as identified five major determinants of S-SCM practices, namely Supply-Chain Coordination &amp; Trust (S-CCT); Supply-Chain Learning (S-CL); Supply-Chain Continuity(S-CC); Supply-Chain Orientation(S-CO) and Supply -Chain Risk Management(S-CRM) and further additional five determinants were identified as Supply-Chain Dynamic Capabilities (S-CDC): Knowledge generation and absorptive capacity of the firm (KG-AC);Demand-0rientation(D-O), Innovative-Ability(I-A), Renovation Ability(R-A) and Social Network enhancement-Ability (SNE-A).Further three determinants of S-SCM performance namely Environmental-Performance (E-P); Social-Performance (S-P) and Economic- Performance(E-P) are identified. In order to collect data from 172 automobile and electronic goods companies in India, a research survey was being carried out. The SEM measurement and Structural Model Analysis was carried to find the association between the three determinants. The result of the analysis makes a significant contribution to SCM literature. The research outcomes of this research aim to enable practitioners to design execute and monitor the different elements of S-SCMfirm level activities, its dynamic capabilities and assess the effect of these activities on the firms’ operational efficiency.</jats:p>"

With the impact of climate change and human activities, the mechanism and process of floods are constantly changing. However, in many areas, there are only simple scaling results that can be used to guide daily work. Taking the Daqinghe River basin as an example, a fixed flood scaling exponent determined in 1974 (before the change point of 1979) is still used all over the basin, which is apparently no longer appropriate. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to explore: (1) the scale relationship between the peak flows and the basin area under changing environments; (2) the validation of the scale invariance theory; (3) the physical relationship between the event-based scaling theory and the annual flood quantile-based scaling theory in the mesoscale non-nested and partly nested basins; and (4) the modification of the existing uniform flood scaling exponent in the study area. To achieve these objectives, eight simultaneous observed flood events in seven non-nested and partly nested mesoscale sub-basins of the Daqinghe River basin were selected to analyze the flood scaling theory. The results showed that there was a scaling relationship between the flood peaks and watershed area for the flood events, and the scale invariance theory was also supported herein. To analyze the effect of the environmental conditions on flood scaling in the Daqinghe River basin, the flood events were reconstructed after the change point (the year 1979). It was found that the flood scaling exponents of the reconstructed flood events are larger than those of the observed events after the change point. The flood scaling exponent changed with flood events, varying from 0.65 to 1.26 when considering the basin area as the independent variable, and decreasing with a minimum of 0.36 when taking the rainfall characteristics into consideration. It was also found that the mean of the event-based scaling exponents is larger than the annual flood quantile-based scaling exponents.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the dry season there was a scarcity of the availability of clean water in several Central Java province (Wonogiri, Sukoharjo, Karanganyar Disrict and Surakarta City), including Wosusokas Regional Region, so the government often drops clean water. So, the Government conducted the Wosusokas Regional Water Supply System Program. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) scheme is an option to overcome investment cost. This study aims to identify and analyze the risks of Wosusokas regional water supply system project eith government perspective. This research adopted a case study and literature analyze. Selected respondents from PDAB Tirta Utama, Dinas Bina Marga dan Cipta Karya Central Java, BPPW Central Java, District/ City Governments (Regional Water Supply Company, Bappeda and DPU) from Wonogiri, Sukoharjo, Karanganyar and Surakarta. The result found 35 risk factors that could potentially project failure or delay, the majority of these are considered high (11,43%), moderate (54,29%) and low (34,29). Risk factors with high probability are delay and increase cost of land acquisition, failure to complete the contract by the contractor / sub-contractor, failure initial tariff and delay periodic tariff adjustments. The results are useful for Government as a reference in managing the risks of PPP Spam Regional especially in Central Java.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Although the contribution of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to economic growth is beyond doubt, they collectively affect the environment and society negatively. As SMEs have to perform in a very competitive environment, they often find it difficult to achieve their environmental and social targets. Therefore, making SMEs sustainable is one of the most daunting tasks for both policy makers and SME owners/managers alike. Prior research argues that through measuring SMEs’ supply chain sustainability performance and deriving means of improvement one can make SMEs’ business more viable, not only from an economic perspective, but also from the environmental and social point of view. Prior studies apply data envelopment analysis (DEA) for measuring the performance of groups of SMEs using multiple criteria (inputs and outputs) by segregating efficient and inefficient SMEs and suggesting improvement measures for each inefficient SME through benchmarking it against the most successful one. However, DEA is limited to recommending means of improvement solely for inefficient SMEs. To bridge this gap, the use of structural equation modelling (SEM) enables developing relationships between the criteria and sub-criteria for sustainability performance measurement that facilitates to identify improvement measures for every SME within a region through a statistical modelling approach. As SEM suggests improvements not from the perspective of individual SMEs but for the totality of SMEs involved, this tool is more suitable for policy makers than for individual company owners/managers. However, a performance measurement heuristic that combines DEA and SEM could make use of the best of each technique, and thereby could be the most appropriate tool for both policy makers and individual SME owners/managers. Additionally, SEM results can be utilized by DEA as inputs and outputs for more effective and robust results since the latter are based on more objective measurements. Although DEA and SEM have been applied separately to study the sustainability of organisations, according to the authors’ knowledge, there is no published research that has combined both the methods for sustainable supply chain performance measurement. The framework proposed in the present study has been applied in two different geographical locations—Normandy in France and Midlands in the UK—to demonstrate the effectiveness of sustainable supply chain performance measurement using the combined DEA and SEM approach. Additionally, the state of the companies’ sustainability in both regions is revealed with a number of comparative analyses.</jats:p>",

IT therefore plays a critical role in supply chains. How to achieve higher organizational performance through IT in a complex and uncertain supply chain environment has become an important issue. Even though many practitioners and scholars have taken multiple points of view to investigate the effects of IT infrastructure capability on firms’ performance, little research has explored cause-and-effect relationships from the perspective of supply chain capabilities. Based on a resource-based view of the firm, this study develops a research framework for investigating the mediating role of supply chain capabilities in the relationships between IT infrastructure flexibility, integration, and firms’ performance. Data for the study were collected from 270 companies in the Taiwanese electronics industry and the relationships proposed in the framework were tested using the Partial Least Squares method. The results indicate that IT infrastructure integration and flexibility indirectly and positively impact organizational performance through the mediating effect of supply chain capability, and the mediating effect is a full mediation. The findings provide empirical support to resourced-based IT studies, which propose mediating IT impacts on organizational performance. This study should be useful to practitioners who implement IT strategy. </jats:p>",

The calculated surface profiles, stage hydrographs and maximum run-up heights for 24 sets of initial conditions are elaborately compared with the experimental measurements, which show the SWEs reproduce the wave oscillation evolution and the maximum run-up height inaccurately. The maximum run-up heights calculated by the SWEs are all smaller than those by the RANS and the measured results, the maximum errors are within −10% to −25%, which may predict delay of the downstream dam-break. However, the maximum errors calculated by the RANS are within ±10%. So the RANS predict more accurate results than the SWEs. Additionally, the generation of short waves must be below a certain upstream-to-downstream ‘depth ratio’, roughly the ‘depth ratio’ &amp;lt;2/3 in this study. If the ratio is too high, it is difficult to form a wavy push due to air entrainment and turbulence. The SWEs predict more accurate results for shallow initial depths than deep initial depths. Therefore, the advantage of the RANS can be more obvious for deep initial depths.</jats:p>",

In Canada, protecting threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) populations requires preserving large areas of intact forest habitat, with some restrictions on industrial forestry activities. We present a linear programming model that assesses the trade-off between achieving an objective of habitat protection for caribou populations while maintaining desired levels of harvest in forest landscapes. The habitat-protection objective maximizes the amount of connected habitat that is accessible by caribou, and the forestry objective maximizes net revenues from timber harvest subject to even harvest flow, a harvest target, and environmental sustainability constraints. We applied the model to explore the habitat protection and harvesting scenarios in the Cold Lake caribou range, a 6726 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> area of prime caribou habitat in Alberta, Canada.

All analyses were performed in vitro using radioligand binding assays, and the results indicated lack of affinity to β<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and α<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> receptors and serotonin transporter (SERT), furthermore very weak affinity to the 5-HT<jats:sub>1A</jats:sub> receptor (30% inhibition at 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> and 10<jats:sup>−5</jats:sup> M). Analysis of the α<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and β<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> adrenergic receptor density indicated lack of any adaptive effects after 14 days of Cr(III) administration through intraperitoneal injections (doses 6 and 12 mg/kg). The antidepressant activity of chromium(III) indicated in clinical trials concerned patients with atypical, seasonal, or dystonic symptoms. This effect, as it seems based on the presented results, does not depend on direct affinity to serotonin receptors and transporter nor is the result of adaptive changes in the adrenoreceptor system.</jats:p>",

Through coordination mechanisms such as water transfers and regional demand management, water utilities can improve the efficiency of resource allocation and delay the need for new infrastructure investments. Though cooperation provides utilities with the potential for reduced cost strategies for improving the reliability of their services, two important challenges are worthy of careful consideration. First, regional utilities often have to navigate robustness conflicts stemming from potential asymmetries in their risk exposure, demand dynamics, and the availability of supply resources. Second, successful implementation of candidate compromise water portfolios requires that cooperating utilities understand their operational tolerances to deviations from the recommended regional actions (“imperfect implementation”). This study contributes a framework for identifying compromises across regional robustness conflicts and quantifying tolerances to implementation uncertainties. The framework is demonstrated on a system of four interdependent but institutionally independent water utilities in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina that are confronting robustness conflicts given asymmetries in their vulnerabilities to growing demands and hydroclimatic uncertainties. Our findings highlight that seemingly balanced compromise management strategies can yield significant and potentially surprising unintended consequences that could degrade regional cooperation. Moreover, asymmetries in regional robustness can be amplified with modest deviations from their agreed upon actions. Results of this analysis are broadly applicable to water supply regionalization as a global challenge and provide insights for discovering robust compromises and safe operating spaces for multi‐actor water supply systems.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the structure of a park power system with P2G was built. Secondly, a dispatching optimization model for the park power supply system was constructed with a peak regulation compensation mechanism. Finally, the effectiveness of the model was verified by a case study. The case results show that with the integration of P2G and the marketized peak regulation compensation mechanism, preferential power energy storage followed by gas storage had the best effect on the park power supply system, which minimized the clean energy curtailment to 11.18% and the total cost by approximately $120.190 and maximized the net profit by approximately $152.005.</jats:p>"

To preserve the useful qualities of pulp, air with a low temperature is used as a drying agent. To study the interaction of various factors affecting the drying process of beet pulp, mathematical methods are used to plan the experiment. A mathematical description of this process can be obtained empirically. Moreover, his mathematical model has the form of a regression equation, found by statistical methods based on experiments. As a result of statistical processing of the experimental data, regression equations are obtained that adequately describe the drying process of beet pulp in an air dryer.

The results of our analysis indicate significant progress towards universal health coverage (UHC) in Vietnam, with the expansion of health insurance coverage being accompanied by increases in admissions and inpatient days. However, some concerns remain. Our findings show a positive response of supply capacity only in terms of doctors and nurses at higher‐level hospitals (provincial hospitals), and none in other relevant aspects. Moreover, we find no positive response of the number of outpatient visits. Another concern is the issue of financial protection. The decline in out‐of‐pocket payments is not significant throughout our observation period, suggesting that lowering the cost of healthcare is not straightforward and that the expansion of health insurance coverage alone cannot achieve this. We believe that the Vietnamese experience has valuable implications for other emerging and developing countries, considering that the expansion of health insurance coverage is likely to increase utilization of healthcare services significantly and that the supply side needs to be prepared for the increase.</jats:p>",

Green supply chain management (GSCM) has been regarded as an effective tool in China for mitigating the negative effects that firms have on the environment. However, the extent to which GSCM pressures influence GSCM practices, and whether and how GSCM practices affect GSCM performance are topics that remain under‐explored. Combining Institutional Theory, Resource‐Based View (RBV) Theory, and the literature on GSCM, our study sheds light on the relationship among GSCM pressures, practices, and performance under the moderating effect of quick response (QR) technology. Using statistical analysis of the collected data and case studies from companies in China, we establish several results. First, among different GSCM pressures, market and export pressures have significant impacts on GSCM practices, whereas cost pressure does not influence GSCM practices significantly. Second, internal improvement practice exerts a significant impact on GSCM practices, while external improvement practice negatively affects positive economic performance. In addition, ecology practice has significantly influenced environmental, positive economic, and operational performance. Third, QR technology suppresses the positive effect between internal improvement practice and negative economic performance. Two real cases from Huawei (telecommunications technologies) and Beijing Benz Automotive (automobile manufacturing) are conducted to verify the findings and generate additional insights. Our findings contribute to the literature and provide guidance to help governments and companies establish effective and innovative GSCM policies.</jats:p>",

However, the actual functional role of food retail and distribution in the determination of the risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS) has not been studied hitherto. The main aim of this study was to test the effects of food chain length on the prevalence of MetS in a population accustomed to the Mediterranean diet. We conducted an observational study in Southern Italy on individuals adhering to the Mediterranean diet. We examined a total of 407 subjects (41% females) with an average age of 56 ± 14.5 years (as standard deviation) and found that being on the Mediterranean diet with a SSC significantly reduces the prevalence of MetS compared with the LSC (SSC: 19.65%, LSC: 31.46%; p: 0.007).

Endoscopy has seen a significant development over recent years in various medical fields with its application expanding from the support of minimal invasive surgery to in situ imaging. In this context, the application of endoscopic techniques to assess the quality of the regenerated bone in situ in the drill hole before implant placement is an appealing approach. <jats:italic>Aim</jats:italic>. The aim of this study was to use short distance support immersion endoscopy (SD-SIE) to compare the quality of regenerated bone in healed postextraction sites, which are grafted with an in situ hardening <jats:italic>β</jats:italic>-TCP, against ungrafted sites, before implant placement. This assessment was based on microscopic bone analysis in combination with the blood vessel count. <jats:italic>Method</jats:italic>. 13 spontaneously healed and 13 grafted postextraction sites in 3 men and 6 women, aged 26–83 years, were evaluated using SD-SIE after 4–6 months. SD-SIE was applied in drill holes before implant placement, and videos were taken from representative central buccal areas. The video recordings were analyzed using Image J software for (1) number of blood vessels per area (NBV), (2) relative area of vessels (VA), (3) relative area of mineralized bone (MBA), (4) relative area of unmineralized bone (UMBA), and (5) relative area of bone substitute (BSA). <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. The grafted sites showed more (1) NBV as well as (2) VA (8.6 ± 1.1; 2.03 ± 0.28%) than the ungrafted sites (2.5 ± 0.6; 1.18 ± 0.36%) (independent <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>-test; <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>); (3) MBA and (4) UMBA were similar to those in the grafted sites (86.3 ± 2.2 %; 13.7 ± 2.2 %) and to the ungrafted sites (89.5 ± 3.7%; 10.5 ± 3.6%) (independent <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>-test; <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>); and (5) BSA in the grafted sites was 18.2 ± 5.4%. <jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>. SD-SIE is an interesting new approach for in situ assessment of bone quality and blood supply before implant placement.

Exhumed systems that can help to constrain the tectono‐stratigraphic evolution of such systems are rare or complicated by inversion tectonics. Here, we document a mid‐Pleistocene deep‐water syn‐rift system fed by Gilbert‐type fan deltas in the hangingwall of a rift margin fault bounding the West Xylokastro Horst block, on the southern margin of the Gulf of Corinth, Greece. Structural and stratigraphic mapping combined with digital outcrop models permit observations along this syn‐rift depositional system from hinterland source to deep‐water sink. The West Xylokastro Fault hangingwall is filled by two distinct sediment systems; an axial system fed by coarse‐grained sediment gravity flows derived from fault‐tip Gilbert‐type fan deltas and a lateral system dominated by mass transport deposits fed from an evolving fault‐scarp apron. Abrupt changes in stratigraphic architecture across the axial system are interpreted to record changes in relative base level, sediment supply and tectonics. Locally, depositional topography and intra‐basinal structures controlled sediment dispersal patterns, from bed‐scale infilling of local rugose topography above mass transport complexes, to basin‐scale confinement from the fault scarp apron. These acted to generate a temporally and spatially variable, heterogeneous stratigraphic architecture throughout the basin‐fill. The transition of the locus of sedimentation from a rift margin to a fault terrace through the syn‐sedimentary growth of a basinward fault produced regressive surfaces updip, which manifest themselves as channels in the deep‐water realm and acted to prograde the system. We present a new conceptual model that recognises coeval axial and transverse systems based on the stratigraphic architecture around the West Xylokastro fault block that emphasizes the lateral and vertical heterogeneity of rift basin‐fills with multiple entry points.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The frequency of supply chain disruptions is growing. The recent supply chain disruptions and their costs emphasize the need for resilient supply chains. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to investigate interactions between critical antecedents of supply chain resilience including risk management culture, supply chain connectivity, visibility, collaboration, agility, their impact on supply chain resilience, and finally on firm performance. Using the same antecedents and literature support, an empirical model has been proposed. The proposed model has been tested using rigorous statistical analysis such as reliability, convergent, and discriminant validity tests. Partial least squares-structural equation modelling has been used to validate the proposed model and the interdependencies between the critical antecedents. An important finding of this research is that organizations, using the proposed model, can develop and improve supply chain resilience capability by establishing the risk management culture through improving the risk awareness among employees and conducting periodic risk assessment exercises. In addition, the study suggests that organizations trying to achieve supply chain resilience must develop sufficient supply chain connectivity and visibility through adopting information and communications technologies and visibility tools for quick response and recovery from supply chain disruptions. Data collected from the Indian manufacturing sector are used to validate the model. The holistic view presented by the proposed model describes the inter-relationships between critical antecedents to achieve supply chain resilience. Concluding remarks and future research avenues have been presented. </jats:p>",

However, to counter the intermittent nature of solar power and ensure firm power supply, energy storage is essential. This paper presents a comparative analysis of power supply options based on two solar energy technologies - PV and concentrated solar power (CSP). Energy storage in the form of battery and thermal energy respectively has been included and different combinations of supply options, along with utility grid, have been analyzed in terms of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).

Nitrogen removal characteristics and permeation characteristics of two systems were investigated by adjusting influent carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N = 2–20). Results showed that nitrification and denitrification performances were mainly influenced by organic matter and system combination, which further effected the nitrogen removal. When optimal operating parameters were: electrode space of 30 cm, hydraulic load of 1.0 m3/(m2·d) and inlet/reaction time of 1/8 in BRC-MFC system, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and NH4+ removal efficiencies still reached 97.63, 64, and 42.26%, respectively and achieved high removal efficiency of organic matter and nitrogen simultaneously compared to the BRC system. Efficient supply of electron and phylogenetic diversity of bacterial communities in BRC-MFC process was the main reason to achieve deep denitrification removal. After the V3-V4 variable region of 16S rRNA gene was sequenced by the Miseq high-throughput sequencing method, introduction of MFC enhancement technology affected the microbial community structure in the system. The presence of MFC contributed to an increase in community diversity (from 14 to 19 phyla).

To improve the power factor and decrease the inverter capacity, the segmented power supply control methods of the DLFSPM motor are investigated in this study. First, the structure, electromagnetic parameters, and the segmented power supply method of the DLFSPM motor are explored. Then, the mathematical models and the control strategies of the DLFSPM motor are deduced and proposed.

Here, the ESP of the Changsha–Zhuzhou–Xiangtan urban agglomeration was constructed, which made use of the Bayesian network model to dynamically identify the ecological sources. The ecological corridor and ecological strategy points were identified using the minimum cumulative resistance model and circuit theory. The ESP was constructed by combining seven ecological sources, “two horizontal and three vertical” ecological corridors, and 37 ecological strategy points. Our results found spatial decoupling between the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ES) and the degradation in areas with high demand for ES. The ecological sources and ecological corridors of the urban agglomeration were mainly situated in forestlands and water areas. The terrestrial ecological corridor was distributed along the outer periphery of the urban agglomeration, while the aquatic ecological corridor ran from north to south throughout the entire region. The ecological strategic points were mainly concentrated along the boundaries of the built-up area and the intersection between construction land and ecological land. Finally, the ecological sources were found primarily on existing ecological protection zones, which supports the usefulness of machine learning in predicting ecological sources and may provide new insights in developing urban ESP.</jats:p>"

However, considerably low tumor‐targeting efficiency of existing radionuclides and radionuclide‐based nanomedicines limits the efficacy of CR‐induced theranostics (CRIT). It remains a challenge to precisely and efficiently supply CR energy to the tumor site. Here, a “missile‐detonation” strategy is reported, in which a high dose of p‐SCN‐Bn‐deferoxamine‐porphyrin‐PEG nanocomplex (Df‐PPN) is first adminstered as a CR energy receiver/missile to passively target to tumor, and then a low dose of the <jats:sup>89</jats:sup>Zr‐labeled Df‐PPN is administrated as a CR energy donor/detonator, which can be visualized and quantified by Cerenkov energy transfer imaging, positron‐emission tomography, and fluorescence imaging. Based on homologous properties, the colocalization of Df‐PPN and <jats:sup>89</jats:sup>Zr‐Df‐PPN in the tumor site is maximized and efficient CR energy transfer is enabled, which maximizes the tumor‐targeted CRIT efficacy in an optimal spatiotemporal setting while also reducing adverse off‐target effects from CRIT.

Firstly, flow characteristics over a non-eroded bed with a mild slope were investigated. Results show that along the transect line located one diameter away from the boulder centerline, the existence of the boulder has negligible impact on the mean flow characteristics, which are similar to flows over a flat bed. At the boulder centerline, the flow is largely deflected by the boulder and turbulence characteristics in the horizontal plane are largely enhanced in the wake of the boulder. Secondly, water scour experiments were carried out over a steep slope. It could be observed that scour occurred around the boulder and bedloads were deposited downstream, forming a typical pool–riffle sequence. An analysis shows that the length scale (L/D) of geometric features associated with pool depth, riffle height and pool–riffle distance (S/D) are positively related to the boulder-related Froude number (Frb): L/D = 1.18Frb − 0.11 and S/D = 12.5Frb + 0.6; and the erosion volume (Ve) for flat bed and boulder bed is positively and negatively related to the averaged Froude number (Fr): Ve/D3 = 37.1Fr − 21.3 and Ve/D3 = −44.8Fr − 38.6, where D is the boulder diameter.</jats:p>",

The economic analysis of energy supply systems for buildings and industry should include a detailed feasibility analysis and a life cycle perspective. Simulations were performed to quantify the potential savings when the excess of PV energy (surplus) is supposed to be exported to the grid by considering the net metering and net billing approaches. Our objective was to evaluate the electrical demand of a logistics center with pre-design modeling and simulation, and determine the adequate system configurations by considering the life cycle costing (LCC). We established a baseline and three alternative economic scenarios for optimization. Combining the use of TRNSYS 180 Simulation Studio and its optimization library component, GenOp (Generic Optimization Program), we simulated different options of grid energy contracts considering the variable tariffs and the integration with PVs. Based on the LCC, a single-objective optimization (SOO) process was performed. This approach allowed us to envisage possible configurations, reducing up to a quarter of annual grid energy consumption that represents savings of around 21% for the LCC in a timeframe of 20 years, reaching up to 39% when the export of the PV surplus energy is considered. The payback period of investments is below six years for the optimal scenarios.</jats:p>"

Healthcare budget impact analysis in the Russian Federation of providing adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with basic therapy for outpatient treatment.\n\nMaterial and methods. The hypothesis of reducing costs for the treatment of exacerbations of COPD was tested while providing all patients with basic therapy on an outpatient basis. The model calculates the direct medical costs of drug provision and treatment of exacerbations in patients with COPD in the current situation and when all patients with COPD are covered with basic therapy as part of a program of preferential drug provision. The simulation period is 1 year. The analysis does not take into account social losses associated with disability, payment of disability certificates, reduced labor productivity and mortality.\n\nResults. The cost of providing all patients with COPD with the recommended basic drug therapy on an outpatient basis is substantially offset by a decrease in the cost of treating exacerbations: drug costs should increase by 14.1 billion rubles compared with the current situation, while the cost of providing medical care to patients with exacerbations is reduced by 9.7 billion rubles. As a result, the difference in direct medical costs, or the necessary additional investments, is 4.4 billion rubles. The price of drugs used for basic therapy has the greatest impact on the size of the required additional investments.\n\nConclusion. Providing all patients with COPD with the recommended basic drug therapy on an outpatient basis, we can expect a decrease in the number of moderate exacerbations per year by 14.7% and severe exacerbations by 31.2%. Taking into account not only medical, but also socio-economic costs can not only offset additional investments, but also demonstrate significant savings. When implementing a pilot project of preferential drug provision for patients with COPD in a specific region of the Russian Federation, it is possible to reduce the cost of purchasing medicines when forming a municipal order.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Malaysia electricity supply industry (MESI) has gone through a series of reforms and restructuring since it first started at the beginning of the last century. The latest series of reform, known as MESI 1.0 has been ongoing since 2010. The objectives are to achieve secure and reliable supply of energy, to have economically competitive tariffs, to be environmentally sustainable and to improve customer satisfaction/choice. MESI 1.0 is now coming to its end, and in a recent development, the government has announced the commencement of the next series of MESI reform, MESI 2.0. The objectives of MESI 2.0 are to increase the industry efficiency, to future proof the industry, structure, regulations and key processes, and to empower the consumers. MESI 2.0 is obviously the continuation of MESI 1.0. Thus, prior to the start of MESI 2.0, it is important to review the progress and achievements of MESI 1.0 in such a way that enables informed decisions to be made in designing MESI 2.0. This paper therefore presents a review on the progress and achievement of MESI 1.0, focusing on the initiatives undertaken and evaluating the extent to which the objectives of MESI 1.0 have been addressed by the initiatives. Analysis performed on the review results shows that the second objective of having competitive tariffs is mostly addressed by the initiatives whereas more work needs to be done to address the other objectives, particularly on being environmentally sustainable. Liberalization through the unbundling of MESI is also identified as the potential means to achieve the objectives of MESI 2.0. Findings from this study can serve as the reference point in identifying the current state of MESI reform and in determining the way forward for subsequent MESI reforms.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasing the visibility in supply chain network had decrease the risk in industries. However, the current Cross-Time approach for temporal community detection algorithm in the visibility has fix number of communities and lack of operation such as split or merge. Therefore, improving temporal community detection algorithm to represent the relationship in supply chain network for higher visibility is significant. This paper proposed six steps model framework that aim: (1) To construct the nodes and vertices for temporal graph representing the relationship in supply chain network; (2) To propose an enhanced temporal community detection algorithm in graph analytics based on Cross-time approach and (3) To evaluate the enhanced temporal community detection algorithm in graph analytics for representing relationship in supply chain network based on external and internal quality analysis. The proposed framework utilizes the Cross-Time approach for enhancing temporal community detection algorithm. The expected result shows that the Enhanced Temporal Community Detection Algorithm based on Cross Time approach for higher visibility in supply chain network is the major finding when implementing this proposed framework. The impact advances industrialization through efficient supply chain in industry leading to urbanization.</jats:p>"
