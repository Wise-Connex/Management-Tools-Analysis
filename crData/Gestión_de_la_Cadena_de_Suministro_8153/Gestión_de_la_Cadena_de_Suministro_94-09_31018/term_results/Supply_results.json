Seventeen new private companies were created, significant organizational restructuring occurred, and a whole new regulatory framework was established. Most important, at least in so far as England and Wales are concerned, British public policy abandoned the traditional model of the horizontally and vertically integrated utility (i.e. the franchised-monopoly model), and opted instead for experimentation with an approach based upon competition in both electricity generation and retail supply of electricity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reports on two recent surveys carried out by the IFLA Office for\nInternational Lending. The first, in 1991, showed fiction to be the poor\nrelation in interlending. Reasons for this include slight demand, poor\nrepresentation in union catalogues and the association of fiction with\n“frivolous” leisure reading. Nothing seems to be known about\nthe nature of demand for fiction, some of which may be for serious\nresearch. There are several possible systems for access to, and the\nsupply of, fiction for interlending. The second survey, in 1993,\nrevealed that the great majority of countries have no policy on the\ninterlending of fiction. Ideas on a policy were invited though some\nthought that no separate policy was needed. Recommends that any country\ntrying to develop a policy should go about it in a systematic manner,\nstarting with the collection of information on the acquisition of\nfiction and its use, and working out a policy in the light of relevant\nnational legislation and practices and in consultation with\nparticipating libraries. Although most libraries responding to the\nsurvey thought that all fiction should be made available for\ninterlending, the question of what, if any, restrictions should be\nimposed is a key area for consideration.</jats:p>",

It shows that West German control is strong but not all‐encompassing. The small business service offices in the city, however, work predominantly for small and medium‐sized companies in the region and are not engaged by the surviving large economic units controlled by Treuhand or West German and West European enterprises. The massive degree of external control, which characterizes most sectors in East Germany now, limits the market for regional business service establishments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Our aim was to assess whether endotoxemia impairs the ability of the diaphragm to extract O2 and whether this defect leads to a greater dependence of O2 uptake on O2 delivery. In two groups of anesthetized mechanically ventilated dogs, the left hemidiaphragm was vascularly isolated. Diaphragmatic blood flow and cardiac output (CO) were measured simultaneously in all animals. Saline (S group) or Escherichia coli endotoxin (100 mg; E group) was infused intravenously over 60 min. In both groups, CO was reduced in stages by controlled hemorrhage, and systemic and diaphragmatic O2 deliveries and consumptions were measured at each stage to construct the O2 delivery-O2 consumption relationships. In the S group, the average systemic O2 delivery below which O2 uptake became supply dependent was 7.2 ml.kg-1.min-1. At this O2 delivery, systemic O2 extraction ratio (ER) averaged 67.9%, whereas the maximum O2 ER was 91.3%. Critical diaphragmatic O2 delivery and critical and maximum diaphragmatic O2 ER, by comparison, averaged 9.0 ml.kg-1.min-1, 65%, and 81.9%, respectively. Endotoxin infusion raised critical systemic O2 delivery to 16.7 ml.kg-1.min-1 (P &lt; 0.05) and reduced critical and maximum systemic O2 ER to 55.5 and 77% (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. Similarly, critical diaphragmatic O2 delivery in the E group increased to 14.8 ml.kg-1.min-1 (P &lt; 0.05), whereas critical and maximum O2 ER declined to 51.8 and 72.8%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Thus, endotoxemia impairs diaphragmatic O2 extraction. This, in turn, leads to a greater dependence of diaphragmatic O2 uptake on O2 delivery. </jats:p>",

Despite the popularity of FFW as a source of income, careful project design meant that disincentives were largely avoided. In particular, the take‐up of FFW was restricted, by a combination of self‐targeting and community based administrative rationing; and agricultural intensification and diversification were encouraged directly through extension programmes.</jats:p>",

In some animals, ischemia was combined with indirect electrical stimulation at 10 Hz either for 3 x 2 h (strenuous activity) or for 7 x 10-min bouts/day (mild activity). After 2 wk, muscle blood flow and fatigue were measured during 5-min isometric supramaximal twitch contractions at 4 Hz. Terminal arteriole diameters were assessed in TA by intravital microscopy at rest and during contractions. Vascular perfusion pressure in the muscles was estimated from measurements in the carotid and saphenous arteries below the site of ligation. Capillary supply was expressed in TA and EDL as capillary-to-fiber ratio on the basis of histochemical staining for capillaries. Strenuous stimulation of ischemic muscles increased their atrophy, failed to restore blood flow, and actually worsened fatigue. In contrast, mild stimulation improved perfusion pressure, increased capillary-to-fiber ratio in the glycolytic part of TA, restored dilatation of terminal arterioles during muscle contractions, and improved blood flow and muscle fatigue so that they were no longer significantly different from control muscles. Thus, an attenuated intermittent protocol may be indicated in the treatment of muscle ischemia. </jats:p>",

Despite reassertive efforts and lower prices in the arms field, Russian export prospects are questionable, given uncertainties over budgetary investments, lagging technology, and potentially unreliable parts production or supply. West European sales are likely to remain confined to niches, since there still are no single unified European Union production and marketing mechanisms. China, the least predictable supplier, remains on an economic arms sales push. The depressed market for third-tier suppliers seems likely to persist. The global move to restructure defense industries is likely to lead to a shift from overproduction of finished arms, with many dual-use products emerging instead.</jats:p>",

Im ersten Mastabschnitt enthielt das cystinreiche Basisfutter 0.26 % Cystin und 0.18 % Methionin und das cystinarme Basisfutter 0.18% Cystin und 0.26% Methionin. Im zweiten Mastabschnitt betrugen die Cystin/Methionin‐Anteile 0.21/0.18 bzw. 0.17/0.24.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It was hypothesized that the exercise-induced changes in glucoregulatory hormones and glucose production (Ra) occur as a result of a small deficit in glucose availability. To test this, 18-h fasted dogs performed 150 min of treadmill exercise with either the liver as the sole source of glucose (controls, n = 5) or with glucose infused from 0 to 50 min (period 1) and from 100 to 150 min (period 3) at rates designed to track the glucose utilization (Rd) response (ExoGlc, n = 5). The liver alone supplied glucose from 50 to 100 min (period 2). Isotopic and arteriovenous methods were used to assess Ra, Rd, and gluconeogenesis (GNG). Variable [3H]glucose infusion and frequent sampling were used to facilitate Ra measurements. Arterial glucose declined by -3.1 +/- 1.4, -4.3 +/- 2.9, and -6.4 +/- 3.7 mg/dl in periods 1-3 in controls (changes are mean values during each of the 50-min periods; P &lt; 0.05). In ExoGlc, arterial glucose did not deviate from basal in periods 1 (+0.1 +/- 1.8 mg/dl) and 3 (+1.5 +/- 4.5 mg/dl) but fell from basal (P &lt; 0.05) by the same amount as controls in period 2 (-5.7 +/- 2.1 mg/dl). Matching the Rd response with exogenous glucose led to increases in arterial and portal vein plasma insulin levels (P &lt; 0.05) but did not affect glucagon, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol levels. Ra was elevated by 3.1 +/- 0.5, 4.0 +/- 1.1, and 4.7 +/- 1.1 mg.kg-1.min-1 in periods 1-3 in controls (P &lt; 0.05). In ExoGlc, Ra rose by 0.0 +/- 0.4, 4.1 +/- 1.4 (P &lt; 0.05), and 0.4 +/- 0.7 mg.kg-1.min-1, respectively, in periods 1-3. The rise in Ra was reduced in periods 1 and 3 of ExoGlc compared with controls (P &lt; 0.02). GNG rose to approximately 250% basal in controls and did not respond with any significant difference in ExoGlc. In summary, the exercise-induced increases in counterregulatory hormones and GNG are present even when a deficit in glucose supply is eliminated by an exogenous glucose infusion. In contrast, the fall in insulin and the rise in hepatic glycogenolysis are greatly attenuated. The regulatory components affected by exogenous glucose predominate at the liver as deviations in plasma glucose of approximately 4% correspond to approximately 60% changes in Ra.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </jats:p>",
