      "abstract": "<jats:p> We analyze a planning model for a firm or public organization that needs to cover uncertain demand for a given item by procuring supplies from multiple sources. The necessity to employ multiple suppliers arises from the fact that when an order is placed with any of the suppliers, only a random fraction of the order size is usable. The model considers a single demand season with a given demand distribution, where all supplies need to be ordered simultaneously before the start of the season. The suppliers differ from one another in terms of their yield distributions, their procurement costs, and capacity levels. </jats:p><jats:p> The planning model determines which of the potential suppliers are to be retained and what size order is to be placed with each. We consider two versions of the planning model: in the first, the service constraint model (SCM), the orders must be such that the available supply of usable units covers the random demand during the season with (at least) a given probability. In the second version of the model, the total cost model (TCM), the orders are determined so as to minimize the aggregate of procurement costs and end-of-the-season inventory and shortage costs. In the classical inventory model with a single, fully reliable supplier, these two models are known to be equivalent, but the equivalency breaks down under multiple suppliers with unreliable yields. </jats:p><jats:p> For both the service constraint and total cost models, we develop a highly efficient procedure that generates the optimal set of suppliers as well as the optimal orders to be assigned to each. Most importantly, these procedures generate a variety of important qualitative insights, for example, regarding which sets of suppliers allow for a feasible solution, both when they have ample supply and when they are capacitated, and how various model parameters influence the selected set of suppliers, the aggregate order size, and the optimal cost values. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increased competition in the global market place has forced companies to seek better products and services, with lower cost and in a market suitable time. According to the holonic manufacturing paradigm, those requirements could be achieved if a reconfigurable enterprise were developed from autonomous and intelligent agents that dynamically interact with each other. This system should be able to automatically organize itself in such a way that its functions were arranged to achieve the finest performance. But if this system was really effective and proactive, it should search for functionalities beyond its own boundaries; it could obtain better competitive edges if it were gathering external partners that do some tasks in better ways than it ordinarily does by itself. Hence, the virtual supply chain, in its sense of distributed enterprises aggregation, can be a natural result of holonic manufacturing systems. This paper illustrates the advantages of using holonic concepts in the virtual supply chain realm through the self-organization of dynamic systems, exploring the holonic paradigm as a catalyst to enable this aggregation. Hence holonic manufacturing models will be seen as important references to virtual supply chains</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Land cover within eight drinking water catchments in Sarawak was classified into six categories using satellite imagery and GIS. The categories represented varying levels of vegetation modification from largely undisturbed or mature secondary vegetation (Category 1) through to bare, non-vegetated areas (Category 6). Rivers less than ∼10 m in width were usually ‘invisible’ on satellite images because of dense canopy cover. More than 70% of headwaters in all catchments, except one (Buri Bakong), were not visible, indicating the presence of dense riparian vegetation. For the river sections that were visible on satellite images, 5%–22% of the riparian buffer was highly degraded (completely lacking vegetation). The highest degree of riparian modification occurred in the lowlands, the midland catchment of Tingkas and the highland catchment of Trusan. Although Sarawak government policy requires buffer widths of 5–50 m of natural vegetation to be retained along all streams and rivers in drinking water supply catchments these guidelines were not met at nine of the eleven field sites surveyed. These results suggest that compliance with buffer guidelines is important to water quality in rivers, particularly in logging areas, oil palm plantations and near settlements.</jats:p>",

I use the model to guide a quantitative assessment of the determinants of crime and of a counterfactual experiment in which an income redistribution policy is thought of as an alternative to greater law enforcement. The model economy considered in this paper is populated by heterogeneous agents who live for a realistic number of periods, have preferences over consumption and leisure, and differ in terms of their age, their skills as well as their employment shocks. In addition, savings may be precautionary and allow partial insurance against the labor income shocks. Because of the lack of full insurance, this model generates an endogenous distribution of wealth across consumers, enabling us to assess the welfare implications of the redistribution policy experiment. I calibrated the model using the U.S. data for 1980 and then used the model to investigate the changes in criminality between 1980 and 1996. The main results of this study are: 1) Law enforcement policy was the the most important factor behind the fall in criminality in the period, while the increase in inequality was the most important single factor promoting crime; 2) Stigmatization is not a free-cost crime control policy; 3) Income redistribution can be a powerful alternative policy to fight crime.</jats:p>"

We argue that this problem relates to two aspects ‐ the cognition and expression of SCR. The paper considers SCR as a unification of a fuzzy and random meaning in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, intrinsic relationship between the theoretical foundation of SCR evaluation and the cloud theory is discovered, accordingly to which, the cloud theory is applied to study the evaluation of SCR from a holistic perspective. According to the comprehensive invalidation degree of a supply chain, SCR is differentiated as six grades and the influencing factors of SCR are classified taking into account __ve aspects. A comprehensive performance model is developed to measure five aspects of influencing factors and to evaluate the exact class SCR belongs to. As we know, the cognition of SCR depends on human mind while the natural language is an appropriate medium to express human mind. Therefore, linguistic terms are adopted to express uncertain transformation between qualitative concepts and their corresponding quantitative values. This method is further demonstrated using a numerical example.</jats:p>",

The research was carried out on a representative part of the water supply system of Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, i.e. on a District Metered Area (DMA), using the log-linear analysis of frequency tables. The first influential factor that was analyzed was the condition of pressure regulation. The DMA was observed in the period when the system was not in the condition of pressure regulation (January 2005–March 2006) and in the period when the system was in the condition of pressure regulation (March 2006–September 2008). Other influential factors that were included into the analysis were the diameter, the material and the age of pipes. In addition to the main goal established in this general way, a specific goal related to the condition of regulation in interaction with remaining influential factors was also set. Using the log-linear analysis, general results about the influence of the interaction between observed factors were obtained. The specific goal was reached by conclusions made about the effect of the relation between the DMA condition of regulation and remaining influential factors, i.e. diameter, material and age of pipes on the frequency of pipeline failures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, people are interested in nanoscale materials (less than 100 nm in size), since their properties are different from those of large scale molecules of the same material due to their greater surface area. This paper deals with a novel, effective and low cost technique for defluoridation of water using nanotechnology. Nanocrystalline calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate powder have been prepared through combustion route using calcium nitrate and sodium hydroxide. The combustion-derived nano calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate powders have been characterized by using XRD and SEM. The powder X Ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern confirms the crystallanity and phase purity. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) reveal the powder is an agglomeration of fine particles. The particle size of the powder is found to be in the range of 12–20 nm with a large surface area. The synthesized nano calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate powder is used for defluoridation of water samples with stirring time (1 hr–16 hrs), adsorbent quantity (3–50 mg/L) and pH (6–9) as experimental parameters. It is found that fluoride levels could be removed by using 50 mg of nano powder from 20 mg/L of 1litre standard sodium fluoride solution. In this technique, 90% minimization of sludge could be achieved.</jats:p>",

Then an experimental approach is suggested to be implemented as an alternative methodology to deal with the issue, instead of the analytical method in use. The results obtained are used to justify the adequacy of the experimental approach to the modern call centers operation, as long as it is possible to have the model closer to reality.

In this study, photolysis of chlorine and bromine was explored in buffer and simulated natural water solutions under low-pressure UV (LPUV) and medium-pressure UV (MPUV) lamps. At pH 6.5 and 8.5, the quantum yields of bromine photolysis were 3.8 and 0.6 for MPUV, and 4.4 and 0.8 for LPUV, respectively. At pH 6.5, the photolysis of bromine was faster than that of chlorine under either MPUV or LPUV source, while at a higher pH of 8.5, the contrary was found. For all conditions tested, the presence of bromide did not significantly change the observed photolysis rate of total free halogen during the UV/chlorine process in the presence or absence of natural organic matter. Upon UV irradiation, chlorine always produces higher ∙OH concentration than bromine does. The presence of bromide results in considerable decrease of ∙OH concentration at pH 6.5, compared to that obtained from the UV/chlorine process in the absence of bromide.</jats:p>",

The performance of polyethersulfone membranes with nominal molecular weight cut-off of 1 kDa, 5 kDa and 50 kDa was examined for isolation of low and high molecular weight compounds in fresh and estuarine waters with diverse physico-chemical properties. Detailed protocols for operating the TFF- system and for membrane cleaning are proposed. The ultrafiltration membranes can be efficiently cleaned to provide low carbon blanks (&amp;lt;0.09 mg/l). Standard colloid tests confirmed that the higher molecular weight compounds were isolated in the retentate and the lower molecular weight compounds remain in the permeate. Mass balance of fractionated natural samples showed good recoveries for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (99±13% (1 kDa); 103±20% (5 kDa); 94±14% (50 kDa) (n=9). Moreover, high ionic strength or high DOC content did not enhance either fouling or contamination of the membrane. These findings demonstrate that the PALL TFF system is reliable for natural organic colloids fractionation in aquatic systems across both salinity and DOC gradients.</jats:p>",

Information on the price and income elasticities of residential water demand is crucial for effective management of water demand. We carried out this empirical analysis using several panel-data models. The analysis is based on data provided by the urban municipalities, in which the number of the end-users connected to water supply networks exceeded 50,000. We focused on the larger cities to obtain sample homogeneity in terms of the access to water supply and sewage collection systems, as well as the income structure. We found that the indicators of price elasticity of residential water demand in Poland are similar to those being known from the relevant surveys conducted in Western Europe. However, the income elasticity is smaller in absolute terms when compared to that in countries with more developed economies. Based on the results obtained, our prediction is that the decreasing trend of individual water consumption in Poland will slow down in the next few years. Our study is one of the first to investigate the price and income elasticities of water demand in Poland, and also one of the first such ones carried out for economies in transition.</jats:p>",

This is used to develop a conceptual model of the use of social capital in a service supply chain setting.Findings - Social capital is proposed to improve the operational performance of service firms as a source of both physical and information resources. The impact of social capital is projected to vary by firm size and service type. Small firms have limited resources and thus a need for resources obtained through social capital. Service firms that have high customization and customer contact are subject to process variations which can be mitigated by social capital. A conceptual model is presented to test several propositions related to social capital.Originality/value The impact of social capital has not been widely studied in an operational setting. This is the first known study to specifically analyze the impact of social capital in service supply chains.</jats:p>"

We also sought to identify and measure the effects of other relevant inefficiency factors. A translog profit frontier function with an inefficiency module was estimated using a panel of 2,265 observations of 385 active Norwegian forest owners for 1991–2004. We found that profit efficiency decreases as the revenues from timber sales fall relative to agricultural or wage income. Other factors decreasing the efficiency were logging distance (beyond what can be explained by logging costs), fragmentation of the forest property, and time. Factors increasing profit efficiency were experience (age), information (possession of a management plan), and geographical location (centrality). On the basis of our results we make recommendations on how forest owners can improve their profit efficiency. We also suggest further developing and streamlining contract regimens as policy instruments for promoting efficiency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This contribution presents part of the work that had been done to develop the water resources in Wadi Naman east of Makkah City to form a strategic water reserve for the city of Makkah and the nearby holy shrines. The aim of the strategic water reserve is to be used as water supply in emergencies when the desalination plant or the pipelines from the desalination plant to the city have to be out of the service for a considerable amount of time due to planned or unplanned shutdowns. The development plan calls for a constructing of a subsurface dam across the Wadi at a prescribed location. The proposed subsurface dam will extend from 3 m below the natural ground surface to a depth of 2–3 metres inside solid bedrock. The suggested dam may be constructed using plain plastic concrete and utilizing the diaphragm wall technique for construction. The crest of the subsurface dam can serve as a buried spillway to convey access water downstream and the overflow freeboard will provide a room for utilities that passes through the wadi to serve cities and villages upstream. The alluvium thickness upstream of the proposed dam location is ranging from 20–70 m and the total volume of the alluvium behind the dam that can store water is 218 × 106 m3. Pumping test revealed that the transmissivity is 1,376 m2/day and the yield storage coefficient is 0.15. The safe water yield that can be stored in the alluvium behind the dam due to natural recharge of 6.53 × 106 m3/year and interception of the groundwater flow by the dam can reach an amount of 32.7 million cubic metres of water in a period of about 5 years from the date of completion of the dam. This amount of water can serve the city and the nearby holy shrines for a period of up to four months with a good demand management program. However, to maintain the desired levels of water quality and quantity in the reservoir and to minimize the adverse effect of the dam on the downstream area a very strict management program of the basin has to be followed. This management program can be used to control the urban and rural development in the area upstream of the dam and enhancing artificial and natural recharge in the upstream and downstream sides of the dam.</jats:p>",

The results showed that formation of HAAs after chlorination is a fast process. Owing to the presence of fairly high organic precursors in the raw water, a large amount of HAAs (up to 80 μg/L in summer) was formed after addition of the pre-chlorine, and only a small portion of the HAAs was removed during the coagulation, flotation, and rapid filtration units. However, more than 80% of HAAs were removed in slow sand filtration (SSF) unit. Laboratory batch filtration tests showed that the HAAs can not be effectively removed by conventional coagulation and filtration treatments. However, the HAAs in water was effectively removed by biodegradation in batch biodegradation tests using filter sands taken from the top of the SSF unit in Tai Lake WTP. For comparison with the results obtained in batch experiments, simulated SSF systems were also installed in laboratory to evaluate the effects of biodegradation for HAAs removal in filter columns. Results of parallel laboratory SSF column tests showed that HAAs was quickly degraded when the simulated SSFs have been operated for a suitable time to allow the microbial growth on the sand surface. In both batch and simulated SSF biodegradation treatments, the biodegradation rates for HAAs decreased as the number of halogen atoms increased. The results in this study demonstrated that biological degradation is the major mechanism responsible for HAAs removal in the SSF units.</jats:p>",

We investigate the performance of three commonly studied supply chain contracting mechanisms: the wholesale price contract, the buyback contract, and the revenue-sharing contract. The simplified setting we consider utilizes a two-echelon supply chain in which the retailer faces the newsvendor problem, the supplier has no capacity constraints, and delivery occurs instantaneously. We compare the three mechanisms in a laboratory setting using a novel design that fully controls for strategic interactions between the retailer and the supplier. Results indicate that although the buyback and revenue-sharing contracts improve supply chain efficiency relative to the wholesale price contract, the improvement is smaller than the theory predicts. We also find that although the buyback and revenue-sharing contracts are mathematically equivalent, they do not generally result in equivalent supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

With greater emphasis being placed on energy efficiency, membrane distillation coupled with waste heat or solar heat sources to drive the process is being reconsidered. In particular, the use of membrane distillation to treat brine concentrates is receiving renewed attention, as it results in increased water recovery and lower brine discharges, and high salt concentrations do not increase the driving force requirements for membrane distillation. In this paper, four different membranes, one made of polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) and three made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) of different pore sizes, were assessed the performance in membrane distillation under different hot feed flow rates and inlet temperatures. The results show that the PTFE membranes had a much higher flux than that of PVDF at the same operational conditions, and PTFE membranes of large pore size produced higher flux than that of the small pore size. The results also showed that increasing the flow rate of the hot feed and its inlet temperature increased the flux, but the rates of increase decreased with increasing flow rate and inlet feed temperature.</jats:p>",

Because mortality during the pelagic stage is thought to be high and density independent, larval abundance and traits of individual larvae should have strong effects on overall population dynamics in marine organisms. Surprisingly, few experiments have tested how localized interactions among breeding adults affect the quantity and phenotypic traits of larvae they produce. Here I experimentally test for the influence of food competition, mate limitation, and population density on somatic growth, fecundity, and offspring provisioning (larval length and energy reserves) in a planktivorous, territorial coral reef damselfish, <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Stegastes partitus</jats:named-content>. I manipulated food supply and adult <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">S. partitus</jats:named-content> density on isolated patch reefs in the Bahamas and also made behavioral observations of <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">S. partitus</jats:named-content> occurring on nearby natural reefs at a range of population densities. On the experimental reefs, females experienced density‐dependent growth and fecundity; male reproductive success was density dependent, but male growth was not. Density‐dependent growth and reproduction were not moderated by food supplementation, and density‐dependent reproduction was not influenced by mate availability. On natural reefs, the frequency of aggressive interactions, particularly involving females, increased with population density, implicating aggression‐related energetic costs as the source of both forms of density dependence in the experiments. Food supplementation increased female somatic growth and larval energy reserves, suggesting that females allocated surplus energy to future reproductive potential and enhanced offspring quality. Neither experimental treatment affected larval length. By altering patterns of reproduction, the interplay between spatial variation in food availability and population density may drive population dynamics in a broad range of benthic marine organisms.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Chloramine decays in distribution system due to wall and bulk water reactions. In bulk water, the decay could either be due to chemical or microbiological reactions. Without such distinction it is not possible to model chloramine decay in an actual distribution system since microbiological decay depends on different factors compared with chemical decay. The dependence of chloramine decay on chemical reactions is mostly understood. Although it is widely accepted that microbiological reactions could accelerate chloramine decay, quantification had not been possible until the microbiological decay factor method was proposed. In this paper, the effect of temperature on microbial and chemical decay coefficients is presented. This was done by following the procedure of the microbiological decay factor method but by varying the temperature of incubation between 18 and 30°C. The procedure was repeated for several samples. The results indicated that it is possible to express temperature dependence of both microbiological and chemical coefficients using the Arrhenius equation within the tested temperature range. Estimated E/R values were found to be 3,551±705 K−1 and 6,924±1,700 K−1 for chemical and microbiological decay rates respectively. Traditionally, it is believed that every 10°C rise would double the decay rate coefficients. However, the E/R value estimated in this study shows that a 16–17°C temperature rise is needed to double the chemical chloramine decay rate. A possible application to predict residuals in summer using winter water quality results is demonstrated. Results indicated that microbial decay factor method could help pre-warning water utilities of possible residual loss in summer. Traditional indicators could not offer such distinction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, ozonation installations in French drinking water treatment plants are operated in order to ensure an ozone residual of 0.4 mg/L at the outlet of the contactor with a contact time of 4 minutes which guarantee, with regards to the USEPA tables, a 4 log virus inactivation. Veolia Water has launched a thorough study concerning hydraulics in ozonation contactors which goals are (1) to reach the disinfection level desired through a better supervision of operating conditions, (2) to guarantee good hydraulic performances to reduce ozone production and ozonation-by products (bromates). The validation of these objectives is related to a relevant control of every ozonation tank with a Ct criteria considering from now their geometry, which condition their hydraulic efficiency. In comparison with CSTR method, the Ct10 method has been judged as the most relevant. Veolia is working with such a tank control, which definitely requires the determination of its hydraulic efficiency. Considering that numerical modelling of the ozonation contactors will be very long and expensive, the project team is working on the determination of an analytical model expression for hydraulic efficiency. The objective is to create an innovative tool which enables plant operators themselves to easily determine the hydraulic efficiency of inter or post ozonation tank.</jats:p>",

The efficiency of the different processes (photolysis, Vacuum UV (V-UV) and photocatalysis) within the photoreactor was investigated using para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) which is a good probe for hydroxyl radicals. The effect of pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total inorganic carbon (TIC) was also studied. V-UV was found to be the most efficient process for pCBA degradation within this unit. No photocatalytic degradation was observed. The water quality largely affected the efficiency of the system. Indeed, both DOC and TIC lowered the hydroxyl radical concentration in the system, but DOC did it to a larger extent. Atrazine and sulfamethoxazole, were successfully degraded, and as for pCBA, V-UV was the most efficient process. Sulfamethoxazole displayed a better removal by photocatalysis than atrazine and pCBA. In addition, there was a larger contribution of photolysis during the degradation of sulfamethoxazole than of atrazine. The UV254 nm absorbance of the water affected the photolysis of sulfamethoxazole which has a high molar extinction coefficient and quantum yield at 254 nm, while the DOC is mainly competing with the pollutants for the hydroxyl radicals.</jats:p>",

The ability of developed Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) bark carbon as an adsorbent for Cr(VI) removal from synthetic sample was studied. The experiments were done in the batch process. Effects of adsorbent quantity, pH, contact time, initial Cr(VI) concentration and agitation rate were investigated on removal of chromium(VI). Approximately 95% of hexavalent chromium (10 mg L−1) was removed at pH 3 within 21 hours at 150 rpm and the concentration reached upto permissible limit recommended by standard agencies. The results indicate that the Langmuir model fits the data better than the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model. The adsorption follows second order kinetics for Cr(VI) removal in this study. The maximum adsorption capacity of 23 mg g−1 was found for the Cr(VI) adsorption. Characterization of the developed adsorbent was performed by SEM and EDX analysis and the results of the characterization supported surface nature and composition of the adsorbent.</jats:p>",

It was found that the degradation of geosmin and MIB followed similar pseudo-first-order kinetics with reaction rate constants being approximately 0.025 min−1 for typical geosmin and MIB concentrations of 250 and 500 ng/L. The normalised formal quantum efficiency was calculated to be in the range of 162–182 L/mol. Influence of additives (i.e. sodium bicarbonate and alcohols) on the degradation process was also investigated. It was found that there was a small reduction in the degradation rate constants of geosmin and MIB with increasing sodium bicarbonate concentration. At 50 mg/L sodium bicarbonate the degradation rate constants decreased by approximately 5%. Similarly, for methanol and ethanol concentrations up to 35 and 50 mg/L, respectively, these constants were found to also decrease. While addition of sodium bicarbonate and alcohols was seen to have relatively small negative effects on the photocatalytic degradation performance, the magnitude of their influence was consistent with the hypothesis that the degradation mechanism of geosmin and MIB was predominately that of attack involving HO∙ radicals.</jats:p>",

The methodology is then applied to a typical conventional waterworks to assess the potential of the waterworks to comply with the standard for turbidity and formulate effective strategies for turbidity control. Coagulation and filtration are found to be the CCPs to improve the performance of the waterworks in turbidity compliance, while source water and sedimentation are the quality control points (QCPs). CLs for the CCPs and QCPs are also quantitatively determined, based on which requirements for monitoring system and corrective actions are proposed.</jats:p>",

In close cooperation with fire brigades the conventional fire flow requirements were challenged. Based on modern building codes, it proved possible to reduce the capacity of fire-hydrants to 8.3 l/s (30 m3/h) in newly built areas. Six years after the introduction of the velocity criterion the characteristics of the newly laid networks have changed resulting in smaller diameter pipes and reduced length of networks. The amount of 100/110 mm pipes have dropped from 55% of the total length to 45% of total length. The total investment costs for new networks have dropped by 20% in the Netherlands.</jats:p>",

In total, 73 different products were available from pharmacies, most of which (50) were claimed by manufacturers to be appetite suppressants. Seventy-eight pharmacists were interviewed, of whom 57 stocked OTC weight-loss products. Of these 57, only two claimed to undertake any measurements before supplying the products and 33 had no supporting materials/information about the products, although 38 claimed to provide advice. None of the 57 pharmacists had undertaken any specific training in relation to weight loss. Only 44% of all those interviewed considered OTC weight-loss products to be useful, with even fewer (35%) considering them to be safe.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Community pharmacies are a major distributor of OTC weight-loss products, despite the lack of evidence of their efficacy and concerns about their safety. Many pharmacists had limited knowledge of the products, placed few restrictions on their supply and viewed training in weight loss as unnecessary. Pharmacists should consider the appropriateness of supplying these products and utilize the opportunities presented to support weight reduction by more effective means.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper proposes a leakage detection method based on detecting significant discrepancies between pressure measurements and their estimations obtained from the simulation of a calibrated water distribution network model. Every sensor in the network will allow to detect a discrepancy in pressure due to leakage depending on its location. Then, a set of well distributed pressure sensors will generate a leakage signature that allows leakage localisation. This paper presents the methodology used in the Barcelona network for distributing properly the sensors for a good discrimination in the leakage localisation process. The methodology for sensor placement uses the pressure sensitivity matrix to the leakage presence. This matrix is normalised and binarised in order to be used as a leakage signature matrix using the standard model based fault diagnosis approach. Sensors may be installed in any node and leakages are simulated as a constant demand that can appear in any node too. The problem of deciding which are the best localisations for a small number of sensors in order to detect and localise leakages is an inverse problem that should be solved using optimisation. The resulting optimisation problem is of discrete nature and very huge for a real network. This type of problem is, in general, hard to solve and very time consuming. The use of GA (Genetic Algorithms) has been proved adequate according to the formulation of the signatures in the sensitivity matrix.</jats:p>",

The survey data, collected in 1999 from 3,051 Finnish forest owners, includes information on objectives for ownership as well as annual harvest volumes between 1994 and 1998. Ownership objectives are identified using principal component analysis, and five forest ownership objective groups are generated using K-means clustering: multiobjective owners, investors, self-employed owners, recreationists, and indifferent owners. Along with stumpage price, reforestation costs and forest and owner characteristics, including the above objective groups, are used as explanatory variables in estimating the supply equation. A consistent estimation method allowing for heteroscedasticity and non-normality is used. Statistically significant elasticity of the unconditional mean harvest with respect to timber price is 1.3. Recreationists and indifferent forest owners, ceteris paribus, harvest about 2 m3/ha/year less than multiobjective owners and self-employed owners, whereas investors and indifferent owners are more price-responsive than the other groups.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the launching of the WTO, the environment of world trade is presently moving toward realizing complete trade liberalism. Under the GATT, only the direct subsidy was regulated for export and the domestic subsidy directly unrelated to export was not explicitly regulated. The reason for regulation on subsidies is that export subsidy brings about unfair result from the position of competing countries because it enables even inherently uncompetitive products to be exported by artificially changing the structure of comparative advantage formed in the marketplace. In contrast, domestic subsidy did not become the object of alertness because the effect of its trade distortion was not only theoretically obviously identified but did not empirically as the concrete reality.\r\nThis subsidy, as one of the means for realizing national policy, is widely delivered in a diversity of forms such as provision of subsidies in a narrow sense, tax benefit measures, low-interest loans, export credit, and so on. If this is seen by objective, there are ① export subsidy for encouraging export, ② subsidy for encouraging the use of the particular industry at home, ③ structural adjustment subsidy intended for the industry losing competitiveness, ④ regional subsidy for activating underdeveloped areas, and ⑤ subsidy to promote research and development that is provided its basis principle as the regulation on subsidy. The Agreement on Interpretation and Application of Articles3 6, 16, and 23 of GATT was enacted in the Tokyo Round.\r\nThe WTO's Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures defines the subsidy as the provision of funds by government(financial contribution) or provides that government shall provide support in a form of price and income support stipulated in Article 16 of GATT Agreement and it should consequently provide the beneficiary with benefits. Accordingly, the kinds of subsidies which were conventionally divided into export subsidy and domestic subsidy are now divided into prohibited subsidy, actionable subsidy and non-actionable subsidy on the basis of both the effect of subsidy on trade and specificity.\r\nThe prohibited subsidy includes the subsidy provided with export performance and subsidy provided for the use of domestic goods instead of imported products, and its use is overall prohibited. The actionable subsidy is governmental assistance that has the specificity that it is provided for the particular area, industry and enterprise or exerts a long-term influence on export and import and thus damages in other countries. But the actionable subsidy is not prohibited, but the countervailing duty may be imposed on it or retaliation may be provided for it.\r\nThese two kinds of subsidies are generally called the subsidies subject to regulation. The non-actionable subsidy is referred to as either governmental assistance used with an allowable aim of R&amp;D, regional development, environmental protection and so on thought it may have specificity or governmental assistance without any specificity.\r\nIt is reasoned that the Agreement on these subsidies will exert a tremendous influence on economy in underdeveloped countries, including Korea. The reason is that government's subsidy has had great influences in the process of national economic growth. Because the agreement provides that subsidies shall be restricted on the basis of the recognition that government subsidies artificially distort export competitiveness and impair fair competition between countries, industrial support through governmental assistance policy has arrived at a difficult situation.\r\nUnder the WTO, the development of export insurance as a means of export promotion policy is a important indirect method.</jats:p>",

In this paper a characterisation methodology for the sectors is presented. This methodology is based on the knowledge provided by the company but has been analysed using clustering techniques. The main objective of the classification was to give a scope of the different types of sectors present in the network. A decision table based on the relevant descriptors was built.

The FeOx-30 catalyst exhibited excellent performance as a catalyst for the oxidation of Mn2 + . About 95% and 30% of the manganese species were immobilized on FeOx-30 and silica sand in FBR, respectively. The oxidation rates of Fe2 +  and Mn2 +  and the immobilization efficiencies of iron and manganese oxides strongly depend on pH value. Usually during oxidization the pH values of the solution containing Fe2 +  must be above 7, and Mn2 +  must be above 9. During this study, large amounts of iron species leached from the surface of FeOx-30 only when manganese was in the system. The surface of the FeOx-30 became fragile in a single system. However, the removal of iron and manganese species simultaneously was better than only the removal of manganese in an FBR. In the binary system, the optimum pH condition for immobilization of both iron and manganese species was pHi 9. The higher catalyst loading in the binary system led to a higher removal efficiency of iron and manganese.</jats:p>",

Consequently, arsenic levels in many water supply sources have become critical.

This becomes a very sensitive issue in the context of water scarcity and climate change, given the expected increasing demand on groundwater sources. This work presents a case study that describes the development of low-cost techniques for efficient arsenic control in drinking water. The results obtained at the Manteigas WTP (Portugal) demonstrate the successful implementation of an effective and flexible process of reactive filtration using iron oxide.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) is a high nutrient–low chlorophyll region of the ocean. Downcore nitrogen isotope records from the EEP have been previously interpreted as a direct reflection of changes in nutrient consumption. However, the observed changes in sedimentary <jats:italic>δ</jats:italic><jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N since the last glacial maximum have no coherent relationship with export productivity or an inferred variation in the iron‐to‐nitrate ratio of the surface waters. Rather, downcore N isotope records in the EEP strongly resemble changes in the extent of water column denitrification as recorded in nearby sedimentary <jats:italic>δ</jats:italic><jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N records along the western margin of the Americas. This similarity is attributed to the overprinting of the N isotopic composition of nitrate in the EEP through the advection of nitrate westward from the margins in the subsurface. A local nitrogen isotope record of changes in the degree of nutrient consumption is extracted from the bulk sedimentary record by subtracting two different sedimentary <jats:italic>δ</jats:italic><jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N records of denitrification changes from two new EEP <jats:italic>δ</jats:italic><jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N records (TR163‐22 and ODP Site 1240). The denitrification records used are from 1) the Central American margin (ODP Site 1242) and 2) the South American margin (GeoB7139‐2). The degree of consumption in the surface waters declines rapidly from elevated values during the last glacial maximum to a pair of minima around 15 and 11–13 ka, and finally it increases into the Holocene. The derived EEP nitrogen isotope record indicates that the regional peak in export productivity occurred when the supply of nutrients exceeded the apparently high demand. The influx of nutrients during the deglaciation is attributed to the resumption of intense overturning in the Southern Ocean and the release of sequestered CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and nutrient‐rich, O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> poor waters from the deep ocean. This has important implications for understanding the glacial‐interglacial scale variation in intermediate water suboxia and water column denitrification.</jats:p>",

This paper develops the mathematical models to calculate the depth of sand filter and water velocity in operating the proposed BSF especially to remove organic and suspended matter simultaneously. Parameters in the equations are all physically meaningful, experimental data validation shows the equations remained accurate.

It offers a scientific interpretation of the indigenous technology applied to the systems, which facilitates to use the same channel network for irrigation, drainage and flood management. The flood management technology of the farmers by diverting as much discharge as possible to the field channels results in the reduction of discharge towards the downstream part of the main channel. It is depicted in the simulation study that uses the river analysis program HEC-RAS 4.0. A cascade of weirs is found to be the most cost effective and user-friendly option to upgrade these systems preserving the existing irrigation, drainage as well as flood management functions. This study suggests that the conventional irrigation design principles should be applied very cautiously with full knowledge of the existing socio-institutional setting, hydro-ecological regime and indigenous technology for upgrading any traditional irrigation system successfully. The indigenous flood management technology strengthens the emerging concept that the floods in the Ganges plain are to be managed, not controlled.</jats:p>",

Our approach distinguishes itself by improving problem-solving efficiency based on a diverse set of algorithms without complicated synthesis efforts, removing the focus from agent communication and coordination details, and improving reusability, flexibility and extensibility by supporting object-oriented and component-based programming style.

When employed correctly, water mains cleaning can be effective in removing loosely deposited sediments and bio-films that cause water discolouration, coliform regrowth and unpalatable tastes and odours. Despite its long history in the water industry, water supply practitioners continue to use highly subjective mechanisms to identify when, where and how much to spend on their mains cleaning programs. This paper discusses the benefits of using the Resuspension Potential Method, an objective means of planning and implementing mains cleaning, to achieve an optimum outcome for both the water company and its customers. Since 2005, Yarra Valley Water has undertaken Resuspension Potential Method measurements in 13 of its water quality zones to gain a better understanding of sediment accumulation rate in the zones over time. Ultimately the information will be used for more effective planning and proactive implementation of the mains cleaning programme.</jats:p>",

Social communication approach occurs  in the form of social advocacy in the policy-making processes so that  the policy becomes more sensitive to the needs of the local people. It  is expected that by doing so the policy will be supportive to the need  of local people. This article is to analyze the development of drinking  water supply systems managed by government and NGOs as well as with  local people. Some of them are not sustainable in terms of its policy  processes continuity. The study reveals that such situation occurs due  to less participation or support of local citizens and inappropriate  local government policy supporting toward the program. This paper  intends to elaborate more on the topics of community and social  communication approaches relating to the development of water supply  system.</jats:p>"

Because supply control traditionally focuses on enforcement against producers and dealers, an analytical framework is presented that links different kinds of enforcement to different layers in the drug distribution chain described in Chapter 5. The remainder of the chapter is organized by the supply level that is targeted by an intervention: production/refining, international trafficking, high-level domestic enforcement, and retail enforcement. The final section presents an assessment of what is currently understood about the effectiveness of the different programmes.</jats:p>",

An upgraded version of the biogeochemical model SWAMCO is coupled to the ocean-sea-ice model NEMO-LIM to explore processes governing the spatial distribution of the iron supply to phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean. The 3-D NEMO-LIM-SWAMCO model is implemented in the ocean domain south of latitude 30° S and runs are performed over September 1989–December 2000. Model scenarios include potential iron sources (atmospheric deposition, iceberg calving/melting and continental sediments) as well as iron storage within sea ice, all formulated based on a literature review. When all these processes are included, the simulated iron profiles and phytoplankton bloom distributions show satisfactory agreement with observations. Analyses of simulations and sensitivity tests point to the key role played by continental sediments as a primary source for iron. Iceberg calving and melting contribute by up to 25% of Chl-a simulated in areas influenced by icebergs while atmospheric deposition has little effect at high latitudes. Activating sea ice-ocean iron exchanges redistribute iron geographically. Stored in the ice during winter formation, iron is then transported due to ice motion and is released and made available to phytoplankton during summer melt, in the vicinity of the marginal ice zones. Transient iron storage and transport associated with sea ice dynamics stimulate summer phytoplankton blooming (up to 3 mg Chl-a m-3 in the Weddell Sea and off East Antarctica but not in the Ross, Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas. This contrasted feature results from the simulated variable content of iron in sea ice and release of melting ice showing higher ice-ocean iron fluxes in the continental shelves of the Weddell and Ross Seas than in the Eastern Weddell Sea and the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Seas. This study confirms that iron sources and transport in the Southern Ocean likely provide important mechanisms in the geographical development of phytoplankton blooms and associated ecosystems.\n                    </jats:p>"

C. perfringens) have been introduced in water quality monitoring for microbial safety of drinking water because of their higher resistance to water disinfection processes than E. coli. Interpretation of this parameter, however, is hampered by lack of quantitative data on the spore decay rates. We determined decay rates of environmental Clostridium spores in river water and in filter sand in a twelve year microcosm study at different temperatures. Decay was not significant at 3°C and limited at 15°C. First order decay rates in water and sand were in the same order of magnitude and ranged from of 0.001 up to 0.0023 d−1. Molecular typing of isolates of surviving SSRC showed diversity in the species at different temperatures. From the results in combination with literature data it was concluded that there is heterogeneity in the longevity of environmental SSRC. There is a need for more information on the survival of C. perfringens spores which is essential for interpretation of this parameter in water microbiological quality control.</jats:p>",

The concentrations of all nutrients except Mn were identical in all treatments. The objectives of the experiment were to test whether grafted tomato plants have a higher or lower ability to withstand deficient or toxic levels of Mn in the root zone and to study the effects of grafting on nutrient uptake and translocation to the aerial organs. Both excessive and insufficient Mn concentrations in the root zone significantly reduced the number of fruit per plant, whereas mean fruit weight was unaffected by external Mn concentrations ranging from ≈1 to 100 μM. The excessive external Mn concentration caused the leaf Mn concentration to increase beyond the critically high level at the expense of leaf and root iron and zinc concentrations but without significant differences between the grafting treatments. The fruit yield of plants grafted onto ‘He-Man’ was significantly lower than that of self-grafted plants when the Mn concentration in the root zone was excessively high. This response might be associated with the lower translocation of magnesium (Mg) to the leaves of plants grafted onto ‘He-Man’ in comparison with the self-grafted plants, resulting in lower Mg/Mn ratios in the leaves. Grafting onto ‘He-Man’ also restricted the leaf and root iron and copper concentrations but enhanced those of potassium. Overall, tomato cv. Belladona proved to be more tolerant to excess Mn than to Mn deficiency in terms of vegetative growth and fruit yield.</jats:p>",

The metatarso‐phalangeal joint was cleared in methyl salicylate and perfused vessels studied in the intact bones. The bones were sawed into 5 mm thick slabs, decalcified and radiographed.

The dorsal half of the sagittal ridge of the distal third metatarsal bone and the plantar half of the proximal phalanx were examined histologically.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: Regions of the epiphysis with thick cartilage contained a greater number of perfused vessels than regions with thin cartilage. The cartilage canal vessels were oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the underlying ossification front. Cartilage canal vessels were incorporated into the ossification front during growth and became reliant on a subchondral arterial source. Macroscopically visible lesions were not detected in the current group of foals. On histological examination, pathological changes consisting of an area of chondronecrosis surrounded by fibrovascular granulation tissue were found in sections from the lateral proximo‐plantar eminence of the proximal phalanx in the 7‐week‐old foal.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>: The same anatomical feature (traversing the ossification front to enter cartilage canals) reported to render vessels vulnerable to failure in the tarsus was also present in the metatarso‐phalangeal joint of foals.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Potential relevance</jats:italic>: Osteochondrosis may occur by the same pathogenetic mechanism in the metatarso‐phalangeal joint as in the tarsus of foals.</jats:p>",

However, if applied to raw water with humic materials, it leads to the formation of halogenated organic compounds that are a potentially serious environmental and health problem. This renders pre-chlorination of raw waters to oxidise iron inappropriate. Coagulation, the principal treatment process for removal of THM precursors, is therefore essential for chlorination by-product control. In this study, the impact of pre-chlorination and the performance of Moringa oleifera as a coagulant aid at Masaka waterworks were assessed. An average increase of trihalomethanes of over 4,000% at aeration and pre-chlorination stage was observed at the plant. From the jar tests, alum with Moringa oleifera reduced dissolved organic concentration by 47.1%. The treated water after sedimentation tasted salty but after filtration and chlorination, the salty taste disappeared. Residual iron values of 1.38 mg/L and 3.05 mg/L were achieved with MOC-SC as coagulant aid and alum alone respectively. The jar test results indicated that use of alum with Moringa oleifera as coagulant aid is promising as a first stage in the treatment train for waters with humic materials and high content of iron.</jats:p>",

These revelations emerge from food web modules that incorporate fundamental constraints imposed by mass balance and a key trait, stoichiometric body composition, into a species’ niche. These niche components involve a species’ requirements from its environment and its own impacts on its environment. More specifically, stoichiometric composition influences minimal nutrient requirements of consumers (perhaps especially grazers); this component becomes pertinent because large imbalances often arise between nutrient:carbon content of consumers relative to prey. Furthermore, these imbalances then modulate the impact of consumers on their own resources through nutrient recycling. Once these niche components become synthesized, their implications in shaping food webs provide powerful mechanisms linking changes in environmental gradients with community structure and ecosystem function. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Roxarsone (ROX) is widely used as a feed additive in intensive animal production. While an animal is fed with ROX, the As compounds in the manure primarily occur as ROX and its metabolites, including arsenate (As[V]), arsenite (As[III]), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Animal manure is commonly land applied with phosphorous fertilizers in China. A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the phytoavailability of ROX, As(V), As(III), MMA, and DMA in water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica), with the soil amended with 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, and 2.0 g PO4/kg, respectively, plus 2% (w/w manure/soil) chicken manure (CM) bearing ROX and its metabolites. The results indicate that this species of water spinach cannot accumulate ROX and MMA at detectable levels, but As(V), As(III), and DMA were present in all plant samples. Increased phosphorous decreased the shoot As(V) and As(III) in water spinach but did not affect the root As(V). The shoot DMA and root As(III) and DMA were decreased/increased and then increased/decreased by elevated phosphorous. The total phosphorous content (P) in plant tissue did not correlate with the total As or the three As species in tissues. Arsenate, As(III), and DMA were more easily accumulated in the roots, and phosphate considerably inhibited their upward transport. Dimethylarsinic acid had higher transport efficiency than As(V) and As(III), but As(III) was dominant in tissues. Conclusively, phosphate had multiple effects on the accumulation and transport of ROX metabolites, which depended on their levels. However, proper utilization of phosphate fertilizer can decrease the accumulation of ROX metabolites in water spinach when treated with CM containing ROX and its metabolites. Environ. Toxicol.

In this paper we use a methodology for mapping information flows in an internal supply chain, and case studies of two Swedish multinational organisations. Eight retrospective cases were used to map, describe and analyse the information flow that supports the physical material flow from the receipt of an order to point of delivery. Every involved person was interviewed on at least one occasion each. The interviews were conducted to map and describe the information and physical material flow. The aim was to identify factors that could improve and rationalise information flows and generate a better flow within the organisation.</jats:p><jats:p>The study shows the importance of an integrated information system, but also clearly indicates the importance of a collaborative culture and an awareness of the human–technology interface. The study also shows that three factors of interface distortions are most frequent in the cases: (1) changes registered in the database trigger no action among the staff, (2) new knowledge to staff is stored only orally and not in the database, and (3) interface between the paper system and the database, and between the old and the new information storage culture.</jats:p>",

The degradation efficiency of UV/NaClO was lower than that of UV/O3. The final UV absorption removals of the two processes were approximately 80% and approximately 90% respectively. During the two processes, dihydroxylated chlorophenols were the main intermediates. And pH values decreased with the oxidation being carried on. However, the UV/NaClO process was incomplete and some adsorbable organic halogens, such as ethyl 2-chloroacetate, 3,4-dichlorobut-3-en-2-one, ethyl 2,2-dichloroacetate, 2-chloro-1,1-diethoxyethane, ethyl 2,2,2-trichloroacetate and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, still existed in the final solution. The costs of the two processes were also estimated. On a small scale, UV/NaClO process had significant economic advantage.</jats:p>",

In recent years, ongoing economic globalization, advances in information communication technology and other factors have wrought major changes in the traditional supply chain: for example, in subcontracting structure. Given the role of small and medium enterprises in underpinning economic growth, lifting the basic quality and performance level of these firms and improving business conditions for them have emerged as key policy themes. New efforts are needed to establish fair trade as a business practice and to create a new business culture in corporation with competition policy, small and medium enterprise policy and business ethics, such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices.</jats:p>",

This paper presents an optimal control approach for the management of water resources in a rapid developing region with critical water shortage. A model of the water allocation system is developed which considers both surface and groundwater resources and the distribution network. A reduced model of the complex spatially distributed 3D Finite Element groundwater model is applied. Hence the optimization problem, which is formulated as a large scale structured non-linear programming problem, can be solved with appropriate computation effort. The performance of the proposed concept is analyzed using realistic optimization scenarios.</jats:p>",

This article reports on the empirical findings of the quantification of risks that decision makers consider most important when deciding on a risk portfolio to mitigate and the manner in which risks are prioritized according to their importance. The empirical findings suggest that decision makers attached great importance to counterfeit, Food and Drugs Board, and exchange‐rate fluctuations. With respect to risk‐mitigation strategies, risk reduction is considered most important, followed by risk avoidance. Dynamic sensitivity analysis with respect to a change (increase) in the Food and Drugs Board did not result in any change in the ranking of risk policy options, while a change (increase) in counterfeit resulted in a change in the ranking between risk reduction and risk avoidance. Risk avoidance ranked number one, followed by risk reduction.

As organic micropollutants are only a minor part of the total natural organic matter, a challenge is posed in targeting the removal of a very small, specific part of the DOC, without removing all of the natural organic matter. In addition, organic micropollutants encompass a broad range of physicochemical properties, which make their removal by a single treatment step impossible. Combining AOP with artificial recharge and recovery, two complementary processes are expected to provide a hybrid system for organic micropollutant removal, according to the Dutch multiple barrier approach. Pilot-scale experiments with O3 and different advanced oxidation processes (UV/H2O2, UV/O3 and O3/H2O2) were carried out in cooperation between Dunea and ITT Wedeco. The pilot installation had a capacity of about 0.5–2.0 m3/h, with a varying LP-UV-dose, ozone dose and peroxide dose. Atrazine, isoproturone, carbamazepine, diclofenac and ibuprofen are well removed by UV/H2O2 as well as by O3/H2O2. In general, O3/H2O2 is a more energy efficient process compared to UV/H2O2. MTBE is best removed by O3/H2O2, Amidotrizoic acid and iohexol are best removed by UV/H2O2.</jats:p>",

Since hierarchical design and reusable intellectual property (IP) are widely used, it is necessary to optimize floorplanning/placement methodology considering voltage islands generation to solve power and critical path delay problems. In this article, we propose a floorplanning methodology considering voltage islands generation and performance constraints. Our method is flexible and can be extended to hierarchical design. The experimental results on some MCNC benchmarks show that our method is effective in meeting performance constraints and can simultaneously consider the tradeoff between power routing cost and total power dissipation.</jats:p>",

Fatty acids of food supply were assessed for the picoplankton, nanoplankton and microplankton size fractions. There were marked differences in upwelling conditions among locations, as well as in their food supply in terms of quantity and quality. Differences in fatty acid composition were also found, both among food assemblages and between copepod species. Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; linoleic acid) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA; oleic acid) dominated the picoplankton and nanoplankton size fractions of food, and they were highly represented in both species of copepods, indicating these size fractions were the major contributors to their diet. These fatty acids can thus be considered as useful trophic markers for copepods. Variation in lipid profiles between species depended on sampling sites, whereas differences in lipid composition among sampling sites were attributed to distinct upwelling conditions, which drive the changes in food quality, such that trophic response is highly dependent on food offer. Variation in fatty acids compositions of copepods may thus act as an indicator of upwelling variability. Our findings suggest that lipid transfer from primary producers to primary consumers can have a crucial role for carbon cycling in the marine food web, and that picoplankton and nanoplankton fractions are the key items of copepod diet in this upwelling system.</jats:p>",

We report the most comprehensive suite of biogeochemical iron budgets to date for three contrasting sites in subantarctic and polar frontal waters south of Australia. Distinct regional environments were responsible for differences in the mode and strength of iron supply mechanisms, with higher iron stocks and fluxes observed in surface northern subantarctic waters, where atmospheric iron fluxes were greater. Subsurface waters southeast of Tasmania were also enriched with particulate iron, manganese and aluminum, indicative of a strong advective source from shelf sediments. Subantarctic phytoplankton blooms are thus driven by both seasonal iron supply from southward advection of subtropical waters and by wind‐blown dust deposition, resulting in a strong decoupling of iron and nutrient cycles. We discuss the broader global significance our iron budgets for other ocean regions sensitive to climate‐driven changes in iron supply.</jats:p>",
