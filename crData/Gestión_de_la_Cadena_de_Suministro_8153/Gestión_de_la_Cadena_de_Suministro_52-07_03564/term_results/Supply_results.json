The importance of adequately planning fuel supply for a large power system is stressed, and the fundamental considerations of adequacy of supply, reliability, characteristics of supply, coal storage, and transportation are discussed with reference to the System characteristics, and with special emphasis on the development of the fuel supply for the two new plants.</jats:p>",
