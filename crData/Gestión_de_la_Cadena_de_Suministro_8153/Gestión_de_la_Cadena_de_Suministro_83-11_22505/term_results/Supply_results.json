No larger groups of outputs nor any input groups satisfy the sufficient dual conditions for consistent aggregation and two‐stage choice. Production is homothetic in outputs, fertilizer, and hired labor. Product supply and input demand equations are estimated. Estimates are inconsistent with expectations of the competitive model. The normalized profit function Hessian is not positive definite, and parameter symmetry is rejected.</jats:p>",
