According to this line of argument, if the subject prefers not to receive particular benefits from the state, then he need not incur obligations through their provision. However, as the discussion in Ch. 2 shows, for certain essential public goods, there is no alternative to state provision. Moreover, the fact that a subject prefers that goods be provided in a different form or by a mechanism other than the state is not ordinarily sufficient to dissolve obligations that they would otherwise incur.</jats:p>",

The modification of payment systems may lead to decreasing central banks possibilities of money regulation. Seigniorage which is obtained by the banking system is a kind of economic rent. The effect of money multiplier reveals itself in the world credit market and influences exchange rate dynamics of reserve currencies. Using government securities as the main asset of central banks and as an instrument of open market operations leads to appreciation of interest rate and to decreasing of credit activities in the economy. A perspective instrument of money regulation is allocation of central banks deposits with commercial banks.</jats:p>"

OPEC revenue has grown over the last year, but instability in revenue has been repeatedly related to geopolitical crises, instability in one or more OPEC member states, or lower world demand.OPEC pricing is set based on an arithmetic average of a basket of seven crude types; in practice, this is unhealthy for the crude price and always fails to follow the market.Furthermore, there is one trillion barrels of crude worldwide awaiting cost effective technology to make it ready for production.This would possibly results in better price stability in the crude oil market.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>OPEC price, based on basket trading, was set for 10 -20 days as $22.0 - 28.0 for adjustment.This has not been forced in the market since it was accounted.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Until the European Union created a unified currency, the US dollar has been (and still is) the dominant currency since 1945 and handles over 70% of world official exchange reserves.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Will this state of affairs change? Will the oil (and possibly gas) price become stable whilst subject to rules other than that of supply and demand? Can the Euro replace the Dollar in the trading of crude oil?Would it be better for OPEC members to base production quotas on regulations other than those currently used?</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Most forecasts of prices and quotas face difficulties in finding rules to follow.

The study indicated that both men and women unfavorably view the use of wastewater for possible consumption (released into potable surface or groundwater supplies) or applications involving close, personal contact (laundry). Women were especially concerned about pumping wastewater into the groundwater for subsequent potable use. Both genders felt that wastewater reuse for applications not involving close personal contact (such as firefighting, car washing, lawn irrigation and agricultural uses) was acceptable. General knowledge concerning wastewater reuse was mixed. Those with lower incomes, less education, and 65 years of age or older had significantly less knowledge of this issue than younger, more educated, higher income individuals. Primary sources of information for most demographic groups included newspaper and television, although the Internet was identified as a frequent source for selected groups.</jats:p>",

These first appeared as large blades with symbolic status, as part of the Neolithic expansion in North Italy. By the middle Neolithic the blades were reduced in size, but enjoying their widest distribution, creating a cultural zone on the left bank of the Rhône, more than 200 km from their source. In the late Neolithic, although the zone of influence was still large, the eclogites in the Rhône Valley were giving way to more local rock sources and copper.

The paper deals with the tasks required to upgrade the network, and to review and improve the operational policies and practices, before the tools and techniques to reduce NRW can be put in place. The paper discusses each step of the strategy and its development, from upgrading the network by improved infrastructure management and zoning, to the available techniques and equipment for monitoring and detecting real and apparent losses.</jats:p>",

This food scare, on the one hand, strongly affected consumers' attitude, making meat safety one of the most important issues of product quality for both consumers and retailers and, on the other hand, had important effects on the supply chain organization. The coming into force of the European Regulations (EC) No. 1760/2000 and No. 1825/2000 on beef labeling has partly led to a reshaping of the structure and organization of the Italian beef chain. The new relationships and contracts along the chain have been analyzed, and the strategies set up by the retailers to improve beef safety and quality and reinforce market segmentation have been discussed. The experience of the COOP Italia, the most important Italian large‐scale retailer, has been studied and discussed considering its chain organization and contract designing for beef products.

Each module, e.g. a house, office, etc, can have multiple users using elemental demands, which can be stochastic or deterministic, to produce representative flows. Elemental demands represent water using devices, e.g. a toilet, and are modelled as flow against time. Stochastic elemental demands have modeller defined variability and can include queuing. Deterministic elemental demands occur at fixed times. Modules, which can include local storage, are interconnected to form networks with the flows being aggregated at each node. Network and system faults can be introduced as stochastic processes, flow limits and hydraulic constraints are observed and queued demands carried forward until satisfied. A novel double sweep algorithm is used to distribute flows within the model. The WatSup model uses an advanced object-oriented numerical engine to provide a robust, fast modelling system with a time step of one second.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Considerable progress has been made over the past 10 years in the assessment and benchmarking of real losses in potable water distribution systems. Most of the advances have been based on the burst and background estimate (BABE) methodology, which was first developed in the mid-1990s by the UK water industry and has since been widely accepted and used in many parts of the world. Since the original BABE methodology was developed, several other key concepts have been added to the evergrowing list of water demand management tools. In particular, the infrastructure leakage index (ILI) and unavoidable annual real losses (UARL) introduced by A. Lambert, and the fixed area variable area discharge (FAVAD) theory by J. May, are now recognised as key “tools of the trade” in any water demand management assessment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>One of the first main developments where the above-mentioned concepts were applied in practice to benchmark leakage was in South Africa, where the local Water Research Commission supported the production of the BENCHLEAK Model. This was basically the first comprehensive model to assess real losses in potable water distribution systems using the UARL and ILI concepts. The model was developed by one of the authors together with A. Lambert, and was soon followed by similar developments in Australia (BENCHLOSS) and New Zealand (BENCHLOSSNZ). Both models incorporated additions and enhancements to the original South African model, and were tailored to suit the local conditions in line with the clients' requirements.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Similar developments took place in parallel by various leakage specialists, most notably in Brazil, Malaysia and Cyprus, to mention just a few of the similar initiatives. Each time a new model was developed, certain improvements were made and the “science” of leakage management and benchmarking was enhanced.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Through the use of the different models and from discussions with various researchers from around the world, it has become clear that there is a genuine need for such models, and they are being readily accepted by clients in most areas. The discussions have also raised many questions concerning the derivation of the terms used to calculate the UARL and the ILI, and, to address these concerns a specialist group was created through the IWA to investigate the various issues.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will highlight the progress that has been made to date with regard to the key issues that have been raised by the task-team members, and recommendations based on the feedback that has been received from around the world. The paper will also present some of the results that have been obtained from different parts of the world to highlight both the progress and the problems associated with the assessment of real losses. The paper will conclude with a short description of several new models that have been developed and are in use, which demonstrate the latest improvements to an ongoing process to assess and benchmark real losses in water distribution systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mathematical models and methods have been established in various fields of applications in recent years. These include transport and traffic (see for instance the Oberwolfach workshop on “Traffic and Transport Optimization” in 1999), production planning (see Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, the volume on “Logistics of Production and Inventory” Graves, Rinnooy Kan and Zipkin (eds.), North-Holland, 1993), communication networks (see “Handbook of Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics” Rosen (ed.), or “Handbook in Operations Research and Management Science” the volume on “Network Models” Ball, Magnanti, Monma and Nemhauser (eds.)) and financial engineering (“Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives” by J. Hull). The success of mathematical methods does not only rely on progress in computer technology, but in a fundamental way it relies on the improvement of the underlying mathematical models, methods and associated algorithmic developments. In recent years new challenges from industry and business have arisen. Modern problems contain more and more structures whose origins lie in various disciplines of mathematics, including graphs and networks, optimization, control and stochastic processes. A prominent field in which such problems arise is supply chain management.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Supply chain management is typically defined as:</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>A set of approaches utilized to efficiently integrate suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and stores so that merchandise is produced and distributed in the right quantities, to the right locations, and at the right time, in order to minimize systemwide costs while satisfying service level requirements.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The idea of the workshop was to bring people from mathematics who have successfully applied mathematical methods for the solution of practical problems together with people who are in touch with the real-world problems that constitute supply chain management. To motivate and initiate interactions between the two groups, the mathematicians presented their applied methods and explained the situations in which they are effective as well as the underlying theory. These methods and concepts cover a wide spectrum, ranging from integer programming and dynamic programming methods through approximation algorithms to stochastic optimization methods. Similarly, supply chain management experts explained their problems, pointed out where current methods will help and where further developments are necessary. The scope of these problems is quite impressive. It includes distribution problems that integrate warehousing and transportation, inventory management models, the integration of procurement and manufacturing activities with demand planning processes and pricing and auction models that are used to improve business-to-consumer and business-to-business interactions. In this way we hope that the workshop provided a forum for open discussions about interesting new mathematical problems that are of central importance to supply chain management.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The workshop itself was organized as follows. We had a series of plenary talks from world leading experts in mathematics and in supply chain management about the current state-of-the-art in these fields. We completed the program by having a series of shorter talks where people reported on their chosen models and solution methods for these models.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In particular we invited and encouraged young people to participate in the workshop. They used the chance to gain as well as to present insights into new developments in applied mathematics and supply chain management. The interconnection of the two disciplines showed to provide a great source for new, interesting research projects in the future.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The Oberwolfach workshop on “Mathematics in the Supply Chain” turned out to be of great interest for both experts in mathematics and experts in supply chain management. The meeting offered a platform for mathematicians to become acquainted with an important future-oriented field of applications. Vice versa, it offered a platform for supply chain management people to learn more about current mathematical models and methods potentially useful in solving further problems. We are very happy that we had the opportunity to organize such an interdisciplinary workshop at Oberwolfach.</jats:p>",

Most current models of water supply surveillance for urban areas come from developed countries and have significant shortcomings if directly applied elsewhere. There are differences not only in socio-economic conditions but also in the nature of water supply services, which often comprise a complex mixture of formal and informal services for both the ‘served’ and ‘unserved’. The development of approaches to water supply surveillance that allow targeting of activities on priority groups is assessed based on case studies from Peru and Uganda. The development of a zoning approach that incorporates indices for vulnerability is shown to be a useful tool to assist surveillance in targeting data collection. Zoning also assists in targeting subsequent interventions into communities and strategies where public health gains are likely to be greatest. Two approaches to urban zoning are presented from Peru and Uganda, both of which are effective.</jats:p>",

The value of rainfed agriculture to produce competitively should be re-assessed. This requires the concerted efforts of farmers, researchers, and policy makers to work on the technical factors that determine agricultural production as well as to address the economic policy environment. Syria is a small country with a diversified rainfed and irrigated agriculture. Rainfed and supplemental irrigation technology has improved Syria's food self-reliance, however, the policy environment is not conducive to the sustainable use of natural resources. Supplemental irrigation technology to produce wheat is used to illustrate the need to address both the technical issues as well as the economic incentives to make agricultural production competitive. Kazakhstan is a large country with a predominantly rainfed agriculture. Farmers could benefit from rainfall probabilities to use fertilizer and improved wheat varieties under rainfed agriculture as Syria did during the eighties and nineties. Implicit taxation of farmers needs to be removed and access to markets must be ensured for farmers in Kazakhstan to benefit from international wheat prices. While it is important to improve production technology, the economic policy environment needs to be addressed first to create incentives for farmers to produce commodities competitively in water-scarce regions.</jats:p>",

The framework is motivated by the emergence of B2B exchanges in several industrial sectors to facilitate such integrated contract and spot procurement. In the framework developed, a buyer and multiple sellers may either contract for delivery in advance (the “contracting” option) or they may buy and sell some or all of their input/output in a spot market. Contract pricing involves both a reservation fee per unit of capacity and an execution fee per unit of output if capacity is called. The key question addressed is the structure of the optimal portfolios of contracting and spot market transactions for the buyer and these sellers, and the pricing thereof in market equilibrium. Existence and structure of market equilibria are characterized for the associated competitive game between sellers with heterogeneous technologies, under the assumption that they know the buyer's demand function. This allows an explicit characterization of the price of capacity options and the value of managerial flexibility, as well as providing conditions under which B2B exchanges are efficient and sustainable. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2003 the Aquarec project sponsored by the European Commission under the 5th Framework Programme was started, aiming at “integrated concepts for reuse of upgraded wastewater with special focus on the European countries”. One of the key elements is the development of a treatment matrix, in which wastewater treatment processes are categorised as a function of the raw wastewater quality and the reuse application and are further characterised with respect to costs, operational critical control points and environmental aspects. The construction of the treatment matrix is based on the reuse options (industrial, domestic, natural and agricultural applications), the water quality requirements, the treatment requirements and the extensive description of the various treatment processes and schemes. In the process of constructing the matrix it can be concluded that the actual knowledge on municipal wastewater treatment is definitely well consolidated until the so-called secondary treatment including biological or physical/chemical nutrients removal; the treatment of this effluent should be accomplished by more advanced techniques. As a consequence of the actual EU rules on water discharges, it makes sense to focus the Aquarec project on the possible refinements of secondary effluent. Great attention must be given to the advanced or tertiary wastewater treatment processes, as a mean to upgrade the effluent to water suitable for reuse.</jats:p>",

The simulation points out that there is a significant potential for an increased utilisation of reclaimed wastewater in many European countries, specifically in the Mediterranean region driven by different factors like increased wastewater treatment capacity and higher demand for irrigation and groundwater recharge.</jats:p>",

The UK has recently established the world’s first Stem Cell Bank to be a repository for stem cell lines from the UK and elsewhere, and to make them available for use by both academic and commercial laboratories around the world. It will not accept material from embryos specifically created for the purposes of research. However, this novel development poses a number of interesting sociological questions that will be explored in detail. As the stem cell lines are effectively immortal the provenance of any donation will need to be carefully scrutin-ized. How will the required information about whether appropriate informed consent has been obtained, whether the donors are traceable or anonymous, and where any intellectual property rights may reside, or be established? Of particular interest will be the basis for achieving standardization of practice across the variety of stakeholders (laboratories, clinics, patients, pharmaceutical companies, regulatory authorities, etc.) involved. Finally, while the UK has one of the most liberal, but also the most regulated governance structures within which to work, it appears that most of the attention is focused on tissue collection, leaving downstream therapeutic application (which may never materialize) by commercial interests relatively ungoverned. Provenance, standardization and governance in the ‘supply chain’ of embryonic stem cell lines may therefore provide a basis for better understanding the global commodification of ‘life’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The electrical distribution industry in South‐East Queensland is currently experiencing a period of rapid change as growth in the region far exceeds what could have been reasonably forecasted 10 years ago. It is due to this growth and the capacity requirements of customers that all distribution entities are significantly building up their program of works to meet this demand. Whilst this increased work is providing supply to the public, there is some uncertainty over the effects of this on the quality of the associated management involved due to the correspondingly increased amount of time and attention needed. Of especial concern is the extent to which effective project risk management is currently conducted or even possible under these circumstances. The research reported in this paper aimed to shed some light in this situation by capturing the ‘real world’ experiences, with respect to the risk management skills and application of those managers involved, and identify any deficiencies in current practice. This involved a questionnaire survey in 2004 of a sample of forty‐six project managers, representing a thirty‐one percent response rate, within the electrical distribution industry in South‐East Queensland. Surprisingly, in view of the supposed unusual local circumstances involved, the results agree substantially with previous studies of actual risk management practices generally in that there is an underutilisation of risk management due to manager’s concerns about the time and resources needed, together with a desire for a more thorough assessment of risks by means of a formal risk management process.</jats:p>",

It was found that DOC removal was independent of the unsaturated vadose zone depth except during the initial flooding period when the effluent was injected into each column. From tests to study the nitrate profile, it was found that the pattern of nitrification was dependent on the depth of the unsaturated zone during the initial periods of SAT flooding. However, no further nitrification occurred at the end of the flooding since the injection of the effluent continued to provide a high loading concentration to the SAT columns. The lack of phosphate removal in this study indicates that its removal is more dependent upon the soils and aquifer characteristics than on the depth of unsaturated zone.</jats:p>",

Numerical study shows that considerable supply chain cost savings can be achieved if production and transportation costs are considered simultaneously. However, the buyer's payments in such auctions can be high. We then develop a new Vickrey-type auction that incorporates the buyer's reservation price function into quantity allocation and payment decision. As a result, the buyer has some control over his payments at the expense of introducing uncertainty in the quantity acquired in the auction. </jats:p>",

Supply chain disruptions caused by external events can have a significant financial and operational impact on firms not properly prepared.

One critical component of disaster management planning in supply chains is the storage of emergency supplies, equipment, and vital documents that will be needed in times of crisis.

The potential problems of interest are bacterial regrowth, precipitation of iron, and corrosion in the raw water distribution system. The AR trial plant is located on the Arrenaes peninsula on Zealand, Denmark. A large-scale production plant for drinking water (4 million m3/year) is proposed at the locality. To test the microbial properties of the mixed water, laboratory experiments have been carried out. Based on the results, it has been concluded that introducing water from the proposed large-scale AR plant to the distribution system will not cause problems with undesirable regrowth of bacteria in the pipelines, as long as the content of AOC in the abstracted AR water stays within the current range, between 3 and 15 μg/L. Chemical modelling (PHREEQC) shows that the mixed water is supersaturated with iron oxides, which may precipitate as iron sludge. Furthermore, the model shows that the hardness of the water in the pipelines will decrease when abstracted AR water is added. This is not expected to cause corrosion, due to a simulated supersaturation with calcite in all water types. However, long-term operation of the proposed large-scale AR plant, and thereby leaching of calcite from the aquifer, may lead to corrosion of the pipelines.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Seoul, the multiple regression models were used to estimate future water demand and to verify the ability of the water supply to cope with regional development. A regional development project extending over two districts was planned to stimulate the regional economy of Seoul in October 2003, and multiple regression models for each district were developed to verify the capacity of water facilities and the retention time of reservoirs. Two variables, the population and the area of the commercial district, were used to express domestic and commercial water usage. Coefficients for variables of models should be positive values; however, the coefficient for population was negative in Jung-gu. The prediction of water demand with one regression formula for each district may not be sufficient to characterize the water use pattern of a district. So, by characterizing each sub-district of the two districts, applying principal component and cluster analysis, they were divided into residential and commercial groups. Then, multiple regression models with the same variables were developed for each group. As a result, the models not only had positive coefficients for all variables, but also could provide reasonable sensitivity for the variables. For each group, the commercial area had nearly same sensitivity, but the population in the commercial area showed more sensitivity than in the residential area, because people living in the commercial area do not have to go to another district to work or sleep. Future water demands were estimated, depending on three scenarios of regional development, using the existing and newly developed models. The water demands estimated by the newly developed model are 3,416-11,372 ton/day less than those by existing model. Therefore, the model developed gave the correct water demand and prevented a wrong decision from being made.</jats:p>",

This two‐factor experiment proved the general hypothesis that food supply and predation had independent and additive effects on population dynamics of root voles. The experimental results proved the following predictions: (1) predation reduced population density and recruitment significantly; (2) food supply increased population density; (3) predation and food supply influenced spacing behavior of root voles separately and additively: Exposure to predation reduced long movements of root voles between trapping sessions; additional food supply reduced aggression level and home range size of root voles. Less movement of individuals that exposed to predators possibly reduced their opportunity of obtaining food and lessened population survival rate, which led population density to decrease. Smaller home range and lower aggression level could make higher population density tolerable. The interactive effect of predation and food on home range size was highly significant (P=0.0082&lt;0.01). The interactive effect of food and predation on dispersal rate was significant (P&lt;0.01). From the experimental results, we conclude that the external factors (predation, food supply) were more effective than internal factors (spacing behavior) in determining population density of root voles – under the most favorable external conditions (−P, +F treatment), the mean density and mean recruitment of root vole population was the highest; under the most unfavorable external conditions (+P, −F treatment), the mean density and mean recruitment of root vole population was the lowest.</jats:p>",

This effluent can be used for watering of green areas and car washing. The objectives of the present work were to characterize the effluent and to propose a specific treatment to enable reuse of the effluent from the container washing machine. The analysis of water quality identified the following problems: high pH (10.0), high biochemical oxygen demand (50 mg/L), high concentration of free residual chlorine (3.15 mg/l), alkalinity (207 mg/l as CaCO3) and hardness (38.8 mg/l as CaCO3). These parameters must be reduced in order to comply with the Mexican standards for water reuse (NOM-003-ECOL-1997), and to protect the washing equipment against corrosion and incrustations. The water can be used for the watering of green areas after pH adjustment and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5) removal. If special equipment is used for car washing, it is necessary to reduce the concentration of calcium and magnesium using a strong cationic resin. Following these recommendations the specific industry installed a treatment system with pH adjustment, dual filtration (sand-anthracite) and adsorption system with activated carbon. The effluent is now used for watering of green areas and for car washing with garden hoses.</jats:p>",

These new forms of vertical organizations are different types of hybrid forms, according to New Institutional Economic theory. We highlight that these new organizations were chosen because of the lower degree of acceptance by the retailers of the asymmetry of information on quality, generally to their discredit, and in order to protect their reputation. Nevertheless, even in the case of products where the risk of acquiring a bad batch is particularly problematic for retailers, the latter do not seek to create bilateral governances systems directly with the producers, a situation that can lead to high tensions with the producers.

Stratified sampling technique was used in the study. Total supply and consumption of the fuelwood in the district is 470084 and 494103 tonnes per year respectively. About 24019 tonnes of fuelwood, which accounts for 5 per cent of total consumption, is found to be deficit. Per capita fuelwood consumption in the district is 466 kg. Out of the total supply, homestead contributes 79% while forest and bamboo stead contribute 8 and 13% respectively. A total of 35 different fuelwood species are being exploited for energy. It seems that there is acute scarcity of suitable species for firewood in the region. As the population of the region increases there will be huge demand for fuelwood in the coming years. Therefore, more emphasis should be given for scientific selection of suitable firewood species and people should be mobilized to take up large-scale energy plantation for fulfilling their demand.</jats:p>",

Theoretical perspectives on greener supply are developed and then tested against a sample of manufacturing companies. Environmental policy documents published by the sample companies seem to offer surface evidence for a proactive supply chain management role in environmental protection. Yet a more detailed examination of the three elements that constitute supply chain management – the management of the transformation of materials, the management of information flows and the management of supply chain relationships – finds a suboptimal situation for all three areas. In part this gap can be explained by limits in the technical capabilities of the supply chain. More important, however, are structural constraints that prevent the supply chain manager from actively searching for environmentally friendlier alternatives.

In this study, we reassess the institutional explanation, because earlier supportive evidence is threatened by two alternative macro-level explanations: the influence of the economic necessity to work and the influence of gender role values in society. Our main research question is whether and to what extent these alternative explanations alter the effect of public childcare arrangements on mothers’ labour supply. Using panel data from 13 countries of the EU, we find evidence in favour of the institutional and economic explanations. In countries with more generous provision of public childcare and in countries with a lower level of economic welfare, the impact of childbirth on female labour supply is less negative than in other countries. Economic welfare appears to suppress rather than rival the institutional effect. More egalitarian gender role values in a country increase mothers’ labour supply, yet these values do not alter the institutional effect. Our results underpin the importance of publicly supported arrangements for enhancing female labour supply. </jats:p>",

We investigated the effects of this supply on the<jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic>mire vegetation in SW Götaland by comparing above‐ground tissue concentrations of N and P and biomass variables in five vascular plant and two<jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic>species collected during three periods since 1955 at 81 sites representing three vegetation types, viz. ombrotrophic bog, extremely poor fen and moderately poor fen, within two areas differing in annual N deposition. The N:P ratios in the plants were rarely below 17, suggesting P as the growth‐limiting mineral nutrient. In the vascular plants both growth and concentrations of N and P were highest in the moderately poor fen sites because of a higher mineralization rate, the differences between the extremely poor fen and bog sites being smaller in these respects. In the extremely poor fen and bog sites the N concentrations were slightly higher in the area with the highest N deposition. From 1955 to 2002 the concentration of N in the<jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic>spp. increased proportionally to the supply rate while P remained constant. In the vascular plants the concentrations of P remained constant while N showed slightly decreasing trends in the bog and extremely poor fen sites, but since the size of the plants increased the biomass content of N and P increased, too. The increased N deposition has had its greatest effects on the site types with the highest<jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic>biomass and peat accumulation rate. The high N concentration in the<jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic>mosses probably reduced their competitiveness and facilitated the observed expansion of vascular plants. However, the increased N deposition might also have triggered an increased mineralization in the acrotelm increasing the supply of P to the vascular plants and thus also their productivity. This may also explain the slightly higher productivity among the vascular plants in the area with the highest N deposition rate. In conclusion, it seems as the increased N deposition has directly influenced only the growth of the<jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic>mosses and that the effects on the growth of the vascular plants are indirect.</jats:p>",

The customer, for obvious reasons, is more likely to choose the item with the longer remaining shelf life. Therefore, the supply to the retailer's shelves and issuing policies for making available the particular items to the customers affect product outdating and related costs. Revenues will be affected by the extent to which more can be charged for items with a longer remaining shelf life or by the impact of the remaining shelf life on demand.

When examining internal demand management a number of problems arise including: product overspecification, premature establishment of design and specification, frequent changes in specification, poor demand information, fragmentation of spend, maverick buying, inter-departmental power and politics, and the risk-averse nature and culture of the organisation. It is argued that unless these problems are addressed and eliminated the NHS will not be in a position to select the most appropriate reactive or proactive approach from the range of sourcing options available. An improvement path that NHS Trusts might follow to achieve more efficient and effective procurement and supply management is outlined.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The soluble nitrogen (N) components in sugar beet seriously impair sugar recovery. The only N component determined routinely in the sugar factory is amino N (the sum of amino acids in the beet), which is assumed to reflect all the other N components. Amino N is affected by N supply and variety, but only little is known about the other N components such as total soluble N, betaine and nitrate. This study aimed at investigating the effect of N supply on the N composition of sugar beet varieties with special emphasis on N supply by variety interactions. In 2001 and 2002, field trials with four varieties and four N treatments were carried out at six sites in Germany. Storage root yield and the concentrations of sucrose, sodium, amino N, betaine, nitrate and total soluble N in the beet were determined. With increasing N supply, the concentration of amino N increased considerably and that of nitrate slightly, whereas that of betaine remained rather constant. Thus, the N composition of sugar beet changed with increasing N supply and the percentage of amino N of total soluble N increased. Although amino N has the closest correlation with total soluble N, for quality assessment it may overestimate the effect of N supply on other N components. Varieties clearly differed in root yield and quality as well as in all N components. The variety with the lowest amino N had the highest betaine concentration. However, as related to the concentration of total soluble N in the beet, for all varieties amino N as well as betaine showed the same response pattern. This indicates that the N composition of sugar beet is determined by the level of total soluble N, irrespective of variety or N supply. All varieties required the same N supply for obtaining maximum yield or quality. N supply did not affect the ranking of the varieties for all parameters studied, consequently it need not be considered for variety choice.</jats:p>",

The survey data from customers are used to assess the degree of integration between marketing and operations and the relationship with customer behavioral intentions. The results indicate that eBusiness‐, product‐, and service‐quality, all have a significant direct effect on customer behavioral intentions to purchase again. There is limited support for technology as a moderating factor. Finally, the relationships between the predictor variables and customer behavioral intentions differ across grocers. This supports the idea that grocers utilizing different operational strategies should focus attention on different facets of their business and provides insight as to where efforts should be directed.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Biological weighting functions (BWFs) for inhibition of photosynthesis by UVR and photosynthesis <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic> irradiance (PI) curves for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were estimated for both species grown with an enriched CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply (high dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC]: 1% CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in air) and in atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> levels (low DIC: 0.03% CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>). The response to UVR and PAR exposures was different in each species depending on the DIC treatment. Under PAR exposure, rates of maximum photosynthesis were similar between treatments in <jats:italic>N. gaditana</jats:italic>. However, the cultures growing in high DIC had lower sensitivity to UVR than the low DIC cultures. In contrast, <jats:italic>N. atomus</jats:italic> had higher rates of photosynthesis under PAR exposure with high DIC, but the BWFs were not significantly different between treatments. The results suggest that one or more processes in <jats:italic>N. gaditana</jats:italic> associated with HCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> transport are target(s) for UV photodamage because there was relatively less UV inhibition of the high DIC‐grown cultures in which inorganic carbon fixation is supplied by passive CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> diffusion. Time courses of photochemical efficiency in PAR, during UV exposure and during subsequent recovery in PAR, were determined using a pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer. The results were consistent with the BWFs. In all time courses, a steady state was obtained after an initial decrease, consistent with a dynamic balance between damage and repair as found for other phytoplankton. However, the relationship of response to exposure showed a steep decline in activity that is consistent with a constant rate of repair. A novel feature of a model developed from a constant repair rate is an explicit threshold for photosynthetic response to UV.</jats:p>",
