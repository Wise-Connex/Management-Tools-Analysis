It is argued that the beginning of Athens' reliance on the Black Sea as more than a lucrative and strategic asset, and ultimately as the systematic source of most of its imported grain, first began near the end of the Peloponnesian War, with the collapse of Athens' Aegean empire. For most of the fourth century Athens and the Bosporan (Spartocid) Kingdom were bound in a tight social and economic relationship largely designed and determined by the mutual interests of their elites. Archaeological evidence and the iconography of Graeco‐Scythian art illustrate this interdependence. The “school” of the Athenian rhetorician Isocrates is argued to have been the crucial network along which this elite relationship functioned culturally and politically.</jats:p>",

The different personnel connected with the grain supply, from grain‐dealers (sitopolai) and “retailers” (kapeloi) to politicians and kings, each had their own pattern of rhetorical presentation. By observing how these patterns intersect, it is argued that the direct involvement of Athenian politicians in trade, and particularly in the grain supply on which Athens delicately depended for its survival, always risked a direct clash with democratic ideology, and therefore required subtle forms of rhetorical manipulation and concealment. Once the purpose and forms of this concealment are detected, Athenian rhetoric serves to reinforce both the picture of elite land‐holding in the cleruchies presented in Chapter 3, as well as that of elite networking in the Pontic trade of the fourth century presented in Chapter 5.</jats:p>",

Perceived differences exist among the regions of Asia, the Western Hemisphere and Europe, as well as among the LCC nations of these three regions. However, no one region outperforms the others, and no one nation outperforms the others, on all 14 operational indicators investigated. Accordingly, this study also identifies the key areas of comparative advantage and disadvantage that each LCC region and each LCC nation presents in its relationship with U.S. buying firms.</jats:p>",

The growing lexicon of outsourcing terminology has caused confusion for many managers and academicians alike, who tend to view outsourcing as a fixed, discrete event or a simple make‐or‐buy decision. In reality, outsourcing is an umbrella term that includes a range of sourcing options that are external to the firm. Understanding these options, their characteristic differences, and how they serve to meet differing business objectives is the focus of the current research. Based on in‐depth interviews with 19 senior executives experienced in outsourcing, as well as a thorough synthesis of available research, this article provides a framework clarifying the broad spectrum of outsourcing arrangements, and their inherent risks and advantages. Managerial guidance related to outsourcing is also provided.</jats:p>",

The results not only show that e‐RAs have fewer negative effects on buyer–supplier relationships than currently assumed but also that the management of e‐RAs (particularly a high valuation of types and sources of information combined with a high quality of information exchange and communication) has a positive impact on the buyer–supplier relationship.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study shows how Classical Athens, the largest and historically most important of the Greek city‐states, depended for its survival on a supply of grain from overseas sources, especially (in the fifth century bc) the conquered territories of its Aegean empire, and (in the fourth century) the distant steppes of Scythia (modern Ukraine and southern Russia). This trade was central to Athenian politics, and is here found to have been organized and controlled by powerful elites, a conclusion that challenges prevailing interpretations of Athenian democracy. New light is also cast on the nature of Athenian imperialism; the relationship of the city of Athens and its countryside; the relevance to the Athenian economy of fourth‐century rhetorical and philosophical schools (particularly that of Isocrates) and other elite networks; and the history of the Bosporan Kingdom in the northern Black Sea. A wealth of ancient textual evidence (from history, oratory, and drama) is presented alongside archaeology, aerial photography, epigraphy, and iconography. Revolutionary new discoveries, like the Grain‐Tax Law of 374/3 bc, and the vast building complexes lining the Crimean coast of the Azov Sea, are discussed comprehensively with older evidence, like the golden treasures from Graeco‐Scythian graves. Decades of foreign scholarship and discovery (especially in Russian) are synthesized and made accessible to English readers. Moving from the edges of the Greek world, to the islands of the Aegean, to the prosperous demes of Attica and the courtrooms and popular assemblies of Athens, this book presents a sweeping reinterpretation of Athenian economy and society.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water planners facing a choice between water “supply” options (including conservation) customarily use the average unit cost of each option as a decision criterion. This approach is misleading and potentially costly when comparing options with very different reliability characteristics. For example, surface water, desalinated seawater or recycled wastewater and some outdoor demand management programs have very different yield patterns. This paper presents a method for calculating constant-reliability unit costs that adapts some concepts and mathematics from financial portfolio theory. Comparison on a constant-reliability basis can significantly change the relative attractiveness of options. In particular, surface water, usually a low cost option, is more expensive after its variability has been accounted for. Further, options that are uncorrelated or inversely correlated with existing supply sources—such as outdoor water conservation—will be more attractive than they initially appear. This insight, which implies options should be evaluated and chosen as packages rather than individually, opens up a new dimension of yield and financial analysis for water planners.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies a procurement problem with one buyer and multiple potential suppliers who hold private information about their own production costs. Both the purchase quantity and the price need to be determined. An optimal procurement strategy for the buyer requires the buyer to first design a supply contract that specifies a payment for each possible purchase quantity and then invites the suppliers to bid for this contract. The auction can be conducted in many formats such as the English auction, the Dutch auction, the first-priced, sealed-bid auction, and the Vickrey auction. The winner is the supplier with the highest bid, and is given the decision right for the quantity produced and delivered. Applying this theory to a newsvendor model with supply-side competition, this paper establishes a connection between the above optimal procurement strategy and a common practice in the retail industry, namely, the use of slotting allowances and vendor-managed inventory. Also discussed in the newsvendor context are the role of well-known supply contracts such as returns contracts and revenue-sharing contracts in procurement auctions, the scenarios where the buyer and suppliers may possess asymmetric information about the demand distribution, and how the cost of supply-demand mismatch is affected by supply-side competition. Finally, this paper compares the optimal procurement strategy with a simpler but suboptimal strategy where the buyer first determines a purchase quantity and then seeks the lowest-cost supplier for the quantity in an auction. </jats:p>",

The majority of performance measurement models incorporate hard quantitative measures that are not appropriate for the soft features of business relationships.

The proposed model can be utilised with qualitative (interviews) as well as quantitative (survey) data. The aim of any improvement strategy for the performance of SRs should be to minimise the gaps in partners' perceptions and pursuit the role that the parties play in the relationship and identify those factors that have greater importance to the relationship. Appropriate strategies should be then selected to minimise the gaps in the perceptions of the individuals against these factors.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The usefulness of the model in assessing SRs' performance lies in the fact that a holistic view of SRs is achieved by taking into account both soft and hard dimensions of SRs. Contrasting the model to other performance management models its major limitation is that it cannot be used as a “scientific” diagnostic tool for suggestion of best practices. Further research is required to identify the causes behind poor performance in a particular area and then devise appropriate strategies.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The proposed model can be used in different context (manufacturing or services), does not require specialised knowledge or external consulting and provides scope for improvement of relationships between departments within an organisation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This paper emphasises the importance of performance measurement of SRs and proposes an innovative for performance measurement model, which overcomes the limitations of existing tools and can be applied in several contexts.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

It was at this time that Athens discovered or adapted the cleruchy as a social and economic tool, that the Athenian elite became involved in leading the city's first imperialist adventures overseas, and that Attica began to specialize in the intensive cultivation of cash‐crops. The Athenian democracy led to the intensification of all of these trends, and to the creation of an ideological system, deployed in rhetoric, to mask the serious incongruities between popular and elite interests. A need for imported grain drove Athens at different times to depopulate neighboring Aegean landscapes in order to extract grain surpluses, or to enlist the help of foreign kings, acting as Athenian citizens and benefactors. A supply system of such ruthlessness, sophistication, and ambivalence lay at the heart of Athenian democracy.</jats:p>",

Special attention is given to Euboea and its role as Athens' chief fifth‐century granary, protected by a system of fortifications largely disregarded by previous scholarship. The Peloponnesian War and the political crisis of 411 bc which led to the loss of most of the island are examined in detail. The Athenian method of obtaining grain in the form of taxes is studied in the light of a new interpretation of the recently published Grain‐Tax Law of Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros of the year 374/3 bc.</jats:p>",

There can be many possible demand supply networks with different logistics costs for a product. Therefore, we introduce a Petri Net-based formalism, and a reachability analysis based algorithm that finds the optimum demand supply network for a user-specified product structure. The method has been implemented and is currently in production use inside all Nokia business groups. It is used in demand supply planning of both network elements and handsets. An example of the method’s application to a concrete Nokia product is included.</p>",

This paper analyses issues and problems pertaining to urban and rural water supply services in Tanzania by citing examples from Dar es Salaam City and Singida rural district. Desk study, field visits, discussions and personal observations were used for collecting information. Water supply coverage is 73% and 53% for urban and rural areas, respectively. Only 30% of the population in Dar es Salaam is served by piped water. The unserved poorer segments of the population pay higher for water services. The water distribution systems are worn out and account for 60% of water loss. Inadequate coverage of water supply is associated with prevalence of waterborne diseases. Urban water authorities are inefficient in financial management. Water tariffs are low, ranging between US$ 0.25 and US$ 0.35/m3/month and unregistered customers exceed 110, 000. Singida rural water sources include dams, shallow and deep wells. About 70% of installed pumps are impaired owing to poor management. Rural populations use polluted sources which are purified using local seeds. Finally the paper gives recommendations for improving water supply services.</jats:p>",

Either if the production technology exhibits strong nonconvexity or if the utility function has a high elasticity of intertemporal substitution, then there may exist dual balanced-growth equilibria and the impact of a change in money growth depends on which steady state is realized in the long run.

On the one hand, the introduction of modularisation suggests that buyer and supplier firms should move towards greater collaboration in order to co‐develop products and reduce interface constraints. On the other hand, the standardisation of interfaces suggests that buyer firms could introduce a “black box” approach to component design, holding suppliers at arm's‐length and reducing dependence.

However, communication patterns between participants that emerge in a supply chain tend to distort the original consumer’s demand and create high levels of noise. In this article, we compare the performance of new machine learning (ML)-based forecasting techniques with the more traditional methods. To this end we used the data from a chocolate manufacturer, a toner cartridge manufacturer, as well as from the Statistics Canada manufacturing survey. A representative set of traditional and ML-based forecasting techniques have been applied to the demand data and the accuracy of the methods was compared. As a group, based on ranking, the average performance of the ML techniques does not outperform the traditional approaches. However, using a support vector machine (SVM) that is trained on multiple demand series has produced the most accurate forecasts.</p>",

Previous scholarly attempts to calculate these variables are surveyed. As part of the study of land, soil and climate are examined, as well as the extent of arable space, taking into account the use of terracing. As part of the study of land use, the conventional and revised models of Greek farming are compared. The results confirm the continuing usefulness of the former, which would indicate that half of the cultivable land of Attica required fallowing each year, and that natural fertilizers were insufficiently available to overcome this need or to escape relatively low yields. It is argued that the figures of imported grain transmitted by Demosthenes are reliable, and that recent attempts to demonstrate the opposite are unsatisfactory.</jats:p>",

As a form of validation, we apply the model to the Celanese acetic acid supply chain and show that inventory metrics of the new model differ by more than 30 percent from those derived through the simpler modeling approach of aggregating a review period into lead time. </jats:p>",

Archaeological evidence from this deme and its neighbors on the southern Athenian plain and the coastal strip of Attica west of Hymettos is examined, particularly aerial photography showing the systematic use of terracing and roads. The deme's demography and economy are examined in the context of the pattern of settlement in the countryside, and the coordinated efforts of neighboring communities. It is argued that the intensive cultivation of cash crops (especially olives), the economic and social interdependence of neighbouring Attic demes, and their reliance on the urban market of Athens, were the basis of the economy of the Athenian countryside in the Classical period. The division sometimes seen by modern scholars between urban and rural life in Athens is therefore fundamentally incorrect.</jats:p>",

The complexity of event distribution channels is influenced by the event's target market, capacity, partnership relationships, and other factors.

In the first model, each stage has a fixed-order quantity, while in the second model, there is a fixed-order cost for external supplies. For each model, we show that the optimal policy parameters can be bounded and approximated by a series of independent, single-stage optimal policy parameters. We further construct closed-form bounds and approximations for the single-stage solutions and apply them to the serial systems. These results provide simple and effective solutions that will help to facilitate implementations in practice. They also allow us to see the connections between the serial and single-stage systems and sharpen our intuition on optimal policy parameters and system behavior. </jats:p>",

Supply of this nature has been argued to be sufficiently different to “dealing proper” to justify a different criminal justice approach in relation to it. This has been argued to be particularly true regarding social supply among young people who use substances such as cannabis. This research involved interviews with 192 cannabis users in six (three rural, three urban) locations in England. Most were exclusively cannabis users. Nearly half (45%) had been involved in some form of supply, and 78% reported sharing their cannabis with others. Nearly all supply events were between friends within a close age range. The findings suggest that there is little contact by young cannabis users to the wider drug market and that it may be better to understand this activity as taking place in an “arena of transaction” rather than seeing it as an extension of the normally conceived drug market. We argue that there is sufficient difference within this arena of transaction from the wider drug market for most activity there to be dealt with less punitively by the criminal justice system. </jats:p>",

During the same period of time, acid precipitation and forest harvest have removed substantial quantities of base cations from soil. Because of the dominance of base‐poor soils and the low rates of atmospheric base cation deposition, soils throughout the northeastern United States may be increasingly rich in N but poor in calcium (Ca). We studied the consequences of a change in soil N and Ca availability on forest composition by transplanting seedlings of four tree species into replicate plots in the understory and in canopy gaps amended with N and Ca in factorial combination. In this paper, we report on the growth and survivorship of seedlings over a four‐year period.</jats:p><jats:p>Relative to control plots, fertilization with N increased red maple growth by an average of 39% whereas fertilization with Ca decreased survivorship in the understory by 41%. In sugar maple, fertilization with Ca increased growth by 232% and 46% in the forest understory and in canopy gaps, respectively, and significantly increased high light survivorship. Fertilization with N decreased white pine survivorship by 69% in the understory whereas high Ca availability significantly increased survivorship. Fertilization with N or Ca alone reduced red oak growth but had no effect on survivorship. The results of this study suggest that historical losses of soil Ca and the continuing effects of atmospheric‐N deposition on N availability are likely to alter the composition of northeastern North American forests because of the positive effects of N enrichment on the growth of red maple and the negative effects of Ca loss on the growth and survivorship of sugar maple and white pine.</jats:p>",

Goldstein and co‐workers pioneered the field of enzymatic conversion of blood group A and B red blood cells (RBCs) to O (ECO). Using α‐galactosidase from coffee beans to produce B‐ECO RBCs, proof of principle for this revolutionary concept was achieved in clinical trials. However, because this enzyme has poor kinetic properties and low pH optimum the process was not economically viable. Conversion of group A RBCs was only achieved with the weak A<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> subgroup with related enzymes having acidic pH optima. More recently, the identification of entirely new families of bacterial exoglycosidases with remarkably improved kinetic properties for cleaving A and B antigens has reinvigorated the field. Enzymatic conversion of groups A, B and AB RBCs with these novel enzymes resulting in ECO RBCs typing as O can now be achieved with low enzyme protein consumption, short incubation times and at neutral pH. Presently, clinical trials evaluating safety and efficacy of ECO RBCs are ongoing. Here, we review the status of the ECO technology, its impact and potential for introduction into clinical component preparation laboratories.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Consider a firm developing an innovative product. Due to market pressures, production must begin soon after the product development effort is complete, which requires that an upstream supplier invests in capacity while the design of the product and production process are in flux. Because the product is ill-defined at this point in time, the firms are unable to write court-enforceable contracts that specify the terms of trade or the supplier's capacity investment. However, the firms can adopt an informal agreement (relational contract) regarding the terms of trade and capacity investment. The potential for future business provides incentive for the firms to adhere to the relational contract. We show that the optimal relational contract may be complex, requiring the buyer to order more than her demand to indirectly monitor the supplier's capacity investment. We propose a simpler relational contract and show that it performs very well for a broad range of parameters. Finally, we identify characteristics of the business environment that make relational contracting particularly valuable. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The aim of this paper is to investigate the reliability parameters estimation method for the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems using the fault tree analysis (FTA) technique. FTA is a top‐down approach to identify all potential causes leading to system failure. The computation of the system's failure probability is the main goal of this analysis, as this value can be used to calculate other important system reliability parameters such as failure rates, mean time between failures (MTBFs) and reliability. In this paper, the FTA method was applied to five different UPS topologies and the results obtained were compared and discussed in detail. By comparing the critical fault path of the system, it was found that the inverter failures contributed most significantly to the system failure. It was also found that the probability of failure of a UPS system can be reduced by the inclusion of bypass supply, given that the failure rate of the events that causing the failure of the bypass supply should be lower compared to the main utility supply. Finally, to validate the results obtained from this method, comparisons were made to the results from other methods such as the reliability block diagram (RBD), Boolean Truth Table, probability tree, Monte‐Carlo simulation and field data reliability estimation methods.

The research investigates the links among organizational structure (formalization and integration), supply chain process variability, and performance as moderated by environmental uncertainty. We found that in a predictable demand environment, only formal control affects supply chain process variability, leading to improved financial results; but in an unpredictable demand environment, only cross‐functional integration affects supply chain process variability, leading to improved financial performance. We also examined whether supply chain process variability is a complete or partial mediator of the relationship between organizational structure and performance, and found that: (1) in a predictable demand environment, supply chain process variability completely mediates the relationship between formal control and performance and (2) in an unpredictable demand environment, supply chain process variability partially mediates the relationship between integration and performance. Supply chain process variability has an inverse relationship with financial performance, regardless of the demand environment; and organizational structure provides managers with the mechanisms to mitigate this variability's detrimental impact on financial performance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The influence of time–temperature becomes important when the presence of this organism is found in commercial shell eggs. A computer‐aided mathematical model was validated to estimate surface and interior temperature of shell eggs under variable ambient and refrigerated storage temperature. A risk assessment of <jats:italic>S. enteritidis</jats:italic> based on the use of this model, coupled with <jats:italic>S. enteritidis</jats:italic> kinetics, has already been reported in a companion paper published earlier in <jats:italic>JFS</jats:italic>. The model considered the actual geometry and composition of shell eggs and was solved by numerical techniques (finite differences and finite elements). Parameters of interest such as local (<jats:italic>h</jats:italic>) and global (<jats:italic>U</jats:italic>) heat transfer coefficient, thermal conductivity, and apparent volumetric specific heat were estimated by an inverse procedure from experimental temperature measurement. In order to assess the error in predicting microbial population growth, theoretical and experimental temperatures were applied to a <jats:italic>S. enteritidis</jats:italic> growth model taken from the literature. Errors between values of microbial population growth calculated from model predicted compared with experimentally measured temperatures were satisfactorily low: 1.1% and 0.8% for the finite difference and finite element model, respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The growing world population increases the demand for water, energy, and land. This demand for natural resources impacts the transport of material and the supply of nutrients in the coastal ocean by rivers. We assess the potential impact of river N, Si, Fe, and organic carbon (OC) fluxes on the global and coastal ocean biogeochemistry, using an ocean biogeochemistry model and observations, in eight different scenarios. We assess two extreme scenarios, one with no river nutrients, corresponding to a complete stop of nutrient input by rivers, and one with high nutrient fluxes, corresponding to a world population of 12 billion people. Compared to today's scenario values, primary production (PP) changes from −5% to +5% for the open ocean, and from −16% to +5% for the coastal ocean. In the coastal ocean the impact of river nutrients on PP depends on regional nutrient limitation. River inputs have a larger impact on PP in areas where upwelling and high runoff are combined. The coastal ocean is typically N‐ or Si‐limited. River Fe not assimilated by the phytoplankton is exported to open ocean areas, and its fertilizing effect depletes coastal and open ocean surface waters from N and Si. The impact on PP is reflected on global ocean low‐O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>areas whose extent changes from −16% to +23% across the range of scenarios. River nutrients have a modest impact on the global ocean CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>sink of up to 0.4 Pg C a<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, depending on the amount of inorganic and organic carbon transported by the rivers.</jats:p>",

We show that during the planetary-nebula phase of these stars, mass loss can lead to the expansion of all planetary bodies. The orbital eccentricity of the minor bodies, as relics of planetesimals, may be largely excited by the perturbation due to both gas drag effects and nearby gas giant planets. Some of these bodies migrate toward the host star, while others are scattered out of the planetary system. The former have modest probability of being captured by the sweeping secular resonances of giant planets, and induced to migrate toward the host star. When they venture close to their host stars, their orbits are tidally circularized so that they form compact disks where they may undergo further collisionally driven evolution. During the subsequent post main sequence evolution of their host stars, this process may provide an avenue which continually channels heavy elements onto the surface of the white dwarfs. We suggest that this scenario provides an explanation for the recently discovered Calcium line variation in G29-38.</jats:p>",

The problem of interest is motivated by the practice of an original equipment manufacturer in the automotive industry that provides service parts for vehicle maintenance and repair. We provide an effective problem formulation that is amenable to efficient Benders reformulation and an exact solution approach. More specifically, we develop an efficient dual solution approach to generate strong Benders cuts, and, in addition to the classical single Benders cut approach, we propose three different approaches for adding multiple Benders cuts. These cuts are obtained via dual problem disaggregation based either on the forward and reverse flows, or the products, or both. We present computational results which illustrate the superior performance of the proposed solution methodology with multiple Benders cuts in comparison to the branch‐and‐cut approach as well as the traditional Benders decomposition approach with a single cut. In particular, we observe that the use of multiple Benders cuts generates stronger lower bounds and promotes faster convergence to optimality. We also observe that if the model parameters are such that the different costs are not balanced, but, rather, are biased towards one of the major cost categories (processing, transportation or fixed location costs), the time required to obtain the optimal solution decreases considerably when using the proposed solution methodology as well as the branch‐and‐cut approach. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A decision-support model for determining the feasibility of a planned energy-from-waste (EfW) investment for an integrated waste management and energy supply system is presented. The aim is to present an easy-to-understand, inexpensive and fast-to-use tool to decision-makers for modelling and evaluating different kinds of processes. Special emphasis is put on forming the model and interpretation of the results of the example case. The simple integrated system management (SISMan) model is presented through a practical example of the use of the model. In the example the viability of the described system is studied by comparing five different cases including different waste-derived fuels (WDF), non-segregated municipal solid waste (MSW) being one of the fuel options. The nominal power output of the EfW plant varied in each case according to the WDF classification. The numeric values for two main variables for each WDF type were determined, the WDF price at the gate of the EfW plant and the waste management fee (WMF) according to the `polluter pays' -principle. Comparison between the five cases was carried out according to two determinants, the WMF related to each case and the recovery rate related to each case. The numeric values for the constants and variables used in the calculations were chosen as realistically as possible using available data related to the issue. In the example of this paper, the mass-incineration solution (`pure' MSW as a fuel) was found to be the most viable solution for the described system according to the calculations. However, the final decision of the decision-makers might differ from this in the real world due to extra `fuzzy' information that cannot be reliably included in the calculations. This paper shows that certain key values of modelled systems can be calculated using an easy-to-use tool at the very early stages of a larger design process involving municipal and business partners. The use of this kind of tools could significantly decrease the overall design costs of large systems in the long run by cutting out irrational system options at the very beginning of the planning. </jats:p>",

Almost no bromate formed during preozonation. An ozone dose of 2.0 mg/L (0.5 mg/L and 1.5 mg/L for pre‐ and postozonation, respectively) was found to be the optimal dosage for the maximum removal of organics (65% of THMFP, 52% of TOC, 63% of COD<jats:sub>Mn</jats:sub>, and 84% of UV<jats:sub>254</jats:sub>) while keeping bromate under 5 μg/L.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Iron is an essential nutrient and plays an important role in the control of phytoplankton growth (Martin et al., 1989). Atmospheric dust has been thought to be the most important source of iron, supporting annual biological production in the western subarctic Pacific (WSP) (Duce and Tindale, 1991; Moore et al., 2002). We argue here for another source of iron to the WSP. We found extremely high concentrations of dissolved and particulate iron in the Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water (OSIW) and the North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW), and water ventilation processes in this region probably control the transport of iron through the intermediate water layer from the continental shelf of the Sea of Okhotsk to wide areas of the WSP. Additionally, our time series data in the Oyashio region of the WSP indicate that the pattern of seasonal changes in dissolved iron concentrations in the surface‐mixed layer was similar to that of macronutrients, and that deep vertical water mixing resulted in higher winter concentrations of iron in the surface water of this region. The estimated dissolved iron supply from the iron‐rich intermediate waters to the surface waters in the Oyashio region was comparable to or higher than the reported atmospheric dust iron input and thus a major source of iron to these regions. Our data suggest that the consideration of this source of iron is essential in our understanding of spring biological production and biogeochemical cycles in the western subarctic Pacific and the role of the marginal sea.</jats:p>",

Stained bi‐centrifugated‐Cis‐I‐4 latex was injected in arterial vessels responsible for penis vascularization throughout the abdominal portion of aorta. The samples were fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution and arteries were dissected. The penile artery is originated as a branch of internal pudendal artery. At the level of ischiatic arch, the penile artery project two branches, the penile dorsal and the deep arteries; those arteries irrigates the penile dorsal surface and the corpus cavernosum penis. The penile dorsal arteries have an independent course up to the glans penis.

On the other hand, unrestricted information push may serve to distract, overwhelm, and overload individuals and teams, thereby compromising their situation awareness and decision-making effectiveness. The question remains, how much information is enough? The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of information availability on decision-making by utilizing a four-person supply chain management simulation. View of information and communication were manipulated to constrain information availability. Results indicated better performance for conditions with more information availability, including unrestricted information push. Overall, these results illustrated the importance of capabilities such as anticipation and redundancy, which seem to be vital to collaborative tasks. </jats:p>",

Gross external rotation of the hip gave a significant decrease in oxygenation of the femoral head. Straightening the limb led to recovery in oxygen concentration, indicating that the blood supply was maintained. The oxygen concentration at the end of the procedure was not significantly different from that at the start. </jats:p><jats:p> The anterolateral approach appears to produce less disruption to the blood flow in the femoral head-neck junction than the posterior approach for patients undergoing hip resurfacing.

Increasing competitive pressures and market globalization are forcing firms to develop supply chains that can quickly respond to customer needs. To remain competitive and decrease inventory, these firms must use multi-echelon inventory management interactively, while reducing operating costs and improving customer service. The current paper reviews the literature, addressing multiechelon inventory management in supply chains from 1996 to 2005. The behaviour of the papers against demand and lead-time uncertainty is the key analysis point of the literature review presented here and it is conducted from an operational research point of view. Finally, directions for future research are suggested. </jats:p>",

For entering teachers, the reserve pool was the predominant source of supply of both SETs and GETs. However, only 46% of first-time SETs completed extensive teacher preparation with degree majors in their primary areas of teaching, whereas the comparable figure for GETs was 82%. As an indication of the inadequate supply of extensively prepared teachers in special education, about 28% of first-time teachers hired in special education positions had completed teacher preparation in general education. Finally, a modest decline in the supply of degree graduates in special education has occurred since 1997–98 in spite of the increasing quantity demand for entering SETs. </jats:p>",
