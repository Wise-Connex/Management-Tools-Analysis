The article highlights that decision-making is the difficult, but necessary, last step to arrive at a portfolio of projects that do not overload resources and clog the engineering pipeline. The four-step resource management process that a company has implemented helps management visualize and understand the effects of their project decisions. It also helps engineering managers identify resource shortages. The key to implementing this system is to build solid communication processes, get key organizational participation, and have the discipline to keep at it every month. The article also suggests that if a company is to use a software tool to facilitate and enable the process, keep it as simple and effective as the process itself.</jats:p>",

A graphical user interface links the different parts of the system. The system was applied to a water supply area located close to a major road south of Stockholm. Chloride was used as an indicator in determining the risk for groundwater contamination from the road. The future chloride concentration in the aquifer was predicted and the effects of different pumping rates on the chemistry of the water supply well were tested. Modelling results showed that the chloride concentration in the aquifer will increase substantially due to road de-icing and that it will take decades to lower the chloride concentration down to the original background values after an end to the use of de-icing salt. The system may serve as a valuable tool in a planning context. Potential groundwater contamination scenarios can be simulated, and alternative groundwater management strategies can be evaluated.</jats:p>",

A favourable increasing trend for the supply of fruit and vegetables was observed in most Mediterranean countries. However, an increase in the supply of meats and dairy products and a decrease in the supply of cereals and wine were observed in European Mediterranean countries from 1961 until 2001. Only in African and Asiatic Mediterranean countries were cereals the base of food supply. During the 1990s, Greece's food supply pattern was closest to the traditional Mediterranean diet, while Italy and Spain maintained a high availability of fruits, vegetables and olive oil, but were losing the other typical components. Among African and Asiatic Mediterranean countries, only Turkey presented a traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern except with respect to olive oil, the supply of which was very low. France showed a Western dietary pattern, with a high supply of animal products and a low supply of olive oil.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"S1368980006000097_sec05\" sec-type=\"conclusion\"><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>Dietary supplies in the Mediterranean area were quite heterogeneous in the 1960s and have experienced a process of Westernization, especially in European Mediterranean countries.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

By using Microsoft Distributed interNet Application (DNA) and Active ServicePage (ASP), the supply chain management system, consisting of three sections, shipyards, suppliers, and administrator, exchanges and transfers the information ofenterprise's system. Through applying XML to conduct the information exchange, weintegrate the formats of orders for several yacht manufacturers and suppliers, develop the system of placing orders online, and edit XML documents to exchange the information in the system. E-catalogs that are easy to preserve and update will replace the traditional paper catalogs hereafter. The various demands of accessories will result in an increase in the costs of production and logistics. Through this system, yacht manufacturers can search the material of E-catalogs and purchase online directly. Meanwhile, it will allow the suppliers to update the E-catalogs regularly to be more competitive in the market. Taiwan Ship Net can provide the newest information to foreign customers and communicate with all yacht companies, equipment suppliers, and manufacturers in Taiwan.</jats:p>",

The Hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) is a basic concept that underlies the WSPs, and is also known as the product quality management method in the field of food and the medical manufacturing industries. In the amendments of the Drinking Water Quality Standards in Japan, water suppliers are required to reasonably achieve both safe water and efficient water quality management.

In comparison to conventional applications of the HACCP, unmanageable variations of raw water quality, continuous treatment and supply, and numerous standards of water quality items need to be considered. The HACCP system is expected to achieve a quick response to improvements in water quality, accountability towards consumers and a decrease in accidents.</jats:p>",

A model based-upon bed-by-bed description of over 3500 boreholes was sub-horizontally ‘sliced’ to analyse the composition of sediments in different parts of the estuary across the entire fill, as well as solely within estuary marginal sequences. Results demonstrate that different physiographic parts of the estuary are characterized by distinctive vertical sediment profiles that reflect the relative control of antecedent topography as well as sea-level upon them. The results raise questions about the processes controlling sand and gravel abundance in marginal sequences, where the estuary is physiographically most constrained. This semi-quantitative evaluation, the first of its kind on an estuarine fill, provides a technique for interpreting the relative importance of controls on an estuarine system, but highlights the need for improved modelling of estuarine channel form and dynamics over centurial to millennial time-scales.</jats:p>",

Nitrogen supply rates and concentrations were measured over 6 mo in unvegetated pots using PRS™ probes and KCl extraction, respectively. Biomass of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) and N uptake of orchardgrass were measured. Repeated measures analysis revealed significant amendment × rate × time interaction effects for N supply rate and concentration. Of total N applied, available N was 50 to 70% in the FM and PM treatments, 10 to 40% in the AA treatments, and 10% in the VC treatments. High rates of FM and PM were toxic to lettuce but produced good orchard grass yields. VC was safe for lettuce but low N availability limited long-term orchardgrass growth. Higher application rates did not result in corresponding increases in nutrient supply.

One hundred ninety‐five living donor kidney transplant recipients that had neither ischemic injury, episode of rejection, nor any complication were included. Weights and heights of both donors and recipients were recorded to calculate body surface area, lean body weight, and body mass index. The donated kidney was weighed just after cold flush, and the recipient's serum creatinine (Scr) was measured on a daily basis post‐operatively. When the recipient's Scr reached the baseline, a 24‐h urine was collected for the amount of proteinuria (Upr), creatinine excretion (Ucr) and creatinine clearance (Ccr) calculation. The effect of donor and recipient gender was analysed by independent sample <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>‐test. On average, male donors and recipients were heavier and taller than females. However, the mass of kidneys donated from men and women were not statistically different. The gender‐related differences in post‐transplant Scr and Ucr of recipients were associated with the differences in the parameters of metabolic demands of recipients rather than with the weight of implanted kidney (renal mass supply) or with pre‐operative renal functions of donors (functional supply). The early graft function is not determined by donor gender. The effect of recipient gender on the graft function depends on the metabolic demands, which are higher in male recipients.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Future changes to climate in the Great Lakes may have important consequences for fisheries. Evidence suggests that Great Lakes air and water temperatures have risen and the duration of ice cover has lessened during the past century. Global circulation models (GCMs) suggest future warming and increases in precipitation in the region. We present new evidence that water temperatures have risen in Lake Erie, particularly during summer and winter in the period 19652000. GCM forecasts coupled with physical models suggest lower annual runoff, less ice cover, and lower lake levels in the future, but the certainty of these forecasts is low. Assessment of the likely effects of climate change on fish stocks will require an integrative approach that considers several components of habitat rather than water temperature alone. We recommend using mechanistic models that couple habitat conditions to population demographics to explore integrated effects of climate-caused habitat change and illustrate this approach with a model for Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreum). We show that the combined effect on walleye populations of plausible changes in temperature, river hydrology, lake levels, and light penetration can be quite different from that which would be expected based on consideration of only a single factor. </jats:p>",
