With small populations, a large nutrient supply was required to reach the maximal yield of roots, but with large plant populations the same nutrient rate depressed yield. This interaction is illustrated by a response surface, and reasons for it are discussed. The interaction is of limited importance in practice because it was small over the range of population and nutrient supply commonly used. Even with small populations, the compensation achieved by applying more fertilizer was uneconomic. On crops with large populations, such as swedes for human consumption, however, the normal recommended rate of fertilizer should not be exceeded because of loss of yield as well as increased cost. More fertilizer and greater plant density were needed to give maximal total yield (roots + tops) than of roots alone. Effects of nutrient supply and plant population on plant establishment and dry-matter content of the swedes are discussed.</jats:p>",
