Firms are first separated into three levels in the supply chain — final assemblers, top‐tier suppliers, and tertiary‐tier suppliers. The study also separates firms into three industry groups — automotive, electronics, and others. A mailed survey was used to collect the data. The analysis found no statistical difference in the level of quality management practices across the supply chain. This contradicts the general speculation that tertiary‐tier suppliers have fallen behind final assemblers and top‐tier suppliers in quality management practices. However, the results did reveal an industry effect regarding strategic quality planning. The manufacturers in the automotive industrywere more active in strategic quality planning than their counterparts in the electronics industry.</jats:p>",

Items/services made (subjected to make or buy investigations) are characterized by low product complexity and low commercial uncertainty. On the contrary, items/services bought and new items/services (subjected to make or buy investigations) are characterized by high product complexity and high commercial uncertainty. The involvement of functions and hierarchical levels in make or buy investigations for new items/services was found to be relatively low. This fact increases the risk of making erroneous decisions that have a serious impact on the competitive position and profitability of enterprises.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>In today's business world characterized by intense global competition, cost management is an important strategic weapon. External purchases of products and services generally account for more than 50 percent of total costs. Significant cost savings can be realized by effectively selecting suppliers and determining optimal order quantities. Existing cost management tools focus on rationalizing production and distribution activities and do not consider the purchasing function. In practice, simple, subjective, and incomplete approaches for supplier selection are often used. This article presents a rigorous decision support system using total cost of ownership information. The system uses a dynamic mathematical programming model that derives a purchasing strategy by minimizing the total costs, taking into account the relevant constraints. It allows the purchasing and supply manager to objectively evaluate alternative policies. A recent implementation of the system for two product groups at Cockerill Sambre shows potential savings of more than 10 percent compared to current practices.</jats:p>",

This paper uses MSA‐level data on the average size of homebuilder establishments and homebuilder market concentration to test the appropriateness of this paradigm. The data reveal a wide and systematic variation across metropolitan‐area housing markets in both the average size of builders and the market share for the largest builders in an MSA. These results are more consistent with treating homebuilders as monopolistically competitive suppliers of a differentiated product than with treating them as perfectly competitive homogeneous firms. Builders are larger in more active housing markets and where there is a greater supply of readily developed land suitable for large developments. Builder size and concentration are sensitive to the type of regulating jurisdiction imposing land‐use regulation. Both are lower when land‐use regulations are imposed by smaller jurisdictions, and this is particularly true when the smaller jurisdictions impose more intense regulation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine evidence for supply-side explanations of occupational sex segregation, using the 1979–93 NLSY. Supply-side explanations, such as those derived from neoclassical economic theory and gender socialization, look to individual characteristics of workers, such as values, aspirations, and roles, to explain occupational outcomes. Contrary to human capital theory, we find no tendency for individuals with early plans for employment intermittency or more actual breaks in employment to work in predominantly female occupations. This suggests that women who anticipate breaks in employment do not choose female occupations because of lower wage penalties for time out of the labor force. A second neoclassical view, from the theory of compensating differentials, posits that women sacrifice some pay for “mother-friendly” features of jobs. Consistent with this, white and Latina mothers are in more female jobs than are nonmothers, but the opposite is true for African-American women. The gender socialization perspective posits a long-term effect of gendered attitudes and aspirations formed in youth. Consistent with this, we find that those aspiring to or expecting to work in predominantly female jobs are in more heavily female jobs fourteen years later. Also, for women (but not men), more liberal gender role attitudes predicts working in a more sex-typical occupation. For men (but not women), having had either a father or mother who worked in a female occupation predicts working in a more heavily female occupation. </jats:p>",

This approach involves input from a range of representatives from within the organisation, thereby avoiding the often misguided pursuit of “hobby horses”. The approach described has been derived from matrix‐based methods of Japanese origins, in particular quality function deployment (QFD). The strength of these matrix‐based techniques lies in their ability to integrate the many qualitative and quantitative‐based variables that impact the supply chain. From the matrix, a meaningful and coherent strategy for improvement can be determined. The approach is appealing in its simplicity and yet rigorous at the same time, and, as such, may be of use to practitioners in any complex environment such as a supply chain.</jats:p>",

However, the probability of an aggregate stock-out is effectively zero in most markets most of the time.

It is based on a thyristor-switched, high-voltage, high-current, pulse-forming network (PFN). It can provide high pulsed currents (up to 2 kA), with duration of 600 μs, and pulse repetition rate of up to 10 Hz. Higher repetition rates are possible at lower current. The rectangular pulse shape and amplitude are reproducible to within a few percent. Cathodic arc initiation is extremely reliable because the charging voltage is much higher than the minimum starting voltage for the triggerless arc initiation method. The energy utilization efficiency is very high by intentionally mismatching load and PFN impedances and by using an efficiency-enhancing diode; the stored energy is dissipated primarily in the arc.</jats:p>",

Econometric issues raised by earlier supply studies are discussed and tested for. The paper also discusses the rationale for, and tests the existence of, a backward-bending supply relationship, and finds that supply is concave in both periods, and 'bends backwards' during the boom. Evidence of a structural break between boom and bust is found, producing average price elasticities of supply noticeably smaller in the boom (0.58) than in the slump (1.03), with considerable variation across disticts. Land supply elasticities are found to be more stable over time, and marginally greater in the boom (0.75) than in the slump (0.71). The paper also calculates second partial derivatives based on the whole demand-supply system to obtain estimates of the impact of land release on new house prices. </jats:p>",

Ideally, these pricing incentives can lead to lower costs for both the buyer and the seller. In this paper, a situation is examined where a steel distributor faces stiff competition in its highly undifferentiated service offerings and price is the primary factor in attracting sales. A model is developed that quantifies the benefits to the supplier from obtaining advanced commitments from downstream customers. This model can be used to suggest the maximum price discount that can be offered to customers to encourage them to commit to their orders in advance. Careful balancing of the advanced ordering time with the price discount can lead to cost reductions for both members of the supply channel.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

At the same time, foreign direct investment is increasingly being touted as a new form of development assistance, and transnational corporations as new aid agents. However, the ideology of the free market is incongruous with the people‐centredness of contemporary development theory. The result is a polarisation between participatory development and market driven paradigms. This study introduced the models of instrumental and transformative participation and the way they influence information flow and communication. These models are used to examine a project proponent’s and stakeholder’s actions in a privatised development setting, using a Philippine case study. The case study is the Bohol‐Cebu water supply project, a project of water capture, treatment, and transmission, linking the islands of Bohol and Cebu. Communication and information dissemination between the project proponent and stakeholders is viewed under the requirements of Philippine legislation for participation in development. The findings from this research suggest that the proponent tended to exclude or only partially include affected stakeholders in the development process. Sources of information were often nongovernmental organisations, the Church, and, in many instances, the media. The proponent’s method of disseminating information was primarily to target the municipal or provincial government level, thus disenfranchising the ‘grass roots’</jats:p>",

The duration of stage‐one transpiration is found to be controlled by the storage capacity of the root zone, the potential transpiration rate, and the soil desorptivity and drainage properties, which in turn influence the net of upward and downward moisture fluxes through the bottom of the root zone. During stage‐two transpiration the root zone lower boundary behaves like a dry surface, and the transpiration rate is supply‐limited by the upward flux to this boundary. These findings are combined with a similarity solution for the upward flux rate (including the influence of gravity) in order to derive an analytic approximation for the time to onset of stage‐two transpiration. This estimated time to stress<jats:italic>t<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic>, along with a rate scale defined by the time average flux in the root zone prior to stress, can be used to nondimensionalize the relation between stage‐two transpiration and time in similar fashion to the bare soil evaporation analysis of<jats:italic>Salvucci</jats:italic>[1997].

The work of the OECD Public Management Committee (PUMA) on ethics and corruption prevention supports OECD Member countries in their efforts to improve their systems of governance and public sector management. Specifically, this work aims to help governments monitor the broader public service environment in order to maintain effective frameworks for promoting integrity and preventing corruption on the part of public officials. In OECD work on public sector ethics, corruption is seen as more than individual criminal actions, but rather the result of systemic failure and a management problem. This is manifested by low-quality legislation and by weak public institutions that do not enforce laws, and, even more, fail to provide adequate control, oversight, and transparency. </jats:p>",

To facilitate interorganizational e-commerce it is often necessary to share supply and demand information between supply chain partners. Based on our analysis of supply chains in several industries we identify the mechanisms (business processes) required for effective supply chain management. We also identify the information system components needed to support these mechanisms, show how the individual components can be integrated into an information infrastructure framework and identify some technologies currently available that can fit within our proposed infrastructure. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework by simulating convergent assembly (commonly associated with motor vehicle and aerospace production) supply chain performance under various information-sharing strategies supported by our proposed infrastructure. We find that inventory costs can be reduced while maintaining acceptable order fulfilment cycle times. This is true because information, which provides the basis for enhanced coordination and reduced uncertainty, can substitute for inventory. </jats:p>",

The research built on previous studies to define an approach that would be practical and easy to apply. A pragmatic methodology using a series of forms with clear guidelines was developed.

The basic function of homeostasis is to maintain the body’s internal status of the trace elements within physiologically tolerable margins by controlling at least one of the major trace element fluxes: the true absorption of the trace elements from the diet into the body, the reflux from the body into the faeces (endogenous faecal excretion), and the urinary excretion. Furthermore iodine may be a candidate to homeostatic regulation since dietary iodine contents may vary over a wide range and it may be important to the organism to maintain a constant internal status also of this essential trace element. However, quantitative iodine balance measurements are hardly available from the literature and thus knowledge about the existence of iodine homeostasis and its mode of action is still fragmentary. An additional problem also was the lack of appropriate methods to quantify true absorption and endogenous faecal excretion of iodine. However, a recent study has overcome this methodological barrier by adapting the isotope‐dilution technique to iodine (W\n\t\t\t\t\t<jats:sc>indisch</jats:sc> et al. 1999). Therefore, the aim of the present experiment was to quantify possible homeostatic adaptations of iodine metabolism to dietary iodine ranging from deficient to excessive supplies and to measure the interactions to tissue iodine.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper assesses the supply of business advice using new empirical evidence from a large‐scale survey of SMEs. The chief focus of the paper is on a comparison of suppliers that operate in different environments of regulation, contract and reputation. The paper argues that interaction intensity varies with the level of information asymmetry of these different environments, between different types of service supplier and their clients. Interaction intensity between suppliers also varies as a result of the level of trust they enjoy: for example, the low trust enjoyed by consultants appears to encourage higher intensity of interaction which improves the tailoring of the service to the client's needs and enhances impact. The paper assesses interaction intensity using the existence of site visits and/or a written brief/contract as indicators. Although these measures have limitations, the paper demonstrates clear and significant differences between suppliers in terms of interaction intensity, use of contracts and impact in three broad categories: private‐sector consultancy (low trust, high intensity, high impact), business associations (high trust, low intensity, moderate impact) and government support agencies (moderate trust, moderate to high intensity, moderate or low impact). Multivariate estimation methods demonstrate that significant differences in interaction intensity, use of contracts and impact by client type are much less important than differences in supplier type. This indicates that suppliers generally develop more into niche service fields or groups of services rather than niches related to types of firm.</jats:p>",

Four diets were formulated to differ in their rate and extent of OM and N release in the rumen based on the sum of in situ degradability data of the ingredients. All diets were formulated to have a similar metabolizable energy (10·4 MJ/kg dry matter (DM)), crude protein (140 g/kg DM) and daily ratio of N : OM released (34 g N per kg OM) and were either synchronous or asynchronous with respect to their hourly N : OM release. The four diets were slow energy, synchronous (SS), slow energy asynchronous (SA), fast energy, synchronous (FS) and fast energy asynchronous (FA). In both experiments the diets were offered at a rate of 1·75 maintenance energy requirements as two equal meals at 09:00 and 17:00 h. In experiment 1 there was no significant effect of diet on OM apparent digestibility or N retention. Lambs given diet FS had the highest daily production of allantoin (7·82 mmol per day; P &lt; 0·05) and microbial N (7·80 g/day; P &lt; 0Ό5). Hourly plasma urea and ß-hydroxy butyrate (3-OHB) concentrations exhibited a cyclical trend between meals with maximum concentrations occurring within 3 h of feeding and were higher in lambs given diet FA.</jats:p><jats:p>In experiment 2 the four diets were offered to 32 growing ram lambs. Animals given synchronous diets (SS and FS) had a significantly higher live-weight gain than those given asynchronous diets (SA and FA; (132 g/day v. 107 g/day respectively; P &lt; 0·001). Food conversion efficiency (FCE; kg gain per kg DM intake) was improved proportionately by 0·23 in animals offered synchronous diets compared with asynchronous diets (P &lt; 0·001). There was little effect of diet on carcass composition except kidney fat, which was greater in lambs offered the synchronous diets (P &lt; 0·01). Plasma 3-OHB concentrations were higher throughout the growth period in lambs given diet FA whilst plasma urea concentrations were greater in lambs given the diet SS. In conclusion, greater attention to the formulation of diets to be synchronous for their hourly release of N : OM in the rumen can improve the growth rate and FCE of lambs. This effect may be due to an improvement in energy rather than N metabolism.</jats:p>",
