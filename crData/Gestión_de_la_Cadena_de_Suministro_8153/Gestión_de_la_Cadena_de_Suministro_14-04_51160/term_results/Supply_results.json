This study uses data from 617 Chinese manufacturing firms to investigate the relationships among competitive environments, supply chain information sharing (SCIS), and supply chain performance. The results of structural equation modeling analysis show that (i) international competition is positively related to all three types of SCIS whereas local competition is not significantly related to any of the three types, (ii) internal information sharing is positively related to external information sharing with suppliers and customers, and (iii) internal information sharing and information sharing with customers are positively related to superior supply chain performance, whereas supplier information sharing is not significantly related to performance. The findings enhance our understanding of the relationships among competitive environment, SCIS, and supply chain performance in Chinese manufacturing settings. </jats:p>",

Changes in household water consumption characteristics affect the extent of the adverse effects caused when water supply restrictions are imposed. These changes must be reflected in reservoir operation plans in times of drought and when developing long-term water resource management plans or water conservation policies. The objective of this study is to quantify the adverse effects of drought associated with changes in consumption characteristics and utilize this in water resource management plans. We use a water consumption model that accounts for changes in household water consumption characteristics, and we apply this model to several droughts in different periods and cities in Japan. Results indicate that reductions in water consumption because of water supply restrictions tend to decrease over time. We concluded that imposing water supply restrictions during droughts has become less effective for maintaining reservoir storage. In designing water resource management plans, it is important to simultaneously evaluate changes in probability of supply-shortage events and the impact of water supply restrictions.</jats:p>",

Many organizations work towards improving flexibility so as to prepare for such disruptions and maintain competitive advantage. This research effort examines four activities that are associated with the contingency planning process to determine which, if any, of these processes are ultimately supportive of organizational flexibility. These activities are: information sharing, external collaboration, internal collaboration, and information technology usage. A survey method is employed to examine the perceptions of 103 contingency planners to determine which of these potential determinants are positively related to organizational flexibility. The data are analyzed using partial least square regression, and reveal that information technology use and external collaboration are significant determinants of organizational flexibility. Implications of our findings are discussed and future research to support this burgeoning area of supply chain management is proposed.</p>",

The data is collected by means of an online as well as an event survey from logistics managers of various supply chain firms. Indeed Singaporean firms need to properly document these supply chain risks. Moreover, there are gaps in specific areas where Singaporean firms can improve themselves and thus become globally effective corporations.</p>",

Supply chain management has become an effective tool now a day to survive in this competitive world. Organizations do their best to harvest profits by adopting better supply chain management practices for competitive advantage and organizational performance. In this paper an attempt has been made to understand the relationship among supply chain practices, competitive advantage, and organizational performance using structural equation modelling. This research conceptualizes and develops five secondary dimensions of supply chain practices (Use of technology, SC speed, Customer satisfaction, SC integration, and Inventory management). The research also identifies four primary competitive advantage components (Inventory management, Customer satisfaction, Profitability, and Customer base identification) and six primary organizational performance components (Financial Performance, Market performance, SC competencies, Customer satisfaction, Stakeholder satisfaction, and Innovation and learning). The data for analysis was collected from top 10 non-livestock organized retail players operating in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, New Delhi and, Gurgaon in India. The relationships in the proposed framework were tested using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that Indian retailers know that competitive advantage has high impact on SCP but they have less understanding in matching SCP and competitive advantage with organizational performance.</p>",

The high trade costs that are plaguing most developing countries is mainly incurred from the lack of adequate trade-related infrastructure and low quality of institutions that hinder the efficient flow of goods across and within borders. Therefore, the trade facilitation rules that are contained in FTAs among bilateral trading partners are inevitably aimed at deepening their participation in the global value chain network. However, an observation of the FTAs concluded by Korea and the trade facilitation rules contained therein shows that the current trade facilitation rules in bilateral FTAs may be of little practical use for countries that lack the capacity to be involved in the international production activities in the first place. From the development perspective, the current WTO negotiations on trade facilitation which take full account of the special and differential treatment needs of the less developed country members appear more likely to contribute to providing the trading environment that is free from the barriers to trade that have inhibited the less developed countries from integration into the global supply chains and the benefits thereof.</jats:p>",

This paper is an attempt to take these conjectures forward to the level of postulates. This is an empirical study administered through two-phase surveys for determining shared perception of a wider group. This study also investigates the effect of age, gender and education on the perception of people on these conjectures. A-G-E (Age-Gender-Education) analysis is applied for this purpose. The findings indicate a strong parallel between Vrat’s conjectures and survey results. Findings of the A-G-E analysis indicate that the difference in the perception due to demographic factors is significant for many conjectures. It is hoped that this research will bring new insights for managers in handling various issues in a supply chain and also the scientific inventory models can help persons to gain better insights about food intake policies in human body.</jats:p>",

The impact of water volume on operating cost is investigated for water utilities using data from the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) online database. Econometric models are estimated for water utilities located in Albania, Moldova, Brazil, Zambia, Kazakhstan, and Russia. Estimations provide similar quantitative findings and identical qualitative findings across locales. Results suggest that expected operating cost is inelastic with respect to water volume and that operating cost variability increases with water volume. Implications of these findings are that (1) current world-wide strategies to promote water conservation may necessitate an increase in the expected per unit cost of water supply and (2) policies framed as incentives for short-run cost efficiency may need to recognize the difficulty of reducing expected operating cost at existing output levels and that utility managers may face added difficulty in controlling cost if efficiency is pursued by expanding volume.</jats:p>",

However, one area of concern is the negative impact of mining activities on water resources: their quality and quantity. Mining companies are guided by rules and regulations, particularly those that have to do with the quality of water supply. Safe water supply is essential for improved health and quality of life for increased productivity. Yet, water supply in mining communities has not assumed the critical importance that it deserves toward the realization of human health security. A combination of key informant interviews and a copious desk-top study of official documentary reports were analysed in the context of the polluter-pays principle. The paper interrogates the corporate social responsibility ambivalence that arises from fresh water contamination during the extraction of mineral resources in the western mining region of Ghana. In spite of some efforts at addressing this problem through corporate social responsibilities, communities affected by mining still question the professed sensitivity of mining companies to their plight with respect to their inalienable right to water supply.</jats:p>",

The soil properties of the study area such as texture, depth, electrical conductivity, drainage, calcium carbonate content and slope were derived from a semi-detailed soil study carried out on the Albaji Plain on a scale of 1:20,000. After the soil properties were analyzed and evaluated, suitability maps were generated for surface, sprinkler and drip irrigation methods using a geographic information system (GIS). The results demonstrated that by applying sprinkler irrigation instead of surface and drip irrigation methods, the land suitability of 14,530 ha (88.87%) of the Albaji Plain could be improved substantially. However, the main limiting factors in using surface and sprinkler irrigation methods in this area were heavy soil texture, drainage and salinity, and the main limiting factors in using drip irrigation methods were heavy soil texture, calcium carbonate and salinity.</jats:p>",

The current study addresses this gap by examining how firms can develop integrated logistics capabilities and how this capability impacts firm performance. Specifically, the study identifies and empirically establishes the link between the behavioral elements of cooperation, coordination, and communication, and the achievement of integrated logistics capabilities. The results suggest that all three behavioral elements contribute directly to the integration of logistics capabilities across members of the supply chain. Further, it was found that the integration of logistics capabilities does impact operational and relational performance. The integration of logistics capabilities has the potential to lower the overall firm costs, and lead to better relationships with customers and the delivery of superior customer value.</jats:p>",

It presents the findings of the project, which involved investigating the economy and surveying collective forms of organizing in sectors such as agriculture and finance. Examining the well-developed Brazilian solidarity economy movement as contextual background, the lessons from that movement could prove useful to incipient US efforts.

First, the fractional calculus techniques are adopted to describe the dynamics of the energy supply‐demand system. Then the complex behavior of the proposed fractional‐order FOESDS is studied using numerical simulations. It is shown that the FOESDS can exhibit stable, chaotic, and unstable states. When it exhibits chaos, the FOESDS's strange attractors are plotted to validate the chaotic behavior of the system. Moreover, we calculate the maximal Lyapunov exponents of the system to confirm the existence of chaos. Accordingly, to stabilize the system, a finite‐time active fractional‐order controller is proposed. The effects of model uncertainties and external disturbances are also taken into account. An estimation of the stabilization time is given. Based on the latest version of the fractional Lyapunov stability theory, the finite‐time stability and robustness of the proposed method are proved. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to illustrate the usefulness and applicability of the proposed control scheme. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity 20: 74–86, 2015</jats:p>",

Farmers' markets, the most prevalent form of short/direct food supply chains, are most successful where they target ‘ethically concerned’ consumers and those for whom direct relationships with producers are considered as the main guarantee of quality. Such consumers are typically middle‐class urban residents, so that successful farmers' markets are often located some distance from the point of production. Engagement with geographical indication schemes e.g. Protected Designation of Origin and Protected Geographical Indication labels also varies significantly between <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MS</jats:styled-content>s. In some <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MS</jats:styled-content>s, for example, Romania, despite the importance of the small‐farm sector, the number of protected designations is negligible, and this is unlikely to change soon. In some cases, particularly in Italy, the involvement in quality schemes has led to farmers receiving a significantly higher share of the final retail price. Generally, however, protected designations have had most impact in safeguarding products with pre‐existing widespread prestige, rather than serving as a mechanism for creating it.</jats:p>",

It helps in increasing yields and shortened rotations so it has a large potentiality to supply timber and wood demand of the world. Species choice, provenance selection and propagation method are the major aspects of tree breeding. Plus tree selection, progeny testing, provenance test and vegetative propagation have been used since early of civilization and often regarded as conventional tree breeding techniques while seed orchards, clonal propagation, somatic embryogenesis, micro-propagation or in-Vitro propagation, and biotechnology are modern tree breeding techniques. Different countries have been developing tree breeding techniques and achieving maximum benefits from it. Southeast Asia is using Acacia mangium, A. crassicarpa, Gmelina arborea, and Eucalyptus spp.; Populus deltoids, Casuarina equisetifolia, Eucalyptus spp. have been using by India; Teak has been vegetative propagated in Thailand; Salix babylonica has been growing in Greece for biomass production. Increasing yield and shortened rotation are the major prospects while loss of genetic diversity, higher production costs and requirement of constant upgrading are the major hindrances of tree breeding.

For this purpose, a pilot study involving both a qualitative and a quantitative stage was conducted. The qualitative analysis, consisting of an extensive literature review and two case studies conducted in six major, globally-relevant Brazilian companies, led to the development of an initial model. This model was refined during the quantitative stage that involved 38 executives from large national companies. IT was found to be one of the main drivers of SCG influencing companies' supply chain performance. The final model consists of 5 constructs and 26 elements. Regarding the SCG constructs: (a) a new element 'formal contracts', emerged in the 'contractual SCG' construct; (b) the element 'cooperation' was not confirmed in the 'relational SCG' construct; (c) the element 'transparency' was considered an important element in the 'transactional SCG' construct. Five new elements emerged in the 'IT investment' construct. Market aspects were highlighted as being relevant in the 'supply chain performance' construct. Thus, the model includes elements that can be analyzed in order to shed light on how IT investments influence SCG and supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

To efficiently handle the complexity of the distribution network an efficient branch and bound search strategy based on a structural model is used. However, in order to reduce even more the size and the complexity of the problem the present work proposes to combine this methodology with clustering techniques.

Some large competitors of Wal-Mart in the U.S. retail industry jumped on the trend of RFID technology adoption. However, there has been a slowdown of RFID technology adoption since 2008. Many U.S. retailers do not consider adopting RFID technology because of the uncertainty of return on investment and the lack of business cases demonstrating its profitability or efficiency. This study investigates whether RFID companies have better financial performance ratios in the U.S. retail supply chains. RFID retailers have significantly lower days-in-inventory and lower per-employee costs. Compared with pre-RFID, the RFID retailers do not improve profit ratios after they adopted it, but their days-in-inventory ratio and sales efficiency improve significantly. Panel data regression analyses show that inventory management efficiency does impact gross margins, but the impact of cost efficiency is negligible. RFID retailers have a positive relationship with gross margin increases. In summary, it could be stated that introducing RFID improves inventory management efficiency but we do not know yet if RFID technology adoption also contributes to profitability in U.S. retail industry.</jats:p>"

Pharmaceutical supply chains in particular are one example of fragmented information flows among supply chain participants. Pharmaceutical supply chain processes have a crucial influence on medication quality and ultimate patient outcomes. When manufacturing problems arise, temperature control cannot be maintained throughout the supply chain, counterfeit medications enter the supply chain, containers are damaged or sensitive medication is improperly transported and stored, the drugs effectiveness can be affected and this can result in serious consequences, including patient sickens or even death. In this paper, we analyze Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID), a technology that can improve communication of data and information, reduce counterfeiting, and enable monitoring of drug quality in pharmaceutical supply chains. The study is conducted in the context of an RFID platform implemented in Germany. The paper extends and complements previous studies by analyzing the RFID implementation and business value in an end-to-end supply chain process across multiple stakeholders in the pharmaceutical supply chain, from the manufacturer via the wholesaler to pharmacies and hospitals. The results confirm that RFID benefits are realized when supply chain processes are changed with the help of technology, but that different supply chain participants have different benefit realization perceptions. The analysis further reveals specific types of process changes for each supply chain participant and their corresponding benefits.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Summary The genus Salmonella contains approximately 2,579 serovars, most of which are zoonotic and transmitted by foods of animal origin, such as fresh pork and further processed by-products. Non-typhoid salmonellosis in humans manifests as gastroenteritis, septicemia, or can be asymptomatic during the carrier state. Salmonella spp. has a considerable impact in the pork industry due to economic losses resulting from diagnosis, treatment, reduced production, and because this pathogen constitutes a non-tariff barrier to food trade and a serious public health problem. The microorganism is usually introduced to farms through incoming breeding stock or pig feed and is subsequently spread by sick animals or asymptomatic carriers. Infection and/or dissemination of the microorganism may increase particularly during pre-slaughtering due to contaminated trucks, long periods of time spent in transit, stress during handling and fasting, or high animal density or time spent in corrals. Contamination during slaughtering is commonly associated with carcass de-hairing and polishing, evisceration and rectum separation, or from Salmonella present in skin, oral cavity, feces or lymphatic nodes. Pork contamination may also occur through contact with equipment or tools, handling, storage, or improper preservation during slaughter, post-slaughter, marketing, sale, or consumption. For this reason, Salmonella control, with a focus on the supply chain and risk assessment is fundamental for guaranteeing quality and food safety of pork products in Colombia, thereby contributing to public health and improving competitiveness. Studies directed at establishing baselines for the disease and the microorganism in each of the stages of the supply chain should be conducted, including identification of differential risks and establishing measures for monitoring, prevention and control. Key words: cross-contamination, farm, pigs, pork, slaughter.   Resumen El género Salmonella agrupa alrededor de 2579 serovariedades, en su mayoría zoonóticas, transmitidas por alimentos de origen animal, como la carne de cerdo y sus derivados. La salmonelosis no tifoidea en humanos puede manifestarse como gastroenteritis, septicemia o estado portador asintomático. La presencia de Salmonella spp. es de gran impacto para la industria porcícola, por las pérdidas económicas por diagnóstico, tratamiento y disminución de la producción, y por constituir una barrera no arancelaria para la comercialización de alimentos y un grave problema de salud pública. El microorganismo se introduce en las granjas a través del alimento, el pie de cría o los cerdos para levante, y se disemina a través de enfermos o portadores asintomáticos. En el prebeneficio la contaminación de camiones, el tiempo de transporte, el estrés por manipulación, el ayuno, la alta densidad animal, y la permanencia en corrales pueden incrementar la infección y/o diseminación del microorganismo. Durante el beneficio la contaminación se asocia al depilado, pulido de los animales, a la evisceración y corte de recto o a la presencia del microorganismo en piel, cavidad bucal, heces o ganglios linfáticos. La contaminación de la carne también puede ocurrir por contacto con equipos o utensilios, por manipulación, almacenamiento o conservación inapropiada de los productos en etapas del beneficio, posbeneficio, comercialización, venta o  consumo.  Por tal razón el control de Salmonella bajo un enfoque de cadena productiva y evaluación de riesgo es un aspecto fundamental para garantizar la calidad y la inocuidad de los alimentos de origen porcino en Colombia, contribuyendo a la salud pública y a mejorar la competitividad de la cadena. Se deben realizar estudios orientados a establecer las líneas base de la enfermedad y del microorganismo en cada una de las etapas, identificando el riesgo diferencial y estableciendo medidas de monitoreo, prevención y control. Palabras clave: carne, contaminación cruzada, cerdo, faenado, granja.    Resumo  O gênero Salmonella agrupa ao redor de 2579 sorovariedades, a maioria delas zoonóticas, transmitidas por alimentos de origem animal, como a carne suína e seus derivados. Em humanos, a salmonelose não tifoide pode se manifestar como gastroenterite, septicemia ou pode ser assintomática. A presença de Salmonella spp. é de grande impacto na indústria produtora de carne suína pelas perdas econômicas por diagnóstico, tratamento e diminuição da produção. Esta doença constitui também uma barreira não alfandegária para a comercialização de alimentos, sendo também um grave problema de saúde pública. O microrganismo é introduzido nas granjas pelas matrizes e reprodutores, animais na fase de crescimento ou a través do alimento. Tanto os animais doentes quanto os portadores assintomáticos podem ser fontes de contaminação. Na fase prévia ao abate podem ser citados alguns fatores que podem favorecer a infecção e disseminação do microrganismo: contaminação dos caminhões somado ao tempo de transporte em veículos com alta densidade animal, jejum e estresse. Durante o processamento da carcaça, a contaminação está associada à depilação e polimento dos animais, assim como evisceração, presença de microrganismos na pele, cavidade oral, ampola retal, fezes ou linfonodos. A contaminação da carne pode acontecer pelo contato com equipamentos ou implementos, manuseio, armazenamento e conservação inadequada dos produtos nas etapas do abate e após do abate, comercialização, venda ou consumo. Diante do anteriormente exposto, na Colômbia é de fundamental importância direcionar o controle da Salmonella considerando um enfoque abrangente da cadeia produtiva, incluindo a avaliação do risco. Este enfoque permitirá garantir a qualidade e inocuidade dos alimentos de origem suíno, redundado em benefícios para a saúde pública e o aprimoramento da competitividade da cadeia. Devem ser realizados estudos orientados ao estabelecimento dos indicadores da presença e impacto da doença em cada uma das etapas produtivas, identificando o risco diferencial, para sentar as bases de medidas de monitoramento, prevenção e controle. Palavras chave: abate, carne suína, contaminação cruzada, granjas. </jats:p>"

In particular it focuses on problems that can be tackled without the need for capital expenditure. The measures go under the collective name of “turbulence”. This represents the chain deviating from its goals. Quantifying unnecessary waste then allows unnecessary carbon emissions to be estimated while pointing to what changes will have the biggest impact.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>3D Packaging Technologies and Applications, Latest Challenges and Supply Chain Activities</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Semiconductor industry, for more than four decades, has rigorously followed Moore's Law in scaling down the CMOS technologies. Although several new materials and processes are being developed to address the challenges of future technology nodes, in the coming years they will be limited with respect to functionalities that future devices will require. As a consequence a clear trend of moving from CMOS to package and system architecture can be observed. Three-dimensional (3D) technology using the well-known Through Silicon Via (TSV) interconnect is one the emerging options, considered today the most advanced technology, that could enable various heterogeneous integration. 3D Integration is not limited to the CMOS scaling in itself, it is rather based on bringing more functionalities by stacking different type of devices (Logic, Memory, Analog, MEMS, Passive components) while reducing the form factor of the packaging. This functional diversification is also known as More-than-Moore. In addition, considering Known Good Die approach, each component of the 3D package could have a different manufacturer using different wafer sizes and node technology, thus bringing more complexity but also more opportunities and responsibilities to the supply chain. There are several business models identified, either using vertical integration or collaborative approach, if a dominant one will emerge or several tactics will co-exist, it is still remains a key question that will have to be answered. The supply chain interaction and key players will be addressed in this presentation, including current and future standardization needs. This is today a key for the manufacturing of advanced 3D devices. 3D integration is considered today a new paradigm for the semiconductor industry, since it will drive evolution for packages for the coming decades. Due to several advantages that TSV technology can bring, several platforms have started. 3D WLCSP, 2.5D interposers &amp; 3DIC are the main platforms that will be studied in this paper. Market forecasts in terms of wafer starts, market revenue, segments and end-products as well as supply chain activities and major player interactions will be presented. The industry has enthusiastically been waiting for mass production of 3D ICs. Although some small level of production has already been reported, the adoption rate in high volume manufacturing (HVM) is still low due to unresolved challenges that the industry still needs to address. Process technology is not fully mature, there are still many challenges in bonding and de-bonding, testing as well as thermal management that have to be overcome. Furthermore, design tools have to be fully released to enable proper 3D integration design. Looking at the time to market it is foreseen that device such as the Hybrid Memory Cube, combining high-speed logic with multiple stacks of TSV bonded memories, will come into high volume production in 2014. This will definitely change the world of the memory market and will significantly speed up the adoption of 3D technologies. Technology roadmaps for 3D integration will also be included in the manuscript and reviewed during the presentation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>3DIC &amp; TSV Interconnects - 2012 Business Report L.Cadix; A.Pizzagalli; E.

The problem is motivated by a specific two‐echelon distribution system arising in supply chain management, where products come to the depots from different factories by semitrailers and these semitrailers are also used for short‐haul distribution, that is, the load from different factories is not consolidated at the depots. This VRP is rather challenging as it combines several synchronisation constraints occurring in other well‐known standard VRP. In this article, we describe several problem variants, we model the problem as a set partitioning problem, and we show how the heuristic concept of concurrent (LS/LNS) neighborhood search which has shown to be rather effective for other complex VRP‐classes can be customized. Our computational study shows that this approach is effective and efficient for this VRP‐class, too. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, Vol. 64(1), 29–39 2014</jats:p>",

A first regulatory framework, constituted mainly by an Order of 21 August, 2008, helped to strengthen this practice, but also introduced some limitations to the development of RWH. Considering the growing social demand and possible issues for water resources, it is likely that this first regulatory framework will evolve. In order to anticipate these changes, foreign case studies may be very instructive. Based on a detailed analysis of eight countries in all continents (Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, Australia and Uganda), this paper draws up an international overview of RWH allowing French practices to be put into perspective. Beyond the specific and sensitive differences, the experience of these countries gives useful lessons for the French case. Comparisons have been drawn on different topics: uses of rainwater, quality standards, regulatory tools and RWH development factors. RWH, especially, in urban areas appears in France as an isolated topic. It is necessary in the future to better integrate it into overall urban water management approaches.</jats:p>",

Survey data was collected from 138 international supply chain members, mainly from Middle East and Far East. A total of 11 people were selected as potential interviewees. These people worked in various departments in different companies and were of various nationalities. The findings revealed that the cultural aspect of uncertainty avoidance influences information sharing and trust. This study adds a new contribution to the literature on supply chain management (SCM), as noted in Burgees et al.s (2006) review of supply chain literature, studies that examine the social aspect of supply chains, including culture, have been neglected.</jats:p>"

A face-to-face, semi-structured interview questionnaire was used, based on purposive sampling. Descriptive statistics using SPSS software was used for the data analysis and interpretation. The findings of the research revealed that across the supply chains of locally made models, all the manufacturers followed a lean strategy for their inbound supply chain and some had a lean supply chain strategy for their outbound supply chain. A number of them also had an agile supply chain strategy in the outbound supply chain, which suggests a leagile supply chain strategy. It was also found that in some instances there was a mismatch between strategies and practices in the area of product characteristics, manufacturing characteristics, and the decision drivers of the supply chain. Local manufacturers of locally made light vehicle models in South Africa do not always make decisions and implement practices in line with their chosen supply chain strategies.</jats:p>"

The present study approaches such strategies in the case of the underground water networks in the arid regions in Xinjiang, North Western China, known there under the terms kārīz or kănérjĭng. There is an on-going debate concerning the beginnings of the construction of kārīz in Xinjiang. A recent revival of this technique started with a movement of kārīz (re)construction in the 1950s–1960s. In recent decades the kārīz/kănérjĭng water network has suffered due to the expansion of deep well drilling. At the same time the issue has become an object of museum representation. The first museum, Turfan Kariz Paradise, opened its gates in 1992; the Karez Folk Custom Garden, with a more pronounced event and commercial character, was inaugurated in 2000. Both exhibitions are near Turfan. They both demonstrate the traditional construction and maintenance techniques, and stress the strong linkage between local society and the specific traditional water technology. This paper argues that preserving the kārīz/kănérjĭng in the area of Turfan has become a delicate instrument in the political balance involving local authorities, the provincial government in Urumuqi and the central government in Beijing.</jats:p>",

This sector is now faced with a paradox, which is to reduce costs, related to the decline in government subsidies and an increase in the quality of care required by the regulatory bodies. This paradox can be resolved through the optimization of the hospital supply chain. Despite hospital supply chains having a great impact on hospital budgets, still opportunities for optimization exist and improve the health care quality. This article aims to propose a conceptual framework that allows hospitals to evaluate the performance of their pharmaceutical supply chains in order to identify bottlenecks and cost reduction opportunities. After reviewing the literature regarding to the hospital supply chain and the performance measurement, the authors focused on the study of hospital processes of pharmaceutical distribution within the hospital. The findings of this study propose a conceptual framework that will allow hospital to measure the performance of their pharmaceutical supply chain.</p>",

Auditor supply chain knowledge is a specialized understanding of information and processes regarding accounting and auditing issues that relates to both a supplier and its major customer, regardless of industry commonalities, that is particularly useful for understanding complexities associated with the revenue cycle. We find that auditors' supply chain knowledge at the city level is associated with higher audit quality and lower audit fees, compared to companies employing auditors with supply chain knowledge at the national level or employing auditors without supply chain knowledge. Such effects are stronger for supplier companies that derive a high proportion of revenue from their major customers, and when the revenue cycle for the supplier companies is more important. We obtain these results while controlling for the usual determinants of audit quality and fees, along with auditors' industry specialization.</jats:p>",

The supply chain approach of the enterprises is a business philosophy, which requires trust, commitment, coordination, shared objectives, support from the management, and the understanding and acceptance of the mutual dependence (Német, 2009). The main objective of our study is to analyse the relationships among the players of the supply chain through several relationship indicators, such as trust, economical satisfaction, social satisfaction, compelling power, non-compelling power, dependence, reputation and conflict. The relationship among the players of the supply chain has been analysed from two aspects, through the position and through the role of the players of the supply chain.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most frequently used parameters in water supply systems is the pipe breakage rate, which is often expressed by λ. Its definition can be deterministic or probabilistic, but both definitions lead to the same value under certain assumptions. This parameter can be defined per unit time only or per unit time and per unit length of the pipes (using a kilometre as the unit of measurement). The symbol λ is used in both cases and can occasionally generate confusion. In a water supply system, most failures occur because of pipe breakage, and only those cases are considered in this work. For a pipe, λ can be evaluated in terms of time (years) and length (km) and expressed by Λ. This paper aims to investigate the mechanical reliability of a water supply system with reference to pipeline breakages worldwide. A statistical approach is applied to a wide database of Λ values relative to certain variables (e.g., the diameter, material, age, pressure, and chemical characteristics of the water) for water supply systems worldwide (over 3,500 data points were collected from approximately 200 papers). The pipe length L and monitoring period T are often reported in the database. For each water supply system, it is necessary to apply a statistical weight to each value of Λ because the considered variables are notably different. The chosen weight is the product of L · T; the weight is evaluated using statistical analysis if L and/or T are unknown. Finally, a particular treatment is applied to the obtained weights to eliminate distortions in the Λ evaluation because of the different socioeconomic conditions of more or less developed countries. Four results are reported in this work: (1) the weighted average value of Λ in the world (Λm), (2) the average values of Λ in different continents (Λmc), (3) the average values of Λ in different countries (Λmn), and (4) the management correction factor (fCE).</jats:p>",

In this study, a compact, modular filter employing non-woven, highly porous polypropylene fiber as filter media was investigated for the treatment of turbid water under high filtration rates. The impact of different operating variables such as polyaluminum chloride (PAC) dose and filtration rate on the effluent turbidity and headloss were investigated. Due to the fiber's high porosity, the filter was able to retain solids at a filtration rate of up to 1,500 m/day without headloss. When PAC was added, the effluent turbidity decreased significantly with the lowest observed when the dose was 1 mg/L. Furthermore, the effluent turbidity was found to increase with the filtration rate. During all the experiments, no headloss was observed except when the filtration rate was 2,250 m/day or when the PAC dose was 5 mg/L. In terms of its compactness and applicability at very high filtration rates, the polypropylene fiber filter can have a considerable advantage compared to other filters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) is a contract managed under the Partnership for Supply Chain Management (PFSCM) consortium by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). SCMS procures commodities for programmes supported by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). From 2005 to mid-2012, PEPFAR, through SCMS, spent approximately $384 million on non-pharmaceutical commodities. Of this, an estimated $90m was used to purchase flow cytometry technology, largely for flow cytometry platforms and reagents.Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the cost differences between low, medium and high utilisation rates of common CD4 testing instruments that have been procured though PEPFAR funding.Method: A scale of costs per test as a function of test volume through the machine was calculated for the two most common CD4 testing machines used in HIV programmes: Becton Dickinson (BD) FACSCount™ and BD FACSCalibur™. Instrument utilisation data collected at the facility level in three selected countries were then used to calculate the onsite cost-per-test experienced in each country.Results: Cost analyses indicated that a target of at least 40% utilisation for FACSCount™ and 15% utilisation for FACSCalibur™, respectively, closely approach maximal per-test cost efficiency. The average utilisation rate for CD4 testing instruments varies widely by country, level of laboratory and partner (0% − 68%).Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that, because cost-per-test is related inversely to sample throughput, the underutilisation of flow cytometry machines is resulting in an increase in average cost-per-test for many instruments. </jats:p>"

This is good for organized non-livestock retailing (NLR) which is retailing of agriculture and horticulture products. Expecting the better return, many national and international retailers are in the arena. The intense market competition has changed the scenario to supply chain vs. supply chain competition. This has prompted to understand key performance indicators (KPI) for this industry. In this research, the KPI are classified using factor analysis (FA) as: inventory metrics, customer metrics, flexibility metrics, and growth and learning metrics. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach has been applied to test the hypothesis. The results support the hypothesis; (1) firms with more focus on inventory need more focus on flexibility; (2) firms with more focus on flexibility shall have higher level of growth and learning; and (3) firms with more focus on inventory shall have higher level of growth and learning. The primary data was collected from top 10 organized NLR players operating in Punjab, Chandigarh, New Delhi, and Gurgaon in India. Finally, 401 questionnaires were received. The results were tested and validated by rigorous statistical analysis.</p>",

We present a model in which the uptake, storage and assimilation of nitrogen and carbon are explicitly resolved in different sized phytoplankton cells. In the model, metabolism and cellular C : N ratio are influenced by accumulation of carbon polymers such as carbohydrate and lipid, which is greatest when cells are nutrient starved, or exposed to high light. Allometric relations and empirical datasets are used to constrain the range of possible C : N, and indicate larger cells can accumulate significantly more carbon storage compounds than smaller cells. When forced with extended periods of darkness combined with brief exposure to saturating irradiance, the model predicts organisms large enough to accumulate significant carbon reserves may on average synthesize protein and other functional apparatus up to five times faster than smaller organisms. The advantage of storage in terms of average daily protein synthesis rate is greatest when modeled organisms were previously nutrient starved, and carbon storage reservoirs saturated. Small organisms may therefore be at a disadvantage in terms of average daily growth rate in environments that involve prolonged periods of darkness and intermittent nutrient limitation. We suggest this mechanism is a significant constraint on phytoplankton C : N variability and cell size distribution in different oceanic regimes.\n                        </jats:p>"

The results showed that the WTR was beneficial for N removal and the average removal efficiency reached 59%. The denitrification was the primary pathway for N removal and the denitrification rate (2.19 g N/m3 d) was higher than the theoretical value based on the organic matter removal rate (7.35 g CODcr/m3 d). The P removal was excellent and the efficiency still remained 98% after 260-day operation. The lifetime of the WTR fixed-bed column regarding P saturation was estimated to be 7.9 years under the highest HLR of 0.45 m3/m3 d. Moreover, the efficiency and stability of the nutrients removal further increased with the reduction of HLR. Based on regulations, the system holds great promise as a technology for water environment restoration and WTR recycling.</jats:p>",

Evolving nuclear technology, increased access to information, and systematic improvements in design and manufacturing tools, however, should in time ease the proliferation challenge. Eventually, even developing countries could possess a sufficient technical ability. There is evidence that this transition has already occurred. The basic uranium-enrichment gas centrifuge, developed in the 1960s, has technical characteristics that are within reach of nearly all states, without foreign assistance or access to export-controllable materials. The history of centrifuge development in twenty countries supports this perspective, as do previously secret studies carried out by the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom. Complicating matters, centrifuges also have properties that make the detection of a clandestine program enormously difficult. If conditions for the clandestine and indigenous production of weapons have emerged, then nonproliferation institutions focused on technology will be inadequate. Although it would represent a near-foundational shift in nuclear security policy, the changed technology landscape may now necessitate a return to institutions focused instead on motivations. </jats:p>",

When spillovers are endogenized, we further establish that an increasing spillover always benefits both firms without any R&amp;D cooperation, but only benefits the firm whose contribution level is relatively low when under R&amp;D cartels. Finally, we show that the path of first increasing spillovers to be perfect and then forming a cartel has a higher chance of achieving the best mode in terms of profitability. </jats:p>",

Further, these systems were embedded in a supermarket distribution system and they provided the same amount of comparable vegetables at the consumers’ door as the case system. The on-farm resource use measured in solar equivalent Joules (seJ) was similar for the case system and the high-yielding model system and higher for the low-yielding model system. The distribution phase of the case system was at least three times as resource efficient as the models and had substantially less environmental impacts when assessed using LCA. The three systems ranked differently for emissions with the high-yielding model system being the worst for terrestrial ecotoxicity and the case system the worst for global warming potential.

This platform is implemented in a panel manufacturing company to establish the usefulness of the strategies and the constructed system.

Nutrient and total organic carbon (TOC) trends from 1998 to 2012 were assessed in major tributaries of the Wachusett Reservoir in Massachusetts. In this period, solute concentrations generally declined—in seven of eight tributaries for nitrate (all statistically significant at <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05), four of eight tributaries for total phosphorus (all significant), and six of eight tributaries for TOC (three significant). Despite these changes, increased flows resulted in increased or constant daily loads. Installation of municipal sewer systems in selected subbasins between 2002 and 2008 coincided with decreased concentration trends in their tributaries and decreased loads in the most sewered tributary. These results illustrate the dominance of flow in determining loads and have implications for water managers seeking to quantify and manage solute transport.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we move beyond the dyadic view and propose a theory of co‐opetition in supply networks. We argue that as firms within a supply network interact over time to access, share, and transform resources, new ties between firms are formed and existing ties dissolve, giving rise to co‐opetition dynamics at the network level. Taking a configurational approach, we employ the inter‐related dimensions of ties between firm, firm‐level task, network‐level objective, and governance to specify four practical supply network archetypes that cover a wide range of economic activities. We then explain how coopetitive relationships may evolve in these supply network archetypes. Specifically, we discuss how relationships form or dissolve in these archetypes and how local structural changes lead to co‐opetition dynamics at the network level. We also discuss the implications of such dynamics from a managerial perspective.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dietary trans fatty acids (TFA) increase risk for heart disease. In 2007, Canada adopted voluntary TFA limits for food (&lt;5% total fat, &lt;2% total fat for fats) and recommended that unsaturated fat replace TFA, over saturated fat. Mandatory TFA labeling was implemented and a government‐led Trans Fat Monitoring Program (TFMP) measured and publicly reported TFA levels by company/brand. This study assessed changes in TFA levels in the food supply and if saturated fats are higher in foods with lower TFA. Data from Health Canada’s TFMP (n=921, 2006‐2009) and the University of Toronto food (n=5544, 2010‐2011) and restaurant (n=4272, 2010) databases were used. The proportion of foods meeting TFA limits improved from 75.4% in 2006‐2009 to 96.1% in 2010‐2011, particularly in packaged foods: croissants (25 to 100%), pies (36 to 98%), cakes (43 to 90%), and garlic spread (33 to 100%). Most TFMP restaurant categories, except for muffins (95%) had 100% of foods meeting TFA limits in 2010. Some food categories had a large proportion of foods exceeding TFA limits: dairy‐free cheeses (100%), frosting (72.0%), shortening (66.7%), coffee whiteners (66.7%), and restaurant‐prepared biscuits and scones (47.4%). Coffee whiteners, donuts, popcorn and frosting that exceeded TFA limits contributed &gt;25% TFA to total fat. Saturated fat was higher (p&lt;0.05) in some foods with low TFA levels: chocolate chip, chocolate covered and sandwich cookies, brownies and squares, cakes with pudding/mousse, dessert topping, and among restaurant‐prepared cookies. There is an impressive improvement in TFA levels in the Canadian food supply, demonstrating that voluntary limits and monitoring are effective in reducing TFA in the food supply. Efforts should focus on reducing TFA where levels remain high and on limiting the use of saturated fat to replace TFA.</jats:p>",

An effort was made by AGS (Administração e Gestão de Sistemas de Salubridade, S.A.), private operator in 17 water utilities, to achieve a higher level of managing data. Data management was an important hurdle to be overcome in order to accurately assess performance indicators. An appropriate bridge to be made is the link between IAM methodological processes and current operational management; this link is crucial when alternative solutions are defined in the planning stage and decisions need to be made. In the past, through continuously hydraulic modelling collaborative projects, AGS achieved sufficient maturity in several processes, such as (a) update network maps, (b) link geographical information system with other information systems, and (c) profiling consumption demand. Nowadays, concerns related with energy savings are gaining importance; concepts as energy efficiency, reducing carbon footprint and gas emissions should be followed. This paper describes an approach to energy assessment in a real water distribution system, where performance indicators associated with energy efficiency were computed for three different operational alternatives. Results considering a balance between cost and performance dimensions were assessed.</jats:p>",

In the proposed optocouplerless topology, HPF operation at input ac mains is achieved by operating the buck ac–dc converter in continuous conduction mode. The design, modelling and simulation of the proposed topology are executed using MATLAB‐Simulink and sim‐power system toolboxes. A prototype of the power supply for LED lamp is developed for multiple LEDs connected in series configuration. The efficiency of the proposed LED lamp driver is observed as 83.76% at rated voltage of 220 V and the THD of ac mains current less than 17.27% for a wide range of voltages of 90–270 V.</jats:p>",

The formation of struvite is envisioned as a promising process for nutrient removal and subsequent recovery, thus providing a strong incentive for its implementation, since the sewage is a renewable source of phosphorus. Struvite precipitation was obtained by controlled addition of Mg(OH)2 or MgCl2. We evaluated the removal of ammonia and phosphate under equimolar conditions of magnesium and magnesium stoichiometric excess of 100–200% relative to the limiting reagent, under a stirring speed of 300 rpm at pH 8, 9 and 10. MgCl2 in 1:1 molar ratio to phosphate, considering the stoichiometric ratio [PO43−]:[NH4+] of 0.13 (presented by raw sample). The results show the best cost–benefit ratio, removal of phosphate of 90.6% and ammonium removal of 29%, resulting in 23 mg l−1 PO43− and 265 mg l−1 NH4+ concentration in effluent.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An aspect of life history that has seen increasing attention in recent years is that of strategies for financing the costs of offspring production. These strategies are often described by a continuum ranging from capital breeding, in which costs are met purely from endogenous reserves, to income breeding, in which costs are met purely from concurrent intake. A variety of factors that might drive strategies toward a given point on the capital–income continuum has been reviewed, and assessed using analytical models. However, aspects of food supply, including seasonality and unpredictability, have often been cited as important drivers of capital and income breeding, but are difficult to assess using analytical models. Consequently, we used dynamic programming to assess the role of the food supply in shaping offspring provisioning strategies. Our model is parameterized for a pinniped (one taxon remarkable for the range of offspring‐provisioning strategies that it illustrates). We show that increased food availability, increased seasonality, and, to a lesser extent, increased unpredictability can all favor the emergence of capital breeding. In terms of the conversion of energy into offspring growth, the shorter periods of care associated with capital breeding are considerably more energetically efficient than income breeding, because shorter periods of care are associated with a higher ratio of energy put into offspring growth to energy spent on parent and offspring maintenance metabolism. Moreover, no clear costs are currently associated with capital accumulation in pinnipeds. This contrasts with general assumptions about endotherms, which suggest that income breeding will usually be preferred. Our model emphasizes the role of seasonally high abundances of food in enabling mothers to pursue an energetically efficient capital‐breeding strategy. We discuss the importance of offspring development for dictating strategies for financing offspring production.</jats:p>",

No matter what biorefinery strategy is employed, to compete in the longer term, it will be critical to have a supply‐chain adapted to the targeted products. In order to meet customer needs and at the same time be cost‐competitive, there are trade‐offs to be made between responsiveness and efficiency in several areas of the supply chain, such as production and customer service. This paper reviews supply‐chain characteristics and competitive factors for various bioproducts. An approach that can be used by decision‐makers during early‐stage design is presented, suitable for screening‐out less promising options based on their supply‐chain characteristics. Fundamental aspects such as the differentiation of products, their possible green advantage, biomass procurement, and process characteristics are discussed within five categories: bioenergy, biofuels, commodity biochemicals, fine and specialty biochemicals, and biomaterials. Several examples of biorefinery strategies are discussed to illustrate these concepts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction: Vitamin D deficiency is an important risk factor for fractures. However, there are few data available only on the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and recovery after surgery for hip fracture. Aim: The authors investigate the vitamin D supply of patients with hip fractures. Method: Between February and September 2013, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels were determined in 203 patients with hip fracture (74.8±11.5 ys; 67 men and 136 women) and in 74 control subjects. Results: Vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism occurred significantly more frequently in patients with hip fracture than in control subjects (72% vs. 45%, and 33% vs. 17%, respectively). Patients with better condition after surgery showed higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (p&lt;0.001) than those with poor condition. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were lower in the 31 patients who died [median of survival time: 19 (5–52) days] compared to those who survived [22.6 (9.5–45.0) vs. 33.0 (16.5–56.6) nmol/l]. Conclusions: The association between vitamin-D deficiency and mortality as well as the positive correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and better postoperative condition confirm the importance of proper vitamin D supply in the prevention and cure of hip fractures, what is more in the increase of the chance of survival.

Specifically, we examine how uncertainty in supply capacity affects optimal ordering and pricing decisions, supplier and retailer profits, and the incentives to reduce such uncertainty. When two suppliers sell through a monopolistic retailer, supply uncertainty not only affects the retailer's diversification strategy for replenishment, but also changes the suppliers’ wholesale price competition and the incentive for reducing capacity uncertainty. In this dual‐sourcing model, we show that the benefit of reducing capacity uncertainty depends on the cost heterogeneity between the suppliers. In addition, we show that a supplier does not necessarily benefit from capacity variability reduction. We contrast this incentive misalignment with findings from the single‐supplier case and a supplier‐duopoly case where both suppliers sell directly to market without the monopolistic retailer. In the latter single‐supplier and duopoly cases, we prove that the unreliable supplier always benefits from reducing capacity variability. These results highlight the role of the retailer's diversification strategy in distorting a supplier's incentive for reducing capacity uncertainty under supplier price competition.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The InN quantum dots (QDs) grown on a GaN buffer layer have been widely studied for their potential applications, such as solar cells, infrared light-emitting diodes and biosensors etc.. However, the InN growth temperature was restricted due to the issue of low dissociation temperature. Leading In (indium) adatoms are less mobile in finding the energetically favored site, resulting in high density structure defects that generally exist in the conventional metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) or molecular beam epitaxy growth of InN QDs. The flow rate modulation epitaxy (FME) technique was proposed to overcome the In adatoms migration issue and was proven to be a suitable method for preparing high optical quality InN QDs. Nevertheless, the low density of InN QDs grown by the FME technique is a drawback for most optoelectronic devices based on the QDs’ active layer which prefer high density QDs. In other words, the growth technique for high density QDs plays an important role. It was well known that the adatom kinetic processes, such as adsorption, desorption, and diffusion at surfaces, are considered to be key parameters controlling the dot density, material quality and surface morphology. Recently, the pulsed-mode (PM) MOCVD method was reported as a useful approach for preparing high density InN QDs on GaN buffer layers. However, most of these reports could only achieve one benefit, either density or optical quality. Therefore, in this study we proposed a new method to grow high density InN QDs while maintaining the optical quality.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The two-step growth method consists of one growth cycle for step-1 and two growth cycles in step-2. The duration of one growth cycle is 50 sec, including a 10 s TMIn flow process, a 20 s NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> process, and two 10 s purge processes intervened in between. The two-step growth included step-1 for high density InN nucleation at 575<jats:sup> o</jats:sup>C, and then, the reactor temperature was raised to 650<jats:sup> o</jats:sup>C in 5 min increments to decompose the poor material quality InN islands. The aim of the step-1 growth was only to create high density nucleation sites on the GaN buffer layer. The reactor temperature was then reduced to 600<jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C to enable the growth of InN QDs with high density and high optical property in step-2 of the process. The experimental result show that the high density 1.5×10<jats:sup>10</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−</jats:sup>\n                  <jats:sup>2</jats:sup> truncated hexagonal pyramidal InN QDs can be grown by the two-step growth method. The InN nucleation, InN decomposition and In adatom diffusion in the step-1, annealing and the step-2 process, respectively, determined the density, shape and size distribution of the InN QDs. The bimodal size distribution of the two-step growth InN QDs can be attributed to the high mobility of the incoming adatoms or/and existing islands, which favors coalescence process. The double-peak feature in the photoluminescence (PL) is related to the ground-state emission from the InN QDs with bimodal size-distribution. The low residual carrier concentration (1.8×10<jats:sup>18</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−</jats:sup>\n                  <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>), large confinement energy (342 meV) and intense PL emission for 6.1 nm high InN QDs indicated that a two-step growth is suitable for QD device applications.</jats:p>",

As a key component of wheat handling in the Canadian grain industry, grading of wheat for value‐added blending has historically been accomplished by visual identification. As of 2008 in Canada, visual identification was eliminated for all primary classes of wheat and replaced by an alternative system of wheat declaration. Given the high costs of testing each truck and railcar for quality assurance, the declaration system must rely on incentives and trust as there is now considerable potential for accidental or opportunistic misrepresentation throughout the grain supply chain. This research attempts to identify cost‐effective handling strategies and policies so as to maintain the integrity of the supply chain under the new declaration system. An agent‐based simulation model is developed to capture the effects of individual heterogeneity as well as behavioral adaption to the declaration system within the modern wheat supply chain. The simulated results are used to identify superior testing strategies for handlers, along with the relative risks and costs associated with each of the testing strategies.</jats:p>",

Origins of this food waste include private households, restaurants and canteens, as well as supermarkets, and indicate that 59–65% of this food waste can be avoided. Since ∼50% of the food waste is fruit and vegetables, monitoring and control of their natural ripening gas – ethylene – is suggested here as one possible key to reducing food waste. Ethylene accelerates ripening of climacteric fruits, and accumulation of ethylene in the supply chain can lead to fruit decay and waste.

Even so, cross‐shore sediment supply remains poorly known in quantitative terms and this reduces confidence in predictions of long‐term shoreline change. In this paper, field measurements of suspended sediment load and cross‐shore transport on the lower shoreface are used to derive a model for sediment supply from the lower to the upper shoreface at large spatial and temporal scales. Data collection took place at five different field sites that exhibit a wide range of wave conditions and sediment characteristics. Data analysis shows that both suspended sediment load and cross‐shore sediment transport scale with the grain‐related mobility number which ranged up to <jats:italic>ψ</jats:italic> ≈ 1000 in the measurements while the effect of orbital velocity skewness is more limited. A 1 year long simulation of sediment transfers between the lower and the upper shorefaces on a natural beach compares well with transport rates estimated from long‐term bar migration patterns and aeolian accretion on the same beach.</jats:p>",

We first formulate an integrated model to establish a theoretical benchmark for performance of the entire supply chain. It is a mixed integer programming model that involves harvesting, bucking, transportation, production, and sales decisions for both tactical and strategic planning levels. We then present two sequential approaches S‐A and S‐B where the coordination is done through internal pricing. S‐A is the approach currently used in practice where harvesting in the forest is the main driver of the supply chain activities and internal pricing is introduced to control bucking decision in a separate stage. In contrast, S‐B takes downstream demand information into consideration and internal pricing directly influences harvesting decision in the first stage. In order to find the appropriate setting of internal pricing that leads to the system optimum, we suggest two heuristics H‐I and H‐II. The internal pricing in H‐I is based on dual values and in H‐II, it is derived from a Lagrangian decomposition. A real‐life case study in the Chilean forestry industry is used to compare the results of different approaches. It is shown that the new sequential approach S‐B generates as good feasible solution as that obtained from the integrated approach but in much less time. Both heuristics H‐I and H‐II bring about near‐optimal feasible solutions. H‐II also provides optimistic bound of the optimal objective function value, which can be used as a measure of the solution quality.</jats:p>",

Recordings of short and long interruptions from two power supply systems are analysed and the similarity between their patterns is identified and then used to introduce a general interruption probability distribution model, defined in stages as multi‐zone theoretical curves. The effectiveness of the proposed theoretical interruption model is firstly verified for a basic test system supplying an aggregate load point whose power profiles (residential, commercial, industrial and mixed load) are engaged in assessing the energy not supplied, and afterwards for a typical UK power supply system consisting of about 15 000 electricity customers. The results show that a correct representation of the moment of interruption performed with the proposed model leads to completely different results than those obtained based on the conventional assumption that the time when interruption occurs is given by a known probability distribution. Moreover, comparisons against reported figures of reliability indices determine the most suitable probability distribution that shall be used to model the initial conditions of the Monte Carlo simulation and accompany the proposed theoretical model throughout the simulation process.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to investigate strategies for the effective and simultaneous removal of turbidity and C. hirundinella cells using turbidity and total photosynthetic pigments (TPP) as indicators of appropriate coagulant dosages during conventional drinking water purification. Source water samples with low turbidity, and high number of C. hirundinella cells were collected. A laboratory-scale conventional water purification plant was used to simulate coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and sand filtration. Various coagulant options were dosed as part of conventional coagulation. The coagulant option Ca(OH)2–organic polymer achieved the best removal of both turbidity (50%) and C. hirundinella cells (75–82%) after sedimentation using TPP as an indicator. Ca(OH)2–SiO2 and organic polymer alone achieved better removal of C. hirundinella (57–75%) and turbidity (33–50%) respectively when TPP was used as an indicator rather than turbidity. Sand filtration removed the remaining turbidity and C. hirundinella cells from the supernatant completely. Implementing new purification strategies may increase treatment costs, but the focus of drinking water purification utilities should always be primarily the production of safe and aesthetically acceptable drinking water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Mineralized soil nitrogen (N) is an important source of N for grassland production. Some soils can supply large quantities of plant-available N through mineralization of soil organic matter. Grass grown on such soils require less fertilizer N applications per unit yield. A reliable, accurate and user-friendly method to account for soil N supply potential across a large diversity of soils and growing conditions is needed to improve N management and N recommendations over time. In the current study, the effectiveness of chemical N tests and soil properties to predict soil N supply for grass uptake across 30 Irish soil types varying in N supply potential was investigated under controlled environmental conditions. The Illinois soil N test (ISNT) combined with soil C : N ratio provided a good estimate of soil N supply in soils with low residual mineral N. Total oxidized N (TON) had the largest impact on grass dry matter (DM) yield and N uptake across the 30 soil types, declining in its influence in later growth periods. This reflected the high initial mineral N levels in these soils, which declined over time. In the current study, a model with ISNT-N, C : N and TON (log TON) best explained variability in grass DM yield and N uptake. All three rapid chemical soil tests could be performed routinely on field samples to provide an estimate of soil N supply prior to making N fertilizer application decisions. It can be concluded that these soil tests, through their assessment of soil N supply potential, can be effective tools for N management on grassland; however, field studies are needed to evaluate this under more diverse growing conditions.</jats:p>",

Extensive supply chains can negatively affect recovery through higher vulnerability to network disruption and positively through support from trading partners, easier search for new partners, and general benefits of agglomeration. Our results indicate that networks with firms outside of the impacted area contributed to the earlier resumption of production, whereas networks within the region contributed to sales recovery in the medium term. The results suggest that the positive effects of supply chains typically exceed the negative effects.</jats:p>",

We examined whether milk Na:K, as a biomarker of progress toward mature milk production, is predicted by maternal report of a milk supply concern at d7. We used flame photometry to determine Na and K concentrations in d7 milk from the Early Lactation Success cohort, and defined elevated Na:K (↑Na:K) as &gt;75%tile. Of 406 mothers interviewed, 257 provided a milk sample, including 62 (24%) who reported a milk supply concern. Na:K ranged from 0.24 to 13.60 (median, 0.62) and was strongly correlated with formula use (Spearman r=0.21, p=0.0009). Subsequent analyses were restricted to the 197 mothers exclusively breastfeeding (EBF) at d7 (Na:K 75%tile=0.80). ↑Na:K occurred in 15/36 (42%) vs. 33/161 (20%) of mothers with vs. without a milk supply concern, respectively (p=0.008). This relation strengthened after adjustment for ethnicity: OR (95%CI), 2.8 (1.3‐6.0); and AOR (95%CI), 3.5 (1.5‐7.9).

What is not commonly understood is the supply network of these small food stores, and how this influences the food they stock. We conducted a network analysis to assess the influence of the supply network of corner stores on food procurement patterns and stocking of essential foods (fresh produce) versus non‐essential foods (snacks and beverages). We surveyed a sample of corner stores (n=24) in low‐income neighborhoods of Baltimore City, their suppliers (wholesalers, warehouse clubs, supermarkets, superstores) and their delivery vendors that provide shipments from manufacturers. Preliminary findings showed that, on average, each corner store is connected to more delivery vendors (6) than suppliers (3), resulting in a greater supply of non‐essential foods. Furthermore, non‐essential food procurement was more likely in corner stores with greater numbers and types of delivery vendors. With few alternatives, corner stores also show more reliance on a limited number of wholesalers in procuring essential foods. Our study highlights the significance in analyzing the supply network structure to identify potential points of intervention. To improve the availability of essential foods in small food stores, efforts are needed to increase diversity and density in a corner store’s supply network.</jats:p>",

Increased reactive nitrogen (Nr, NO3− &amp;amp;plus; NH4&amp;amp;plus;+ &amp;amp;plus; dissolved organic nitrogen) emission from the Asian continent poses profound threats to ecosystem safety from terrestrial throughout the ocean proper. To quantify atmospheric Nr input, diagnose its sources, and evaluate influence on marine nitrogen cycle of the South China Sea (SCS), an oligotrophic marginal sea adjacent to the emission hot spot China, we conducted measurements of concentrations of nitrate and ammonium as well as other major ions and dual isotopes of nitrate (δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3) in atmospheric deposition collected from Dongsha Island off southern China. The δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 for dry deposition averaged at −2.8‰ and +58.8‰, ranging from −7.5 to +3.7‰ and from ∼ +17 to +88‰, respectively. Wet deposition, although with limited samples, showed a similar flux-weighted mean in δ15NNO3 (−2.6‰) yet a significantly higher mean in δ18ONO3 (+78.8‰). The dual isotope ratios showed an anti-correlation and an inverse seasonality; the δ15NNO3 values were higher in summer compared to those in winter, while the δ18ONO3 values were higher in winter than those in summer. In winter, not only dual isotopic compositions of nitrate but also the ammonium and nitrate dry deposition fluxes were relatively uniform, demonstrating a persistent influence of fossil fuel combustion sourced from Asian continental outflows via the northeasterly monsoon winds. More variable isotopic values in summer likely suggest varying sources and dynamical formation processes of dry deposition nitrate. Biomass burning and lightning are suggested to be responsible for the observed higher δ15NNO3 values in summer. Atmospheric nitrate and ammonium deposition together was estimated to be ∼50 mmol N m−2 year−1, with the dominance of nitrate in dry deposition but ammonium slightly higher in wet deposition. If not including this additional fertilization of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen deposition to enhance the carbon sequestration, CO2 release out of the SCS would be double than that of the present amount, 460 ± 430 mmol C m−2 year−1. Our study demonstrates that atmospheric deposition may serve as an important external Nr supplier to the SCS; however it is difficult to separate the isotopic signal from N2 fixation (−2–0‰) due to their similarity in δ15NNO3. More studies related to isotopic composition of nitrogen speciation in atmospheric Nr deposition, their relative contributions and source identification, and the role of typhoons in the SCS are required.\n                    </jats:p>"

It involves the sequestration of dysfunctional or excessive mitochondria within double‐membrane autophagosomes, which then fuse with the vacuole/lysosome to deliver these mitochondria for degradation. To investigate a physiological role of macromitophagy in yeast, we examined how the <jats:italic>atg32Δ</jats:italic>‐dependent mutational block of this process influences the chronological lifespan of cells grown in a nutrient‐rich medium containing low concentration of glucose. Under these longevity‐extending conditions of caloric restriction (CR) yeast cells are not starving. We also assessed a role of macromitophagy in lifespan extension by lithocholic acid (LCA), a bile acid that prolongs yeast longevity under CR conditions. Our findings imply that macromitophagy is a longevity assurance process underlying the synergistic beneficial effects of CR and LCA on yeast lifespan. Our analysis of how the <jats:italic>atg32</jats:italic>Δ mutation influences mitochondrial morphology, composition and function revealed that macromitophagy is required to maintain a network of healthy mitochondria. Our comparative analysis of the membrane lipidomes of organelles purified from wild‐type and <jats:italic>atg32Δ</jats:italic> cells revealed that macromitophagy is required for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis.

An ongoing concern is the safety of supplies that use wastewater because of the potential for introduction of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals into drinking water supplies. Prior research into contaminants of emerging concerns (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CEC</jats:styled-content>s) have included a variety of methods, but the only consistent removal is with reverse osmosis (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RO</jats:styled-content>) membranes, ultraviolet light (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UV</jats:styled-content>), and advanced oxidation processes (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AOP</jats:styled-content>). However, few of these prior studies have measurable quantities of these contaminants in the influent wastewater, so determining actual removal percentages is difficult. This project was designed to evaluate the removal of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CEC</jats:styled-content>s to verify that a 3‐log removal of common constituents was realized.

However, to better understand the implications of anthropogenic nutrients requires a heightened understanding of baseline nutrient dynamics within these ecosystems. Here, we provide a novel perspective on coral reef nutrient dynamics by examining the role of fish communities in the supply and storage of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). We quantified fish‐mediated nutrient storage and supply for 144 species and modeled these data onto 172 fish communities (71 729 individual fish), in four types of coral reefs, as well as seagrass and mangrove ecosystems, throughout the Northern Antilles. Fish communities supplied and stored large quantities of nutrients, with rates varying among ecosystem types. The size structure and diversity of the fish communities best predicted N and P supply and storage and N : P supply, suggesting that alterations to fish communities (e.g., overfishing) will have important implications for nutrient dynamics in these systems. The stoichiometric ratio (N : P) for storage in fish mass (~8 : 1) and supply (~20 : 1) was notably consistent across the four coral reef types (but not seagrass or mangrove ecosystems). Published nutrient enrichment studies on corals show that deviations from this N : P supply ratio may be associated with poor coral fitness, providing qualitative support for the hypothesis that corals and their symbionts may be adapted to specific ratios of nutrient supply. Consumer nutrient stoichiometry provides a baseline from which to better understand nutrient dynamics in coral reef and other coastal ecosystems, information that is greatly needed if we are to implement more effective measures to ensure the future health of the world's oceans.</jats:p>",

Even though the thumb contributes 40 percent of the overall function of the hand, its irrigation is sometimes neglected. The principal irrigation of the thumb is normally provided by the princeps pollicis artery. It has been described that this artery usually arises from the radial artery or in other occasions can arise directly from the deep palmar arch, or from a common trunk with the radilis indicis artery. However, anatomical variations to this description have been found in previous studies. In order to determine the origin of the princeps pollicis artery, 12 hands were dissected out of 6 adults formalin preserved cadavers from the Gross Anatomy Laboratory of the Universidad Central del Caribe during the fall semester of 2012‐2013. In the present study we have found 58.3% of the specimens with the princeps pollicis artery arising from the first dorsal metacarpal artery. In 85.7% of these cases there is a persistent anastomosis between the princeps pollicis and the superficial palmar arch. Additionally, the irrigation of the thumb was found as normally described in 25% of the specimens. The remaining 16.6% of the specimens were discarded. These results allow us to suggest further investigation in this topic to provide significant statistics in terms of the incidence of this anatomical variation in the population.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold><jats:italic>Grant Funding Source</jats:italic></jats:bold><jats:italic>: Supported by: This publication was possible by grants from the National Center for Research Resources (5 G12 RR 003035‐27) and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (8G12 MD 007583‐27) from the National Institutes of Health</jats:italic></jats:p>",

A hybrid power source, which consists of a fuel cell (FC) and a rechargeable battery, has the advantages of long lifetime and good load-following capabilities. In this article, we propose the schematic of a hybrid power supply system that can be integrated on a chip compatible with present CMOS processes. For the on-chip, fuel-cell-based hybrid power system in wireless sensor node design, we propose a two steps optimization: (1) dynamic power management (DPM), and (2) adaptive fuel cell optimal power point tracking (AOPPT). Simulation results demonstrate that the on-chip FC-Bat hybrid power system can be used for wireless sensor nodes under different usage scenarios. Our proposed DPM method can achieve 12.9% more energy savings than the method without DPM. Meanwhile, implementing our AOPPT approach can save about 17% energy compared with the fixed architecture for the fuel cell system.

We quantified the impact of long‐term nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) treatments and greenhouse warming on the short‐term temperature (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic>) response and sensitivity of leaf respiration (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>), the high‐<jats:italic>T</jats:italic> threshold of <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>, and associated traits in shoots of the Arctic shrub <jats:italic>Betula nana</jats:italic> in experimental plots at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Respiration only acclimated to greenhouse warming in plots provided with both N and P (resulting in a ~30% reduction in carbon efflux in shoots measured at 10 and 20 °C), suggesting a nutrient dependence of metabolic adjustment. Neither greenhouse nor N+P treatments impacted on the respiratory sensitivity to <jats:italic>T</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sub>10</jats:sub>); overall, <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sub>10</jats:sub> values decreased with increasing measuring <jats:italic>T,</jats:italic> from ~3.0 at 5 °C to ~1.5 at 35 °C. New high‐resolution measurements of <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> across a range of measuring <jats:italic>T</jats:italic>s (25–70 °C) yielded insights into the <jats:italic>T</jats:italic> at which maximal rates of <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> occurred (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub>). Although growth temperature did not affect <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub>, N+P fertilization increased <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub> values ~5 °C, from 53 to 58 °C. N+P fertilized shoots exhibited greater rates of <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> than nonfertilized shoots, with this effect diminishing under greenhouse warming. Collectively, our results highlight the nutrient dependence of thermal acclimation of leaf <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> in <jats:italic>B. nana</jats:italic>, suggesting that the metabolic efficiency allowed via thermal acclimation may be impaired at current levels of soil nutrient availability. This finding has important implications for predicting carbon fluxes in Arctic ecosystems, particularly if soil N and P become more abundant in the future as the tundra warms.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Existing assessments of biomass supply and demand and their impacts face various types of limitations and uncertainties, partly due to the type of tools and methods applied (e.g., partial representation of sectors, lack of geographical details, and aggregated representation of technologies involved). Improved collaboration between existing modeling approaches may provide new, more comprehensive insights, especially into issues that involve multiple economic sectors, different temporal and spatial scales, or various impact categories. Model collaboration consists of aligning and harmonizing input data and scenarios, model comparison and/or model linkage. Improved collaboration between existing modeling approaches can help assess (i) the causes of differences and similarities in model output, which is important for interpreting the results for policy‐making and (ii) the linkages, feedbacks, and trade‐offs between different systems and impacts (e.g., economic and natural), which is key to a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of biomass supply and demand. But, full consistency or integration in assumptions, structure, solution algorithms, dynamics and feedbacks can be difficult to achieve. And, if it is done, it frequently implies a trade‐off in terms of resolution (spatial, temporal, and structural) and/or computation. Three key research areas are selected to illustrate how model collaboration can provide additional ways for tackling some of the shortcomings and uncertainties in the assessment of biomass supply and demand and their impacts. These research areas are livestock production, agricultural residues, and greenhouse gas emissions from land‐use change. Describing how model collaboration might look like in these examples, we show how improved model collaboration can strengthen our ability to project biomass supply, demand, and impacts. This in turn can aid in improving the information for policy‐makers and in taking better‐informed decisions.</jats:p>",

THE 1872 BRANCH SET OF ACCOUNTS The slow maturing process that started with the setting up of a cost accounting system in the 1820's and 1830's led, in 1872, to the adoption of branch accounting in which each branch of the Company had its own set of accounts. This development placed the Company very close to a modem day cost accounting system used by French companies today. All the basic principles were present in 1872. The July 25, 1872 instruction does not attribute a number to each account and does not group accounts into \"classes” as is now done in France. Therefore, the following classification is the researcher’s and consists of five categories: the balance sheet ac­ counts, expense accounts, activity center accounts, perpetual in­ ventory accounts, and manufacturing accounts. 1 — Balance sheet accounts a. “Central administration”: looks like a current account of the Paris Headquarters by the branch. b. \"Industrial buildings, tools and machinery” c. \"Debts” d. \"Drafts on Paris\"; to be paid by Paris e. \"Drafts on the factory\"; to be paid by the factory f. “Cash” 2 — Expenses accounts a. “Supply\" b. \"Wages\" c. “Sundries” 3 — Activity center accounts a.
