The suprarenal arteries are derived from the aorta but the superior and inferior artery invariably become the chief supply of the diaphragm and kidney, respectively.</jats:p><jats:p>The arteries supplying the gland are end arteries which branch profusely on the surface of the suprarenal capsule. These in turn give rise to smaller vessels in and under the capsule. At this level a unique capillary system forms vascular caps on glomerular clusters of cells. The vascular channels through the cortex are either cleft‐like sinusoids passing through or between glomerular cell groups or arteriae medullae. The former supply the cortical cells and the latter supply the medulla. The sinusoids of the inner cortex are wide, filled with red blood cells and constitute the first order of venous drainage.</jats:p><jats:p>The inner, provisional cortex of the fetal suprarenal gland is described and contrasted with the X zone of the mouse which is completely different in histological structure and manner of appearance and disappearance.</jats:p>",
