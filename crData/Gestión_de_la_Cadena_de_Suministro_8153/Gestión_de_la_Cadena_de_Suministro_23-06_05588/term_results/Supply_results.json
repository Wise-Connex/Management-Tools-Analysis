AI has developed dramatically in recent years, embodied by the newest generation of large language models (LLMs) that exhibit human‐like capabilities in various domains. However, SCM as a discipline seems unprepared for this potential revolution, as existing perspectives do not capture the potential for disruption offered by AI tools. Moreover, AI integration in SCM is not only a technical but also a social process, influenced by human sensemaking and interpretation of AI systems. This article offers a novel theoretical lens called the AI Integration (AII) framework, which considers two key dimensions: the level of AI integration across the supply chain and the role of AI in decision‐making. It also incorporates human meaning‐making as an overlaying factor that shapes AI integration and disruption dynamics. The article demonstrates that different ways of integrating AI will lead to different kinds of disruptions, both in theory and in practice. It also discusses the implications of AI integration for SCM theorizing and practice, highlighting the need for cross‐disciplinary collaboration and sociotechnical perspectives.</jats:p>",

The authors begin by describing analogies' role in advancing organization theory with a focus on image transfers between knowledge domains. While much has been said about the merits of conceptual transfers between domains, much equally remains unknown, particularly about how to deliberately develop creative insights that have the potential to challenge or enhance existing supply chain management theory. To address this issue, this research builds on prior work on analogies, creativity, and design thinking to develop a heuristic‐analytic model. This model is designed to assist researchers in theorizing by analogy through a controlled dual cognitive process of divergence before convergence combined with a distant boundary‐spanning knowledge search. An illustration of the model shows how creative output can provide a fresh perspective that helps render supply chains potentially more resilient.</jats:p>",

When disruptions occur in global supply chains, and in particular, in low‐income markets, they spur innovations that may be necessary to address both existing and potential future disruptions. However, such innovations in turn create disruptions to existing supply chains, and they may also create new supply chains. Therefore, this study theorizes in support of the mutual causality between innovation and disruption in low‐income markets. The focus is on low‐income market contexts because of the unique opportunities and constraints that exist in these contexts, resulting in interesting and unique dynamics between innovation and disruption. Further, the mechanisms through which innovation‐disruption mutual causality occurs—as well as the boundary conditions for these mechanisms—are identified. This culminates in a theoretical framework surrounding the interrelationship between disruption and innovation in low‐income markets. Theoretical and practical implications are explored, and potential areas for future research are delineated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Companies use supply chain strategies to achieve competitive advantage in the market. Volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA) have been characteristics for the global supply chain in the past years. The COVID-19 pandemic led to factory and port closures, transport bottlenecks and lorry driver shortages, which have had an impact on the supply chain. The world has become less predictable, which requires companies to define supply chain strategies to cope with more risks and uncertainties. An updated supply chain strategy system integrating offerings, capabilities, vision and mission is described. A method to define the four types of capabilities — products, processes, equipment, digital tools — is explained. The approach to translate the strategy intent into action is based on the steps architecture, design, implementation and execution. This can be defined for the key capabilities that need to be aligned for the success of the business. An example explains the application of the approach in a company. Reviewing strategy can be now executed more regularly and standardised, accelerating the time to adapt the strategy to changed requirements. Defining and implementing the supply chain strategy are key tasks for many companies. A good supply chain strategy helps a company to improve the competitiveness in the markets. Understanding customer requirements and own capabilities, the supply chain strategy defines how the company will excel in the market and for the customer. As the supply chain is responsible for most customer-oriented processes, it typically translates the company strategy in an actionable format. Many companies struggle to define the supply chain strategy and evaluate it regularly to identify when this strategy needs to be updated. VUCA have characterised the supply chain world in the last years. In the last 18 months many additional supply chain disruptions have appeared and long-standing supply chain assumption have proved to be wrong. Many companies need to review and update their supply chain strategy to align their existing capabilities with the changed market requirements, acquire new capabilities and refocus their internal and external processes. This paper discusses how supply chain leaders can define a new strategy to cope with the changed situation.</jats:p>"

Grounded in Duchek's organizational resilience theory, the purpose of this chapter is to explore the digital supply chain, a proposed solution to the global disruption impacting business sustainability. Data were collected from a review of previous literature and cases of digital supply chain successful implementation in the US retail industry. A key recommendation for firms is to invest in digital supply chain models that fit businesses' needs.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have gained popularity in logistics and supply chain management due to their ability to deliver goods, collect data, and perform various tasks. This research examines the potential of drones in enhancing the sustainability of agricultural supply chains and aims to explore how drones can improve efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of supply chain operations in agriculture. It focuses on analyzing the benefits and challenges associated with using drones in agricultural logistics, inventory management, last-mile delivery, monitoring, and inspection. The study highlights the significant contributions of the Lean approach in utilizing drones for supply chain management in agriculture. The findings indicate that drones optimize lastmile delivery, providing timely and efficient transportation while reducing costs and overcoming challenges faced by traditional vehicles. They also enhance inventory management by providing real-time information, leading to cost reduction and improved supply chain operations. Furthermore, drones play a crucial role in crop monitoring, facility inspections, and precision agriculture, improving overall productivity, reducing environmental impact, and promoting sustainability in the agricultural sector. This research provides valuable insights into the potential applications of drones in agricultural supply chains. By understanding the benefits and challenges associated with their use, stakeholders in the logistics and supply chain management industry can make informed decisions and develop strategies to incorporate drones into their operations.

Giri and Bardhan (2015) found out that supply chain process becomes inefficient and lack business strategies has affect the operation which led to poor profitability. That’s why manufacturing supply chain needs to innovate constantly for maintaining their position in the marketplace and to fight uncertainties. Hence firms are focusing on strategies for developing innovation within and across its manufacturing supply chain. In line with following objectives, this study employed a quantitative research approach that utilized stratified sampling technique and self-administered questionnaire survey. The respondents for this survey were the senior managers (top management) in operations management from manufacturing firms in Malaysia. Subsequently, the survey data have been utilized to test the research framework and hypothesis.  The results of the study are useful for supply chain practitioners and manufacturers in integrating the right SCMPs and competitive advantage on improving SCI. Furthermore, industrial practitioners also receive insight on how to take account of the mediating effect of competitive advantage in designing their supply chain innovation for better manufacturing performance. In fact, organizations are not certain of what to implement, due to a lack of understanding of what constitute a comprehensive set of SCMPs. There was far too little knowledge available on the role of competitive advantage in mediating the effect between SCMPs and supply chain innovation. As such, this paper is one of the first to address the mediating effect of competitive advantage between SCMPs and supply chain innovation. Also, the results have suggested successful dimensions of SCMPs that could be implemented in order to obtain competitive advantage and foster supply chain innovation in manufacturing industry in Malaysia.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Change is never easy, and leadership must champion the change. When UScellular made the decision to put more focus on its network supply chain operations, the company started with identifying the leadership team that would drive the organisational transformation. This piece of the puzzle was critical because it would be the foundation of the work needed to mature our network supply chain. Leaders would need to encourage collaboration, develop talent and work across organisational boundaries. The new UScellular network supply chain needed change champions. These leaders needed to be able to work together seamlessly, build trust and have strategic thinking to help us set priorities and navigate to our future. The leaders needed to engage their teams to start driving the changes. It was part of the strategy to be very deliberate on who was hired for each of the leadership roles and what function they would lead. Once the leadership team was in place, we discussed how important change management was going to be for us to be successful as we navigated not only the change to our organisation but to our partners and stakeholders. We discussed how we would approach hiring, process creation and how we were going to get there. We had open communication with our teams and partners and knew that we may not get everything right the first time. But we believed in the strategy, and we would learn and improve along the way. The team drove a culture of inclusiveness, accountability and openness. When discussing how to handle our change management plans, we made sure to address five key steps: 1) prepare the organisation for change; 2) vision and plan for change; 3) implement the changes; 4) embed changes within team culture and practices; and 5) review progress and analyse results. These five steps were instrumental in setting the team up for success in the transformation. Leaders deliberately kept in mind how to care for the team and how they might be feeling during different stages of this transformation. Another key piece for network supply chain transformation was that senior UScellular leadership was very supportive of what we were trying to accomplish. They understood that this was going to be a journey that we needed to manage from both a people perspective and a process perspective, with impact on both internal and external partners. Senior leaders recognised the need for additional personnel for the organisational transformation to be successful. They gave the team the support needed to be successful in driving a more mature supply chain. In conclusion, for this transformation to be successful, we addressed leadership by hiring the right associates for the right roles and focusing on change management. We were open and honest with the larger team and partners that we would have our struggles but would work together to find common ground and solutions that would drive real progress. Our progress shows how we were able to use change management practices effectively to drive this progress.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Eighty per cent of companies are unprepared to quickly address disruptions and their operations are not structured to absorb disruptions over the long term, according to a recent Boston Consulting Group (BCG) survey. These companies need to strengthen their resilience — the ability to quickly identify and assess risks, react fast and absorb the impacts of disruptions across the supply chain. Although the pandemic-induced supply chain challenges are easing, now is the time for supply chain leaders to reinforce their commitment to resilience. Each company should determine the optimal level of supply chain resilience in its specific circumstances and risk profile. This paper sets out a wide variety of actions to build resilience. Investments that allow companies to ‘absorb’ disruptions (for example, network design, multisourcing, product redesign and inventory) are costly to employ across the board, so a targeted approach is necessary to maximise return on investment. Investments to ‘recover’ from disruptions (monitoring and sensing, predictive modelling and crisis response) can be cost-effective and offer the promise of a first-mover advantage when crises occur. All companies need both absorb and recover capabilities. Our research finds, however, that few companies excel in all these dimensions, and the frontrunners are investing to increase their advantage. Companies can apply these capabilities to define a strong resilience strategy. Steps include gaining visibility into your extended supply chain, quantifying potential disruptions and the cost of actions to reduce the associated risks, and understanding your current level of resilience and how resilient you want to become. With this information, supply chain leaders can secure the investment they need.</jats:p>"

This paper attempts to show the impact of enabling alternative qualified and more affordable supplier sources of spare parts to be part of the procurement process along with original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to supply the plant machinery’s spare parts for maintenance. In this case study, the reverse engineering of spare parts is intended for Saudi Aramco internal installation and utilisation and not for commercial purposes. This is particularly relevant to cases of OEM parts becoming obsolete or sources are diminishing, causing increased spare parts cost. The case study sheds some light on the work done, the challenges faced to enable such process and shares the methodology used. It also shows the cost saving, materials shortening delivery time, localisation and other benefits as a result of obtaining spare parts from reverse engineering manufacturers.</jats:p>"

This study examines the impact of earthquakes, a type of natural disaster, on firms and supply chains. Earthquakes affect not only the firm or the country directly affected by the disaster, but also all supply chains, which have become more complex and sophisticated due to globalization. In order to create resilient supply chains, the shares of global firms during the earthquake process are analyzed and recommendations are developed.</jats:p>",

Supply chains across industries and geographic locations must also adopt the new technologies that replace human labor in order tor remain relevant and functional. That is not to say that the need for human labor is completely non-existent. For developing and emerging economies, where the extent of digitization is still dismally low because of various factors, the relevance of the human facet of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is still hugely relevant and essential. This article investigates the importance of the human factor in the management of digitized supply chain in the modern world, from the perspective of the developing countries. The research reveals that there is no substitute for human labor, especially in situations where there is need for speed in decision making and where computer programs run on historical knowledge become incapable of offering a solution. Key words: digitization, supply chain, supply chain management, human, labor, RPA, AI, ML, labor displacement. </jats:p>"

The data from the interviews were then analyzed using grounded theory (GT). To detect any interrelationships among the elements, the model was further analyzed quantitatively through the rough DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) method. Rough set theory was used to aggregate group information to overcome the vagueness of the group decision-making process. The results of the qualitative phase helped to configure a model which included 6 main dimensions, 17 sub-dimensions, and 48 elements.

One approach to fixing this problem is to use a SCOR strategy that is effective in improving the supply chain. PT. X is one of the fertilizer companies whose current condition is that there are problems in planning to meet the needs for production supporting materials so which has the potential to hinder fertilizer production. This is because PT X has not carried out an analysis that hinders demand planning or the supply chain as a whole. Thus, researchers can measure the value of effectiveness in the supply chain to improve targets that have not been achieved. In this research, a scoring method called SCOR was used which included AHP weighting. Fifteen key performance indicators (KPI) were generated based on the five SCOR model indicators used in processing, namely data plan, source, make, delivery, and return. With a final score of the SCM performance level of 86.872, which is included in the Good category. However, this value can still be improved so that it is included in the excellent category, namely &gt;90.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the agricultural sub-sectors that occupy a strategic position in agricultural development is the horticultural sub-sector, with one of its potential commodities being avocado. Avocado is one of the export-based commodities, especially in South OKU Regency, South Sumatra Province. This study aims to obtain an overview of the Avocado Agribusiness Supply Chain management in South OKU Regency. The study was conducted in Warkuk Selatan District, South OKU Regency in February 2022. The research method used was a qualitative descriptive method with a type of data using primary data and secondary data. The data analysis method uses the Food Supply Chain Network (FSCN) method, which illustrates South Oku Regency's avocado supply chain model. The results showed that the Avocado Management Supply Chain Management model with the FSCN framework consisted of four main components: the supply chain structure, the business chain process, supply chain management, and supply chain resources. Avocado supply chain targets are still dominated to meet the domestic market and products in the form of fresh avocados for consumption. Avocado supply chain management comprises election partners, contractual agreements, transaction systems, government support, and supply chain collaboration. The avocado supply chain structure in South OKU Regency consists of farmers, collecting traders, local and non-local traders, retailers, and consumers with respective roles in the supply chain structure.  Business processes in avocado supply chain management consist of procurement, replenishment, and customer order cycles. Based on marketing margin analysis, the lowest total marketing margin is found in channel IV, with a margin value of Rp 1,500 per kg. The four avocado marketing channels in South Warkuk Ranau District have Farmer’s Share ≥40%, so it is categorized as an efficient channel.</jats:p>"

To prepare for disruptions, companies historically have utilized scenario planning capabilities to build redundancy, flexibility, and develop early detection capabilities. In this chapter, the authors provide guidance on selecting the right ‘causal linkages' between supply chain objectives and performance measures, relevant to the scenarios being evaluated. The authors describe how organizations can leverage the maturity model approach in conjunction with foundational concepts of perspective-based performance evaluation models, like the balanced scorecard (BSC), to define a comprehensive performance measurement framework. The authors propose using maturity models – which by design provide a roadmap to the next level of performance – as a structured way of identifying any supply chain's current capability or maturity level. A holistic framework for operational metric alignment and KPI governance, based on perspective-based modeling design principles is presented.</jats:p>",

Development prospects are also considered, starting from the automation of individual procedures and moving on to the development of complex autonomous systems for decision-making. Further, a detailed analysis of the transformation of key business processes in supply chains under the influence of artificial intelligence was carried out. This made it possible to discover how artificial intelligence technologies affect the organization and management of supply chains, which can lead to changes in management approaches and strategies. In the article, a matrix model of the interaction of specialists with artificial intelligence in supply chain management was developed and improved. It contributes to the understanding of how to effectively combine the role of humans and artificial intelligence systems to optimize processes in supply chains. Special attention is paid to the transition from supporting to autonomous role of artificial intelligence systems in supply chains. This change in dynamics may change the balance of power between humans and AI systems, and affect accountability and control mechanisms, as well as the ethical implications of delegating authority to AI systems. Accordingly, it is important to develop the digital skills of supply chain managers and increase their level of digital competence in order to implement artificial intelligence technologies effectively and ethically. The lack of such competencies can become an obstacle in the development and successful use of artificial intelligence in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

While some studies find that recalls represent failures that can motivate firms to innovate, others suggest that the resource‐intensive nature of recalls may inhibit firms from innovating. This study presents a theoretical framework that reconciles these two perspectives by proposing an inverted U‐shaped relationship between a firm's product recall frequency and innovation output. The paper also evaluates the effect of the firm's growth potential on the recall frequency–innovation relationship. Analysis of data on vehicle recalls and recall‐related patents in the automotive sector from 1980 to 2019 confirms the inverted U‐shaped relationship and shows that the relationship is steepened by the growth potential of the firm. Overall, the study presents a more nuanced understanding of learning from product recalls and bridges the supply chain disruption and innovation literature in the context of product recall.</jats:p>",

A total of 29 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2015-2022 with a focus on sustainable public procurement (SPP) practices and SDGs were retrieved from the Web of Science and Emerald databases for analysis. From the reviewed articles, we develop a conceptual model for better illustration and understanding of the link between SPP practices and SDGs. The model indicates that the achievement of SGDs can be influenced by four dimensions, namely: the underlying principles of SPP, the fundamental practices of SPP principles, the drivers of SPP principles, and the perceived roles of SPP practices which are aligned with the targets of UN SDGs. The analysis of the study revealed that SPP can impact up to 70% (12 out of 17) of UN SDGs. It is established that pubic procurement performs important functions in a diligent manner which adds value and delivers core services to societies, thus supporting the achievement of SDGs. Individual commitment and political will, strong enforcement and control mechanisms, continuous monitoring and assessment of the target areas, and offering inclusive solutions and shared visions among actors are identified as the drivers for building resilience in SPP and achievement of SDGs. The developed model could serve as a basis for identifying the deficiencies in SPP and achievement of SDGs for policy implications, reform, and future research domains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ever-changing and volatile nature of today's economic climate places a significant strain on supply chain management. Manufacturing organizations, particularly in developing nations like Sri Lanka, are exposed to a number of hazards that could impair overall performance and disrupt supply chain operations. Utilizing the Resource Based View (RBV) and Dynamic Capability View (DCV), this study sought to determine the effects of supply chain risk on supply chain integration and agility performance. The study is quantitative and cross-sectional, with data collected by a standardized questionnaire. 165 apparel manufacturing plants registered under the Board of Investment (BOI) in Sri Lanka were selected for the survey with the systematic random sample. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 and Structural Equation Modeling with Smart PLS. The findings show that supply chain risk has a significant positive impact on supply chain integration. Furthermore, Supply chain integration impacts on the agility performance. The results support the presence of mediation of supply chain integration on the supply chain risk and agility performance. These findings point to a positive and significant relationship between supply chain risk and supply chain integration. In addition, supply chain integration has a positive effect on the agility performance. The findings corroborate the existence of a mediating effect of supply chain integration on supply chain risk and agility performance. The results of this study indicate that organizations mitigate supply chain risk by fostering customer and supplier partnerships that boost agility and flexibility. Moreover, supply chain integration can assist businesses lessen the negative effects of supply chain risk on their agility performance by enhancing coordination, communication, and responsiveness across the various phases of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

All the relationships were significant. Also, the drivers and inhibitors of SC digitisation revealed both positive and negative associations with the extent of  SC integration.&#x0D;\nResearch Limitation: The selected firms are not fully representing the entire population of cement manufacturing and distribution firms in Ghana, which impact on the external validity of the findings.&#x0D;\nPractical Implications: The results will help increase the performance of cement production firms and improve its SC integration.

This logic conceals the imposing weight of services. Logistics is an activity that is undergoing major changes due to new technologies and managerial innovations. The advent of the supply chain service (SSCM), as a dual concept combining both traditional supply operations and the coordination of various resources, with a view to customer satisfaction, while integrating constraints of time, capacity, shared resources, and co-production, has turned logistics research upside down. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a qualitative analysis of the impact of MCSS practices on the performance of the service company. The theoretical analysis and the review of interviews show that SSCM approaches differ, and that company performance is viewed differently depending on each SSCM practice, and also depending on the multiple facets of this performance.

Each of these, Shocking Contrasts argues, amounted to an unanticipated shock, positive or negative, to the supply of a crucial factor of production; and elicited one of four main responses: factor substitution; factor movement to a different sector or region; technological innovation; or political action, sometimes extending to coercion at home or conquest abroad. This book examines parsimonious models of factor returns, relative costs, and technological innovation. It offers a framework for understanding the role of supply shocks in major political conflicts and argues that its implications extend far beyond these specific cases to any period of human history.</jats:p>",

Considering their commitment to sustainability and presence in the high-impact sector of food and beverages, this chapter analyzes the impact of government interventions on these companies' supply chains. Their CDP responses, sustainability reports, and relevant literature were qualitatively analyzed using the cross-case analysis method to investigate collaborative strategies enabling low-carbon transitions in these companies. Based on the analysis, environmental sustainability dimensions were devised that demand substantial engagement with governments and regulatory authorities. Implications of the study are manifold as it not only provides recommendations for effective government-industry partnerships in the food sector but also provides the basis for further research in this area.</jats:p>",

This paper carries out a disaggregated analysis of the structure of the hashish supply chain from Morocco to Europe to explain the value contributions at each level, the end-price formation, and the supply chain management practices. The methodology adopted is based on a mixed method of data collection where the primary data are gathered from field interviews with cannabis producers and dealers and secondary information is obtained from official statistics, research papers, informational reports, and documentaries. We review supply and value chain frameworks through the lens of cost–benefit analysis. Our main findings show an unequal contribution on the part of the different levels of distribution, with end-user prices increasing by 7000% of the cost of production during the supply chain. The chain also has high variable costs but limited fixed ones, exacerbating the lack of stability and fostering continuous adaptation. We also detect a reluctance to raise end-user prices but a great propensity to change quality. This research may have implications for several stakeholders. In the case of dealers, we find that they have created a supply-push system thanks to their dominant power, leaning on information sharing as a source of resilience. In the case of law enforcement, we delve into the operational functioning of the drug chain and the reasons for its survival. For financial investigation operations, unknown or unrealized economic parameters are quantified. For development agencies, the need to implement alternative development programs for producers is evidenced. Finally, for health authorities, we highlight the consequences of seizures and prohibitions of hashish trafficking on the deterioration of the quality of hashish and the subsequently added health hazards for end-users.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the value chain effect of these developments on the telecommunications sector of the Nigerian economy. There is focus on the industry itself, subsidiary industries as well as the downstream value chain creation arising from the influx of emerging markets multinational enterprises (EMNEs) into the sector. Using basic statistical techniques, the study finds that the entrance of the multinational investors into the industry following the market liberalization policy of 1999 has not only created a vibrant telecommunications market but also enhanced the value chain on the Nigerian economy at large. The findings of this study provide further insight into the value chain creation debate as it concerns the telecommunications industry not just in Nigeria but in countries of similar economic stature and structure. Additionally, the findings are important to the regulators and policy makers in developed and developing economies alike, for evidence-based policies.</jats:p>"

Knowledge-based supply chains have a critical role in increasing resilience in supply chain processes with emerging technologies. Thus, it is necessary to determine the critical factors that increase SC resilience. Therefore, this study aims to determine SC resilience improvement factors in knowledge-based supply chains and investigate the importance level of determining factors using the Graph Theory Matrix Approach. The results suggest that the most important supply chain resilience improvement factor is Adaptive Capacity (F3), followed by Product Prioritization (F9) and Flexibility (F1), respectively. This study is expected to benefit managers and policymakers as it provides a better understanding of critical SC resilience improvement factors that play a role in knowledge-based supply chains. In order to increase resilience in the supply chain, system thinking and solutions should be encouraged by businesses to increase collaboration with stakeholders. Businesses and governments should provide collaborative long-term solutions for the uncertain environment to ensure a sustainable and resilient environment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable supply chains have become increasingly crucial to address environmental and social challenges faced by societies worldwide. Last-mile delivery, which involves delivering products from a distribution center or warehouse to the final destination, typically a consumer's doorstep, is an essential component of the supply chain. However, it faces numerous challenges such as traffic congestion, air and noise pollution, and carbon emissions. This research paper explores the viability of last-mile delivery solutions for sustainable supply chains. The study reviews the literature on last-mile delivery challenges, sustainable last-mile delivery solutions, and case studies of sustainable last-mile delivery solutions. The results indicate that innovative last-mile delivery solutions, such as electric vehicles, cargo bikes, and drones, have the potential to reduce environmental impact and improve the efficiency of last-mile delivery while enhancing social equity. Additionally, partnerships between different stakeholders, including governments, logistics companies, and consumers, can contribute to the development of sustainable last-mile delivery solutions. The study concludes that sustainable last-mile delivery solutions are essential to achieving sustainable supply chains and recommends further research to explore the economic feasibility and scalability of these solutions.</jats:p>"

The main direction of business process reengineering in the conditions of modern competitive interaction is the entry into the zone of inter-company relations, to the level of coordination of the activities of enterprises – elements of creating added value with the aim of working out a joint strategy within the framework of creating value for the end consumer. Aspects of digitalization of supply chain management processes are considered, highlighting Blockchain as a promising direction of digitalization within the framework of monitoring the movement of goods from the first resource level to the final consumer, conducting financial transactions, and identifying users. The process approach is integrated with the concept of value chain management. This led to the selection of the “previous types of activities” and “subsequent types of activities” segments in view of the focus on the agrarian enterprise as a focal element. Measures to overcome the current problems of the functioning of logistics supply chains in the agricultural sector of the Ukrainian economy are summarized, including reengineering the export infrastructure system (creating a diversified logistics system resistant to external challenges), diversification of the activities of agricultural enterprises within the framework of optimization of the business process implementation model by supplementing the chain of creation of added value with previous and subsequent types of activities within the framework of integrated agricultural structures in order to reduce the impact of the external environment (in practice, the presented strategy is implemented through vertical integration “from the bottom up”). The positive effects of vertical integration in the agricultural sector, consisting of the optimization of business processes, are highlighted: reduced dependence on foreign markets, reduction of total costs due to the coverage of logistics processes, optimization of the range of finished products by lengthening value-added chains; formation and rational use of investment funds in view of losses as a result of military actions.</jats:p>",

The dimensions of SCM practices examined in this study were strategic supplier partnership, customer relationship management, level of information sharing, quality of information sharing, and internal lean practice. The metric for measuring the company’s operational performance was the lead time. A quantitative research approach was used for this study to determine the effect of supply chain management practices and the operational performance of BBSc. The descriptive and explanatory research design was employed for the study. The probability sampling technique particularly the stratified and simple random sampling method was used to enable the researcher to use his discretion in selecting samples from the target population. Using a total of 33 questionnaires; the primary data was collected from 184 employees. The data was collected by using 5 point Likert Scale type questionnaire and then the collected data were analyzed using SPSS Version 25. From the result of the analysis, it was concluded that there was strongly positive and significant correlation between SCM practices and overall operational performance since the SCM practices included in this study explained 80.9% of the variability of the operational performance of the company. Based on the findings, the researcher recommended that Beddelle Brewery share company should strive to involve its key suppliers in planning and goal setting, create long-term agreement with key strategic suppliers, and interact with customers to set reliability, responsiveness, and other standard work for the organization, to be informed on the changing needs to improve their understanding with their trading partners and to work on improving quality of information sharing practices across the supply chain timely with its supplier.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The issue of labor rights violations by multinational corporations has emerged as a serious international problem. Accordingly, the international community discussed how to regulate labor rights violations by multinational companies and strengthen their responsibility to protect labor rights. Various efforts and attempts to protect human rights at the level of multinational corporations, global governance and international organizations, and advanced countries have resulted in preventing violations of labor rights by multinational corporations and enhancing labor rights. However, there were definitely limitations. New measures are emerging to enhance labor human rights that can overcome these limitations. The EU Parliament and EU Member States have determined that the essence of the problem of labor rights violations by multinational corporations lies in global supply chains. They intend to enhance labor rights by enacting the Mandatory Corporate Due Diligence Act (Mandatory Supply Chain Due Diligence) to impose certain obligations on domestic companies, overseas branches of domestic companies, and subcontractors for human rights and due diligence. The due diligence obligations of the EU Parliament and EU member states are not limited to domestic companies, but they are also mandatory for foreign companies operating in their countries, which is expected to have a lot of impact and change. According to the EU Parliament's Corporate Due Diligence Directive, Korean conglomerates and small and medium-sized enterprises exporting to the EU are subject to the due diligence guidelines, so they must carry out due diligence on human rights and the environment in their supply chains, assess and minimize negative impacts, and disclose information. The EU Parliament's Mandatory Business Due Diligence Directive applies not only to the original contracting company but also to cases of human rights violations caused by its suppliers.\r\nIn particular, the textile and steel industries, which are high-risk sectors, are more likely to be classified as companies subject to due diligence obligations, so they should also pay attention to the issue of labor rights violations that may occur in the global supply chain. Although it will take some time for the EU Parliament's mandatory corporate due diligence directive to be applied in EU member states, the trend of EU member states and the EU Parliament making it mandatory for companies to conduct due diligence on their supply chains is expected to have a significant impact on international norms. In line with this trend, the Korean government also needs to actively restructure its domestic laws and policies to comply with various international standards, including the European Due Diligence Directive.</jats:p>",

Advanced biomanufacturing is estimated as being $94.6 billion while total biomanufacturing is $438.8 billion. When including supply chain items and other indirect value added, the total biomanufacturing industry is $1363.8 billion and advanced biomanufacturing is $259.9 billion. These estimates include biomanufacturing items that are excluded from estimates of the bioeconomy made by other organizations and/or individuals. Other U.S. estimates have also been inconsistent with measures of GDP or value added. As calculated using NIST's Manufacturing Cost Guide, the biomanufacturing industry impact accounts for 43 % of the total U.S. impact while advanced biomanufacturing is 6.4 %. This report also examines the assets, material flow time, fuels, and electricity used in biomanufacturing.</jats:p>"

With the development of science and technology, people’s living standard is constantly improving. The demand of the elderly group for old-age service is not only limited to the basic daily life of individuals before; it is moving toward the need for services that make people happier and healthier, how to integrate modern science and technology with the old-age service industry to make it serve the old-age industry better. This research is about constructing and evaluating the intelligent supply chain of Chinese old-age service. Based on the research results of previous scholars, this paper divides the construction of the intelligent supply chain of China endowment service into four aspects: policy aspect, economic aspect, social aspect, and technical aspect; the four significant aspects are divided into the first-level indicators, and 16 second-level indicators are divided under the first-level indicators. The importance and satisfaction of each evaluation index were obtained by distributing questionnaires to the managers who study the supply chain and the employees who are related to the old-age service. After the reliability analysis, the IPA quadrant analysis chart of the evaluation index was constructed using importance-performance analysis. The index of constructing an intelligent supply chain system for China old-age service is given priority, the supply chain system of China old-age service is further improved, and the social security of China old-age service is enlarged.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the drivers ofsupply network resilience, viewed as adaptive capacity to disruptions, focusing on trust and investigating the moderating role of network topology on the relationship between trust and resilience.We first develop an NK agent-based model of the supply network to simulate resilient performance.Then, a simulation analysis is carried out, to assess the effect of trust on the resilience of supply networks displaying different complex topologies. Our results confirm that trust positively affects supplynetwork resilience; however, across the different topologies, the beneficial effect of trust varies. Inparticular, we find that trust is beneficial at most for the following topologies: local, small-world,block-diagonal, and random. For centralised, diagonal, and hierarchical topologies improving trustincreases resilience at a moderate level. We also find that, as the frequency of disruptions rises, thepositive effect of trust on resilience decreases. Managerial implications of the main findings are finallydiscussed</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This methodological paper proposes two codifiability indicators to examine trade and manufacturing statistics and the spatial distribution of value-added manufacturing activities. Codifiability is defined as the level of documentation about the manufacturing processes of a product required to allow tasks to be replicated by other suppliers. First, the codifiability indicators allow researchers to examine products that are grouped under the same sub-product class in conventional statistics, but the manufacture of such products could involve vastly different technologies and thus the level of value-added. A proprietary database was used to delineate the supply networks of automakers in passenger vehicles and their major tier-I suppliers between 2000 and 2015. Second, codifiability allowed the researchers to unpack the spatial distribution of value-addedness of each supplier in the production network, as illustrated by the top two parts suppliers to the automotive industry, Bosch and Denso. The importance of codified standardized commodity parts with lower value-added in the continental European home market illustrates the importance of geographical proximity for Bosch, while the dominance of non-standardized service parts with lower level of codification and higher value-added in its exports to North America is also consistent with the ‘follow the customers’ process in the overseas market reported in the automotive industry. The relative importance of service parts with lower level of codifiability in Denso’s home market illustrates the division of labour with other cross-holding suppliers (especially Aisin and JTEKT) and thus the effects of the interlocking cross-holding of Japanese automobile and parts suppliers, which reconfirms the importance of cultural proximity in Asia’s (Japanese) supply networks.</jats:p>",

This can address power quality issues or provide emergency traction for locomotives that unexpectedly lose power and even break through traditional energy barriers in the railway field, achieving a low-carbon power supply for railway energy, and a mutual backup with substations. However, methods to coordinate the control strategies of PV and the battery locomotive traction have not been clearly revealed, nor has the actual stability of the system. In this study, to address the above issues, an emergency power supply scheme is proposed for the first time that utilizes a dual-mode RPC inverter combined with a coordinated control strategy for the PV and battery, achieving the traction of locomotives. In addition, a one-dimensional impedance model was established for the PV system, battery system, locomotive (CRH3), and RPC projected onto the dq coordinate system, and the critical amplitude margin (CAM) was defined to quantitatively analyze the sensitivity and laws of different parameters concerning the low-frequency stability of the system. At the same time, impedance ratios and passive criteria were used to reveal the stability mechanism, and parameter adjustment criteria and design suggestions were put forward. Finally, the feasibility of the emergency power supply scheme of the “PV–battery locomotive network” coupling system and the correctness of the low-frequency stability study were verified using the Starsim semi-physical experiment platform.</jats:p>"

Thus, the value of the maximum heat flow to the heating system decreased by 36%, and the maximum heat flow to the hot water supply system - by 7.7%, and the total maximum hourly heat consumption, respectively, decreased by 23%. In addition, studies have established that for such values of the thermal power of the heat source, a decrease in the temperature parameters of the heat carrier can lead to an increase in the consumption of the heat carrier to provide thermal energy to the house by almost 3 times. And this, in turn, for the same diameter of the pipeline, leads to an increase in specific pressure losses by more than 5 times, and, accordingly, to an increase in the power of circulation pumps, the consumption of electrical energy and the cost of these pumps. This means that at present, the transition of large systems of district heating system of Ukraine to low-temperature coolants is possible only during the reconstruction of heat networks.</jats:p>",

It is noted that, from a theoretical and practical point of view, there is a great interest in deliveries in international supply chains, which are usually multimodal and include many unique aspects specific to a particular chain, a particular delivery scheme.\nAn example of delivery of goods that have both perishable and dangerous properties – bioproducts in international supply chains – was considered, which is presented in the form of a scheme for organizing the service of transportation of special cargoes involving motor vehicles, which also incorporates an aviation component. The scheme of the cargo delivery organization complex in the road-air connection was proposed, which includes stages related to transportation by road and air (with road delivery including main road transporta-tion, as well as deliveries to and from airports, last mile delivery), loading and unloading operations, temporary storage of goods, organizational and forwarding activities, etc.\nIt is noted that there is a need to take into account the fact that the peculiarities of special categories of cargo delivery are related to their specific properties and should be addressed by all participants in the delivery process in the international supply chain, primarily carriers who are responsible for the safety of cargo along certain parts of the route. At the same time, it was determined that the freight forwarder or logistics operator, as the organizer of the cargo delivery process, must ensure the processes of consolidation and deconsolidation of cargo (with the possible addition of refrigerants).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Developing an energy supply based on resources whose use does not spoil the noosphere and the creation of such energy supply of efficient equipment whose operation does not cause any damage to nature and man is an urgent task. The need for such an approach is especially relevant and noticeable in agriculture. This article presents the final results of complex studies of new PV devices and PV systems based on them. Considered in the article are the best solutions we propose to improve PV equipment and make it more attractive for agricultural consumers. The developed vertical and planar high-voltage multijunction silicon PV cells and PV modules on their basis are presented. The first type of modules have a maximum power point voltage of up to 1000 V, specific power of up to 0.245 ± 0.01 W/cm2, and efficiency of up to 25.3% under a concentration ratio range of 10–100 suns. The samples of the second module type (60,156.75 × 156.75 mm PV cells) have an open-circuit voltage of 439.7 V, a short-circuit current of 0.933 A, and a maximum power of 348 W. Additionally, two types of newly designed solar energy concentrators are described in this article: one-dimensional double-wing concentrator ensuring low Fresnel optical losses and multi-zone parabolotoric microconcentrator with the uniform radiation distribution in the focal region, as well as modules based on these concentrators and the developed PV cells. For PV modules, the maximum power degradation is 0.2–0.24% per year in a wet ammonia environment. For concentrating PV modules, this degradation is 0.22–0.37% per year. This article sets out the principles of increasing the efficiency of PV systems by increasing the level of systematization and expanding the boundaries of PV systems. The thus-created PV systems satisfy 30–50% more consumer needs. Thanks to a higher output voltage and other specific features of the developed modules, PV system loss decreased by 12–15%, and maintenance losses also decreased.</jats:p>"

The study was quantitative, involving a sample of 402 supply chain professionals drawn from the manufacturing sector across the four provinces of the country. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling based on the SMART PLS technique. Eco-design Green distribution and green training impacted positively on dynamic capabilities, the latter of which in turn is linked to improved agility, reliability, and reduced supply chain costs.

In the works of domestic researchers, starting from the 18th century, individual theses appear on the local and imported nature of objects, their characteristics and differences are mentioned, and the manufacturing process is described, but these data have not been generalized to date. The subject of the study is a complex of written, material and pictorial sources containing information about the place and time of manufacture of composite bows used by Buryat archers. The article analyzes data from written sources and published works of specialists on the topic. The data is compared with identified composite bows from museum and private collections collected in the territory of Buryat residence or received from Buryat archers, as well as with a series of published images. As a result of the analysis, it was possible to identify and prove the existence of two sources of supply of composite bows to Buryat archers: imports and local production. Imported products are represented by various variants of the “Manchu-Mongolian” tradition, differing in the general ideas of the craftsmen about morphology, sizes and basic manufacturing techniques; Bright decor was used for decoration. The most common were locally made compound bows. Despite some differences, locally produced items are fundamentally different from imported ones in terms of morphometric features, which confirms that the Buryats have a local, distinctive culture of shooting and making composite bows.\n\t</jats:p>"

During the research, data from the National List of Essential Medicines, the 14th State Formulary of Medicines, the Ukrainian clinical protocol, the clinical protocols of Great Britain and the United States of America for the treatment of breast cancer, and a depersonalized database of drug prescriptions were used. The research used such methods as clinical-economic, organizational-economic, mathematical-statistical, graphic, grouping and generalization.\nResearch results. It was established that 46 schemes of schemes for the treatment of breast cancer are presented in Ukrainian and international clinical protocols (Great Britain, USA). In all three protocols, there were 5 regimens for the treatment of breast cancer, such as CMF (Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexat, Fluorouracil), AC (Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide), DC (Docetaxel, Cyclophosphamide), TC (Trastuzumab, Capecitabin), EC (Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide).\nAnalysis of the pharmaceutical component in the protocols for individual drugs showed that they included 23 drugs according to the INN, which belong to the group of antineoplastic drugs. The Ukrainian clinical protocol includes 17 drugs, the British protocol – 14 drugs, and the American one – 15 drugs. The frequency analysis of antineoplastic drugs included in the Ukrainian clinical protocol revealed the TOP-3 in terms of drug prescription frequency: L01A A01 Cyclophosphamide (Ki=0.037), L01C D02 Docetaxel (Ki=0.029), L01D B01 Doxorubicin (Ki=0.026). The largest number of prescribed drugs are vital drugs – 61.96 %, the smallest share – essential drugs – 2.17 %, and the share of non-essential drugs is 35.87 %. The ABC analysis made it possible to determine the group of the most expensive drugs in the treatment of breast cancer - these are antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents. The total expenses for this group amounted to UAH 772,459.96, which according to the US dollar exchange rate of the National Bank of Ukraine at the end of August 2022 was USD 21,122.77. According to the analysis of the matrix of the integrated ABC-VEN-frequency analysis, it was established that the largest number of prescriptions belonged to the group of less expensive and vital drugs (B/V) – 7 drugs (48.73 % of the total amount. At the same time, the largest amount of expenses is observed in for the A/V group – UAH 772,459.96 (52.83 % of all costs directed to the pharmaceutical support of patients). The results of the structural analysis of the group of the most expensive drugs showed that the highest costs were characteristic of L01CD02 Docetaxel (UAH 1166,531.31; 39.81 % of the total cost in the group), and the lowest – for L01DB01 Doxorubicin – UAH 63,694.14 (5.46 %, respectively).\nConclusions. According to the results of the conducted research, it was established that the largest costs fall on the group of essential drugs (1047735.07 UAH, 71.65 % of all costs). This determines the need for further pharmacoeconomic calculations of breast cancer treatment to optimize the costs of antineoplastic drugs</jats:p>"

This study demonstrates the parallels between different types of project risks, their ratings, and the different lending instruments and amounts committed by the bank. The most prevalent risks in the analyzed WSS projects were identified, namely, fiduciary, institutional capacity for implementation and sustainability, environmental and social, and political and governance. The World Bank appears to have different levels of tolerance for the different types of risks, and this tolerance seems to vary between regions and with time. Risks seem to have different weights when financiers decide which WSS projects to finance. Global and regional risk profiles of the 185 WSS projects financed by the World Bank were developed, which can help borrowers identify risks that they can mitigate to potentially improve their ability to attract private finance for WSS projects.</jats:p>"

Associates are critical to warehouse operations, and warehouses are seeking ways to maximise labour efficiencies while also reducing costly churn. To be successful, warehouses must solve one of the most basic challenges: how to staff hard-to-fill and hard-to-do jobs. Warehouses are known for being dirty, dull and dangerous. Turnover is high and the impact of labour challenges is enormous. Robots work hard so people can work smart. Warehouses that implement advanced technology realise enormous benefits, including up to 4x more throughput. The robots-as-a-service (RaaS) business model allows warehouses to implement advanced AI technology without an enormous upfront spend. The best use of advanced tech is to support the human workforce and unlock the best solution to attaining and retaining warehouse labour. Jobs become reimagined by ‘up-levelling’ warehouse work and labour productivity increases. Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) captures data that helps to forecast inbound parcel volume, understand the profile of the parcels, predict throughput required to meet business goals and more. Robotic solutions offer consistent and reliable performance in the warehouse, delivering dependable, round-the-clock productivity, so that humans do not have to be burdened with monotonous, repetitive robot work.</jats:p>"

The educational organizations that implement programs of additional profession- al education, as well as training centers of health authorities, professional asso- ciations of medical and pharmaceutical workers can carry out assessment of the level of possession of professional competencies of medical and pharmaceutical workers. Unfortunately, this variety of ways does not always allow obtaining a complete picture of the possession of professional competencies by medical and pharmaceutical workers.

This paper was conducted to develop an optimal water allocation strategy with an economic framework. Game theory has been used to determine the planning structure. A co-operative technique based on the core solution, Shepley value, and nucleolus solution has been incorporated into the decision-making system and the results of the proposed model have been calculated based on the long-term information of the downstream cropping pattern in the Zhanghe irrigation network, Hubei Province, China. Five components of rice planting including growth period, yield production, water consumption, selling price, and cultivated area have been evaluated to find the optimal scenarios. Results showed that the application of co-operative game theory can improve the economic index and water-saving potential in agriculture. Furthermore, the proposed simulation confirmed that the economic effects were important for understanding and planning for irrigation efficiency and water-saving potential.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability in the transportation and supply chain industry has been a concern for decades. Conversations have been ongoing about how to reduce the carbon footprint, incorporate electric vehicles into fleets, and adopt alternative fuels. Now, however, we’re at a crossroad. The global climate crisis has reached a tipping point, highlighting transportation’s contribution to the problem in the boardrooms of most corporations. And for good reason. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, transportation is responsible for nearly a third (29%) of all greenhouse gas emissions. While passenger vehicles make up a significant portion of that number, ships, trains, planes and freight trucks are also in the mix.The purpose of this research is to study factors influencing Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) in China. These factors include seven first-order variables: independent variables: Carbon Footprint (CF), Organizational Practices (OP), Transportation Model (TM), Environmentally Responsible Packages (EP), Alternative Energy (AE), Partnership Initiative (PI), and Technology Development (TD); two second-order variables: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Operating Model (OPER) and one dependent variable: Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). 400 sample were collected using electronic questionnaire through social media. We used Structural Equation Models (SEM) for data analysis. The result shows that since the RMSEA, which is an absolute fit index that assesses how far our hypothesized model is from a perfect model, for this model is .039 (&lt;.05) which strongly indicates a “close fit” and the Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) value is .903 (&gt;.90), the model seems to fit well according to the descriptive measures of fit. Moreover, CFI, which is incremental fit indices that compare the fit of our hypothesized model with that of a baseline model (i.e., a model with the worst fit), its value equals .956 indicating an acceptable fit.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The mathematical modeling of reverse logistics inventory systems ignores the fact that returned items may arrive out of sequence, i.e., with different number of remanufacturing times. Moreover, such modeling assumes that the retuned items may retain the same quality upon recovery regardless of how many times they have been previously remanufactured. This paper develops a new mathematical expression of the percentage of retuned items that can be remanufactured a finite number of times. The proposed expression is modeled as a function of the expected number of times an item can be remanufactured in its lifecycle and the number of times an item can be technologically (or optimally) remanufactured based on its quality upon recovery. The model developed in this paper considers joint production and remanufacturing options. The return rate is a varying demand-dependent rate, which is a decision variable with demand, product deterioration, manufacturing, and remanufacturing rates being arbitrary functions of time. The model considers the initial inventory of returned items in the mathematical formulation, which enables decision-makers to adjust all functions and input parameters for subsequent cycles. Illustrative examples indicate that dependent purchasing price of recovery items and the incorporation of remanufacturing investment cost significantly impact the optimal remanufacturing policy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Raw rubber production is the sole foundation for the rubber product industry, rendering raw rubber to manufacture essential commodities to mankind such as tires, condoms, surgical gloves, and so forth. Raw rubber production involves various stakeholders; however, literature focusing on the social impacts of raw rubber production and its supply chain has hereto been limited. Social life cycle assessment, a popular tool to assess the social impacts of a product or process and was deployed herein to assess the social profiles of three Sri Lankan raw rubber supply chains (crepe rubber, concentrated latex, and ribbed smoked sheets). The Social Hotspots Database v4 on Sima Pro v9.3 was used for the analysis. Results indicated that Governance and Labour rights &amp;amp; decent work had been affected in its supply chain of fertilizers due to Corruption and Freedom of association &amp;amp; collective bargaining issues, mainly in Belarus, and China. Proposed improvement options to address these touchpoints were found to be effective. For instance, if the importation of K-fertilizer shifted into low risk countries, overall social risks associated with Corruption and Freedom of association &amp;amp; collective bargaining in the supply chains could be reduced by ca. 36% and 25%, respectively. As a result, social risks in the aforesaid impact categories, i.e., Governance and Labor rights &amp;amp; decent work, were reduced by ca. 35-41% and ca. 17-20%, respectively. Such improvements may help positioning the Sri Lankan rubber industry in the sustainability-conscious-world rubber market.  Further, the methodical hierarchy developed herein is suggested to adopt in any industry to measure social sustainability subjected to the relevant refinements to the supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management is critical for companies (suppliers, distributors, manufacturers, and retailers) and researchers. Supply chain sustainability is important in Developing Countries. To evaluate the performance of supply chains in companies located in Developing Countries like Albania and Kosovo, this article will examine the findings of the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) model. Utilizing the SCOR model can improve a company’s chances of survival and rivalry in the market. The selection of Performance Attributes appears to be the standard for measuring performance. By contrast, Snorm De Boer normalization equates the importance of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) calculates the weighted criteria of KPIs, and Objective Matrix (OMAX) analyzes the measurement results of the KPIs. This article identifies unexplored areas for future research that will be beneficial in the field of supply chain management, such as the creation of supply chain performance metrics, creation of a model that is tightly integrated into the supply chain, and  handling supply chain-related problems and issues.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The experiences of developing Australia’s North hold lessons for Canada. Experience from development of iron ore mining and gas production in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, and with coal and gas development in the Central Queensland coalfields region, can be applied usefully to development of resources and infrastructure in Canada’s North, as well as in other resource-rich regions of the world.\nSupply chains that provide efficient transport, handling and processing of mineral and energy products in the two Australian regions, and goods and services inputs to production, have been critical to their success in becoming world-leading resources exporters. Governments and industries in the Pilbara and Central Queensland have followed contrasting pathways to developing infrastructure and supply chains. Each initial pathway had advantages and disadvantages. Approaches by governments and project operators have changed over the 60 years of resources development, in light of experience, in response to big increases in scale of production, to the need to increase efficiency, experience of existing approaches and to accommodate new industries and entrants.\nGovernments have key roles to play in resources regions through their control of land allocation for development, and environmental and social protection. Governments also have responsibilities and unique abilities for co-ordination of development.\nWhile discussion in this paper focuses primarily on supply chains for transport of outputs and inputs, another important consideration is infrastructure for people, without which resources projects cannot be developed and operated.\n\n\n\n</jats:p>"

The present study aimed to analyze the risk of the oxygen supply system of a hospital in Qazvin using the method of studying risk and human performance.\nMaterials and Methods: In this research, firstly, study team members were selected according to the purpose of the study to benefit from their experiences in discovering the possible situations of human operation risks. According to the field visits, interviews, and existing documents, the duties of people related to the objective were analyzed by the Hierarchical Task Analysis technique. Following that, the types of errors and causes were identified, and proposed controls were presented to reduce unacceptable risks.\nResults: According to the 75 scenarios obtained from the used method, the results indicate that failure to perform job duties with 32.42% as the most important parameter, with the essential factors of human error, such as memory slip (38%) and heavy workload (31%), plays a role in the three categories of consequences of fire, explosion, and reduction of oxygen sent to the departments.\nConclusion: This method can be used to reduce the risk of fire, explosion, and oxygen pressure sent to different units by using the techniques of improving working conditions, changing the way of training, equipping the oxygen concentration detection sensor, and using the liquid oxygen tank.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the VAR model is adopted to explore the mutual dynamic influence between M2 and real estate prices through variable stability test, lag selection of VAR model, convergence, impulse response and variance decomposition, etc. The analysis shows that the money supply of M2 positively influences the housing prices in China, however, the housing price has little effect on M2.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Coastal lagoons have long been subject to continuous changes caused by mutual interactions with human activities. Monitoring such changes becomes critical, particularly when modifications in landscape and land cover classes can affect their capacity to ensure Ecosystem Services (ESs). In the Venice lagoon, some confined areas called “valli da pesca” supply provisioning ESs, namely aquaculture and hunting, but also other ESs that are important for the entire lagoon, such as regulating and cultural ones. Being heavily modified ecosystems under human control, valli da pesca underwent considerable morphological evolution depending on the maximized ES and the applied management. Using remote sensing data from different sources, we reconstructed changes in land cover and landscape elements in valli da pesca over the last century. By calculating landscape indicators related to land, saltmarshes, and water, we found that landscape features were initially similar for all the valli da pesca. Then, a process began between 1975 and 1987, in which management devoted to maximizing different ESs shaped the land cover in specific patterns. This study confirms the importance of these areas in the context of the entire lagoon and require for monitoring their land cover changes. Remote sensing data represent an important source of historical data to deepen the knowledge about human-Nature interactions, for keeping trace not only of the landscape evolution but also of the dynamics in the ESs supply in response to human interventions.</jats:p>"

One of the reasons for the lack of support for the construction of new agricultural biogas plants is the belief that biogas plants will affect the operation of consumers connected in its immediate vicinity through interference introduced into the grid. This article presents the possibilities a biogas plant built on a farm offers. The impact of an on-farm biogas plant on the voltage parameters of a farm specializing in barnless cattle rearing is analyzed in detail. As demonstrated by the authors’ research in one of the agricultural biogas plants (with an electrical capacity of 40 kW), these plants do not introduce significant disturbances to the power quality into the grid. The most significant changes in the parameters of the voltage supplying the farm under study were caused by the operation of the digester mixer installed in the fermenter. Thanks to the research, it was also possible to identify a problem with the effect of the digester mixer on the energy parameters produced in the biogas plant. This problem has so far not been noticed or corrected by biogas plant manufacturers.</jats:p>"

Two of the main benefits of blockchain technology are smart contracts and distributed decision-making processes. These features can be especially useful in implementing Industry 4.0. Moreover, this technology can increase productivity in supply chains by enhancing transparency, reducing operational costs, and improving monitoring and supervision throughout the lifecycle of products. In this paper, we introduce a blockchain-based architecture for a supply chain in cloud architecture. This approach leads to the more efficient implementation of Industry 4.0 and increases sustainability in the supply chain. In this study, we aim to investigate whether the proposed blockchain-based platform affects sustainability in the supply chain. From a sustainability perspective, we solve the large-scale problem of a cloud-based production–distribution system in centralized and distributed states. The results of the solution indicate a significant improvement in the decentralized state compared to the centralized state and this improvement enhances sustainability in the supply chain. We verify the proposed model by considering an axiomatic design algorithm. In the distributed model, the system cost is reduced by up to 45%, and the solving time is decreased by approximately 51% in pessimistic conditions and by about 87% in optimistic conditions. These improvements directly enhance economic and environmental sustainability, resulting in reduced energy consumption.</jats:p>"

The focus is on mining the patterns of orders and shipments and synchronising demand and supply based on enterprise data. The problem with this approach is with product proliferation and item complexity, demand latency increases, making the order signal out of step with the market by weeks and months. In addition, as supply chain leaders attempt to better align supply chains with markets in the face of months after months of disruption, historical patterns of orders and shipments are irrelevant. The reason is simple. In a volatile world, history is not a good signal to drive decisions. To find a solution, o9 Solutions and Supply Chain Insights partnered with a group of business leaders and academics to test the use of multiple streams of demand data and determine the value of using market, or channel, data versus driving demand off of order or shipment patterns. In this paper, we share insights and the journey. While the opportunity is tremendous and the value clear, the biggest issue for technologists and business leaders is unlearning conventional paradigms. As the use of market data makes many of the traditional planning assumptions obsolete. Here the reader will learn the lessons from the testing and gain insights to adapt their planning processes to be more outside-in.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, both consumers and companies are paying more attention to extended warranty services. Considering a dual-channel supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer, we assume the manufacturer provides an extended warranty in the online direct channel and investigates the decision making of the supply chain players. We develop three game models to study this problem, and they are the basic model without extended warranty (Model B), the decentralized decision model with the manufacturer’s extended warranty (Model M), and the centralized decision model with the manufacturer’s extended warranty (Model C). The Stackelberg game method is used to solve the established model, the influence of relevant parameters on the solution result is analyzed, and different models are compared. Compared with Model B, we find that the whole supply chain always be better, but the retailer would be worse in Model M. Compared with Model M, we find that the entire supply chain always performs better in Model C. Finally, we do some sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>"

In this paper, under the concept related to active aging, the active aging index is proposed, and the current situation is analyzed by studying active aging based on the human capital perspective, the labor supply profile of the elderly in China, and the impact of active aging on labor supply. With the advancement of population aging, the employed population of the elderly grows further, and the employment rate of the elderly population aged 60 and above in China is about 17%. The employment rate of the male elderly population is significantly higher than that of the female elderly population, with the employment rate of 60-year-old male elderly being about 32 percentage points higher than that of females of the same age. Among the employed older adults, nearly 85% or more have an educational attainment of only junior high school or below. Therefore, in the period of rapid population aging in China, it is of great practical significance to study active aging to optimize the structure of the elderly, achieve sustainable economic growth and build a harmonious society.</jats:p>",

To combat COVID-19, governments and health officials everywhere have enacted laws requiring the use of protective gear like gloves, masks, and hand sanitizers. Compared to earlier pandemics like the Spanish Flu in 1918 and Ebola in 2014, the effects on the entire world are more severe now. The automotive manufacturing industry, including its derivative business such as tire manufacturing, as one of the business activities, is also dealing with difficulties, as is seen from the drop in production and sales volume. During lockdowns, they were forced to scale back or stop their retail sales and production, which cost them money. By implementing supply chain and digital transformation for business continuity, this research intends to assess the problems and make recommendations for solutions that will allow these firms to thrive in the face of uncertainty.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: Drastic and fundamental changes are increasingly occurring in the environment in which organizations operate.  An obvious manifestation of the responses towards this turbulent environment is the introduction of performance contracting as part of the broader public sector reforms aimed at improving efficiency and effectiveness in the management of the services. Managers form a major stakeholder group in an enterprise.  However, their productivity and performance is dependent on their degree of motivation.  This can be influenced by how they perceive and interpret various initiatives that may be introduced by the organization; a critical one in this regard being introduction of performance contracting. Performance contracting is a devolved management by outcome rather than management by processes. It provides a range of management instruments used within the public sector to define responsibilities and expectations between parties to achieve mutually agreed result.  This research work sought to investigate the disconnect that may arise between management perception of performance contracting in state corporations, based on their initial expectations from such a plan. The main objectives investigated during the study were: To establish management’s level of awareness of the performance contracts adopted by the state corporations and to determine management perception of performance contracting at state corporations.&#x0D;\nMethodology: A sample of 160 respondents was used in the study. The data collected was presented using tables and analyzed using descriptive statistics i.e. frequencies, percentages, mean scores and standard deviations. &#x0D;\nFindings: The major findings were:  There is a very high level of awareness of performance contracting in the organizations and that the organization’s capacity to achieve its objectives has greatly improved.  To a moderate extent, the managers felt that there was mutual support and trust at all levels of the organization and empowerment of employees in their jobs. General conclusions drawn are that the organizations were very successful in implementing performance contracting, and that to a moderate extent, the organizations have developed a reasonable sense of direction.&#x0D;\nUnique contributions to theory, practice and policy: Recommendations made were that, all employees need to be stakeholders in the future direction of the organization, even if it be in varying degrees.  Their daily performance and activities should be measured along the specific milestones and core values identified by the contract, since what cannot be measured cannot be managed.</jats:p>"

This research strived to pervade this knowledge gap through a mixed-method empirical study on 66 international clothing brands. The findings reveal a two-step supplier selection process involving enlistment in a qualified supplier pool and subsequent allocation of work orders within the pool. Supplier competence and competitiveness are critical for enlistment and order qualification, while supplier relationship, competitiveness, and competence influence the selection of order winners. Notably, larger companies prioritize relationships in supplier selection. International RMG buying companies should focus on supplier competence factors to mitigate supply chain risks and maintain positive public relations. For the same reason, Bangladeshi policymakers should enforce compliance and help RMG suppliers to gain competencies.</jats:p>"

Recently, groundwater investigators have utilized neural computing techniques to indirectly estimate soil sample K instead of time-consuming direct methods. The present study utilizes easily measurable characteristics, i.e., grain size at 10 and 50% finer by weight, porosity, and uniformity coefficient as input variables to examine the efficacy of feed-forward neural network (FFNN), Kohonen self-organizing maps (KSOM), and multiple linear regression (MLR) models in estimating the K of soil samples. Model development and validation used 70 and 30% of datasets, respectively. The determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean bias error (MBE) were used to compare the model performance with the measured K values. The study's outcome indicates that the FFNN and KSOM models better estimate the K value, while the MLR model performs merely satisfactorily. Overall, during validation, the FFNN model correlates better with the measured values having R2, RMSE, and MBE of 0.94, 0.016, and 0.006, whereas the corresponding values for KSOM are 0.91, 0.024, and −0.004, and that for MLR are 0.87, 0.024, and 0.013, respectively. Notably, the FFNN model exhibits superior prediction performance and can be employed in aquifers for precise K estimation.</jats:p>",

The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has disrupted traditional SCM and logistics business processes, making digitalization a crucial element for differentiation and competitiveness. The objective of this article was to investigate how the adoption of appropriate digital technologies could accelerate intra‐African trade in goods and services through the AfCFTA Agreement. The author employed a content analysis of the primary source documents, specifically the Protocol on Trade in Goods, available on the AfCFTA's website. The nine Annexes of the Protocol on Trade in Goods were evaluated against a digital supply chain (DSC) model adopted in this article. The results of the analysis showed that the supply chain and logistics processes of the AfCFTA's Protocol on Trade in Goods could be effectively identified and mapped to potential digital technologies through the adopted DSC framework. The practical implications of this study suggest that the AfCFTA could adopt a DSC framework as a guide in concluding negotiations on the Protocol on Digital Trade to harness the benefits of digital technologies. As the main contribution, this article provides a DSC framework that could be utilized to accelerate intra‐African trade through optimization of supply chain and logistics processes of the AfCFTA.</jats:p>",

Significant amount of the product (20–25%) is compromised to postharvest losses, therefore, alleviation of food security problems can be achieved through reduction in postharvest losses. Role of plant growth-promoting (PGP) microbes for the enhancement of potato production has been subject of extensive research. However, their impact on postharvest quality of horticultural crops has largely been unexplored, with limited research conducted on plant–microbe interactions in postharvest crops and their impact on storage stability. Although, microbial control has emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to chemical fungicides in several studies, however, significant research and development are required in development of sustainable microbial bio formulations for effective management of the crops under storage, in keeping with the quality of the produce. Therefore, manipulation of the bacterial microbiome, specially during crop storage, might provide microbial solutions as cleaner and sustainable alternatives to chemicals for plant production along the whole food chain. This chapter would elucidate functional analysis of the dynamics and potential of microbial live formulations for reducing the crop losses due to various diseases and status of the crop</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to recurring food quality and safety issues, growing segments of consumers, especially in developed markets, and regulators in agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) require a fast and trustworthy system to retrieve necessary information on their food products. With the existing centralized traceability systems used in AFSCs, it is difficult to acquire full traceability information, and there are risks of information loss and data tampering. To address these challenges, research on the application of blockchain technology (BCT) for traceability systems in the agri-food sector is increasing, and startup companies have emerged in recent years. However, there have been only a limited number of reviews on the application of BCT in the agriculture sector, especially those that focus on the BCT-based traceability of agricultural goods. To bridge this knowledge gap, we reviewed 78 studies that integrated BCT into traceability systems in AFSCs and additional relevant papers, mapping out the main types of food traceability information. The findings indicated that the existing BCT-based traceability systems focus more on fruit and vegetables, meat, dairy, and milk. A BCT-based traceability system enables one to develop and implement a decentralized, immutable, transparent, and reliable system in which process automation facilitates the monitoring of real-time data and decision-making activities. We also mapped out the main traceability information, key information providers, and challenges and benefits of the BCT-based traceability systems in AFSCs. These helped to design, develop, and implement BCT-based traceability systems, which, in turn, will contribute to the transition to smart AFSC systems. This study comprehensively illustrated that implementing BCT-based traceability systems also has important, positive implications for improving AFSC management, e.g., reductions in food loss and food recall incidents and the achievement of the United Nations SDGs (1, 3, 5, 9, 12). This will contribute to existing knowledge and be useful for academicians, managers, and practitioners in AFSCs, as well as policymakers.</jats:p>"

Although previous studies have predominantly concentrated on the economic benefits of remanufacturing, comparatively less emphasis has been placed on its carbon emissions and the differentiated incentive-penalty policies for various recycled products. Our objective is to evaluate the impact of remanufacturing policies, such as carbon taxes and incentive-penalty schemes, on multi-period hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing closed-loop systems, considering different carbon emissions for new and remanufactured products. We investigate optimal recycling and production strategies for enterprises under two distinct quality distributions (exponential and normal) and analyze the government’s incentive and penalty amounts for recycled products at various quality levels. In order to ensure the robustness of the variable quality distribution, we employ a genetic algorithm and a particle swarm optimization algorithm for comparative verification and problem solving. The study’s findings reveal that: (1) irrespective of the quality distribution, enterprises consistently exhibit a preference for recycling products of the same quality level, and the range of quality for which the government offers incentives or imposes penalties remains fundamentally constant; (2) subsidies may be granted for recycled products with a quality level ranging from 0.2 to 0.4, whereas recycled products with a quality level exceeding 0.4 are subject to penalties.</jats:p>"

The internal glycogen storage in the muscles and adipose tissue influences how intensely sucrose associated information is stored. Insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons integrates internal energy storage into memory formation. Octopamine, in turn, suppresses the formation of long-term memory. Octopamine is not required for short-term memory, because octopamine-deficient mutants can form appetitive short-term memory for sucrose and to other nutrients depending on the internal energy status. The reduced positive reinforcing effect of sucrose at high internal glycogen levels combined with the increased stability of food-related memories due to prolonged periods of starvation could lead to increased food intake.</jats:p>"

Dan permasalahan yang terjadi pada Sabrina Bakery yaitu perubahan permintaan secara mendadak oleh konsumen sehingga berpengaruhi terhadap ketersediaan bahan baku, pada proses produksi terdapat produk cacat sehingga dapat memberikan kerugian bagi perusahaan, dan kedatangan bahan baku yang tidak sesuai spesifikasi pesanan sehingga terjadi pengembalian bahan baku kepada pemasok. Berdasarkan kondisi tersebut perusahaan memerlukan pengukuran kinerja supply chain untuk mengetahui bagaimana kinerja rantai pasok dan menentukan arah perbaikan. Pada penelitian ini digunakan beberapa metode untuk merancang dan mengukur kinerja supply chain yaitu model Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) untuk menjabarkan aktivitas berkaitan dengan rantai pasok, metode AHP untuk pembobotan hierarki KPI, dan metode OMAX untuk scoring system. Berdasarkan model SCOR terdapat 17 KPI teridentifikasi yaitu 3 KPI plan, 3 KPI source, 5 KPI make, 3 KPI deliver, dan 3 KPI return. Berdasarkan metode AHP dengan software expert choice proses make memiliki bobot tertinggi dengan bobot 0,511, dan return menjadi bobot terendah dengan bobot 0,065.

The data used in this research are primary data and secondary data. The results of the study concluded that beef cattle are the largest meat contributor from the ruminant group to national meat production so that this livestock business has the potential to be developed as a profitable business. The increase in population and public awareness of consuming highly nutritious protein has made the demand for beef tend to increase from year to year. However, the fact is that beef production in Indonesia has not been able to meet public demand or consumption. Various efforts have been made by the government to maximize and increase beef production, but in reality these efforts have not been successful, so the government imports to meet domestic needs.</jats:p>"

Unlike the active fault-tolerant control approaches used for interleaved boost converters, which require controller reconfiguration, the proposed control scheme is passive fault-tolerant and does not require reconfiguration in the event of a faulty stage. The 2IBC model is analyzed together with the most important parasitic parameters, then, the averaged state-space model is derived to implement the control scheme. The appropriate linear cascade control is determined by using the small-signal equivalent model and improving the robustness and dynamic performance, thereby a proportional integrator controller is replaced by a sliding mode controller. The prototype system uses a signal processor and a low-power solar panel. The control code is generated by a PSIM software and loaded to the via a code composer tool. The experimental results validate the control design and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control scheme. In addition, the proposed controller ensures the continuity of service in the event of a faulty stage by verifying the reliability of the power supply.</jats:p>"

In particular, in the Abruzzo region, there was a decrease of circa 60% in tourist arrivals from 2019 to 2021. A driving force for the recovery of the tourism sector may be investment in sustainability activities, especially those connected to social aspects, which appear to be less considered. Social sustainability can be investigated through the Social Life Cycle Assessment methodology, thus allowing the assessment of the social risks that are connected to the life cycle of a delivered service. This study aims at providing a social footprint of the supply chain of one overnight stay at an accommodation facility using the Social Hotspot Database. The main results show that electricity consumption has the greatest impact within the life cycle, and it is the “Health and Safety” category that is the most influenced, followed by “Labour Rights and Decent Work”, “Governance” and “Human Rights”. Finally, at a subcategory level, “Occupational Toxics and Hazards” is the most influenced one, followed by “Occupational Injuries and Deaths”, “High Conflict”, “Corruption” and “Legal System”. These findings allow us to understand the overall main social risks related to the sector in Italy, since the assessment of the foreground system was conducted at a country and a sector level.</jats:p>"

The DCPS adopts a full-bridge circuit architecture, with the TI TMS320F28335 digital\n  signal processor (DSP) as the core, combined with an 18-bit high-resolution A/D converter and\n  discrete PID algorithm to achieve closed-loop current control, ensuring a stable output current\n  value of the system. The DCC can control eight DCPS modules through an RS485 protocol with a\n  virtual instrument control interface. This new system can replace the analog signal-modulated Bira\n  MCOR30A power supply system, which has been in operation for 25 years in the TLS storage ring and\n  can be upgraded to an FDPSS. This article aims to discuss the design concepts, hardware\n  implementation, and testing of FDCPS and DCC to demonstrate the advantages of full digital control\n  and to achieve the goal of independently researching and developing the prototype of\n  FDPSS. Ultimately, after long-term testing and verification, the system's output current stability\n  is less than ± 20ppm, indicating that this new system has high-precision and high-stability output\n  current characteristics. In this study, upgrading the TLS storage ring corrector magnet power\n  supply system to full digital control significantly improves output current stability and accuracy.</jats:p>",

This work examined a trade credit supply chain involving a manufacturer and two retailers in a decentralised supply chain in which the retailers engage in product promotion while the manufacturer financed them through credit provision. It considered a supply chain structure in which the manufacturer provides trade credit to the retailers and a situation in which he does not provide trade credit. It used Stackelberg game theory to determine the optimal promotion efforts, the credit periods and the players’ payoffs, and showed that while the manufacturer is better-off with the retailers’ efforts, the retailers need to consciously determine appropriate optimal effort to avoid getting short-changed. It also showed that while credit period reduces with the manufacturer’s margin, it increases with a retailer’s margin. It further showed that while the retailers’ payoffs reduce continuously with credit period, the manufacturer’s payoff is fixed in the long-run irrespective of the credit period provided by the manufacturer to the retailers. By comparison the players as well as the channel perform better with the adoption of trade credit, however a retailer must avoid placing he price margin at equality with that of the manufacturer if he hopes to enjoy long credit period.</jats:p>"

In individuals of the same species and breed, quite high discrepancies can sometimes occur in the topography of the coronary arteries of the heart. When studying the coronary bed of the heart of animals, we recorded a case of the presence of a right-handed type of blood supply in a two-month-old Blackand- White calf in the absence of a left coronary artery. In this regard, we set ourselves the goal of studying the features of the vascularization of the right half of the heart in a two-month-old Black-and-White calf with a right-sided type of blood supply.To achieve this goal, the heart of the corpse of a two-month-old Black-and-White calf, obtained from a private farm in the Leningrad Region, was studied. The study was conducted at the Department of Animal Anatomy, St. Petersburg State University of Veterinary Medicine. To study the vascularization of the heart of the studied animal, classical and modern anatomical techniques were carried out, such as fine anatomical preparation, photography, and the manufacture of corrosion preparations using latex.According to the results of the study, it was found that in the absence of the left coronary artery in the studied two-month-old calf of the Black-and-White breed, the right coronary artery completely and completely compensates for its absence. The presence of the right interventricular artery was established, which has such branches as the artery of the right septomarginal trabecula and atrioventricular branches that supply blood to the tricuspid valve area and the right septomarginal trabeculae of the heart. It was determined that the vessels that vascularize the structures of the right atrium and right ventricle in their topography in the studied individual are inferior in the number of S-shaped bends and sharp corners in comparison with the arteries of the left half of the heart, which can reduce the risk of developing coronary pathologies in the right half of the heart. It was established that the subsinus artery differs from the generally accepted classical topography and plunges into the thickness of the myocardium of the right ventricle and interventricular septum, and practically does not pass as part of the subsinus sulcus.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Background.\n Intraoperative patellofemoral maltracking/instability is often corrected by lateral retinaculum release. Due to the fact, that the medial parapatellar approach dissects medial genicular arteries, forced lateral release can also cause excision of lateral vessels, which leads to total devascularization of the patella and obviously devastating patellar complications. In this study, we evaluated the possibility of precise intraoperative localization of the lateral genicular arteries (aa. superior et inferior genicularis lateralis) by an orthopaedic surgeon using the transillumination method.\nMethods.\n 12 patients underwent cemented TKA with patella-friendly Zimmer Biomet NexGen Legacy Posterior Stabilized prostheses (without patellar resurfacing), 7 right knees and 5 left knees. The mean age of patients in the study group was 66.636 ± 7.003 years. The minimal follow-up period was 13 months (mean – 16,363 ± 2,5 months). Functional outcomes were assessed using Knee Society and a specific patellar questionnaire - Kujala Score. Intraoperative detection of insufficient patellar stability and/or patellar maltracking was based on the no-thumb technique. In pre- and postoperative period X-ray investigation, standard standing X-ray and Merchant view were used to evaluate implant position and patellofemoral congruency.\nResults.\n In this study, ten out of twelve knee joints (83.3%) had at least one artery visible by the proposed method in the lateral parapatellar area. Five out of ten knee joints had more than one artery that could be visualized and identified as an arterial vessel. In postoperative Doppler ultrasound sonography, we found at least 1 artery, namely the superior lateral genicular artery in all 12 patients, 8 out of 12 patients had also an inferior genicular artery. Postoperative Knee Society score showed significant improvement from a mean 51.181 ± 3,868 to a mean 88,727 ± 3,663. Mean hospital length of stay is 8.545 ± 1.863 days. X-ray assessment using standard anteroposterior, lateral and Merchant skyline views showed appropriate implant positioning and patellofemoral congruency. The mean Kujala score in the postoperative period (3 and 6 months) was 67.3 ± 6.75 and 75.6 ± 6.42 perspectively.\nConclusions.\n Using the proposed transillumination method can help preserve the lateral blood supply to the patella and to avoid devascularized patella-related complications\nTrial registration:\n This study was retrospectively approved by the Republican Ethical Committee.

This transformation provides numerous opportunities to improve strategic, tactical, and operational capabilities to meet sustainability goals. However, the high level of uncertainty associated with digital transformation programs has created doubts among many manufacturing companies about the successful adoption of digital transformation in their supply chain processes. While previous studies have examined digital transformation technologies and their implementations in supply chains, little attention has been given to the drivers and barriers associated with adopting digital technologies for sustainable supply chains, especially in the context of manufacturing. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of digital transformation adoption in manufacturing supply chains and identifying the critical drivers and barriers to successful digital transformation implementation. A total of six barriers and eleven drivers have been selected from the literature. Finally, this study provides insights for decision-makers to overcome the main barriers that hinder the successful implementation of digital technologies in supply chain functions, which can lead to a higher ethical supply chain level from a sustainability and operational efficiency perspective.</jats:p>"

WHO has recommended the standards for the quality of drinking water. In this research,154 water samples were collected from 50 sites across Gilgit Baltistan Pakistan, and their pH value, Total dissolved Solids (TDS), Salinity, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Total Hardness and Turbidity were determined. These values were compared with WHO Standards for drinking water. It has been observed that in some cases, the TDS, EC and Turbidity were found on higher side, making it unfit for drinking. In such cases, the open stream water (Nullah) has been mixed with the spring water to augment the water needs of increased population. This has deteriorated the quality of water as a result. It is recommended that proper water treatment initiatives may be undertaken in such areas and the existing capacity of water supply systems may be enhanced to meet the needs of people due to population increase.</p>"

Meanwhile, new approaches have emerged in the financial industry, such as the supply chain mode. This paper modeled the coupling relationship of financial markets based on deep learning model and proposed the supply chain financing strategy of financial markets in different countries. The experimental results show that when the minimum value of supply chain finance is 0.5577, the loss risk has not reached the boundary of the effectiveness of the risk control standard. Therefore, this paper aims to systematically analyze the financing mode of international trade supply chain, comprehensively perfect the international trade governance mode, and thus realize the freedom of trade, and at the same time, provide new ideas for enterprises' financing difficulties, and probe into the ways of supply chain financing mode in improving enterprises' financing difficulties, so as to help solve the financing difficulties of a large number of enterprises and optimize the financing strategy of international trade.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the concept of regional power grid flexibility was clarified, and the ramping factor is proposed as a flexibility metric. On this basis, taking the output priority of each node as the objective function and considering constraints such as line flow, power balance, and system flexibility, a mathematical model for regional power grid transmitting flexible power externally is proposed. Compare with the traditional models, this model focuses more on flexibility rather than economy. The case analysis based on the improved IEEE 30-Bus System verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its advantages over the traditional models.</jats:p>"

Those principles are maintained as the organization's way of doing business offers an effective adaptation to environmental problems and maintains success. The study sought to ascertain the importance of organizational culture in road freight transport sector in Zimbabwe. The road freight sector has been characterized by unprofessional behaviour and incompetent management. Organizational culture is key to defining the uniqueness of an organization, brand, philosophy, and how it relates to business ethics and all other stakeholders. Globally organizational culture has been given great eminence and priority as strategy followed culture in business performance. This was a quantitative study of road freight transport sector across Zimbabwe with a population of 1256 registered companies and a randomly picked sample size of 384 registered road freight companies out of 1256 companies from which data were collected. A total of 384 questionnaires were distributed and 291 were retrieved giving a response rate of 75.6%. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data. Reliability was checked using Cronbach’s alpha (?). Before conducting structural equation modelling, data were validated using exploratory factor analysis, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. SPSS® version 21 and AMOS® version 21 were used to analyse the data. The findings showed that organizational culture can help to mediate the relationship between transportation costs and firm competitiveness. The findings suggest that organizational culture has a significant impact on the relationship between transportation costs and firm competitiveness. The study also found out that all the registered companies that took part in the research confirmed that the value of time phenomenon was alien to their business organisational culture practices as they worked on assumptions. They also indicated loss of business due to customer complaints. The study recommends policy formulation for companies that emphasizes standard operating procedures and good time management as organisational culture for firms to be competitive.</jats:p>"

In addition to sustainability concepts, environmental costs such as the emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and its impact on the environment are also discussed. In this research, according to the five defined indicators and based on the potential of using solar energy and the possibility of exploiting renewable energy sources such as solar energy, various management scenarios have been developed. After examining the virtual water management model developed in the Hunan basin as a case study, the development of the water–food–energy nexus model and its calibration, and four scenarios including improving water use efficiency, energy saving, increasing food productivity, and nexus sustainability were developed. The results showed that the nexus strategy can provide sustainability goals according to the weight of each component. After the combined scenario, improving the efficiency of water consumption can be the component with the highest priority in the decision-making model in dry areas.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a supply chain model is constructed as a starting point, and deep reinforcement learning algorithms are introduced on this basis. Firstly, the decision problem of uncertainty is handled by the reinforcement learning method of functions, and the DQN algorithm (deep neural network algorithm) is divided into two parts for iterative rules. Then the target network is established to make the iterative process more stable, to improve the convergence of the algorithm, evaluate the loss function in the training process of the network, and to determine its influence factor. Then the neural network is used to improve the iteration rule, improve the output layer, select the final action, and define the model expectation reward. Finally, the Bellman equation is fitted to the function by a deep neural network to calculate the final result. The experimental results show that by analyzing and constructing the cost of international logistics under supply chain management, the capacity utilization rate of ocean freight link is 57% The unloading link is 74% and the total capacity utilization rate is calculated as 76%. It shows that using deep reinforcement learning algorithms under international logistics supply chain management is feasible and necessary for improving the management strategy research of supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The institutional theory elucidates that businesses seek to provide a reasonable and relevant explanation for their behaviour because they are motivated by the need for social justification within institutional settings that shape their strategic directions and decisions. This study examined the supply chain performance implications of institutional pressures and supply chain technology among Ghanaian firms. The study employed the quantitative method and survey design. Data was sourced from 394 managers of small to large-scale firms operating in the Greater Accra Metropolis of Ghana. Data were analysed using Structural Equation Models (SEM). The study found that institutional pressures positively relate to supply chain performance. It was also discovered that supply chain technology utilisation (SCTU) mediates the relationship between Institutional pressures (INP) and supply chain performance (SCP). The finding shows the relative importance of INP and SCTU on the performance of supply chains of firms in Ghana. The study recommended that firms in Ghana and Africa must pay critical attention to supply chain technology to enhance their supply chain operations. The study provides practical implications for firms by highlighting the importance of institutional pressures and supply chain technology utilization in supply chain performance. This will provide firms with the insight to identify the most important institutional pressures that affect their supply chain technology utilization and performance. The study also encourages the use of technology in supply chain management. This can lead to more efficient and effective supply chains, which can help society by lowering prices and making more products available. The study is unique in its focus as it attempts to shift the discourse beyond how institutional pressures influence firms’ environmental and sustainability performance to how they impact supply chain performance.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

An optimization framework was developed to find the maximum values of economic water footprint based on environmental, ecological, energy, and technical constraints. The results of the study showed that the simulated relationship can be used together to estimate long-term relationships between variables, there is a positive and significant relationship between ecological footprint and biological capacity and a negative and significant relationship between trade globalization and economic water footprint. The middle form of the ecological footprint N also increases energy consumption leading to an increase in the economic water footprint. Moreover, the results showed that there is a relationship with economic growth, and this indicates that the increase in economic growth in this region will lead to further destruction of the environment.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we create a game-theoretic SC network model that incorporates together non-cooperative SC competition, employee productivity and engagement, and green investing. Each competing firm within the network seeks to maximise its profit by determining an optimal flow of products and allocation of green investments across the SC according to a predetermined budget. A carbon tax on emissions and consumer sustainability preferences are also included in the model. The model is solved using a Variational Inequality reformulation. The illustrative numerical examples presented in this paper have been inspired by the Maltese dairy industry and demonstrate the applicability of the model to real-world problems. The results highlight the significance of the employee engagement factor in enabling firms to adopt and realise more sustainable SC practices.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Combining the characteristics of a large amount of risk assessment data, a numerical analysis algorithm is introduced in the process of platform design, and the extrapolation method in the numerical analysis algorithm is used to calculate the risk assessment- related data. To make the calculation faster and the data more accurate, the central difference quotient extrapolation is used to accelerate and a downtime mechanism is introduced. Firstly, the approximation formula for the calculation is constructed, followed by the construction of a sequence of variable steps to obtain a sequence of approximations. Finally, the obtained approximate sequence values are used to construct an interpolating polynomial, and the constant term of the polynomial, which is the final risk factor, is obtained through continuous iteration. To verify the effectiveness of the numerical analysis-based algorithm in supply chain financial risk assessment, the simulation results show that the risk assessment accuracy of the numerical analysis-based supply chain financial risk assessment platform is as high as 99% and the time required is 17 seconds higher than other assessment models, which verifies that the numerical analysis algorithm can improve the accuracy and rapidity of risk assessment.</jats:p>"

The need for efficient water and energy management is growing as the world struggles to keep up with rising water and energy demands. This research examines artificial intelligence (AI)'s impact on the water flow and energy balance confluence subnetwork of sensing elements from all the original network's nodes. The study proposed an AI-based optimized sensor energy balance model (AI-SEBM) that uses pressure data to maintain energy balance in turbines and save water with the optimized energy source for agriculture usage. This research explores the potential for installing Kalpan hydraulic turbines, which are most effective during half-load operation, and to forecast all loads with little computing effort to balance energy in turbulence. To anticipate daily pressure readings and energy consumption across all nodes in the network, an AI-based optimization wireless sensor network is designed for communication and linked to an energy balance system. Sensors are strategically deployed at the network's nerve centres. The maximum flow algorithm is used for a grid representing the water and energy balance to determine the positions of the virtual nodes.</jats:p>",

A survey among 36 individual agribusiness companies was undertaken taking the role of each company in the coordination process of its supply chain into consideration. Senior managers were asked to declare the role of each company in the coordination process of its supply chain as well as to indicate which performance indicators they used through a questionnaire which presented a list composed by 49 performance indicators divided into the four traditional perspectives. Fisher's exact test and a logit model were used to analyze the relations between the usage of performance indicators and the role played in supply chain coordination process. The statistically significant results from Fisher's exact test were relating to inventory, operational costs, operational cycle, information and integration of materials, and risk management. The results from the logit model point out that inventory, and operational costs presented significant predictability levels regarding to the identification of individual supply chain participants, while operational cycle, information and integration of materials, and risk management presented significant predictability levels relating to individual supply chain coordinators. The research carried out in this paper is based on responses provided by senior managers regarding managerial practices and the sample size is limited. However, the results presents a new perspective about the relevance of the role of individual companies within the coordination process of supply chain regarding to performance indicators from which further research may be conducted. The implications relating to management control arising from the findings suggests that metrics selection criteria within in the context of supply chain can be based on both individual motivations and objectives.</jats:p>"

By tilting the burners of an annular combustor in circumferential direction relative to the rotational axis of the engine, the potential of increased combustion stability is opened up due to an enhanced exhaust gas recirculation between adjacent flames. The innovative gas turbine combustor concept, called the Short Helical Combustor (SHC), allows the main reaction zone to be operated at low equivalence ratios. To exploit the higher stability of the fuel-lean combustion, a low-swirl lifted flame is implemented in the staggered SHC burner arrangement.

Since the stabilization mechanism of the low-swirl flame relies on outer recirculation zones, the upstream transport of hot combustion products back to the flame base is studied by the variation of the combustor confinement ratio. It turns out that increasing the combustor size amplifies the exhaust gas recirculation along the sidewall, and increases the temperature of recirculating burned gases. The present study emphasizes the capability of the proposed lean-burn combustor concept for future aero engine applications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ensuring uninterrupted and reliable operation of water treatment systems is a priority task of the industrial complex of Ukraine. For effective reliability management in water treatment systems, it is necessary to analyze potential failures and determine the probability of their occurrence. For the purpose of research to determine the probability of the occurrence of risks as a result of failures of various units of the water purification system, using the example of the operation of a column-type electrocoagulator, it is proposed to use the structural and functional block diagram of water purification systems to obtain generalized patterns, which makes it possible to reduce the entire system to several interdependent units, namely: 1) fine-cleaning filtration unit; 2) a unit for cleaning from soluble impurities; 3) a unit for cleaning coarse impurities; 4) pipe-pump unit. When the water treatment system is operating, taking into account the ranking of the reliability of the units, it can be stated that the 1st unit may fail at the beginning, followed by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th units. It is established that if all the units of the system are working, the system is in the S0 state. When other blocks fail, in the same sequence, the system will be in states S1, S2, S3 and S4. The most interesting are the states of the system, in which block failures do not cause shutdown of the entire system, but only its off-duty operation, which is manifested only as a result of the deterioration of the quality of treated water. Analyzing the obtained results, it can be asserted that during the operation of the water treatment system, the highest probability of failure is in unit 1. After the unit is restored and during further operation of the system, the highest probability of failure is unit 2, then unit 4 and unit 3. The failure probabilities of the units are the probabilities of risks, moreover, the physical value generated by these risks (the amount of polluted water that entered the ecosystem or the boiler unit) will be greater, the longer the unit failure detection period. When the water treatment system operates for a long enough time, a probabilistic constant mode of transition from state to state is established in it according to the scheme «working state of all blocks - failure of one or several blocks - repair - working state of all blocks». The probability of the sequence and duration of these events can be determined, which makes it possible, on the one hand, to assess the risks arising during operation and to determine a management strategy to minimize these risks.</jats:p>"

This research thesis aims to employ bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive examination of global contributions and contemporary keyword trends in the field of SCM technology within the EU. Using the Web of Science database, a systematic search was conducted, resulting in a total of 3,173 relevant articles. Bibliometric Analysis and VOSviewer (VOS) were employed to analyze the research landscape. The analysis shows that although this topic is based on the European Union, the scientific productivity and influence on the topic from China, Britain and the United States are higher than that of many EU countries. The European Journal of Operational Research emerged as the most influential journal in terms of both productivity and impact. Affiliations primarily consisted of universities, with a significant contribution from five universities showing consistent growth in research productivity. The results of Network visualization and Thematic Map analysis results of keywords show that technology-based red keyword clustering is very important for the research in this field, including demand response, microgrids, algorithms, price, policies, simulation and so on. This analysis highlights the importance of technology-related topics in the supply chain of EU retailers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Carbon emissions were one of the most critical contributors to climate change, and the recent climate agreement had agreed for all participating countries to reduce their emissions. Malaysia has pledged to reduce 45 per cent of its carbon emissions by 2025. However, reducing carbon emissions from the industry was still limited due to voluntary reporting, particularly among manufacturers. Thus, it is ambitious for the Malaysian government to achieve its target by 2025. A complete review is performed to go through the literature and determine the review's research path. This review aims to investigate the low carbon performance based on the manufacturing industry's low carbon supply chain practices. The findings show that low carbon production was insignificant in reducing overall carbon emissions. In contrast, the rest of the low carbon supply chain practices were by the Natural Resource-Based-View (NRBV) theory. It helps to identify companies' low carbon supply chain practices to reduce carbon emissions and meet environmental regulations. Additionally, the review also provided new insight into mediating effect that contributes to the organizational theory of NRBV. The theoretical hypotheses were tested with bias-corrected and accelerated (BCA) bootstrap confidence intervals. The instrument used in this review is a questionnaire, and the questionnaire consists of five (5) scales which tapped on (LCSCM), energy management, and low carbon performance. Responses from the respondent were collected via an online survey between Malaysian manufacturing industries. SmartPLS was used to perform the model and structural analyses. The result shows that LCSCM influence carbon performance directly and indirectly, so the hypotheses are supported. This review is one of the earliest attempts to record empirical evidence regarding companies’ low carbon supply chain practices and performance. Thus, the review shows results can be used and extended to develop low-carbon supply chain frameworks.</jats:p>"

It includes a wide range of actions, from influencing information to the military means by which the hybrid actor achieves its goals. These goals can include weakening or even destroying the target. Security of supply means preparedness and continuity management actions, which aim to safeguard economic activities and related systems that are necessary for the population’s livelihood, the country’s economic life, and national defense in the event of exceptional conditions and comparable serious disruptions. Both hybrid threat and information influencing can disrupt the realization of the goals of security of supply. This work-in-progress paper proposes a framework, which consists of hybrid threat and its sub-classification, and information influencing as one of the means to implement hybrid threat. The framework also describes the security of supply and elements that are used to combat information influence and maintain the security of supply. In addition, the framework paper discusses what kind of elements measuring the maturity level of an organization’s prevention of information influence could consist of.</jats:p>"

Tumor cells have the capacity to reprogram pathways that control nutrient acquisition, anabolism and catabolism to enhance their growth and survival. Tumorigenesis requires the autonomous reprogramming of key metabolic pathways that obtain, generate and produce metabolites from a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment to meet the increased bioenergetic demands of cancer cells. Intra- and extracellular factors also have a profound effect on gene expression to drive metabolic pathway reprogramming in not only cancer cells but also surrounding cell types that contribute to anti-tumor immunity. Despite a vast amount of genetic and histologic heterogeneity within and between cancer types, a finite set of pathways are commonly deregulated to support anabolism, catabolism and redox balance. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy in adults and remains incurable in the vast majority of patients. Genetic events and the hypoxic bone marrow milieu deregulate glycolysis, glutaminolysis and fatty acid synthesis in MM cells to promote their proliferation, survival, metastasis, drug resistance and evasion of immunosurveillance. Here, we discuss mechanisms that disrupt metabolic pathways in MM cells to support the development of therapeutic resistance and thwart the effects of anti-myeloma immunity. A better understanding of the events that reprogram metabolism in myeloma and immune cells may reveal unforeseen vulnerabilities and advance the rational design of drug cocktails that improve patient survival.</jats:p>"

In summary AI algorithms are transforming the manufacturing sector and its global supply chain by enabling predictive maintenance, improving quality control, optimizing the supply chain and manufacturing processes, enabling mass customization, facilitating autonomous operations and promoting sustainability. To answer the question what the AI strategies for the manufacturing sector and its global supply chain are, it was conducted a review of the recent scientific literatures to detect the salient aspects. With these identified directions it was cross-checked the news press articles of seven large global consulting companies to pinpoint the highlights and lowlights. For better understanding of the AI expectations, a cross table survey had been considered with strengthen, opportunities and limitations.

Neuroimaging studies in AIS patients suggest that penumbral tissue is characterized not only by hypoperfusion, but also by microvascular flow disturbances that strongly affect tissue outcome. Here, we demonstrate that microvascular flows become increasingly chaotic in the ischemic penumbra in the hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion in a rat model of AIS. Biophysical models suggest that these disturbances are accompanied by increasing hypoxia in the absence of blood flow changes. Unlike findings in severe ischemia, pericyte constrictions do not appear to occlude penumbral capillaries. We propose that microvascular flow disturbances represent a critical feature of penumbral tissue, and a potential target for neuroprotective therapy after AIS.</jats:p>"

The life support system, used today on the spacecraft, includes: system for regenerating water from atmospheric humidity condensate in a spacecraft cabin, a water regeneration system from urine, system of generating oxygen and hydrogen during the electrolysis of water in microgravity conditions, a system for utilizing carbon dioxide, removing harmful micro impurities, operating at the expense of internal resources spacecraft during space flight. Thus, the task arises of developing new types of power supply and life support systems, including the development of new and improvement of existing technologies for continuous charging of spacecraft fuel cells with hydrogen and oxygen, generating onboard electricity without the use of “Earth tanks” with supercritical liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, improvement of existing oxygen and hydrogen generation systems, regeneration of water from condensate of atmospheric moisture and waste products of astronauts, removal of harmful micro impurities and cultivation of rapidly multiplying microalgae on the spacecraft during a long space flight. The article presents a new type of power supply and life support systems for spacecraft, powered by a solar panel, which includes the developed new technologies: an oxygen and hydrogen gas generator, which makes it possible to economically and easily separately produce oxygen, hydrogen and drinking water to enrich the atmosphere with oxygen and replenish the drinking supplies of the spacecraft cabin, continuously charge the fuel cells of the spacecraft with hydrogen and oxygen, produced for the uninterrupted generation of onboard electricity; a separator for purification of technical wastewaters from harmful solid inclusions and pathogenic microbes and obtaining drinking water from them, regeneration of drinking water from urine, excreted by astronauts, in quantities sufficient for consumption of this water by astronauts during a long space flight; a concentrator that receives a solution with microalgae cells from a space photo bioreactor, growing microalgae under weightless conditions, which utilizes carbon dioxide released during the breathing of astronauts, produces oxygen to enrich the atmosphere of the spacecraft cabin with oxygen through photosynthesis. A concentrator permits to obtain a high-quality concentrate of cells of rapidly multiplying microalgae and supplement the crew's diet by the biggest part of this concentrate, and to replenish the space photo bioreactor with the remainder of the concentrate and nutrient solution in order to obtain enough biomass for a long space flight.</jats:p>"

First of all, the starting power coefficient and cutting off power coefficient are set to reflect the efficiency of the inverter and obtain the active output power of the photovoltaic system. Then, the Gaussian iterative algorithm is used to calculate the power flow of the distribution network, which forms a model along with the branch switch to complete the variables optimization under the conditions that all power conversion elements are removed from the system and the security constraint is satisfied. Afterwards, through the apparent power of the distribution network node, the single feeder is transformed into two feeders to ensure the fixed voltage at the front end of the line and make the node voltage rise and exceed the limit. Meanwhile, the active power and reactive power are provided for distribution network to reduce the feeders voltage loss, the reasonable regulation measures are used to stabilize the voltage, and the constant power factor and voltage amplitude of the network connection point are added to address voltage over limit and lighten the influence of increasing distributed power on voltage rising. Finally, the size of voltage amplitude is referred to determine the reactive power, so as to realize reasonable absorption of distribution network. The analysis results show that the voltage regulation measures proposed significantly improve the overall absorption capacity of the power supply, with the capacity increased by 0.54MW and 0.2MW respectively.</jats:p>",

This study considers the relationship between logistics corporate social responsibility and supply chain performance. Structural equation models were built to explore the relationship between logistics corporate social responsibility, supply chain collaboration, and supply chain performance, and the bootstrap method was used to build path models to explore whether there is a mediation effect between logistics corporate social responsibility and supply chain performance. The results show that logistics corporate social responsibility has a significant positive impact on supply chain coordination, and logistics corporate social responsibility and supply chain coordination also have a significant positive impact on supply chain performance. Supply chain coordination plays an intermediary role between logistics corporate social responsibility and supply chain performance. Based on these results, it is suggested that logistics enterprises improve their awareness of fulfilling corporate social responsibility, improve transparency, strengthen supply chain collaboration, and accept the role of supervision and management at the government level.</jats:p>"

To date, there is an open debate as to whether e-commerce or brick-and-mortar shopping is environmentally less sustainable, especially due to the growing mobility resources needed for e-commerce distribution. The analysis at hand compares the CO2-equivalent emissions of e-commerce and brick-and-mortar shopping of pharmaceutical products considering spatial aspects and the typical transport modal mix of consumers when doing online and offline shopping. The object of analysis is a retailer of pharmaceutical products, more precisely medicines, which offers, both, brick-and-mortar shop and online shopping possibilities. The results show that spatial aspects concerning the residential location of consumers, the vehicles used for shopping trips, the shopping basked size, and trip-chaining effects have a crucial impact on the mobility demand and CO2-equivalent emissions of the two commerce forms. In general, for rural and sub-urban areas, e-commerce results in lower CO2-equivalent emissions, while in urban areas, brick-and-mortar shopping is the favourable solution, if the consumers walk or cycle to the next pharmacy.</jats:p>"

In this study, a two-stage approach is undertaken to optimize a biogas supply chain design by incorporating of 30 districts in Izmir. In the first stage, the selection of the most suitable biogas plants is considered by the goal programming approach, which is of great importance to decide the optimal location with high energy potential. The most suitable sites for the biogas plants are obtained as Konak and Narlıdere districts. In the second stage, the location problem of the biogas vehicle charging stations (BVS) for biogas vehicles is handled considering the results of the first stage using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach. Computational results demonstrate that it would be more appropriate to establish BVS in 12 districts of İzmir. The model and solution approach are pioneering for supply chain problems and an efficient tool for renewable energy plans.</jats:p>"

Herein, the role of stakeholders and the complex interrelationships between stakeholders are important factors influencing the supply chain, and, besides, failure to manage SCRs can result in significant losses for the organization. In West Papua, study related to stakeholder perspectives on the risks in palm oil SCs is still limited. Accordingly, to fill this gap, this paper aims to identify SCRs from the perspectives of key stakeholder of the Indonesian palm oil industry in West Papua. This study employs qualitative research methods. Key risks in the palm oil supply chain (SC) were identified from semi-structured interviews with 64 key stakeholders across 25 different stakeholder groups, using NVIVO software for thematic analysis. The results show that the palm oil SC in West Papua has five tiers and five distribution channels of material, information, and financial flows. Public and private stakeholders identified in palm oil SCs play crucial roles in determining palm oil operations in West Papua. Herein, there are seven identified groups as key stakeholders with thirty-two major risks in the SC. Smallholder farmers are exposed to most of the risks, followed by plantation companies, local cooperatives, and government agencies. Interestingly, risks in palm oil SCs in West Papua are predominantly caused by conflicts of interest among multiple stakeholders.</jats:p>"

In Brazil, there remains a significant deficit in water and sanitation services coverage, particularly in rural areas. To achieve universal access to water, the legal framework addresses the development of decentralization actions and co-participation in management. As a result, a community-managed water supply (CMWS) has emerged as the social tool in which the community effectively participates in decision-making and oversees the operation and maintenance of water systems. The long-term sustainability of these systems is affected by critical factors in implementation, management, and maintenance. However, no strategic plan exists to solve/mitigate the critical factors commonly associated with CMWS. We proposed an action plan with multiscale intersectoral management strategies to guarantee water security for rural populations. The strategies were separated into areas of responsibility discussed in the recent literature and evaluated by experts. The strategies at the national level were related to institutional aspects and policy formulation. At the local level, the strategies were related to supporting CMWS from project implementation to post-construction. Finally, at the community level, the strategies were related to the quality and financial recognition of the services.</jats:p>"

However, changes in household behavior may affect the actions of other decision makers, such as businesses and governments, leading to unanticipated outcomes. Therefore, any analysis of BI must use a model with multilayered feedback from the actions of individual decision makers. To actualize such a model, household budgets, firms, and other entities must autonomously determine production levels, prices, and other factors, thereby encompassing a complete circulation of funds. This study constructs a macroeconomic model using agent-based modeling as a basic framework to achieve these goals, and it analyzes the emergent behaviors generated by BI and the labor supply in the economic system. The results show that although BI brings about more equitable consumption by households, it also creates a unique phenomenon wherein Gross Domestic Product increases but economic activity in terms of capital investment stagnates. Upon examining the impact of BI, the results of this study present the need to examine the multilayered feedback influencing mutual decision makers, which arises from the behavioral changes of individual decision makers caused by BI.</jats:p>"

Such energetic strategies should consider the environmental sustainability of the different available options, fitting the targets of the EU environmental policy. With the aim of supplying a quantitative tool to support the European green transition, this paper reports the entire life cycle assessment (LCA) of three different options for the production and supply of natural gas/methane in Italy: the production of biomethane from biogas (considering a real-scale plant in Italy), the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplied by Qatar by vessel, and the use of compressed gas delivered from Algeria via pipeline. The application of the LCA standardized method allowed for the quantification of the environmental benefit provided by the first option, against all the considered impact categories, thanks to a combination of several advantages: (a) its low-impact anaerobic production, (b) its exploitation of a waste product from the food/agriculture industries, and (c) its production of valuable by-products, which can be considered environmental credits. The results proved the possible environmental gain resulting from an integrated energy supply system that would be able to enhance the economic fabric of specific areas.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, a supply chain model is proposed with preservation technology under learning fuzzy theory for deteriorating items where the demand rate depends on the selling price and also treats as a triangular fuzzy number. The deterioration rate of any item cannot be eliminated due to its natural process, but it can be controlled with the help of preservation technology. Some harmful gases are emitted during the preservation process due to deteriorating items that harm the environment. In general, it can be easily seen that most of the sellers offer a trade credit policy to their regular buyers. In this paper, the retailer’s inventory stock reduces due to demand and deterioration. It is also assumed that some units are defective due to machine defects or delivery inefficiency. The retailer accepted the policy of trade credit offered by the seller. The aim of this paper is to enhance the profit of the supply chain partners. We proposed a theorem to get the optimal values of the selling price and cycle length. The retailer’s total profit is a function of selling price and cycle length, and the retailer’s total profit is optimized with respect to selling price and cycle length under trade-credit. Numerical examples are also presented for the validation of the present study, and sensitivity analysis is also discussed to know the robustness of the supply chain model. Managerial insight and observation have been given in the sensitivity section. Limitations and future work of this paper have been presented in the conclusion section.</jats:p>"

To conduct our analysis, first we use microdata from two Brazilian household surveys to document that civil servants save and work significantly less than their counterparts in the private sector. Second, we use matched employer–employee microdata from Brazil (RAIS) to document differences between the two sectors in terms of wage and unemployment risk. Then, we calibrate the model to be consistent with micro and macro evidence for Brazil. Our counterfactual exercises show that differences in wages characteristics and labor law legislation account for nearly 70% of the gap in savings between civil servants and private sector workers, and 57% of the gap in labor supply. In addition, we find that eliminating those differences can produce sizable increase on aggregate savings, employment, and welfare.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, the importance of addressing halal status concerns and ensuring the appropriate handling of halal pharmaceutical products is gradually rising. Consequently, the complexities of logistics, supply chain management, and transparency in the context of halal pharmaceuticals have become pertinent issues. Surprisingly, the existing literature on halal-related topics remains a 'grey area' when it comes to LSCM (LSCM) in the pharmaceutical sector. To address this gap, this paper aims to investigate the LSCM aspects of halal pharmaceutical research. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was employed to systematically screen, review, and synthesise the literature on halal pharmaceutical research. Through this review, we aim to examine the current LSCM trends and the state of research in the field of halal pharmaceuticals. Despite some notable advancements, halal pharmaceutical research remains largely understudied. Moreover, there are significant gaps in the existing literature, particularly from an LSCM perspective, which hinders knowledge expansion and practical applications. By conducting a systematic review from the LSCM lens, this study aims to contribute valuable conceptual insights and practical implications that will serve as a foundation for future research in the field of halal pharmaceuticals.</jats:p>"

In addition, adequate moisture and suitable soil moisture can make the strawberry grow more healthily, thus improving its quality and reducing the occurrence of hollow fruit. Therefore, in strawberry cultivation, reasonable water and soil moisture management is very important, growers need to carry out timely irrigation and drainage according to the growth of strawberry, to ensure the growth and yield of strawberry. Its disadvantages include the following: vulnerable to diseases and pests, high requirements for climatic conditions, high requirements for climatic conditions and high production costs. As a new agricultural technology, hydroponics can save land resources and reduce land pollution by cultivating plants in containers instead of planting plants on the land.</jats:p>",

The use of coagulation and chlorination methods before biological treatment in aeration tanks was proposed. Alumofloc 18% was used as a coagulant, PAA was used as a flocculant, and sodium hydroxide was used as an alkalizing reagent. The study was conducted on a mixture of industrial and domestic wastewater with COD and BOD5 – 3200 and 1575 mg/dm3, respectively, and on industrial wastewater with COD and BOD5 – 4480 and 1960 mg/dm3, respectively. The effects of reducing COD and BOD5 indicators in the first case after coagulation were 30 and 40%, after chlorination - 37.82 and 43.18%, respectively, in the second after coagulation - 28.58 and 47.25%, respectively. It was established that a significant proportion of organic substances according to the COD indicator is in a dissolved state - 60-70%. It has been proven that as a result of chlorination, the maximum reduction of \"pure\" COD is achieved, therefore, the possibility and expediency of chlorination of water after the secondary settling tank with increased doses should be considered in the wastewater treatment technology of the cardboard and paper factory.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The issue of decreasing air quality index due to supply chain transportation is one of the problems that must be addressed by the manufacturing sector. Green supply chain management (GSCM) can be a solution to address environmental issues in the supply chain. The GSCM is an integrated view that incorporates environmental considerations into the conventional supply chain, ranging from supplier selection, product design, material selection, manufacturing processes, packaging, and distribution. The correct implementation of GSCM can address both environmental and performance issues, e.g. decreasing both energy consumption and air pollution. The GSCM consists of green design, green manufacturing, green logistics, disassembly, and remanufacturing. To address the GSCM issues, the simulation is also discussed in this work. Meanwhile, this work suggests more policies for recycling, remanufacturing, and reuse of obsolete manufacturing products to support GSCM in developing nations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research investigates how the dimensions of Supply Chain Information Technology (SCIT) affect the performance of the manufacturing industry, specifically focusing on selected Nigerian manufacturing companies. The study employed a targeted sampling technique to select 20 respondents from the Department of Procurement and Logistics of each of the five chosen manufacturing companies, resulting in a sample size of 100 respondents. Data was collected from the respondents using a structured questionnaire, and path analysis was employed to analyze the collected data. The findings demonstrate that SCIT dimensions, namely ERP, CRM, EDI, and AAS, have a positive and significant correlation with organizational performance. This association is observed in terms of strategic decision-making, improved understanding of customer preferences, needs, and behaviors, and enhanced data accuracy and order processing efficiency. It can be concluded that implementing SCIT in the manufacturing industry will result in increased operational efficiency, better decision-making, better collaboration, and greater supply chain transparency. This enables managers to proactively address challenges, optimize resources, and drive performance improvements across the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Although, Indonesia is the third-largest country in the world in producing the most, Indonesia still depends on rice imports. This was done by the government to maintain the national rice supply.The rice supply chain in Indonesia has not been optimum, as indicated by the relatively small profits of producer.

In the rapidly changing conditions of the functioning of the country’s economy, the importance of road and rail transport is increasing. Road transport is the fastest–changing channel in the development of new transport chains. The importance of rail transport also remains very high, especially when transporting goods over long distances. Improving the efficiency of logistics companies in the construction of new transport corridors directly depends on the choice of the company’s business strategy and the development of the company as a whole.

It is determined the need to differentiate the system of recognition of the professional qualifications of a combat medic and a senior combat medic with corresponding changes to the professional standard of a combat medic by introducing professional qualification categories: a combat medic of the II category, without medical education with special standardized training in educational centers, which corresponds to 4th level of the national qualification framework; a combat medic of category I (senior combat medic), who must have an appropriate educational qualification corresponding to the 5th level of the national qualification framework, as well as a combat medic of the highest professional qualification category, corresponding to the 6th level of the national qualification framework.\n\nIt is substantiated that the compliance of the professional standard «Combat medic» with the norms of the current legislation requires the separation of professional qualification categories in the corresponding professional standard, as well as further differentiation of the meaningful content of the functionality of staff positions of senior combat medic and combat medic, taking into account the corresponding work and professional competencies. The authors also substantiate the necessity of differentiation in the professional standard the labor functions and professional competences of combat medics without medical education and senior combat medics with a professional medical education based on the introduction of relevant professional qualification categories.\n\nIt has been proven that the proposed differentiation of the professional qualification categories of the «Combat medic» profession is due to a significant difference in the competencies of servicemen who hold full-time positions of senior combat medics and have a bachelor's degree in higher education compared to servicemen who hold similar positions of senior combat medics in the presence of higher education qualification «Junior Bachelor» degree, or vocational pre-university education qualification «Professional Junior Bachelor», in particular with regard to the «responsibility and autonomy» descriptor of the national qualification framework.\n\nIt is emphasized that the implementation of the mentioned proposals regarding the improvement of the professional standard «Combat medic» can be an effective tool and factor of quality management in the system of medical support of the Ukrainian Defense Forces.</jats:p>",

Chlorination still remains the most affordable, economical and effective method compared to any other known means. During hostilities, new risks arise due to the increased danger of emergency situations, leakage and spread of gaseous chlorine. Plans for liquidation of emergency situations, although they contain a list of actions in case of accidents, are based on their man-made nature. At the same time, the \"war scenario\" does not exclude the simultaneous damage of all chlorine containers in the warehouse, for example, due to the impact of a rocket, projectile, their fragments, etc. During wartime, the delivery of chlorine also becomes more difficult, and the risks of disabling automated safety devices due to power outages and other unforeseen situations increase. It is obvious that in wartime, and especially during regional active hostilities, the use of gaseous chlorine should be abandoned, but not the disinfection of drinking water. The authors considered the possibilities of using alternative methods of disinfection of drinking water, their advantages and disadvantages, as well as the possibility of quick re-equipment of disinfection stations. It was noted that solving the issue of replacing gaseous chlorine with safer disinfection reagents should become an integral part of plans to ensure a stable water supply of the settlement during emergency situations and military actions. The optimal solution is to switch to the use of chlorine dioxide with diesel generators. The use of this reagent, in addition to the high reliability and safety of water disinfection, simultaneously prevents the formation of trihalomethanes. In the short term, it is recommended to replace chlorine gas with calcium hypochlorite, which can be stored for a long time. Although the reagent is more expensive compared to other chlorine-containing reagents, its use is intended only in dangerous periods, so the cost should not be considered critical.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SCF (Supply Chain Finance), as an emerging technology-driven financial optimization approach, has grown quickly worldwide with the development of information technology. China is one noteworthy country influenced by SCF development; its traditional financial market structure dominated by banks is undergoing change. The E-commerce-centered SCF has evolved into the representative capital provider in the new financial “Blue Ocean” market. For capturing competitiveness, Chinese JD (Jingdong) SCF practice backed to JD E-commerce is a typical example involving business model innovations, but with few previous related studies on this aspect. Therefore, to fill the research gap, this paper introduces a hybrid theoretical analysis of the BMC (Business Model Canvas) considering a three-layer strategic innovation structure and financial analysis regarding a modified competitive advantages-gaining model to comprehensively explore the recent innovative development and transformation of JD SCF business based on the perspective of competitive advantages. This study identifies JD SCF’s two times of business model innovations that benefit from its sustainable development; verifies that “cost”, “differentiation”, and “focused strategy” are three means for JD SCF practice gaining competitiveness at different development stages and simultaneously emphasizes that the latter two are influenced by business model innovation. The mixed analysis work in this paper may contribute both theoretical and practical implications.</jats:p>"

This review identifies the enabling technologies for Industry 4.0 that are being applied to improve GSC practices and establishes the points of its future research agenda. A systematic literature review (SLR) of this topic was conducted using Web of Science and Scopus as databases. Our study combined descriptive and conceptual analysis, guided by three review questions. These questions were proposed to identify how Industry 4.0 technologies can enhance the development of GSCs. After refinement, 75 papers were analyzed. This research underlines what technologies of Industry 4.0 are being implemented to improve GSC aspects. In addition, it shows in which GSC practices the application of these technologies is being considered and what challenges of implementing Industry 4.0 in GSCs have been identified in the literature. Finally, all these findings enhance establishing a future research agenda. Current studies have focused on analyzing the benefits of implementing Industry 4.0 in GSCs. However, this paper delves into enabling technologies for Industry 4.0 and GSC practices and does not only discuss them in general terms.</jats:p>"

However, in the short term, the real gross domestic product is positively affected by its value and money supply in lag periods and negatively by the real exchange rate, interest rate on lending, and inflation, but the interest rate effect is not significant. As for the exchange rate equation, the relationship between gross domestic product and money supply showed that it is direct with the exchange rate in Iraq during the period 2004-2020 in the long term and that the exchange rate is positively affected by its lag value during previous periods, and the effect of the interest rate on lending and inflation is positive on the exchange rate, but not significant in the short term. The money supply equation showed that the gross domestic product is directly related to the money supply, while the latter is related to an inverse relationship with the exchange rate in Iraq during the period 2004-2020 in the long term, whereas the money supply is related to a direct relationship with the real exchange rate and is negatively affected by the rate of inflation. As for the interest rate on lending, its impact is positive, but not significant, on the exchange rate in the short term. The study recommended that the mutual influence between the real exchange rate and the gross domestic product should be taken into account when drawing and formulating the monetary policy of the exchange rate in Iraq.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Extant literature has used a food supply chain/systems approach to evaluate sources of food loss and waste (FLW) and their impact on food accessibility and therefore nutrient availability. The maximization of nutrients available to a growing global population is a critical aspect in the sustainable agenda and it is acknowledged that the continued augmentation of food produce is no longer the sole solution. However, there is a drive for greater efficiency, not simply in the resources deployed, but in the utilization of the food produced. This paper argues that FLW are not the only sources of nutrient loss within a supply chain and that there is a loss of nutrient density as the food progresses through the supply chain with the deterioration of nutrients in food within the food supply chain. It is argued here that in parallel to the management of loss and waste, there is a further need for a research agenda to explore the reality of loss of nutrient density holistically as it passes from farm to fork, building on the existing scientific research at each tier within the supply chain.</jats:p>",

However, the potential impacts of 4D printing technology on supply chain sustainability, particularly concerning energy use and carbon emissions, remain largely unexplored. In this study, mathematical models are established to quantitively analyze how the adoption of 4D printing technology affects energy consumption and carbon emissions during different stages of supply chains. An exploratory comparison is performed using a protective enclosure for microcontroller board under two scenarios, i.e., the components fabricated using stereolithography with conventional resin needing manual assembly upon use, and a 4D-printed monolithic case with heat-activated self-folding on demand. Case study results indicate that the use of 4D printing contributes to more energy-efficient operations in the supply chain with an approximately 10% reduction in carbon emissions.</jats:p>",

This study focused on the Ras El-Ain area located in the South of Lebanon that dedicated, along with other reservoirs, to supply potable water for Tyr and the surrounding villages. Nowadays, the water of these natural ponds has been polluted significantly due to unrestricted liquid and solid waste disposal. Physicochemical and microbiological water characteristics, following the LIBNOR guidelines, of four selected samples from each natural pond were tested. In addition, another sample was taken from a water reservoir that collects water from these natural ponds. The obtained results were used to evaluate the extent of pollution in these natural ponds using PhreeQC software. The novelty of this study stems from the fact that it is the first to shed light on the degree of pollution level in the Ras El-Ain ponds, Lebanon (an unstudied area).</jats:p>",

The algorithm for forming an effective organisation of production inventory accounting is outlined and tested. Based on the reliable financial statements of PJSC \"Dnipro Mineral Fertilizer Plant\", the presented methodology for organising accounting, control and analysis of production inventories has been tested.  The basic principles of documenting operations of production stocks are studied and peculiarities in terms of inventory recording at a chemical enterprise are identified. A scheme of document flow of inventory movement has been developed. In the course of the study, a comparative analysis of judgements on determining the value of production stocks according to the national and international methods of their reflection was carried out. The main differences in the methods of valuation of inventories for their disposal are identified and characterised. It has been concluded that the valuation of inventories by the FIFO method in martial law is inappropriate. The paper assesses the accounting treatment of production inventories. The organisation of synthetic inventory accounting is described and a journal of business transactions on inventory movements for the month of the current year is formed. It has been established that the organisation of inventory accounting is carried out in accordance with the current regulatory framework and the Order \"On Accounting Policy at an Enterprise\". In the course of the study, certain conditions for the occurrence of irrelevant production inventories were accepted. The basis for these judgements is the analysis of accounting records on inventory movements.  The mechanism for applying decision-making models under conditions of uncertainty is implemented. The analytical table was used to calculate the loss in a discrete situation.  On the basis of the calculations, analytical conclusions are formulated. The effectiveness of applying the decision-making model \"Minimisation of maximum regret\" has been proved. The resulting model allowed to complete analytical conclusions and prove the effectiveness of the use of accounting and analytical reflection of production stocks in order to make effective management decisions.</jats:p>"

However, the unique challenges faced by military supply chains necessitate tailored approaches to enhance resilience. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for optimizing supply chain resilience in military operations. The proposed framework incorporates key elements such as risk assessment, contingency planning, information sharing, and resource allocation. It leverages advanced analytics techniques, including simulation modeling, optimization algorithms, and real-time data integration, to support decision-making and improve resilience. Results demonstrate that the optimized supply chain resilience strategy significantly enhances the military's ability to respond to disruptions, reduce recovery time, and minimize operational downtime. Moreover, the framework identifies critical vulnerabilities and recommends proactive measures to enhance system robustness. By adopting this framework, military organizations can better prepare for and respond to a wide range of supply chain disruptions, ultimately improving operational efficiency and mission success. The findings of this study contribute to the emerging field of military logistics by providing a systematic approach to optimize supply chain resilience and offering valuable insights for military decision-makers.</jats:p>",

One of the possible problems of the weirs is the partial blockage caused by sedimentation upstream of them. This research experiment investigates the hydraulic performance of gabion broad-crested weirs (GBCWs) with an upstream partial blockage. For this purpose, a total of 147 experiments were studied with different conditions for free-flow conditions. The weirs were tested with five partial blockage conditions between 0% and 100% of the weir height (0, 0.25P, 0.5P, 0.75P, and P). The results showed that increasing the partial blockage decreases the discharge coefficient. The changes in the discharge coefficients are minor for partial blockage less than 0.25P, and for partial blockage greater than 0.5P, the discharge coefficients are significantly reduced. As the partial blockage increases, the effect of filling-material size in gabion weirs decreases. Finally, a relationship was developed using the nonlinear regression analysis approach to estimate the discharge coefficient in the GBCWs with partial blockage.</jats:p>",

This paper looks at reasons for the rise of this movement and analyses if this has strong legs, or just a knee-jerk reaction due to the global supply chain collapse arising post-pandemic. It also analyses business sentiments around the reshoring movement to bring to the readers reality on the ground. Furthermore, the paper proposes looking at the reshoring phenomenon as a true risk management process across the global supply chain rather than a reactive approach to reshoring. The paper puts forth a data-driven argument on how the post-pandemic supply chain fiasco has given the US and Europe a window of opportunity to balance its supply chain risk of complete manufacturing dependence on China. Post-pandemic, and for purely economic and strategic reasons, businesses in North America and Europe should be aggressively looking to create a viable regional alternative to China’s manufacturing monopoly to hedge risk, and to do that we have proposed a three-pillar strategy. The paper is not proposing that business move all their operations lock, stock and barrel to Latin America, as that is not a viable strategy.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, IFM has been a target of adulteration by those attempting to make illegal profits and has suffered from contamination-related issues. This study’s main objective was to identify the most critical risks affecting IFM quality in the supply chain and determine mitigation strategies to improve IFM performance measurement. We developed a model to reduce adulteration and contamination rates in the infant formula milk supply chains (IFMSCs) and maximize safety. The steps to achieve the study’s objectives included: (1) identifying the importance of IFMs for infant nutrition and their risks; (2) establishing mitigation criteria for evaluating IFMSC’s performance to maximize quality; and (3) analyzing each mitigation criterion to maximize IFM safety. Based on pairwise comparisons by professionals in the food supply chain (FSC) of decision-making, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model was used to analyze and prioritize mitigation alternatives. According to the contamination quality risk agent, mitigation alternative (QR.M2) ranked highest. This study’s findings illustrate how vital avoiding risk is when dealing with public health, especially infants’ health, and how IFM must undergo precise testing and quality checks at every supply chain stage to ensure quality.</jats:p>"

However, because EVs are mobile, the evaluation of backup capacity for EV-UPS systems is completely different when compared to traditional UPSs. As a result, the focus of this paper is on the evaluation and improvement of backup capacity for EV-UPS systems. The architectures for EV-UPS systems are presented first. The methodology for calculating backup capacity for EV-UPS systems is then presented, followed by four detailed cases based on different grid failure times. Furthermore, the impact of system operating parameters on backup capacity, such as different load power, EV mobility pattern parameters, and grid outage durations, is investigated. The results of backup capacity in cases of different operating parameters are detailed using an EV mobility model. An improved strategy for increasing backup capacity is proposed, in which more backup energy can be released during a power outage. Meanwhile, the next trip requirement is unaffected. The backup capacity with the improved strategy is then calculated and compared to the results with the traditional strategy. Finally, a 5 kW EV-UPS experimental platform is constructed, and the experimental results are presented to validate the proposed method.</jats:p>"

Проблема в использовании устаревших технологий и поиска новых является  наиболее важной в системе организации производства на предприятиях. Важно подчеркнуть, что  данная проблема актуальна не только по причинам изменений в мире, которые очень сильно  повлияли на разрывы во всех логистических цепочках, либо частично, либо разорвались полностью,  но и сейчас, на современном этапе развития цифровой экономики с внедрением передовых и  инновационных технологий. Разработка и использование новых подходов, методов и технологий  помогут предприятиям обрести независимость, улучшить каналы связи как внутри страны, так и с  новыми партнёрами за её пределами, образовывая новые логистические цепи, постоянно их развивая  и расширяя, а также повысить свою привлекательность, конкурентоспособность и  автоматизацию всех процессов. Данные и методы. В исследовании был проведён теоретический и эмпирический анализ  отечественной и зарубежной научной литературы, использовались ресурсы сети Интернет,  сделано сравнение различных методов между собой, выявлены сильные и слабые стороны. Для  решения проблемы были предложены конкретные модели и инновационные технологии, которые  заключаются в автоматизации и упрощении контроля во всех процессах на предприятиях. Полученные результаты. Проведённые исследования помогли понять, что мир не стоит на месте,  и необходимо развивать логистические технологии и методы не только внутри предприятий внутри  страны, но и с предприятиями с других стран. Для эффективного и правильного роста необходимо  разработать и создать собственные цепочки поставок с последующим включением в них  контрагентов, чтобы наши предприятия не были зависимы от предыдущих логистических цепочек,  в которых наше участие, на данный момент, приостановлено или очень затруднено. В процессе  исследования предлагается использовать такие новые модели, как контрольная вышка и SCOR модель, которые позволят предприятиям контролировать все процессы, сочетая в себе все самые  передовые и инновационные технологии: блокчейн, большие данные, интернет вещей, искусственный  интеллект, мультиагенты. Заключение. Результаты исследования весьма полезны и могут быть использованы не только в теоретической основе для реализации процессов, но и на практике. Они позволят сформировать ряд  рекомендаций для выбора, внедрения и использования новых технологий.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>Introduction. This article presents and discusses innovative methods and technologies in supply chains. The  problem of using outdated technologies and finding new ones is the most important in the system of  organizing production at enterprises. It is important to emphasize that this problem is relevant not only for  reasons of changes in the world, which have greatly affected the gaps in all supply chains, either partially or  completely, but even now, at the present stage of development of the digital economy with the introduction of  advanced and innovative technologies. The development and use of new approaches, methods and  technologies will help enterprises gain independence, improve communication channels both within the  country and with new partners outside it, forming new logistics chains, constantly developing and expanding  them, as well as increase their attractiveness, competitiveness and automation all processes. Data and methods. In the study, a theoretical and empirical analysis of domestic and foreign scientific  literature was carried out, Internet resources were used, a comparison of various methods was made with  each other, strengths and weaknesses were identified. To solve the problem, specific models and innovative  technologies were proposed, which consist in automating and simplifying control in all processes in  enterprises. Results. The conducted studies helped to understand that the world does not stand still, and it is necessary to  develop logistics technologies and methods not only within enterprises within the country, but also with  enterprises from other countries. For effective and proper growth, it is necessary to develop and create our  own supply chains with the subsequent inclusion of counterparties in them so that our enterprises are not  dependent on previous supply chains in which our participation is currently suspended or very difficult. In  the process of research, it is proposed to use such new models as the control tower and the SCOR model,  which will allow enterprises to control all processes, combining all the most advanced and innovative  technologies: blockchain, big data, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, multi-agents. Conclusion. The results of the study are very useful and can be used not only in a theoretical basis for the  implementation of processes, but also in practice. They will make it possible to form a number of  recommendations for the selection, implementation and use of new technologies.</jats:p>",

Through a comprehensive review of the literature, the current study identified key circular supply chain practices and their potential benefits for Industry 5.0. The findings indicated that closed-loop supply chains, sustainable sourcing, product design for circularity, and waste reduction may assist Industry 5.0 firms to achieve their sustainability objectives while enhancing the operational efficiency. Moreover, the study also highlighted the challenges associated with the implementation of circular supply chain practices including the necessity for collaboration among supply chain partners, investment in new technologies and infrastructure, and the development of new skills and capabilities. From a practical and managerial perspective, the implications suggest that firms aiming to adopt circular supply chain practices in Industry 5.0 should prioritize collaboration and coordination, make investments in new technologies and infrastructure, and foster the acquisition of new skills and capabilities. To complement this research, future studies could employ empirical research methods in order to validate the findings and recommendations as well as explore potential barriers to the implementation of circular supply chain practices in Industry 5.0.</jats:p>"

However, difficulties are possible in the interpretation of the radiological data, which leads to a violation of the examination technique in such patients and, accordingly, to the lack of success of the therapy and proper routing.\r\nAIM: To demonstrate the clinical case of a patient with intralobar pulmonary sequestration, describing the characteristic radiographic picture, and suggesting research methodology for the identified features of the aberrant vessel.\r\nMETHODS: Clinical and radiological data of a 27-year-old patient with acute respiratory symptoms and suspected abscessed pneumonia based on X-ray and computed tomography (CT) findings were presented. Due to the absence of clinical and radiological dynamics, atypical CT semiotics of abscesses, CT angiography of the thoracic aorta was performed after intravenous contrast enhancement with 80 ml of iodine-containing preparation (350 mg/mL).\r\nRESULTS: A pulmonary tissue thickening was revealed in the lower left lobe with lumpy clear contours, which consisted of a system of cystic cavities with contents, particularly well differentiated after contrast enhancement. On the native study, an additional vascular structure following from the subdiaphragmatic space was traced paravertebrally, which was the reason for extending the CT angiography scanning area to the epigastric region of the abdomen. A large-caliber arterial vessel was detected, which departed as a branch from the celiac trunk and passed to the above-described thickening of the pulmonary tissue. The combination of these signs is typical for intrapulmonary sequestration.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The correct interpretation of the identified changes allowed the patient to be routed to a hospital with a thoracic surgery department, since the sequestration must be removed in the vast majority of cases to prevent recurrent inflammatory episodes. Extension of the scanning area below the diaphragm may be useful, since part of the sequesters is supplied with blood from the abdominal aorta and its visceral branches. This will prevent the need for repeat CT angiography, and information about the source of the blood supply is extremely important for surgeons.</jats:p>"

Specifically, it investigated the supply chain managers’ leadership communication style, level of information sharing, and level of performance.  Further, the study probed the relationship between the supply chain managers’ leadership communication style and level of information sharing, leadership communication style and level of performance, level of information sharing and level of performance. Finally, it probed the predictive ability of the supply chain managers’ leadership communication style, and level of information sharing, taken singly or in combination, of level of performance. The descriptive-correlational research design was employed in this investigation.\nThe respondents of this study were composed of employees working in the supply chain of selected private companies in Laguna consisting of 100 ­­­­. The researcher used Raosoft sample size calculator with a 10% margin of error and 90% confidence level to come up with the sample size of 80. The respondents were selected through stratified random sampling technique.\nThe study findings showed that that an average weighted mean of 3.22 revealed the supply chain managers’ leadership communication style was good, an average weighted mean of 3.21 revealed the supply chain managers’ level of information sharing was high , an average weighted mean of 3.21 revealed the supply chain managers’ level of performance was high , there was a significant relationship between the supply chain managers’ leadership communication style along competency (p=0.000), consistency (p=0.000), commitment (p=0.000) and level of information sharing. The probability value of 0.000 was less than the 0.01 significance level. However, no significant relationship was noted between command and control and level of information sharing. The probability value of 0.470 was greater than the 0.05 significance level, there was a significant relationship between the supply chain managers’ leadership communication style along competency (p=0.000), consistency (p=0.000), commitment (p=0.000) and level of performance. The probability value of 0.000 was less than the 0.01 significance level. However, no significant relationship was noted between command and control and level of performance. The probability value of 0.470 was greater than the 0.01 significance level, and there was a significant relationship between the supply chain managers’ level of information sharing and level of performance. The probability values of 0.000 was obtained which was less than 0.01 level of significance.\nOn the other hand, a probability value of 0.000 indicates a high level of prediction of the dependent variable (level of performance). The obtained R square of 0.782 shows that independent variables (supply chain managers’ leadership communication style and level of information sharing) explain the variability of the dependent variable (level of performance). Further, the ANOVA shows that the independent variables the supply chain managers’ leadership communication styles along command/control and competency as well as their level of information sharing statistically significantly predicted the dependent variable level of performance with an F-value of 53.151 and a probability value of 0.000 which is less than the 0.05 significance level.\nIt was concluded in the study that the supply chain managers’ leadership communication style was good for they can effectively direct people to obey instructions with little or no question and to resist change, manage situations, performing within a strictly delineated framework where everything is neatly organized and structured , their  level of information sharing was high for they can precisely articulate ideas, concepts and negotiations that are aligned to their work objectives in order to reach their goals, their level of performance was high for they possess a consistent, reliable, and steady communication style , the better the supply chain managers’ leadership communication style along competency, consistency, and commitment, the higher is their level of information sharing ,the better the supply chain managers leadership communication style along ccompetency, consistency, and commitment, the higher is their level of performance, and the  higher the supply chain managers level of information sharing, the higher is their level of performance. Likewise, the independent variables the supply chain managers’ leadership communication styles along command/control and competency as well as their level of information sharing are the drivers of supply chain managers’ level of performance.</jats:p>"

This study's overall objective was to identify, develop, and use indicators to measure the resilience of the agrifood supply chain. Specific research objectives were 1) to identify and develop survey-based indicators of the economic resilience of agribusinesses; 2) to use the indicators to measure and analyze the economic resilience of the agrifood supply chain in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3) to evaluate differences in the economic resilience of agribusinesses in the different supply chain stages to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data for the study were collected through two online surveys conducted in 2020 and 2022. Two resilience indicators were identified and developed: a static (SRES) and a dynamic (DRES) indicator. SRES measures the ability of businesses to avoid business losses within each study period. DRES measures firms capacity to recover business activity after an initial negative revenue shock. Study results reflect that, on average, the LAC agrifood supply chain firms in the sample were able to adapt and recover from the disruptions of a global health pandemic. The effects of the pandemic were not homogeneous across firms, nor was their adaptive resilience to the disruption.</jats:p>"

Environmental aspect is one of the sustainability elements that tends to be neglected in the supply chain management. Its impact on project site and living surrounding environment is either taken lightly or ignored by the construction stakeholders. This paper aims to investigate the barriers of the uptake of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) during the pre-construction stage of construction project to assist stakeholders with planning in relation to the environmental protection at the earliest stage of a project. Pre-construction is the stage within a project life cycle for decision making on the selection of materials, labours, plants and equipment. Questionnaire survey was distributed to the construction stakeholders, with 44 valid responses returned. The analysis was drawn from the feedback of the architects, contractors, consultants, and engineers. The results revealed that the critical barriers for the GSCM were lack of company’s leadership and support, lack of awareness, and lack of sustainable GSCM practices. This research provides an overview of current GSCM practices in Malaysia and alerts stakeholders to focus on specific organizational strategies in adopting GSCM.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The world population is continuously growing and it affects increased usage of natural resources on one hand and creating waste and endangering natural environment on the other hand. According to FAO estimate in the following decades, the number of people on the earth is going to be increased to 10 billion, which requires increase in food production. The increase is going to lead to larger amount of waste, which is created in food supply chain. The term “food industry waste “covers all substances that represent left overs or unused excessive materials during production process. In fact, all materials that are meant to be disposed of or process them in a suitable way so they do not pollute environment can be considered the waste. The most part of waste from this sector are remains of basic raw materials, which are remains after obtaining main product. Taking into account these substances do not present the main product, they are known as by-products. They can be processed and reused. Non-disposed byproducts from agriculture and food industry pose a threat and endanger the health of people and animals. The interest in using by-products from food supply chain is growing constantly. Experts are looking for additional opportunities for their safe processing, ways for turning them into raw materials, by whose recycling into new products, the amount of the waste would be minimized, and at the same time new, usable products would be introduced. Large amounts of waste, including by-products is generated during production and processing of meat. If animal origin waste is not processed (recycled), it represent lost raw materials for production of protein energy food, technical grease for chemical industry or fuel with high calorific value. The most suitable way for harmless removal of non-edible by-products from meat industry as well as dead animals, is their collection and usage, depending on the structure and kind of raw materials and their categorization, technical processing and application of modern technologies. Disposal of by-products and animal waste in Republika Srpska is not resolved in an appropriate manner and poses a danger to human health and the health ofanimals. In order to achieve this, there is a need for organized collection, storaging and disposal of animal by-products from slaughtering of animals by their technical processing in specialized plants. These plants allow us to produce high-quality animal feed or the raw material for biofuels production (biogas, biodiesel) with the complete protection of the environment. Economic side of this problem implies collection and safe disposal of huge quantities of biological materials that produce costs, which have to be incorporated in prices of the products. If waste of animal origin is not processed (recycled), they represent lost raw material that was possible to incorporate in production of proteinaceous – energetic feed, technical fat for chemical industry or fuels with high calorific value. The most suitability way for harmless removal of inedible by-products from the meat industry, as well as dead animals, is certainly their collection and use depending on the type and structure of raw materials and their categorization, by technical processing using modern equipment and technology.</jats:p>"

The initial offload ratio is set and supply chain resources are allocated, then the remaining computing resources are distributed according to the server’s computing power. Finally, the offload is optimised according to the resource allocation. The experimental results show that time delay and cost adjustment strategies can improve the CBE supply chain’s comprehensive ability.

As environmental awareness grows, the importance of sustainable, efficient, and socially responsible supply chains is rising, necessitating the integration of AI to meet these goals. AI's potential to bolster supply chain operations' transparency and sustainability is analyzed in detail. Employing a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we evaluate the various applications of AI in SSCM. These range from demand forecasting with predictive analytics, to carbon reduction through intelligent automation, real-time tracking for improved transparency, and supplier assessment via machine learning based on sustainability parameters. Our findings suggest AI's effectiveness in enhancing visibility across the supply chain, promoting ethical and sustainable practices, and optimizing resource use to reduce waste. However, the research also acknowledges obstacles to AI adoption, such as high costs, data privacy concerns, and skill gaps, while proposing potential solutions. In conclusion, the study underscores AI's transformative power in creating sustainable supply chains and provides valuable insights for industry practitioners, policy makers, and researchers. It accentuates the urgency of harnessing AI technology amid growing environmental concerns, changing consumer consciousness, and regulatory demands for sustainability in the digital era.</jats:p>"

Partial heart transplantation, or transplantation of fresh valve allografts, has recently been described as a strategy to provide a durable and non‐thrombogenic alternative to conventional prostheses and provide growth potential in pediatric patients.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was queried to analyze the number of pediatric donor hearts that were not recovered but had viable valves (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 3565) between January 2010 and September 2021. Recoverable valves were grouped by donor age: infants (age &lt; 1 year), toddlers (age ≥1 and &lt;3 years), and children (age ≥3 and &lt;18 years).

The actual number is likely higher because it includes hearts not entered in the UNOS database and domino transplants from orthotopic heart transplant recipients. Partial heart transplantation is logistically feasible as there are recoverable valves available for all age groups, fulfilling a clinical need in pediatric patients with unrepairable valve disease.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The structure of the obtained powder sorbents was studied by the granulometric method and X-ray phase analysis. A laboratory setup was developed to study of influence of sorption parameters on extraction degree of toxic substances from wastewater. The sorption properties of powders obtained by co-precipitation of polyvalent ferrum compounds, electroerosion dispersion of steel shavings and iron ore flotation concentrate are compared. Effect of ultrasonic treatment of coprecipitation reaction mixture and the speed of mixing of the sorption mixture on the quality of wastewater treatment from zinc ions was studied. The best results of sorption water purification were achieved with use of freshly obtained pasty suspension of ferritization coprecipitation at a stirring speed of the sorption mixture of 1200 rpm. It was found, that under such conditions a high degree of extraction of Zn2+ ions  ̶  98 % is ensured, and the resulting purified solution meets the standards for the content of zinc ions in water for its reuse in the rinsing operations at electroplating facilities. The use of research results at industrial enterprises will prevent environmental pollution by toxic heavy metals, replace inefficient technologies, and ensure rational use of water and raw materials in the industrial productions.</jats:p>"

Eight spring oat varieties, four level of nutrient application was arranged in a split-plot design with three replications. The obtained results showed that foliar application of sulphur improves the grain yield of most nutrients responsive varieties by about 34.7%. However, application of silicon had shown a diminishing return association to grain yield of variety GK Kormorán, GK Pillangó, Lota, Panni. LAI, thousands grain weight, SPAD, NDVI was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) influenced by genetic difference of the tested varieties, developmental plasticity, and nutrient application. Significantly higher grain yield was obtained from the variety Mv Pehely than the other tested varieties.

Therefore, encouraging decisionmakers to improve the packaging level is key to coordinating the supply chain of porcelain. Considering consumers’ preferences for packaging level, this paper constructs three kinds of porcelain supply chain decision-making models, including the impact of the packaging level on porcelain transport losses and after-sales problems caused by transport losses. Using Stackelberg game knowledge, the equilibrium decision and supply chain profit under three decision models are compared and analyzed. The main findings are as follows: the decision and profit are better in the centralized decision-making mode. In the decentralized decision-making model, the profit of the leader is higher than that of the follower. Consumers’ preferences for porcelain packaging and the value coefficient of packaging protection have a positive effect on the improvement of supply chain profits and the level of porcelain packaging. In addition, in view of the decentralized decision-making model led by suppliers, this paper introduces a joint contract to encourage the members of the supply chain to improve the packaging level of porcelain and achieve the perfect coordination of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The Autoregressive Distributed-Lag (ARDL) method is used to analyze short-term and long-term effects and uses time-series data from 2000:Q1 to 2021:Q4. The results of this study show that the long-term coefficient of the money supply has a smaller effect on the depreciating exchange rate than the short-term coefficient. Based on the estimation results, it can be concluded that there is an application of the Dornbusch Overshooting Model in Indonesia. A further implication of this research is that the factors that influence exchange rate fluctuations are of great concern in an effort to maintain exchange rate stability. For example, growth in the money supply because a 1 percent change in the money supply results in a change of more than 1 percent in the exchange rate. In addition to the money supply, other variables such as inflation and interest rates also have a large influence on changes in exchange rates and have different magnitudes of influence in the short and long-run.</jats:p>"

Growth, which lessens poverty and increases equality, is often seen as inextricably linked to the effective use of water resources. Traditional water system management aims to optimize surface water and subsurface aquifers to meet conflicting needs. As a result, the special difficulties in water resource management (WRM) would be exacerbated by the added uncertainty brought on by climatic change. Managing the world's water supplies sustainably is crucial to the planet's continued existence and prosperity. However, ecological planning for sustainable water development is difficult because of complex impacts, random processes, and hydrological restrictions. The study was inspired to address the issues head-on by creating a hybrid AI algorithm for ecological water resource sustainability and digital finance (HAI-EWRS-DF) system for solving complex, multi-scale problems in WRM. Control mechanisms, including social, financial, and sustainability on ground-level and surface-level water resource facilities, are recommended to enhance WRM to increase the applicable revenue, promote community well-being, and pave the way for greater economic development.</jats:p>",

This work proposes an Internet of things-based low-cost, interoperable smart electric vehicle supply equipment for deploying in all charging stations. The device hardware is designed to monitor, analyze, and collect consumed energy by the vehicle and transfer this data to a connected network. The pre-defined messages associated with the firmware will help to record this data with a remote management server for further processing. The messages are defined in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), which helps to overcome the interoperability issue. The device is smart because it can gather energy usage, detect device faults, and be intimate with the controller for a better operational environment. The associated management servers and mobile applications help to operate the smart device remotely and keep track of the usage statics. The developed low-cost, interoperable smart model is most suitable for two and three-wheeler vehicles.</jats:p>"

Biodiesel or methyl ester is obtained by transesterification of higher unsaturated fatty acids and alcohols in the presence of a catalyst. The by-product is trihydroxyl alcohol, glycerol, which is widely used in industry. For the production of fatty acid esters, rapeseed oil is mostly used in European countries, soybean oil in the USA, palm oil in Malaysia and others. The advantage of biodiesel is that it is biodegradable and relatively harmless to the environment. The increasing production and application of biodiesel is a consequence of its good characteristics as an environmentally friendly \"fuel\"; significantly lower toxicity compared to diesel of fossil origin; bioavailability; raw materials renewability for its production and the possibility of application in internal combustion engines.</jats:p>"

To do so, a hybrid multi-criteria decision analysis method, combining a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and the analytical network process (ANP), is used to analyze multiple determinants extracted from the target literature and the expert panel opinions. As a result, the key barriers to implementing the CE in the food sector were identified and ranked through the hybrid multi-criteria decision analysis. The practicality and validity of the model in the case of causal relationships that have hindered the CE transition in the food sector in Iran, as a developing country, are examined. A total of 15 barriers in six dimensions were analyzed. The “technical and technological capabilities”, “financial issues”, and “production issues” were distinguished as the most important dimensions. Moreover, “lack of circular design and innovative packaging to reduce food waste”, “high cost of CE implementation”, and “insufficient use of reusable, recyclable, and recoverable materials” were identified as the key barriers in the CE transition in food supply chains. The findings of this study revealed that “government policies”, “culture”, and “financial issues” were the most significant “cause” dimensions, which could leverage the elimination of “effect” dimensions, including “technical and technological capabilities”, “management and collaboration issues”, and “production issues”. The identified challenges and barriers pave the way for CE implementation and outline focal points for decision makers to mobilize their efforts in this regard. The findings can effectively contribute to the domain by providing insightful guidelines for the government and associated authorities, policymakers, and all stakeholders within the food supply chain to support the CE transition in the food sector.</jats:p>"

Family farms are an important part of China's agricultural modernization, and their development level is an important indicator to measure the degree of modernization of a country and a region. The application of agricultural Internet of Things technology in the field of agriculture is helpful for solving the problem of water shortage in family farms in water shortage areas. Based on questionnaire data, this paper used structural equation modeling (SEM) to study the relationship between family farm water financing willingness and behavior. The results showed that the standardization coefficients of Assumption 1, Assumption 2 and Assumption 3 were 0.332, 0.267 and 0.311, respectively. It can be seen that the water resource financing willingness of family farms was greatly affected by their water-saving technology ability, water management ability and government policy support. However, the standardization coefficient of Assumption 5 was 0.087. It can be seen that the water management capacity had no significant impact on the water resource financing behavior, and the water resource financing behavior of family farms was mainly affected by their water-saving technical capacity and government policy support.</jats:p>",

Next, the weights of risk indexes are measured by means of combined weighting based on subjective F-AHP method and objective CRITIC method. The final risk weight coefficients are then derived with EDAS method. With the aid of an improved DEMATEL method, the agricultural product supply chain financial risk factors are analyzed, and comprehensive impact degrees of different risk factors in agricultural product supply chains are calculated. The calculation results show that financial risks in agricultural product supply chains are highly influenced by cooperation level, performance record, and financial standing and repayment history of borrowing organization.

Since most of these problems involve uncertainty and hesitation on the part of Decision Makers (DMs), various studies have emerged recently that present SCM applications of techniques based on Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTSs) and HFLTS extensions. Given the relevance of this subject and the lack of literature review studies, this study presents a systematic review of HFLTS and HFLTS extension applications to SCM decision-making problems. In order to answer a set of research questions, the selected papers have been classified in accordance with a group of factors that are pertinent to the origins of these studies, SCM, HFLTSs, and decision-making. The results demonstrate that the Source and Enable processes have been studied with greater frequency, while the most common problems have to do with supplier selection, failure evaluation, and performance evaluation. The companies of the automotive sector and Sustainable SCM and Green SCM strategies predominate in the analyzed studies. Even though most of the studies use techniques based on HFLTSs, we have identified applications of seven distinct HFLTS extensions, with Double Hierarchy Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets and Probabilistic Linguistic Term Sets being the most utilized. The identification of gaps in the literature presents avenues for future studies focused on innovative applications, integrations of techniques, comparisons of techniques, group decision-making, and validation procedures for new models. The results of this study offer a panorama of the state of the art in regard to this subject and can help researchers and practitioners develop new studies which involve the use of methods that employ HFLTSs and HFLTS extensions in SCM decision-making problems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The object of research is the energy sector of Ukraine, specifically the gas supply system of the national economy. One of the most problematic places is the dependence of the Ukrainian economy on the import of natural gas (NG). Ukraine is rich in various natural resources, in particular, in natural and associated gas. However, own wells for NG extraction are not enough for gas supply to industrial enterprises and the population. Therefore, part of the necessary gas is imported. In the course of the study, methods of alternative supplies were analyzed, namely, liquefied natural gas (LNG), options for its supply with subsequent regasification were analyzed.\nThe global market for liquefied natural gas (LNG) was studied and it was shown that the production and consumption of LNG is constantly increasing. Since Ukraine is part of Europe, and the main suppliers of LNG for European countries are the USA and Norway, one of the options for gas supply for Ukraine considered the supply of LNG to the territory of Poland by sea transport, its regasification and subsequent transportation to consumers through existing pipelines. The second option is the supply of LNG to the Ukrainian coast of the Black Sea. To do this, it is necessary to study prospective transportation routes, build logistics and terminals for receiving and regasifying LNG. Since the depth of the channels from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea is small, the option of supplying natural gas from Central Asia by pipeline to the Black Sea coast of Georgia, its liquefaction, transportation by sea and regasification is proposed. This option requires significant capital expenditures for the construction of a natural gas liquefaction plant on the territory of Georgia and a regasification complex on the Ukrainian coast or a floating terminal.\nIn the course of the work, LNG quality criteria used in the world were studied, and it was noted that for the purchase and use of LNG in Ukraine, it is necessary to develop own standards for controlling its composition. Because the technology of providing the consumer with natural gas using LNG is more flexible than pipeline transport. Its implementation will make it possible to provide Ukraine with natural gas in the required quantities and, if necessary, to promptly change the volume of deliveries.</jats:p>"

One of the important fields is the calculation of water consumption (WC). Remote sensing techniques can be used to estimate actual evapotranspiration and it can also be used to estimate crop coefficients based on spectral reflectance of vegetation indices (VIs), and from a relation with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is an indicator for the absorption and the reflection ratios by the green plant. The current study used remote sensing data to calculate WC for El-Bostan irrigation district. Crop coefficient values were calculated from NDVI and reference evapotranspiration values were calculated using CROPWAT program. The obtained results were verified by comparing them with field measurements. There was a strong linear correlation between the measured and calculated values with r2 of 0.90, while the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.68. The results were also verified by comparing irrigation efficiencies obtained from remote sensing and from field measurements. The results were very close to each other. The study illustrated the importance and the reliability of using remote sensing techniques in calculating WC values, and which could improve water management and water use efficiency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply Chain Management (SCM) encompasses a wide variety of decision-making problems that affect business and supply chain performance as a whole. Since most of these problems involve uncertainty and hesitation on the part of Decision Makers (DMs), various studies have emerged recently that present SCM applications of techniques based on Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTSs) and HFLTS extensions. Given the relevance of this subject and the lack of literature review studies, this study presents a systematic review of HFLTS and HFLTS extension applications to SCM decision-making problems. In order to answer a set of research questions, the selected papers have been classified in accordance with a group of factors that are pertinent to the origins of these studies, SCM, HFLTSs, and decision-making. The results demonstrate that the Source and Enable processes have been studied with greater frequency, while the most common problems have to do with supplier selection, failure evaluation, and performance evaluation. The companies of the automotive sector and Sustainable SCM and Green SCM strategies predominate in the analyzed studies. Even though most of the studies use techniques based on HFLTSs, we have identified applications of seven distinct HFLTS extensions, with Double Hierarchy Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets and Probabilistic Linguistic Term Sets being the most utilized. The identification of gaps in the literature presents avenues for future studies focused on innovative applications, integrations of techniques, comparisons of techniques, group decision-making, and validation procedures for new models. The results of this study offer a panorama of the state of the art in regard to this subject and can help researchers and practitioners develop new studies which involve the use of methods that employ HFLTSs and HFLTS extensions in SCM decision-making problems.</jats:p>"

The Ganga is the most important river in India, but pollution is currently severely threatening its biodiversity and long-term environmental viability. Water samples were taken from 36 locations along the length of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in Uttar Pradesh and analysed for nutrient concentration to evaluate the nutrient load, eutrophication danger, and river trophic status. The average concentration of NO3-N, PO4-P, NH4-N, and SiO2-Si exceeded the values in unpolluted rivers, indicating the contribution of anthropogenic sources. The concentration of NO3-N and NH4-N showed significant spatial variation, and PO4-P showed significant seasonal variation in the study area. The DIN/DIP ratio in the study area exceeded 16:1, indicating a phosphate-limiting condition for phytoplankton development. The DSi/DIN value showed a declining trend in the downstream region of both rivers with average values &amp;lt;1, indicating nitrate pollution leading to eutrophic conditions. The Indicator for Coastal Eutrophication Potential (ICEP) showed a positive value, indicating that the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in Uttar Pradesh were eutrophic due to nitrogen pollution. Trophic State Index (TSI) values indicated that super-eutrophic conditions existed in the Ganga River (65.62) and hypereutrophic conditions existed in the Yamuna River (75.55) in Uttar Pradesh.</jats:p>",

Predictive analytics uses complex algorithms and machine learning to look through huge amounts of data for trends and outliers that could point to cyber dangers. Businesses can stay ahead of cyber attackers and keep their digital assets safe with this method. In the online supply chain, one of the best things about prediction analytics is that it can find new threats before they become full-blown attacks. Predictive analytics looks at past data, current trends, and other factors to be able to guess possible computer dangers and weak spots. In turn, this lets businesses take strategic steps to lower these risks, like fixing security holes or adding more protections. Predictive analytics can also improve the cyber supply chain's ability to respond to incidents. Predictive analytics looks at data from many places, like network logs, endpoint devices, and security monitors, to help find and rank possible security events. This lets companies react quickly and effectively to cyberattacks to lessen their effects. The prediction analytics is a great way to make the online supply chain safer. Using advanced algorithms and machine learning, businesses can find and stop cyber dangers before they happen, keep their digital assets safe, and boost their total security.</jats:p>"

The increase in population, the growth of urbanization, the opening of agricultural areas and the current economic needs cause the demand for clean water supply to increase but the resources that can be supplied are limited. In addition, other side factors such as natural disasters, raw water resources, technical aspects, human weaknesses and political elements also make the management of clean water supply treated to consumers unmanageable and effective. Hence, the study aims to justify political intervention in water supply management in the state of Kedah with a focus on politicking in Syarikat Air Darul Aman (SADA). Four methods are used to obtain appropriate data and information involving library studies, document analysis, face-to-face interviews with SADA senior management and politicians in Kedah using semi-structural questions and participating in the nature of the researchers who have held the position of CEO of SADA. The results of the analysis showed that; naturally as a result of SADA's organizational structure, close ties between politicians and top management, abuse of power by the CEO, poor company delivery system, public perception of society causing influence and political interference in organizations such as SADA are seen to occur. At the end of the study, a conceptual and model framework to enable SADA to become a professional and consumer service-oriented corporate entity by marginalizing political influence was developed for future reference and implementation purposes.</jats:p>"

Therefore, one of the United Nations’ Millennium Goals is to ensure access to safe drinking water for all as its target by 2030. However, ensuring water supply in rural regions, especially in developing countries, is a challenge. To meet the target, investing in infrastructure and maintaining the sustainability of water systems is crucial. This study takes into account the role of the management model of rural water supply systems and its relationship with the sustainability of the water systems. A weighing procedure for a sustainability assessment of rural water systems for the current study was proposed, then an ordered logit regression model was applied to examine the relationship between types of water system management models and the sustainability of the water systems in the context of Vietnam. The results from this study showed that type of management model had an influence on the sustainability of rural water supply systems, and the private management model was considered the one that significantly contributed to the sustainability of the rural water systems in the study area. The study provides some lessons learned for researchers in the field of rural water supply to select appropriate approaches to assess the sustainability of water systems and for policymakers to modify current policies toward more sustainable development of water infrastructure in the future, especially in developing countries.</jats:p>"

The actual daily wastewater discharges were: at MWWTP-1 – 216.8 thousand m³/day (or 54.2% of design capacity according to Project of reconstruction of wastewater treatment plants and the sludge treatment line); at MWWTP-2 – 69.0 thousand m³/day (or 43.2%, respectively). The actual daily load of wastewater pollution during military actions was on average (as a percentage of the design value): at the MWWTP-1 by COD - 60%; by BOD5 – 52%; by TSS – 51%; by Ammonium Nitrogen - 66%; and by Phosphates – 27%; at MWWTP-2 by COD - 52%; by BOD5 – 51%; by TSS - 30%; by Ammonium Nitrogen - 64%; and by Phosphates – 43%. The negative consequences of termination of the started works on the reconstruction of wastewater treatment plants due to military actions on their operation conditions are considered in the paper. The conclusion was made about the need to make corrections in the project of reconstruction of wastewater treatment plants and sludge treatment in case of its restoration, taking into account the actual situation.</jats:p>"

The number of countries outside of the United States that currently source and provide these critical elements is limited, posing implications for the security and continuity of the global and national supply chain and specifically to the national security of the US. This article is a mini review of the existing literature with recommendations for partnerships. It discusses potential stress points in the current supply chain of REEs and explores the feasibility of expanded American partnerships with Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo specifically to address opportunities to strengthen the security and transparency of the global supply chain of REEs. In Africa, REEs are concentrated in countries like South Africa, Madagascar, Malawi, Kenya, Namibia, the DRC, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Burundi. These countries have significant quantities of neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium among other REEs that are required in the numerous technological items (including green technologies) that are manufactured today. The framework for extracting the elements from those countries requires specific attention to ensure the preservation of natural assets that are key to global health.</jats:p>"

This underscores that the presence of a female audit partner leads the beneficial link between female audit committee directorship and audit quality. Regression results on whether the relationship between female audit committee directorship and audit fees is contingent on having a (fe)male audit partner indicate that female audit partners earn higher (lower) audit fees in companies with gender-diverse (all male) audit committees. This corroborates (in somewhat) the male-female disparities in compensation within the public-audit firms' leading ranks, regarded as a male-dominated workplace worldwide. In conjunction with the argument that (compared to their male rivals) female auditors face more difficulties to reach partnership positions in the public-audit firms and are, thereby, more cautious about the loss of these positions through (in almost cases) exerting more audit efforts, and preventing their audited client-firms from manipulating earnings, the authors reveal that female audit partners are associated with longer (lower) audit reporting lags (earnings management) in both companies with gender-diverse and companies with all-male audit committees. The authors therefore conjuncture that the beneficial female auditor effect on audit quality is not contingent (in somewhat) on (fe)male participation on the company's audit committee.

As the biggest power operation company, the State Grid Corporation of China has to ensure the normal operation of the power grid. However, the power system can be affected by several issues such as all kinds of extreme weather, aging of equipment, and with rapid development of the national economy and power industry, the electricity loads are becoming complicated and diversified. Due to the reasons above, pressure on the safe operation of the power grid is increasing significantly. In order to guarantee the safety of daily operation for power system, we propose a new system, including a fault predicting part and aftertreatment part. For the predicting part, machine learning technologies are used especially the Hawkes process model, to predict when and what kind of fault may happen, by which failures can be prevented effectively. In the aftertreatment part, a power supply guarantee command platform is established that can send abnormal information to headquarters at the very beginning and then our platform will search for the optimal maintainer intelligently to solve the problem immediately.</jats:p>",

However, we know less about the drivers of variation in more localized social and environmental outcomes across production sites, which may result from local, national, and global actors and institutions that may interact. I provide a brief overview of the dominant literature on supply chain governance, highlighting the tendency to take an actor-centric approach. I then identify opportunities to study local social and environmental consequences of networked production using a more explicitly multi-actor and multi-level approach that can allow us to identify potential trade-offs, double wins, or spillovers between social and environmental outcomes. </jats:p>",

Research on the formation of logistics systems is important both theoretically and practically. The goal of the research is to improve the theoretical foundations of the formation of a multi-level supply chain model based on the concept of modeling viable systems. A supply chain model based on the methodological apparatus of cybernetic modeling of viable systems is proposed. The supply chain model is presented in the form of a subject (metasystem) and an object of management (operational element), which is proposed in the form of links-elements of the supply chain. This allows coordinating material and other flows in the supply chain, providing viable means of development and maintaining long-term business relationships, and achieving synergistic effects from the interaction between system links. Flows in this system are formed into a logistics chain, which generally combines producers, intermediaries, carriers, and consumers. Based on the structural-level and metasystemic approaches, the main levels and structure of the supply chain are defined. To form a multi-level supply chain model, a differentiation criterion for levels is proposed, which allows, in accordance with the metasystemic approach, to identify five levels of the supply chain - element, component, subsystem, system and metasystem. The multi-level model of an integrated supply chain requires the integration of various functional areas and their participants at all levels within a single supply chain for its optimization and can be applied to any enterprises. The proposed theoretical foundations make it possible to coordinate such management objects in the logistics system as interaction between chain participants, logistics functions, business processes, and create their specific structure and determine integration levels. The structure of the mechanism for forming the supply chain is proposed, which is based on five functions: planning, procurement, production, sales, returns. The feature of the proposed mechanism is that special attention is paid to information support. Generalizing the structure of the supply chain mechanism will improve the effectiveness of establishing logistics links for the enterprise.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Nasia river serves as the primary source of domestic water supply for over 5000 households in the Nasia catchment. However, the river is currently experiencing water stress conditions, causing an imbalance between the demand for water and the available supply. In this study, we evaluated the impact of climate and environmental factors on changes in domestic water supply in the Nasia catchment, with the ultimate objective of providing policy direction. Our approach involved a mixed model of analyzing local perception of the drivers of domestic water supply change through focus group discussions and statistical analysis of in-situ climate and environmental data. Analysis of the local perception revealed that supernatural and mystic beliefs, changes in seasonal rainfall and environmental degradation were the causes of change in domestic water supply at the catchment. The statistical analysis of in-situ climate data revealed that mean and maximum temperatures were the main drivers, accounting for over 40% of the change in domestic water supply. Long term trends in temperature revealed positive trends with an indication of pre-warming of about 1.5oC of the catchment. Analysis of land use/cover change revealed that built-up/bare land has increased by 58.44% whereas farmland, vegetation, and water have reduced by 34.10%, 22.85%, and 1.48% respectively. The increase in bare lands had significant influence on the rate of warming and evapotranspiration in the Nasia catchment. The study’s outcomes hold significant practical relevance for Ghana’s Water Resources Commission and the Water and Sanitation Agency sector, as they endeavour to meet the nation’s water-related targets and sustainable development goal six. Additionally, it will offer valuable guidance for climate service provision and Nasia river catchment protection, as well as the implementation of alternative water sources to complement its usage.</jats:p>"

Unlike previous studies, which focused primarily on simulations of real-time clarifiers by independent measures, this study combines differentoperating criteria and geometric standards on clarifiers to estimate the ultimate capacity of secondary sedimentation tanks (SST). Numerical simulations were performed toassess the SST hydraulic performance under different conditions in order to (i) eliminate vortex zones; (ii) optimize the surface overflow rate (SOR) and predict sludge blanket height (SBH), and finally, (iii) estimate SST ultimate capacity. Based on the current configuration of the SST of Souk-Ahras WWTP, its hydraulic treatment capacity was found to be 49,000 m3/d. The results obtained, which were validated by field observations, showed that optimizing the different parameters yields a significantly improved SST performance. Furthermore, the tests consideredwere shown to be satisfactorily correlated with SOR. Validation using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis yielded anarea under curve (AUC) value of 90%, implying thereby a reasonably good performance. Indeed, optimization resulted in increased solidremoval efficiency and increased SOR to 1.4 m.h−1 (compared to 0.8 m.h−1 in literature) without overflow beyond the SBH.</jats:p>",

To causally estimate this effect, we use a rich urban-level data set, choose our controls using the post-double-selection methodology, and instrument human capital with the per capita number of historical educational institutions. We find that human capital positively impacts urban population, house price and wage growth. While an elastic housing supply reinforces the impact on urban growth, it reduces house price growth and wage growth. Our results infer that human capital increases productivity in both countries and acts as an amenity only in the US. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The machine learning model has become a critical consideration in the supply chain. Most of the companies have experienced vari-ous supply chain risks over the past three years. Earlier risk prediction has been performed by supply chain risk management. In this study, an integrated supply chain operations reference (ISCOR) model has been used to evaluate the organization's supply chain risk. Machine learning (ML) has become a hot topic in research and industry in the last few years. With this motivation, we have moved in the direction of a machine learning-based pathway to predict the supply chain risk. The great attraction of this research is that suppliers will understand the associated risk in the activity. This research includes data pre-processing, feature extraction, data transformation, and missing value replacement. The proposed integrated model involves the support vector machine (SVM), k near-est neighbor (k-NN), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), multiple linear regression (MLR) algorithms, measured performance, and prediction of supply chain risk. Also, these algorithms have performed a comparative analysis under different aspects. Among the other algorithms, the random forest algorithm achieves an accuracy of 99% and has accomplished superior results with a maxi-mum precision of 0.99, recall of 0.99, and F-score of 0.99 with 1% error rate. The model’s prediction indicates that it can be used to find the supply chain risk. Finally, the limitation and the challenges discussed also provide an outlook for future research direction to perform effective management to mitigate the risk.</jats:p>"

Despite that, the level of this technology practice varies across countries, regions, crop types, technologies, socio-economic statuses, and cultures. In the literature, there needs to be more evidence for digital technologies’ role in the role of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) to improve agricultural supply chains (ASC). Thus, this scoping study synthesizes extant research on the extent to which Emerging Digital Technologies (EDTs) promote EDI in the ASC.\nMethodology:\n A scoping approach to systematic literature review (SLR) was applied to achieve the objective by deploying the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. The methodology guided the process of conducting the scoping review step by step.\nFindings:\n Emerging technologies have been found to focus much on some parts of the ASC (such as transportation) where there are limited studies in other ASC parts. Most emerging technologies have been employed in the food supply chain where there is limited literature on the cash crops supply chain.\nResearch limitations/implications:\n The evidence gathered through this study informs innovation policies and prioritizes opportunities for future research and practices in the area. IoT, Blockchain, and Machine Learning are among the technologies worth detailed study for EDI in agricultural supply chain innovations. Each of these provides unique contributions but is subject to further evaluation, re-development, and deployment that considers the local context, nature of innovation, and other dynamics within the ecosystem.\nOriginality/value:\n This review provides insight into the current body of knowledge on the role of EDTs towards addressing EDI in ASC.</p>"

The methods used during the research: an integrated approach to environmental safety management, methods of system analysis, synthesis, and criterion analysis method. As a result of the research, the consequences caused by the wear and destruction of the drainage infrastructure were analyzed, and the latest studies, devoted to the methods of preparation of organizational and technical procedures for its reconstruction and restoration were analyzed. The substantiation was carried out and the structure of the theoretical and methodological approach to the formation of organizational and technical measures for managing the environmental safety of the functioning of the drainage infrastructure was developed. Systematization of the main factors influencing the results of environmental safety management was carried out. A structural model of the interaction between these factors had been developed. On the basis of the established criteria, a system of indicators had been developed that shows the effectiveness of organizational and technical procedures for managing the environmental safety of the drainage infrastructure. There were developed methodological approaches to making organizational and technical decisions on environmental safety management, ways to increase the efficiency of water drainage infrastructure were shown, and also a flowchart of possible instrumental support of organizational and technical decisions to support environmental safety was developed. As a result, it was established that the management of environmental safety at the current stage requires the development of new methods and organizational and technical solutions, which must be adopted by management subjects in a certain composition. The benefits of this are that the choice of the decision-making algorithm according to the proposed approach and adherence to it, as well as the use of the proposed toolkit, make it possible to ensure the efficient operation of the restored infrastructure on the basis of environmental safety.</jats:p>"

Over the past three years, growing geopolitical tension and asymmetric warfare have further increased the visibility of and focus on the weaponisation of information and, by implication, the weaknesses of our collective cognitive security. Societal and economic repercussions of the pandemic and the accompanying »infodemic«, the accelerated geopolitical competition, as well as recent domestic political violence in the USA and—most recently—Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, have increased the sense of urgency to defend and reinvigorate the information ecosystems that form the core of our liberal democracies, enabling everyone to not only express their opinions, but also to form their opinions, to make informed choices without being manipulated. Against this backdrop, the strategic importance of strengthening our knowledge supply chains is growing. Reinvigorating already existing components of our shared information sphere—including national verified encyclopedias—can help boost collective cognitive resilience against information manipulation, both in and beyond Europe. The external face of such investments can contribute to developing new aspects of European knowledge diplomacy, promoting and projecting European democratic values and freedoms in third countries.</jats:p>"

The population of the study was 418 middle and top-level management staff from selected quoted fast-moving consumer goods firms in Lagos State, Nigeria. The study adopted the total enumeration method. Data was collected using a valid and reliable questionnaire with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranging from 0.700 to 0.892. The response rate was 100%. Data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics (Multiple regression analysis).&#x0D;\nFindings: Findings revealed that green supply chain management had positive and significant effect on the performance of selected fast-moving consumer goods companies in Lagos State, Nigeria (Adj. R2 = 0.482, F (5, 407) = 77.600, p &lt; 0.05). The study concluded that green supply chain management practices enhanced organisational performance of selected fast-moving consumer goods companies in Lagos State, Nigeria.&#x0D;\nRecommendations: The study therefore recommended that management of fast-moving consumer goods firms in Nigeria should prioritise the implementation of green procurement, green warehousing, material management, and reverse logistics practices to enhance their overall performance. Also, the management of consumer goods firms in Lagos State should concentrate on optimising their material management processes, such as inventory control, demand forecasting, and supplier collaboration.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The generation mechanism and propagation paths of the DM noise in HPT trigger circuit with SMPS are investigated. To reduce the DM noise, a capacitive SMPS technique is adopted in the HPT trigger circuit with SMPS. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis.</jats:p>",

The main interest is to identify the challenges that organizations face when trying to gain a competitive advantage over other organizations by measuring supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, the concepts and terms used are clarified in the first section, in a broader framework, to note their relevance in the context of the paper, but also the relationship between them. In the second section, scientific papers on this topic are briefly presented, which served as a scientific foundation and prompted us to undertake our study to contribute to the body of scientific knowledge on this little-addressed topic. In the third section of the research, we established a qualitative design, composed of qualitative data from secondary sources, which were obtained data through a literature review and analysed using the comparative-deductive method. The result is to propose a simplified model for measuring SC performance from an ESG perspective. In the conclusions, possible uses of this model are proposed, as well as future perspectives that could improve performance measurement by adding new indicators.</jats:p>",

Pemodelan matematis dibuat dengan memperhatikan berat dan daya mesin induk, dimensi dan konfigurasi pondasi mesin induk, dan koefisien redaman. Pemodelan matematis diwujudkan dalam bentuk persamaan differensial orde-2. Dari hasil analisis yang dilakukan menunjukkan bahwa resonansi secara umum tidak terjadi. Hal ini dikarenakan nilai frekwensi alami pondasi mesin induk berbeda dengan nilai frekwensi eksitasi mesin. Namun perhatian lebih harus diberikan pada saat kapal beroperasi pada putaran mesin antara 1760 RPM sampai 1980 RPM. Hal ini disebabkan karena nilai frekwensi eksitasi mesin induk mendekati sama dengan frekwensi alami konstruksi pondasi. Semakin besar putaran mesin induk, besarnya respon simpangan juga semakin besar. Nilai respon kecepatan yang terjadi masih memenuhi ketentuan yang ditentukan oleh American Bureau of Shipping (ABS).

The methodology was descriptive with a documentary design.

It was found in the texts consulted coincidence in the fact that tidal energy in the coming years will be considered within the range of renewable energies to produce great changes in the energy sector due to the great potential it offers. According to IRENA, the cost of current tidal technologies ranges between 0.17 €/kWh and 0.23 €/kWh, although the pilot projects underway point to a decrease of between 0.25 and 0.47 €/kWh. Thus, in the course of time it will become increasingly accessible to incorporate it into the energy matrix of countries such as Ecuador given its constant wave potential estimated at 14kW/m on average. Thus, the production of tidal energy in Ecuador and specifically in the canton of Esmeraldas should be considered more strongly, given the advantages it offers for environmental, social and in the near future economic quality, all of which is in line with the philosophy of energy efficiency for sustainable development.</jats:p>"

Data on the variables for the study were collected from the archives of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and analyzed using both descriptive such as mean, maximum and minimum with trend graphs and inferential statistics such as Growth model and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Findings of the study revealed that supply of wheat in Nigeria within the study period ranges from 32,600 tons to 169,961 tons with mean of 79609.97 tons. Wheat demand ranges between 427575 tons and 8142811 tons with a mean of 4153978 tons during the period of study. However, the demand has not been met as there is a widening demand-supply gap of 99%, indicating that demand of wheat has a higher growth rate than supply. The result further revealed a stagnating instantaneous growth rate (IGR) of 9.2% for demand and a decelerating IGR of 1.4% for supply but an accelerating IGR of 9.4% for the wheat demand-supply gap. The study also forecasted an increase in demand from 8078642.57 tons in 2021 to 10002488.59 tons in 2030 and wheat supply increase from 40306.22 tons in 2021 to 94707.54 tons in 2030. The demand-supply gap will consequently increase from 7860173.39 tons in 2021 to 9628172.33 tons in 2030. Consequently, the study recommended that Government and other players in the sub-sector should encourage the high production of wheat in the country to boast domestic supply so as to reduce the wheat demand-supply gap.</jats:p>"

In order to address the current problems of water supply systems, such as high energy consumption and low efficiency of the pump station operation, large fluctuations of liquid levels of the clean water reservoirs, and poor response and adaptability to disturbance events, a digital twin (DT)-based full-process dynamic pump station scheduling method for energy-saving optimization in water purification plants was proposed in this study. To be specific, the DT technology was introduced to monitor production disturbance in real time, trigger the rescheduling process in time, and make a fast response to disturbance events during production, so as to provide technical and methodological support for unattended pump stations. The results of experiments revealed that an average energy-saving rate of 9.78% could be achieved by using the proposed method on the premise of ensuring the full-process dynamic water balance. In addition, the method could maintain high efficiency during the operation of the pumps, and guarantee the safety and stability of the pump stations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Australia’s tropical savannas are a vast landscape of grasslands with high biodiversity value. Effective biodiversity conservation in this landscape requires private contributions to complement the under-sized formal conservation estate. The landscape is dominated by rangelands, in particular extensive cattle grazing on pastoral stations which typically measure hundreds or thousands of square kilometers. The paper reports the results of a discrete–continuous (or “two-stage”) choice experiment conducted with savanna pastoralists. A discrete choice experiment explored the stated willingness to participate in two long-term conservation strategies: (i) total exclusion of cattle from designated parcels of land with management of that land for biodiversity, and (ii) the implementation of rotational grazing systems governed by the requirements of biodiversity, among other contractual attributes. An extension question asked about the area that respondents were willing to supply and a contract they were willing to accept. Double-hurdle (type II tobit) modelling was used for combined data analysis. The results show that potential participation in voluntary conservation contracts by pastoralists is primarily influenced by contract attributes, namely, the conservation action required, the stewardship payment received, contract length and whether the contract contains flexibility provisions. Land productivity is also significant. The level of stewardship payment required to incentivize participation in the conservation of grasslands is in line with opportunity costs, in particular option value. The amount of land that pastoralists are willing to supply is determined by the conservation payment as well as farm size and intrinsic motivation. This research illustrates strategies for integrating biodiversity conservation into cattle grazing operations in Australia’s tropical savannas, which are applicable to grasslands globally. It provides data of an economic nature to inform the development of multi-tenure biodiversity conservation strategies.</jats:p>"

Maritime shipping firms, the backbone of global supply chains, are particularly affected by this volatility. In response, these firms have pursued two strategies. First, they have acquired tangible assets to increase their capacity. These assets, however, are neither easily re‐deployable to other uses nor quickly adjustable, preventing firms from flexibly matching supply and demand. Second, these firms have pursued global supply chain integration by acquiring similar firms or firms in their upstream or downstream supply chain to diversify into other supply chain activities. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some firms have successfully pursued these strategies, but others have failed, eventually exiting the market. We posit that one explanation for this difference may be how effectively these firms manage their assets relative to their supply chain integration activities. We test this proposition by drawing from resource‐based theory and transaction cost economics and using longitudinal data for 148 maritime shipping firms. We also test post hoc whether typically acquired supply chain activities are beneficial. Our findings offer insights into asset management and global supply chain integration and offer advice to practitioners.</jats:p>",

The scheme of the construction of a typical \"green\" roof and its classification in terms of types are shown. The proposal to increase the efficiency of stormwater management with the help of \"green\" roofs, through their integration with other systems, that is, the creation and implementation of \"hybrid green roofs\" (Hybrid Green Roofs), is substantiated. The possibility of a \"blue\" roof as a rainwater management technology without vegetation, which allows for effective retention of rainwater, is analyzed. The design scheme and principle of operation of the \"green-blue\" roof are given, and a comparative analysis of its effectiveness in stormwater management with traditional and \"green\" roofs is made. The results of research are presented, which showed that the measured runoff of rainwater from a \"blue\" roof is about 0.45 dm3/s compared to a regular roof with a runoff volume of 1.55 dm3/s. On the other hand, the runoff from the \"green-blue\" roof is about 0.1 dm3/s, compared to the control roof (0.3 dm3/s). It is substantiated that a \"green-blue\" roof is more effective in retaining rain runoff during long-term precipitation than a \"blue\" roof. However, both options can be applied to urban buildings as effective methods of managing stormwater runoff in urban areas. The scheme of construction and the principle of operation of the \"purple\" roof is given - as a type of roof that includes a spongy layer of hydrophilic mineral wool, a dense layer of polyester fabric, and can include an additional cellular layer to increase the amount of rainwater that can be retained, thereby reducing peak flow up to 95%. The results of the study are presented, which confirm the technical feasibility of the \"purple\" roof technology in terms of slowing down the flow and reducing the volume of storm water during rainfall of various intensities. A \"Purple\" roof, based on the concept of \"storage\", is conceptually and technically different from a \"green\" roof and can effectively delay peak rainfall, thereby reducing the pressure on the local stormwater management system. Unlike a \"green-blue\" roof, a \"purple\" roof is passive in nature - water flows off without any mechanical drainage points to divert the water. A diagram characterizing the degree of retention of rainwater, depending on the intensity of precipitation, by different types of roofs is presented. The authors proposed a comparative analysis of rainwater runoff management using traditional roofs, \"green\" roofs, and roofs modified with other \"green\" roof systems.</jats:p>"

In this paper we study the case of a central bank that ignores the presence of hysteresis when identifying shocks. By assuming that all low frequency output fluctuations are driven by permanent technology shocks, monetary policy is not aggressive enough in response to demand shocks. In addition, we show that errors in assessing the state of the economy can be self-perpetuating if seen through the lens of the mistaken views of the policymaker. We show that a central bank that mistakes a demand shock for a supply shock, will produce permanent effects on output through their suboptimal policies. Ex-post, the central bank will see an economy that resembles what they had forecast when designing their policies. The shock is indeed persistent and this persistence validates their assumption that the shock was a supply-driven one. The interaction between forecasts, policies and hysteresis creates the dynamics of self-perpetuating errors that is the focus of this paper.</jats:p>"

The sample includes businesses that were listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) between 2016 and 2020. The study compared 64 firms in the agro-industry with 668 firms from all SET industries. The annual financial report (Form 56-1) and data from the SETSMART database were mined for source data. Though the multiple regression study found a substantial positive relationship between SCF and firm performance for the agro-industry, it was not consistent across all other industries. The results revealed a significant positive relationship between SCF and firm performance.

It is noted that although the share of RES continues to grow and the photovoltaic industry is developing rapidly, the industry still faces many challenges, in particular, how to continue to reduce the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), improve the efficiency of operation and maintenance, and maintain the stability of the power grid, to ensure system security. The effective implementation of solar generation requires an analysis of the prospects for the development of local electric power systems that include SPP, the development of mechanisms and appropriate regulatory, methodological, technical and organizational support that will contribute to the effective development of solar generation, the construction of modern system (schematic) solutions.&#x0D;\nThe analysis of the features of the development of green generation in Poland and Ukraine was carried out, the positive factors that influenced the development of renewable energy sources in Ukraine were determined, which made it possible to form the technical, economic and organizational conditions for the successful development of solar generation, in particular, information was provided on new players in developed energy markets according to the Fourth Energy EU package. The analysis showed that when increasing the efficiency of SPP systems, planning and demand management in the electric network, effective functioning of Energy Smart Community (ESC) become important.&#x0D;\nThe basic components of the effective functioning of electric power systems with SPP are highlighted, namely: concepts of configurations of photovoltaic systems, Smart-inverters, Energy Storage System (ESS), formation of Virtual Power Plant (VPP) based on SPP. It is shown that each of the four concepts involves the connection of a series of photovoltaic panels or strings and power electronics devices (DC converters and inverters), which are configured taking into account the peculiarities of the functioning of various structural (schematic) solutions. The advantages of using Smart-inverters as a new technology that can help integrate solar energy and other distributed energy resources into the electrical network are evaluated. Smart inverters are used to help the electrical grid cope with intermittent generation, helping the electrical grid remain stable and maintain voltage and frequency requirements.&#x0D;\nIt was determined that in any photovoltaic system, the ESS itself becomes a central component that significantly affects the cost, maintenance requirements, reliability and design of the SPP, and the important parameters of the ESS that affect the operation and performance of the photovoltaic system are the battery maintenance requirements, battery life, available power and efficiency. Trends in the market of advanced energy storage systems for SPPs for the next decade are presented. The functioning of virtual power plants based on SPP, as a network of aggregated distributed energy resources that are remotely connected and work together with flexible electricity consumers, is aimed at maximizing the benefits of participants. The possibilities and trends of SPP development in the near future, which are based on the research of Huawei, are presented.</jats:p>"

Distributed power sources (DG) have the advantages of low carbon and environmental protection, flexible control, and low investment cost, but their nodes in the grid are random, which will increase the complexity and uncertainty of grid operation after grid connection. In this paper, we study the planning path of DGs in distribution networks and the protection technologies involved. Firstly, we focus on the impact of DG access on the protection of distribution networks and the impact of different access capacities and access locations of DG on the protection of distribution networks. Second, after studying the current status of the application of traditional genetic algorithms in distribution network fault location, a two-layer planning model based on the modified extreme learning machine algorithm (MPSO-ELM) is proposed, with the load demand guaranteed by the first layer of power allocation and the fault location incorporated into the distribution network protection scheme in the second layer. Finally, simulations are performed to compare and demonstrate the advantages of this MPSO-ELM algorithm. The simulation results show that the MPSOELM algorithm converges faster than the traditional genetic algorithm by 7s, the average operating speed of power nodes is 3.61ms faster than the traditional genetic algorithm by 5.59ms, and the accuracy in fault location is improved by 23.14%. The simulation results verify the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and high efficiency of the ELM algorithm for double-layer planning of distribution networks containing distributed power supplies, which is important for improving the level of power grid construction and avoiding the risk of power grid construction.</jats:p>",

The move away from fossil fuels is associated with a variety of technological, economic, and social implications, each of which is subject to dynamic changes and societal scrutiny and can hardly be predicted with certainty. Therefore, a fact-based assessment for the path to a sustainable green energy future is sought out in this paper, using the road-based mobility sector of the Federal Republic of Germany as an example. The analysis performed in this paper is built on publicly accessible, reputable sources like DESTATIS and EUROSTAT. In addition, some very simple calculations were made, e.g., on the potential for wind and photovoltaic energy within Germany. Such an analysis needs to start with the overall energy consumption of any one country. A basic assumption of the paper is that the energy system of the future will be based to a large extent on electricity and its storage in chemical energy. It is assumed that, in addition to hydrogen, liquid energy sources will play a significant role due to the simplicity of their logistics and the subsequent implications on cost. Examples of green, electricity-based fuels with great potential are methanol, methane, and ammonia. Additionally, biomass plays an important role, either for direct use as a fuel or as a source of non-fossil carbon. Today, biofuels, i.e., biodiesel and bioethanol, deliver the largest contribution to climate protection in the EU transport sector. The main goal—the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions—often collides with geopolitical circumstances or national political necessities. This includes, for example, the current world market situation and its national impacts caused by the Russian attack on Ukraine. The prospect for a green, sustainable, and defossilized energy supply are discussed in this context. The paper concludes that a defossilized world energy supply and trade based on renewable electricity and its derivatives, eHydrogen and refuels, and on biomass, is feasible.</jats:p>"

It has attracted significant investments in commercial practices, especially in the luxury industry. With the recent upgradation of consumption worldwide, consumers care more about the source of information and the value of products. Will tracing products using blockchain technology help competing luxury brands gain consumer trust and cultivate new competitive advantages? This paper proposes a supply chain model comprising two competing manufacturers selling online through retail or direct channels. It also explores whether and how manufacturers implement traceability strategies, including building traceability systems or joining third‐party blockchain platforms, considering blockchain's traceability. The results show that, when only one party adopts the traceability strategy, being the first mover to join a third‐party blockchain platform with high traceability is always beneficial for improving the profits of all parties. In this scenario, the blockchain platform should adopt as high traceability as possible. When both parties choose to trace the product source, a win–win strategy for them is to join third‐party blockchain platforms with low traceability. In this scenario, the untraced party is motivated to implement a traceability strategy. Furthermore, if consumer perceptions of traceability are high, an untraced manufacturer can obtain higher profits using the traceability strategy. Otherwise, low consumer perception of traceability leads to low‐price competition, which is harmful to luxury brands.</jats:p>",

Pump operation essentially depends on properties of the lubricating and cooling fluid, in particular, on its viscosity affecting the flow, pressure and energy costs. The paper propose an algorithm for determining the pump hydraulic characteristics, when supplying the lubricating and cooling fluid. As an example, the submersible vertical centrifugal pumps were considered designed for using in the machines cooling systems and systems supplying the lubricating and cooling fluid. Empirical dependences are presented of the pump head, consumed power, efficiency and indicator of the specific energy cost on the water supply. The obtained dependences were recalculated for the pump operating conditions with liquids, which viscosity was much higher than that of water.

Design/Methodology/Approach: This study employs a survey methodology with data collected from hotels in India. A structural equation modelling using warp partial least squares method (SEM) is used for data analysis and to test the hypotheses of the research model. Research findings: The results of the study indicate that the three antecedents have a positive impact on environment sustainability, which in turn positively influence the competitiveness of the hotels. Theoretical contribution/Originality: The study identifies the three GSCM antecedents that will impact environmental sustainability and organisational competitiveness, i.e., eco-friendly products, green internal environment and green management policy. Practitioner/Policy implications: The hotel industry has begun to recognise that going green can result in higher initial costs, but can lower overall operating costs. The findings of the study indicate that the three green factors identified in the upstream, midstream and downstream of the hotel supply chain are necessary for hotels to survive in the long run. Research limitation: The study can be expanded to restaurants and fast food chains in other parts of the country to measure the adoption of green practices. As more hotels and restaurants spring up in developing countries, more research in green practices along the entire supply chain is essential to for environmental preservation.</jats:p>"

The combination of these two markers could be a potential marker for balance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Therefore, we hypothesized that the balance of these two markers may lead to myocardial damage in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients who is susceptible to vulnerable heart in oxygen balance.

The patients were divided four groups according to the high or low of Hb level of 9 g/dL and DP 12500, a median of our patients, and named low-DP/high-Hb; G1, low-DP/low-Hb; G2, high-DP/high-Hb; G3, and high-DP/low-Hb; G4. The patients with G1 group were defined as a well oxygen balanced group, whereas those with G4 was defined as an imbalance of oxygen supply and demand group.

Median cTnT was 0.083 (25% tile 0.057 and 75% tile 0.13), and 20.4% of patients were defined as suffering from myocardial injury latently. In the adjusted model, the odds for myocardial injury was significantly increasing in high-DP compared with low-DP (OR: 1.87, p = 0.049), while low-Hb did not show significant increment of odds for myocardial injury compared with high-Hb.

This paper constructs a low-carbon dual channel supply chain composed of one manufacturer and one retailer. The manufacturer produces low-carbon product and high carbon product with substitution relationship. The retailer sells high carbon product in traditional channel. The manufacturer also sells low-carbon product in direct channel. The government, manufacturer and retailer conduct a three-level Stackelberg game. This paper studies the optimal decisions of the government, manufacturer and retailer under the three modes of carbon tax + subsidy, carbon tax only and subsidy only. It has been found that for social welfare, the carbon tax + subsidy model is higher than the subsidy model and carbon tax model. For manufacturer profit, the subsidy mode is the highest, followed by the carbon tax + subsidy mode. For retailer profit, the carbon tax + subsidy model is equal to the carbon tax model. The increase in the proportion of consumers who prefer high carbon product in the total market or product cost of low-carbon product, will increase the profit of traditional channel and reduce the profit of direct channel.</jats:p>"

The findings of this study confirmed the direct effect of supply chain collaboration on the intention to use the blockchain and the partial mediation effect of perceived usefulness is revealed. There are few studies on supply chain collaboration, blockchain use, and perceived usefulness in developing countries like Pakistan's textile industry, especially among middle-level employees. Existing scholarship ignores emerging countries' textile sectors and extends results to other industries. The insights also help managers create blockchain-integrated supply chain strategies. Blockchain technology may be maximized via technology providers and industry-wide cooperation. These practical consequences may improve developing nations' textile supply chains' efficiency, transparency, and competitiveness.

In many instances, the companies supplying water to these households maintain header pressure between the maximum and minimum as a guarantee for the water to reach the consumers. This paper is, therefore, aimed at investigating the potential of this pressure in driving turbines for power generation so that the energy could be stored in rechargeable batteries which can be utilized whenever needed. Two sets of experimental setups were developed with turbines arranged both in series and parallel. The experiments were conducted using three working pressures, such as 1.5, 3.2 and 5 bar. It was observed that the turbine mainly depends on the water flow rate, where the higher flow rate is achieved in working pressure of 5 bar which is 33 LPM and 6 Watt generated. The power produced was increased to 12 W with a slight pressure drop of 0.1 bar after the second turbine. However, the drop in pressure was observed to be slightly higher for the lower working pressure. The turbine cut-off pressure was 0.4 bar. Moreover, it was also evidenced that arranging the turbines in parallel has also resulted in an enhanced power generation.</jats:p>"

Electrical equipment installed in an aerodrome is more sensitive and prone to disturbance present at the power supply end. This study provides results of a theoretical power flow study, power quality monitoring, quality analysis, and probable remedies for power quality issues in an aerodrome electrical supply system in Nepal. Power quality measurement for supply from the utility here, Nepal Electricity Authority, and internal power generations in Gautam Buddha International Airport (GBIA) Siddharthanagar, Rupandehi, Nepal is performed by using theoretical load flow approach and continuous monitoring using a power data analyzer. The scope and origin of various disturbances which may induce power quality issues are analyzed. It is observed that the power supply at GBIA has voltage fluctuations of about ±12% and total voltage harmonic distortion of 6.5% with the presence of negative and zero sequence components. A remedial solution for the power quality problem is proposed for future enhancement of the electrical supply system at GBIA.</jats:p>"

In order to reduce CEs and environmental hazards, this paper constructs a Stackelberg game model to explore the evolution of carbon emissions reduction (CER) and recycling strategies in the construction material supply chain (CMSC) under the carbon cap–trade (C&amp;T) mechanism. The monotonicity analysis on important variables and model comparison simulation are then conducted. The results show the following: (1) A contractor’s green preference positively correlates with the CER level and recycling rate, while the CER cost exerts the opposite effect. (2) The C&amp;T mechanism incentivizes low-emission manufacturers to actively participate in CER. However, excessive carbon trading prices may put high-emitters in a dilemma, making the whole supply chain profitless. (3) The recycler’s decision to recycle C&amp;DW tends to follow the manufacturer’s CER decision. These findings not only help policy makers understand stakeholders’ behavior in CMSC under C&amp;T mechanism, but also provide a basis for the government to formulate CER policies and introduce low-carbon management.</jats:p>"

A manufacturer performs the encroachment by selling products through offline retail and direct online channels. It also provides an extended warranty service with the product sold in both channels. This study identifies the best pricing and extended warranty strategies as decision variables to maximize profits for the dual-channel supply chain under the demand substitution effect. Despite the centralized scenario, a decision-making model in the decentralized scenario is also developed using Stackelberg’s game to determine optimal decision variables. The results demonstrate that the centralized scenario consistently outperforms the decentralized scenario. Thus, coordination contracts are proposed considering the profit structure, revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contracts to coordinate and promote a win-win situation for supply chain members. Furthermore, demand substitution effects are investigated for channel parameters represented in the initial market size, price sensitivity coefficient, and warranty length sensitivity coefficient on optimal decision variables. From the sensitivity analysis, these parameters have a different substitution effect on the optimal decision in each channel. The price and extended warranty length offered in a dual channel positively correlate with the market size and warranty length sensitivity coefficient of the corresponding channel. However, they negatively correlate with the price sensitivity coefficient. Accordingly, a similar situation occurs for the profit of each channel. Last, the discussion supports the theoretical results and generates managerial insights for practical decision-making</jats:p>"

The switching method used is SPWM with H-Bridge configuration which is controlled by 2 IC IR2103. Based on the test results, the output voltage of this inverter is 7.45 Volts. With a DC voltage of 12 Volts. With the use of an oscilloscope that is used to measure the output waveform from the switching results of the MOSFET, the signal is still in the form of a square wave. To make a sine wave, an inductor filter is needed which functions to produce a signal to become a sine wave, and to keep the frequency at 50Hz. The voltage generated from the step-up transformer can be adjusted by rotating the feedback trimpot. The resulting voltage is 88 Vac to 260 Vac. and can accommodate a maximum load of 250 Watts.

The author of this study examined 70 publications from 2012 to 2022 within the scope of the subject and analyzed the factors responsible for interruptions and prevention techniques used to curb the interruption of electricity supply. The results revealed that human factors, technological factors, and atmospheric &amp; environmental factors have impacts on the interruption of electricity supply. Further, the study found that most of the publications on the subject were case studies (74%), while the remaining studies comprised Quantitative studies (19%), Qualitative studies (7%), and 0% for mixed studies research. It was also revealed that technological, human, atmospheric, and environmental factors are more responsible for electricity supply interruptions in developing countries than in developed countries. The results imply that electricity network designers need to mitigate electricity interruptions by employing modern techniques. The study recommends that alternative electricity supply sources could be used to help reduce interruptions, especially using other renewable energy sources like solar electrification systems and generators as backup or supplementary systems to enhance the electricity supply.</jats:p>"

Our goal is to evaluate two lot-sizing policies and select the one that optimizes the supply chain by minimizing the total cost and maximizing supplier efficiency. A bi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (BOMINLP) model is proposed. The first objective consists of the development of a coordination mechanism for supplier selection and order allocation that minimizes the entire supply chain cost, and the second objective comprises a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to evaluate the overall performance of suppliers to optimize supplier efficiency. Then, the lot-for-lot and order frequency policies are applied to the BOMINLP model separately to determine the set of selected suppliers as well as the corresponding order quantities and number of orders allocated to each selected supplier per replenishment cycle. Numerical examples that illustrate the solution approach and compare the two lot-sizing policies are provided.</jats:p>"

This paper explores the intricate intersections of these disciplines and their profound implications for ethical supply chain management. The convergence of diplomatic negotiation strategies with theological principles results in a visionary approach that addresses the moral complexities of supply chains while fostering collaborative relationships, responsible practices, and lasting positive impacts. The paper first delves into the fundamentals of diplomatic management and its relevance to ethical supply chains. It examines how negotiation techniques grounded in mutual respect, compromise, and dialogue can transcend traditional transactional models, paving the way for equitable collaborations that encompass cultural diversity and shared value creation. The integration of theological ethics further enriches this approach, embedding moral imperatives into negotiations and emphasizing values such as justice, compassion, and stewardship. Building upon this foundation, the paper explores the practical applications of diplomatic management and theological ethics in supply chain management. It delves into case studies that exemplify how these principles can guide decision-making, strengthen partnerships, and navigate ethical challenges in complex global supply networks. Moreover, the paper underscores the potential benefits of this integrated framework, such as enhanced reputation, increased consumer loyalty, and the promotion of international cooperation. The paper also envisions the future landscape shaped by ethical supply chains guided by diplomatic management and theological ethics. It underscores the significance of this approach in reshaping industries, influencing consumer behavior, and cultivating a global culture that values responsible practices. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the role of education, advocacy, and leadership in driving the adoption of this framework, as well as the challenges and strategies associated with measuring its impact and fostering a culture of ethical resilience. Illuminates the transformative potential of integrating diplomatic management and theological ethics in ethical supply chains. By merging the principles of diplomacy, theology, and ethics, organizations can forge a path toward sustainable business practices that prioritize human dignity, environmental stewardship, and societal well-being. As industries, leaders, and consumers align their values with this visionary approach, they contribute to a future where ethical considerations are woven into the fabric of global supply chain practices, shaping a more harmonious and responsible world.</jats:p>"

It analyzes upstream and downstream industry market status data in the supply chain and various primary data in enterprise management activities. By utilizing the Delphi method to screen and verify multimode market status data indicators, which significantly impact upstream and downstream industries in multiple rounds, 28 types of market status data were selected for analysis. This analysis aimed to investigate the effect of supply chain management on operational decisions within the company. The data reduction method based on adaptive statistics was the most effective in revealing the market status and promoting efficient operation decision-making based on supply chain management. This study also suggests a brand-new technique for measuring supply chain performance based on the Levenberg-Marquardt Back Propagation (LMBP) algorithm, offering a more impartial manner of doing so. The performance evaluation results showed a maximum error level of less than 0.4% when paired with empirical analysis. The proposed optimization model provides strategic guidance for optimizing supply chain management and improving overall performance.</jats:p>"

Schott) are unknown. The problem lies in the lack of studies on the competitiveness of the taro supply chain and associated factors. The factors associated with the competitiveness of the taro supply chain were determined. Competitiveness was operationalized in three factors: production management (GP), administrative management (GA) and business performance (DE). A questionnaire was applied to 47 actors involved in the supply chain. A significant correlation (P &lt;0.05, bilateral) was found for the factors GP (0.845 **), GA (0.756 **) and DE (0.717 **) and the variables related to competitiveness were: proximity to importing countries and ability to high yields. The general competitiveness value was 6.3. The factors that most affect competitiveness are non-economic, such as production capacity, demand estimation, flexibility and sales planning. The economic factors that the agents in the chain cannot control at all are: production costs, distribution and international prices. It is concluded that there are three factors involved in the taro supply chain that provide competitive advantages.</jats:p>"

The managerial insight for fish processing industries to increase profit and reduce carbon emission in production, transportation, and warehouse. A sensitivity analysis is illustrated to show that the supply of raw fish, selling prices, and purchasing costs are sensitive to total profit, carbon emissions, and job opportunities. The results show that the total profit for five months is IDR 21,779,378,445 and the largest contribution to the total cost is the costs of purchasing, emission costs, and production costs, which are 44.04%; 23.7%; and 18.2%, respectively.</jats:p>"

During that time frame, existing infrastructure, logistics, and involved materials were at risk of being stolen or by being destroyed due to direct combat damage or resulting fires. Established food transportation routes suffered from blockades, destruction, or congestion. Switching modes of transport for crop grains proved difficult with the absence of required transport and logistics support. The switch to vegetable oil transport proved harder still. Meanwhile, the re-established naval transportation shed a spotlight on GIS instruments that became critical for the safety of regional food supply chain. This inspired the idea of implementing methods of assessing the safety of transport facilities with the direct participation of the user based on geographic information. These methods can be key in enabling new export routes as part of a stable grain supply chain, supporting logistics behind constructing pipelines for transportation of vegetable oils. As the food safety of the world depends on new export routes, ensuring their efficiency and security will always remain relevant.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The integration of predictive analytics into energy supply chain management is increasingly recognized as a crucial tool for mitigating risks and ensuring operational efficiency. Energy supply chains face numerous challenges, including supply disruptions, fluctuating demand, price volatility, and environmental concerns, which can impact both short-term operations and long-term sustainability. Predictive analytics, leveraging data-driven insights, machine learning algorithms, and statistical models, offers a proactive approach to addressing these challenges by forecasting potential risks and enabling timely interventions. This framework focuses on the application of predictive analytics to identify, assess, and mitigate risks in energy supply chains. Key components of the framework include data collection, analysis of historical trends, real-time monitoring, and forecasting of potential disruptions. By analyzing large datasets from various sources such as market trends, weather patterns, geopolitical factors, and production data, predictive analytics can forecast risks related to energy production, transportation, and consumption, thereby providing valuable insights into potential bottlenecks, price fluctuations, and demand-supply imbalances. One of the primary advantages of predictive analytics in energy supply chains is its ability to improve decision-making and resource allocation. It enhances risk management by allowing organizations to anticipate and prepare for disruptions before they occur, reducing operational downtime and ensuring a more resilient supply chain. Additionally, predictive models help optimize inventory management, demand forecasting, and supplier relationships, contributing to cost reduction and improved overall efficiency. Despite its potential, the adoption of predictive analytics in energy supply chains faces challenges, such as data quality, technological infrastructure, and the need for skilled professionals to interpret and act on predictive insights. This paper explores these barriers and outlines strategies to overcome them, ensuring the effective implementation of predictive analytics. Ultimately, the framework presented aims to foster a more agile, resilient, and efficient energy supply chain, capable of adapting to emerging risks and contributing to the long-term sustainability of the energy sector.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Solar energy is presented as the main alternative to conventional energy sources that often rely on burning fossil fuels. However, one major obstacle to its wider adoption is the limited ability to store the energy produced that can only be generated for a few hours daily. One way to overcome this limitation is using photovoltaic energy to power urban water supply pumps. This allows the energy to be stored as potential energy in regulating reservoirs while also taking advantage of the temporal coincidence between the generation of solar energy and the daily and annual water and energy supply consumption. Given that implementing solar energy in pumping devices involves an enormous investment, the optimal payback period is identified as the key indicator to know which population is one in which this action is more advisable. This work aims to find the key factors influencing the payback period of solar photovoltaic installation in urban water supply networks. To accomplish this goal, this study analyzes all 20 municipalities in the province of Alicante (which consume groundwater) where these systems can be implemented. Furthermore, this study facilitates the identification of variables that influence the decision to install a solar photovoltaic system in an urban water supply. By measuring two or three parameters, it becomes possible to easily determine the economic viability of such an investment in towns supplied with groundwater. Furthermore, these results can be extrapolated to other municipalities with similar features (irradiance, inhabitants, etc.). This study also presents a straightforward formula that supply managers can utilize to calculate the payback period of the installation using readily available data. The main factors that affect the recovery period of a photovoltaic solar installation are the difference in monthly supply consumption between winter and summer months and the average water depth.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is important for every supply chain and the companies that are involved in them to reduce these negative outcomes. In this context, the term Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) stands for the level of adaptability of a supply chain to respond to and recover from disruptions. A high SCR is given if re-maintaining operational continuity is quickly possible. As an example of unexpected disruptions, the COVID19-crisis showed major impacts on the functionality of global supply chains. The upcoming technologies of industrial Digitalization, mainly known as Industry 4.0, provide opportunities to increase SCR. In this paper, first a brief overview of different surveys is given to show the COVID19-impact on global supply chains and therefore prove the need to generally increase SCR. Second, an insight of how especially Digitalization may help to increase SCR is provided. Especially improving the data base for all supply chain partners, faster and more precise decision-making processes, including the use of Artificial Intelligence, are described. Finally, positive chances and major challenges of using Digitalization to increase SCR are addressed.</jats:p>"

By modelling and simulating the implementation of the policy, we explore how operations and decisions at the local authorities’ and potential applicants’ level (micro-foundations) explain emerging patterns of funds’ absorption at a regional level (macro-behaviours). Building upon a mixed-methods approach combining field research and computer simulation, we develop a model capturing the key cause–effect relationships among agents and resources within the Cohesion Policy supply-and-demand system.

Inspired by the strong perception and decision-making abilities of deep reinforcement learning, this paper proposes a cold-start control strategy for a gas supply system based on the MADDPG algorithm, and designs an air supply controller and a hydrogen supply controller based on this algorithm. The proposed strategy can optimize the control parameters of the gas supply system in real time according to the temperature rise rate of the stack during the cold-start process, the fluctuation of the OER, and the voltage output characteristics. After the strategy is trained offline according to the designed reward function, the detailed in-loop simulation experiment results are given and compared with the traditional control strategy for the gas supply system. From the results, it can be seen that the proposed MADDPG control strategy has a more effective coordination control effect.</jats:p>"

First, in order to analyze the dynamic branch of the piezoelectric transducer, we propose an improved LC matching network, in which three voltage RMS values are used to analyze the dynamic branch and discriminate the series resonant frequency. Further, the driving power system is designed using the three RMS voltage values as feedback. A fuzzy control method is used for frequency tracking. The double closed-loop control method of the power outer loop and the current inner loop is used for power regulation. Through MATLAB software simulation and experimental testing, it is verified that the power supply can effectively track the series resonant frequency and control the power while being continuously adjustable.

Furthermore, silicon (Si) is known to alleviate many nutritional stresses but the effects of Si supply on plants subjected to S deficiency remain unclear and poorly documented. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether Si supply would alleviate the negative effects of S deprivation on root nodulation and atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) fixation capacity in Trifolium incarnatum subjected (or not) to long-term S deficiency. For this, plants were grown for 63 days in hydroponic conditions with (500 µM) or without S and supplied (1.7 mM) or not with Si. The effects of Si on growth, root nodulation and N2 fixation and nitrogenase abundance in nodules have been measured. The most important beneficial effect of Si was observed after 63 days. Indeed, at this harvest time, a Si supply increased growth, the nitrogenase abundance in nodules and N2 fixation in S-fed and S-deprived plants while a beneficial effect on the number and total biomass of nodules was only observed in S-deprived plants. This study shows clearly for the first time that a Si supply alleviates negative effects of S deprivation in Trifolium incarnatum.</jats:p>"

Laboratory trials were conducted on the effects of flow rate, initial pH, current density, and supporting electrolytes for defluoridation and disinfection processes. The results have shown that with a flow rate of 10 L/h, initial pH of 6, the current density of 9.4 mA/cm2 (EC cell) and 3.1 mA/cm2 (ECl2 cell), supporting electrolyte concentration of 165 mg/L, and electrolysis time of 50 min, a defluoridation rate of 88% (initial concentration of 12.3 mg/L) and complete disinfection (initial fecal coliforms of 19,700 colony-forming units per 100 mL (CFU/100 mL)) can be reached. The final concentration of fluoride and pathogens in treated water was 1.44 mg/L and 0 CFU/100 mL, which are within the acceptable limit of the World Health Organization and the Tanzania Bureau of Standards of 1.5 mg/L and 0 CFU/100 mL, respectively. The EC–ECl2 system is a promising approach for consecutive defluoridation and disinfection of water to save millions from fluorosis and waterborne diseases.

The country's peak dispatch power stands at 5,552.8 MW against estimated demand of about 98,000MW thus stifling socio-economic activities with attendant adverse effect on economic growth. The absence of effective integrated resource planning was identified as a major cause of the low level of power supply in Nigeria as available energy resources have not been optimally harnessed. Using a future scenario approach, this chapter developed plausible scenarios for Nigeria's power supply by the Year 2050 based on a predictive model of seven per cent (moderate growth), ten per cent (high growth) and 13 per cent (optimistic growth) used in analyzing the impact of energy growth on Nigeria's economy. This led to the generation of scenario-based strategies including the optimal diversification of electricity generation mix and restructuring of the power grid system in Nigeria.</jats:p>",

The aim of the study was to ascertain if Road Freight Transport Sector in Zimbabwe respected the value of time aspect in their operations. Value of time is a sound principle that strategically propels the business into the future. Literature highly recommends the value of time concept for business success as a key to customer satisfaction and an international best practice. This was a quantitative study of the road freight transport sector across Zimbabwe with a population of 1256 registered companies and a randomly picked sample size of 384. A total of 384 questionnaires were distributed and 291 were retrieved, giving a response rate of 75.6%. The study findings indicate that value positively influence firm competitiveness. This implies that travel time and reliability influences company’s reputation, profitability, customer satisfaction and market share. Several empirical studies have reached similar findings (Chi, King-lok, Steven, 2012; Song et al, Gitae, 2017) that value of time has positive impact on firm competitiveness. Study also found that all the registered companies that took part in the research confirmed that the value of time phenomenon was alien to their business practices as they worked on assumptions. They also indicated a loss of business due to customer complaints. The study recommends policy formulation for companies that emphasizes standard operating procedures and good time management for firms to be competitive. The study results and interpretation show that value of time positively influences firm competitiveness. Results imply that if firms in the road freight sector conduct regulars servicing of their fleet, train their employees, plan routes properly, respond to their customers and manage risks there can remain competitive.</jats:p>"

Hence, this paper aims to provide empirical evidence on the effects of the dimensions of food security and their impacts on the food supply chain in the context of households in Malaysia. This research primarily focuses on individuals as the unit of analysis, and 498 households in the Klang Valley, Malaysia, were invited to take part in the survey. Subsequently, out of the invited households, 350 responses were received and considered valid for data analysis. The results of this study show that each of the hypotheses is true and that food security in the supply chain is affected by all four aspects of food security: how easy it is to get food, how much food is available, how it is used, and how stable it is. This study is one of the first to help partners in the food security supply chain better understand the effects of food security mechanisms. This will help consumers become more aware of the food security supply chain in the long run.</jats:p>",

Market price volatility, food scarcity, extreme weather, soaring price of raw materials are some risks that can disrupt the sustainability of the supply chain of egg productions. It is essentially important for smallholder farmers to incorporate risk management approach in their egg productions. This research employs a supply chain operational reference (SCOR) and house of risk (HOR) methodology to identify, assess and evaluate the inherent risk that lies on egg productions managed by smallholder farmers. HOR phase I were able to identify 25 risk events and 45 risk agents, while HOR phase II were able to identify 4 risk agents which represented 20% of ARP score. Finally, this research was able to propose 4 preventive actions (PA) to mitigate the risk of egg productions by smallholder farms.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Enterprises in the prefabricated building supply chain (PBSC) only share information according to their interests, which is bound to cause conflicts of interest and reduce the efficiency of supply chain operations. To promote information sharing (IS) in PBSC, it is necessary to construct an evolutionary game model that fits the realistic network. In this paper, based on the integration of existing research, 13 influencing factors of IS in PBSC are analyzed comprehensively from the perspective of information ecology theory. In addition, due to the complexity and uncertainty of the PBSC, enterprise interaction and supply chain network structure affect the IS decision. Therefore, this paper builds an evolutionary game model of IS in PBSC under a scale-free network, and conducts numerical simulation analysis with MATLAB 2017 software to analyze the evolution law of enterprise IS under different situations. The results show that (1) when the network scale is large, the density of information sharers generally increases, and the speed of network evolution to a steady state generally slows down; (2) eight factors can promote the increase in information sharers’ density, and five factors can inhibit it, but factors have no significant effect on the speed of network evolution to reach the steady state. Based on the simulation results, this paper proposes countermeasures and suggestions such as strengthening the support of the policy environment and social environment, setting up the demonstration benchmark of leading construction enterprises, establishing a directional information resource database, and improving information technologies and risk management systems to provide the scientific basis for government supervision and enterprise decision making.</jats:p>"

Moreover, globalization affected complexity and uncertainty, so many risks have arisen in surviving among rivals. Today, supply chain management became more difficult for recognizing the details and controlling the process. So, recognition and assessment of the risks in advance became vital to provide the continuity of the working processes of the company and not cause big losses. This study aims to minimize the damage that may occur by providing the risk assessment. For this purpose, a risk assessment methodology in which risks are determined via literature review and expert views is proposed. Afterwards, a new technique based on Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is utilized. Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process and Weighted Product are synergistically used within FMEA. Moreover, an application in a widely known fast-moving consumer goods company is performed to validate the proposed methodology.</jats:p>"

Among them, constructively changing the geometric parameters of the distribution pipelines or exhaust devices, giving the axis of the distribution pipeline an inclination to the horizon or the axis of the exhaust devices tilting relative to the axis of the distribution pipeline, changing the angle of the liquid entering the exhaust devices. In the manufactured experimental stand, there must be support in the hydraulic tray to ensure the flooded outflow of liquid from the outlet devices of the distribution pipeline. The presence of liquid support in the hydraulic tray should ensure a flooded outflow of liquid from the outlet devices of the distribution pipeline, and the absence of support - non-flooded outflow. The walls of the hydraulic tray and the distribution pipeline for studying the kinematic characteristics of the external and internal fluid flows, respectively, in the hydraulic tray and the distribution pipeline, and the liquid jete disconnected from the distribution pipeline must be transparent. The slope of the distribution pipeline can be changed relative to the bottom of the hydraulic tray. This achieves different branching angles of the jets to the free surface of the liquid in the hydraulic tray. Due to the design features of the hydraulic tray, the distribution pipeline should be sequential in structure, and not bifurcated. The method of carrying out a study of the flooded outflow of liquid from a pressure distribution pipeline laid in a non-pressure flow has been clarified. Preliminary results confirm the possibility of regulating the uneven distribution of liquid from the pressure distribution pipeline.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The integration of Blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into decentralized energy supply chain networks offers transformative potential for enhancing efficiency, security, and transparency. This paper explores the application of Blockchain and IoT in creating decentralized, resilient, and transparent energy supply chains. Blockchain's ability to provide secure, immutable, and transparent transaction records, combined with IoT’s real-time data collection and monitoring capabilities, enables the creation of a more efficient energy distribution system. In decentralized energy systems, energy producers, consumers, and other stakeholders can interact directly, bypassing traditional intermediaries, which reduces costs and increases operational transparency. Blockchain technology facilitates peer-to-peer energy trading, ensuring secure and transparent transactions between producers and consumers. This reduces the reliance on centralized grid systems and fosters the growth of microgrids, allowing local communities to generate, store, and trade energy autonomously. IoT devices further enhance this by enabling real-time monitoring of energy generation, storage, consumption, and distribution, ensuring optimal resource management and reducing waste. Through sensors and connected devices, IoT enables energy networks to operate with greater precision, responding in real-time to fluctuations in supply and demand. The combination of Blockchain and IoT also ensures the security of decentralized networks by preventing unauthorized access and cyberattacks, providing a robust framework for energy transactions. Additionally, these technologies support greater traceability and accountability, facilitating compliance with regulatory standards and sustainability goals. This paper discusses the benefits and challenges of implementing Blockchain and IoT in decentralized energy supply chains, including issues of scalability, integration, and regulatory hurdles. Moreover, it examines the future potential of these technologies in revolutionizing energy systems by promoting sustainability, reducing costs, and enhancing supply chain resilience. In conclusion, Blockchain and IoT hold immense promise in reshaping the energy supply chain by enabling decentralized, transparent, and efficient operations. This paper highlights their transformative role in enhancing the energy sector’s security, efficiency, and sustainability.</jats:p>"

We find that early‐posted positions are more likely to be filled and end up securing new hires that are better qualified, more effective, and more likely to remain at a school. In contrast, the number of applicants to a position is largely unassociated with hire quality, suggesting that schools may struggle to identify and select the best candidates even when there is a large pool of qualified applicants. These patterns persist even when we restrict comparisons to only positions within an individual school using school fixed effects.

The global drug supply chain is prone to disruptions associated with geopolitical issues, trade, civil unrest, severe weather, and pandemics, all of which have the potential to affect medication supply and result in drug shortages. To our knowledge, the extent to which the supply of antimicrobials is threated due to disruptions in the drug supply chain in the United States is unknown. We examined trends and duration of disruptions to the drug supply chain for antimicrobials. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Manufacturer reports of supply disruptions were extracted from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Society for Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP) websites and merged on the agent-formulation level. For each month of the study period, a drug was considered to have an active supply chain issue if an FDA or ASHP shortage or recall report overlapped with that month for ≥15 days, or if a discontinuation had occurred within the previous 3 months. Total months of supply chain issues were summed for antimicrobials overall, at the agent formulation , and class levels. A Mann-Kendall test was used to determine the significance of trends in supply-chain issues. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Of 105 antimicrobials purchased in the United States, 74 (70%) had a supply-chain issue for ≥1 month from January 15, 2017, to June 30, 2022. Combined, the 74 agents had 1,611 total months of supply-chain issues over the 66-month study period. Agents from the penicillin class were most frequently affected (ie, 80% of penicillins had supply-chain issues for 206 months), but cephalosporins had supply-chain issues for the longest duration (66% of cephalosporins for 653 months). From 2017–2021, supply-chain issues decreased significantly for penicillins and quinolones (tests of trend, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .01 and .02, respectively). No trend was identified for the other classes or antimicrobials overall. Interestingly, supply-chain issues for most classes did not increase with seasonal increases in antimicrobial use. Also, supply-chain issues affected 33 antimicrobial agents for at least half of the study period, and supply-chain issues affected ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefotetan, cefepime, clindamycin, vancomycin for 100% of the study period. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Drug supply-chain issues commonly affect antimicrobials and are not improving for most classes. Drug supply-chain issues cause significant strain on healthcare, including drug procurement, access to optimal therapy, and poses challenges to prescribing and antimicrobial stewardship. To decrease the threat to the antibacterial drug supply, action should be taken to strengthen the drug supply chain to ensure access to these essential medicines.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Disclosures:</jats:bold> None</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, electricity systems have been undergoing rapid renewable energy transitions. This has introduced myriad challenges, namely, matching variability in both supply and demand sides, low plant load factors, resource constraints, etc. Managing these challenges requires effective demand-side solutions. Therefore, demand response (DR) approaches become relevant and essential in better-performing supply- and demand-side planning and management. For this purpose, in this article, two scenarios representing different situations and needing different interventions are developed for future years to study the effectiveness of demand-side solutions in managing the adverse supply-side constraints through an optimization model. The two scenarios are (i) Demand Response in Constrained Electricity System and (ii) Demand Response in High Renewables Electricity System. The model results suggest that the optimization model is robust enough to achieve an optimal as well as desirable solutions for both scenarios and provide evidence for the effectiveness of DR in addressing such challenges. DR solutions, if implemented effectively, can alter and moderate load curves to achieve perfect balance with supply profiles that are affected by resource constraints or by high penetration of solar and wind energy resources. </jats:p>",

This study is based on the data sample composed of complete individual financial statements (audited if available) of firms conducting their business in the Czech Republic from 2011 to 2018 and belonging to the automotive supply chain. This supply chain is defined as (sub) deliveries of the Czech automotive industry represented mainly by companies classified under NACE 22, 27, 25, 24. The hypothesis claiming that the investment and leverage-based variables are the important drivers of operating profitability was only partly confirmed (valid predominantly for Tier 3), which shows that the supply chain organization also plays a crucial role as well as (valid for Tier 1). Also, we have shown (illustrated) that the assumption of different capital structures among tiers is valid. The average overall indebtedness of Tier 3 is higher by approximately 50% (altogether, the short- and long-term leverage are higher by 40% and 62% respectively) than Tier 1 firms. The need for relatively high capital expenditures (applicable to Tier 1) and working capital investments (applicable to Tier 3) is partly facilitated by external funds reflected in the indebtedness, which is associated with the costs reducing overall low profits from these investments. The leverageprofitability relationship seems to be nonlinear for long-term debts contrary to short-term debts where the linear relationship prevails.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The advanced manufacturing industry is located at the top of the manufacturing value chain. Its development is restricted by supply chain collaboration (SCC), the level of which is affected by many factors. Few studies comprehensively summarize what influences SCC and distinguish the impact level of each factor. Practitioners have difficulty isolating the primary factors that affect SCC and managing them effectively. Therefore, based on synergetics and the theory of comparative advantage, this study analyzes what influences SCC in the advanced manufacturing industry and how these influencing factors work, using data from 94 manufacturing enterprises and the Haken model to identify the influencing factors. The results show that China’s advanced manufacturing supply chain underwent a phase change and entered a new stage during 2017–2018. In the new stage, the competitive advantages of enterprises are one order parameter (slow variable) and are primary factors affecting SCC. The interest demands of enterprises are a fast variable and are secondary factors affecting SCC. The competitive advantages of enterprises dominate the interests of enterprises in affecting the collaboration level of China’s advanced manufacturing supply chain. In addition, in the process of influencing SCC, there is a positive correlation between the competitive advantages of enterprises and the interest demands of enterprises, and the two factors have a positive feedback mechanism. Finally, when the enterprises in the supply chain cooperate based on their differential advantages, the collaboration capability of the supply chain is at the highest level, and the overall operation of the supply chain is orderly. In terms of theoretical contribution, this study is the first to propose a collaborative motivation framework that conforms to the characteristics of sequential parameters, which provides a theoretical reference for subsequent studies on SCC. In addition, the theory of comparative advantage and synergetics are linked for the first time in this study, and both of them are enriched and developed. Equally importantly, this study compares the bidirectional influence between firms’ competitive advantages and firms’ interest demands and the ability of both to influence SCC, enriching previous validation studies of unidirectional influence. In terms of practical implications, this study guides top managers to focus on the management practice of collaborative innovation in the supply chain and advises purchasing managers and sales managers on selecting supply chain partnerships.</jats:p>"

The advantage of road transport is the direct transport from the sender to the recipient, faster, easier transportation resulting from technology, availability and operability. The disadvantages of this type of transport are traffic intensity dependence on the state network of road infrastructure and negative impact on the environment. The significance of calculation in transport is so important. It helps carriers to inform on the efficiency and profitability of the services provided, also in allocation of pricing services for budgetary purposes, but also for reducing of cost. This study interrogated the inherent relationship between transport costing and organizational competitiveness in the Zimbabwe Road Freight Sector. The study was prompted by an observation that most road freight companies collapsed before even they reach the five-year mark of trading. Literature is awash with transport costing models and there seemed to be a disparity in the conceptualization and application of these to real business scenarios. That led to the use of somewhat firefighting costing strategies with no meaning results. This was a quantitative study of road freight transport sector across Zimbabwe with a population of 1256 registered companies and a randomly picked sample size of 384. A total of 384 questionnaires were distributed and 291 were retrieved giving a response rate of 75.6%. study found out that the idea of transport costing was alien in the minds of many operators and managers as they used borrowed rates from competitors to price their own services without looking at the cost build up to the rate. This led to unprofitable operations. The study findings established that transport costing has a positive effect on organizational competitiveness. The study recommends training and development into transport costing and inclusion of this concept as a stand-alone module in Zimbabwean Education curriculum.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the main goals of this study were to predict changes in soil salinity over 2022–2050 and to formulate an optimal supplemental irrigation plan preventing soil salinity in a South African rainfed maize field. The study used the Global Climate Model (GCM) MPI-ESM1-2-LR to obtain future climate data for the study area from 2022 to 2050 and applied the HYDRUS-1D model to project the effects of these future climate data on soil salinity over the same period and to identify the best irrigation plan under climate change. Two key findings were revealed: first, the combined use of GCMs (i.e., MPI-ESM1-2-LR model) and soil-water models (i.e., HYDRUS-1D) was a powerful tool to identify soil salinity trends and formulate optimal irrigation plan under climate change. Second, in addition to rainfall amount, supplying a limited supplemental irrigation amount equal to 8% of the actual evapotranspiration of maize at the mid-season stage of maize growth can significantly reduce soil salinity (&amp;lt;1.7 dS m−1) and enhance soil moisture under climate change by 2050. These findings will be useful for preventing soil salinity in rainfed maize fields.</jats:p>",

Using the meta‐frontier Malmquist productivity index as the research method, and a sample of global semiconductor firms consisting of three groups, design, manufacturing, and assembling, as research objects, this study evaluates variation in performance while considering environmental variables and disregarding environmental variables respectively, and compares the differences between those two conditions for the whole supply chain and each group in the supply chain. This study discovers no significant differences in both considering and disregarding environmental variables scenarios, productivity of the whole supply chain shows progress. This study found the investment in enhancing technology development as a more important factor in productivity improvement and identifies design as the global leading sub‐industry in the semiconductor supply chain.</jats:p>",

Due to the need for more data\nfor academics and the industry, and the lesser research interest\ncompared to its passenger counterpart, limited empirical research on air\ncargo market dynamics has been conducted. Live flight and aircraft data\nwere collected for five consecutive years to reconstruct the air cargo\nnetwork and capacity. Air cargo sales tonnes data were collected and\nintroduced as these data eliminate double counting of transfer route\nvolumes. Both datasets were used and compared to analyse the air cargo\ntrade imbalances. The major findings indicate an imbalance in demand on\nmost of the 110 studied region pair combinations. The supply data\nindicate a high imbalance for freighter capacity, a relatively smaller\nimbalance for integrator capacity and a limited imbalance for the\nwide-body belly capacity. The data indicate that the Middle East,\nNortheast Asia, Russia, Central Asia, and Central America regions are\nall transfer or in-transit regions where a large amount of cargo passes\nthrough. However, limited cargo volumes originate or find their final\ndestination here. Although the general assumption indicates that air\ncargo supply follows air cargo demand, imbalances between demand and\nsupply in opposing directions were found for several region pairs. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the first academic\nsources to introduce data analysis based on sales tonnes. This research\nassists academics and the industry in getting a better understanding of\nthe current air cargo market dynamics. It also provides a base to\nenhance future air cargo market research, analysis and forecasting.</jats:p>"

Hydrogen peroxide can be found among the disinfectants frequently applied in ecological production systems. Moreover, it can improve the oxygenation of the root system. The objective of this work was to study its effect on C. fruticosa plants fertigated with leachates. A split-plot design with six treatments, three without an H2O2 supply (S0) and three with an H2O2 supply dosage at 2% (SH2O2), was arranged: raw leachate from C. lanatus (L100), raw leachate from C. lanatus diluted with tap water until EC of 2.5 dS m−1 (LWD), and raw leachate from C. lanatus diluted with standard nutrient solution until EC of 2.5 dS m−1 (LNSD). The results produced data about the evolution of the nutrient and leachate solutions throughout the cultivation period. Morphological (height, leaf number, leaf area, total fresh weight, relative water status, and dry weight) and physiological (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, chlorophyll a+b, and proline) parameters were studied to reveal the plant response. The efficiency of nutrient utilization was higher with the LWD treatment, and water and nitrogen utilization efficiency decreased under the H2O2 supply. In conclusion, the reuse of diluted leachate is advised for nutritionally undemanding crops, such as C. fruticosa; moreover, the H2O2 supply improved tolerance to salinity and enhanced root growth and Red-Green-Blue (RGB) values.</jats:p>"

The results of analyses revealed high concentrations of physicochemical and bacteriological parameters in surface and underground waters. The objective of this research is to study the impact of the various discharges on water and the environment. Physicochemical and bacteriological analysis methods are used to characterize the surface and groundwaters. The synthesis of geological, hydrogeological and physicochemical data made it possible to develop models of underground flows and to delimit the perimeters of protection of the wells. The results showed a significant threat to the environment (Mellah and Seybouse streams) and to the waters of the alluvial aquifer. Indeed, the high concentrations of physicochemical and bacteriological parameters, in particular at the point of discharge of the yeast plant, can have harmful effects on fauna, flora and human health (waterborne diseases). Simulations of groundwater flows and pollutant transfer showed that groundwater is strongly affected by the drainage of the Seybouse wadi. Road traffic can also be the source of accidental pollution.</jats:p>",

Groundwater samples were collected in two seasons, i.e., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons (for the years 2019 and 2020). Ninety-five samples were collected and analyzed to assess overall groundwater quality for irrigation use. The USSL diagram indicated that the maximum groundwater samples were classified under categories C3S1 and C4S1 during the pre-monsoon season, indicating groundwater suitable for irrigation. The major facies observed in groundwater are mixed Ca–Mg–Cl, CaHCO3, and Ca–Mg–Cl type. Gibbs's diagram depicts that the maximum groundwater samples belonged to the evaporation–crystallization zone, which raises salinity by raising sodium and chloride concerning the increase of total dissolved solids. The results showed that the majority of the samples are suitable for irrigation, and the suitability improves during the post-monsoon season.</jats:p>",

Blockchain‐based CSC enables stakeholders to effectively manage their decision‐making processes, increase revenue, reduce time and costs and ensure information synchronisation. Blockchain start‐ups play an essential role in facilitating the transition from a linear to a circular economy while supporting the development of CSCs. This research aims to explore the role of blockchain entrepreneurship in the transition to CSC by evaluating circular blockchain start‐ups. This research contributes to the literature by providing verified roles of blockchain entrepreneurship in the transition to CSC by evaluating the literature and blockchain start‐ups. Another contribution is that the causal relationships between these roles are analysed. In this study, an integrated three‐step methodology including Systematic Literature Review (SLR), Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), and Fuzzy Decision‐Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Fuzzy‐DEMATEL) methods on the base of the theory of change is proposed. An SLR is performed to determine the roles of blockchain entrepreneurship. Then, a QCA is conducted after identifying the roles for verification by evaluations of use cases of blockchain start‐ups. Finally, the causal relationships between these roles are interpreted by using Fuzzy‐DEMATEL. Findings indicate that blockchain entrepreneurship has 12 fundamental roles in facilitating the transition from a linear to a circular economy while supporting the development of CSCs.</jats:p>",

Rules and regulations have been implemented and have become stricter in recent decades. In this study, the exhaust smoke flow around an anchor-handling tug supply vessel in a stationary state, which has been seldom studied, is analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. The study investigates the effect of changing the wind speed and direction, which primarily affects the flow and dispersion of the smoke, to verify the suitability of the environment for the crew. To assess the environment, the recommended and comfortable concentrations of NO2 are used. The results demonstrate that a higher wind speed worsens the effect of the exhaust flow on the environment, owing to lower-pressure values and regions behind the structures. The emission of exhaust smoke is unsatisfactory when the wind flows from the side or rear of the vessel, instead of from the bow. Differing from previous studies conducted on general merchant vessels in navigating conditions, it was found that side winds can also have detrimental environmental effects in the stationary state. Adopting the original design of exhaust pipes leads to the distribution of exhaust smoke over the deck, exceeding the recommended exposure limit. Increasing the height of the pipes is identified as a simple but effective method to facilitate the smooth discharge of exhaust smoke.</jats:p>"

In total, 492 water samples from 200 residential buildings were collected. Identification of Legionella spp. was performed according to ISO 11731, and 58 isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. At least one Legionella-positive sample was found in 112 out of 200 apartment buildings (56.0%). The study revealed extensive sequence-type diversity, where 58 L. pneumophila isolates fell into 36 different sequence types. A total of 420 virulence genes were identified, of which 260 genes were found in all sequenced L. pneumophila isolates. The virulence genes enhC, htpB, omp28, and mip were detected in all isolates, suggesting that adhesion, attachment, and entry into host cells are enabled for all isolates. The relative frequency of virulence genes among L. pneumophila isolates was high. The high prevalence, extensive genetic diversity, and the wide range of virulence genes indicated that the virulence potential of environmental Legionella is high, and proper risk management is of key importance to public health.</jats:p>"

Rapid evolution of emerging technologies accelerates digitization of supply chains and provides opportunities to enable paradigm shifts in supply chain planning. Integration of planning software with industrial internet of things (IIoT) platforms, which collect real-time data across the value chain, can drive the next level of supply chain optimization.

Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) can provide intermediate storage and bridge the gap between water availability and demand, with success depending on the water available and the aquifer capacity to accept and store the water. We present the results of a regional study quantifying both these aspects to estimate the regional potential for MAR. Our results demonstrate that MAR can comprise 10% of the total water demand of the region (24 Mm3/yr) using water that is not otherwise captured, with quality that meets the requirements of the Groundwater Directive. MAR can replace 15 Mm3/yr of surface water used in the public irrigation perimeters and 9 Mm3/yr can be used to develop and maintain a strategic groundwater resource in the aquifers of the Central Algarve. Although climate change is predicted to result in an 8–13% decrease in MAR recharge, this can be addressed by incrementally increasing MAR design capacity. MAR has similar water resource benefits to the planned major infrastructure projects (desalination and River Guadiana abstraction), with reduced environmental impacts and lower costs than almost all feasible alternatives. We conclude that MAR is an important measure to increase water supply security and drought resilience in the Algarve region.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The article analyzes the application of the current documents related to reducing nitrate pollution of groundwater bodies used for public water supply in the Pleven administrative region. The requirements of the European legislation are fully implemented in the Bulgarian legislation, but the legislative measures have not led to quick and permanent results, i.e., small drinking water sources contaminated with nitrates still exist. Special attention should be paid to the diffusive sources of pollution (mineral fertilization of soils) since they are of the most significant importance in groundwater contamination with nitrates. For settlements with permanently elevated nitrate content (over 50 mg/L), it is necessary to consider the application of an individual approach in dealing with this long-standing problem: changing the water source, mixing the water from two neighboring water sources or implementing specific purification methods (biological denitrification, ion exchange resins, etc.). We analyzed the data from the monitoring of drinking water carried out by the Regional Health Inspectorate – Pleven and found that in the Pleven region, there are 17 towns or villages (out of a total of 123) for which some of the listed measures should be foreseen. The district’s relative share of the exposed population is 3.2%, comparable to the country’s exposed population for 2004-2007.</jats:p>",

Today's customers are increasingly expecting a tailored, personalized shopping experience. They expect to be able to shop anywhere, at any time, and from any location. In this context, information and communication technology (ICT) is ushering in a new dawn for retail customers. The internet of things (IoT) is the new generation of internet-connected ICT systems in a digital environment that plays an essential role in retail business process automation. However, security issues in IoT-based retail applications have caught significant attention in academia and industry. Therefore, there is a need to educate retail business operation managers about the potential security risks of IoT-based business information systems.</jats:p>",

Addressing such pressing concerns, the present study aims at proposing a market-facilitating demand-centric agricultural supply chain model where the income of the farmers is directly linked with risk-adjusted actual market movement. The price-sensitive model, being a facilitator for direct marketing, makes farm produce marketable by designing a cost-effective and scientifically managed shared warehouse, and minimizing market volatility risk through diversification among a group of contributing farmers. Empirical validation of this simulation-based modelling was tested on three essential year-round food staples – Tomato, Onion and Potato (TOP) – against the prevailing market settings. Interestingly, instead of immediately selling agricultural produce to market intermediaries due to a lack of storage options, if farmers shared the associated storage cost among themselves and distributed the market returns by proportionate crop sales to fulfil the demand, they could not only realize better returns during the season but also could turn off-season market unpredictability into their favour. The model is focused on enhancing SMFs’ income in the emerging economy context, and its empirical approach for risk minimization strategy is indeed proposed for the first time in the available literature. The finding, demonstrably, substantiates that the policy implication of the proposed model for SMFs in the fruits and vegetables (F&amp;V) segment could improve market access and derive fair returns. </jats:p>"

In these countries, direct sales are the result of the dominance of small-scale family farms with subsistence and semi-subsistence farming, and their insufficient market integration in global food supply chains. The literature highlights that “short supply circuits” have undeniably contributed to reaching the sustainable growth of local communities and securing sustainable income of farmers. However, the authors' clear and critical opinion is that the positive contribution of short food supply chains to sustainable growth should not be generalised or excessively glorified. This attitude relies on the fact that the contribution of short food supply chains to all sustainability dimensions is determined by numerous factors and assumptions, and that the combination of different marketing channels is frequently required to maximise their total contribution to sustainable growth.</jats:p>",

The operation of the system was modeled using the RETScreen, T*SOL, and PV*SOL software programs, based on averaged climate data obtained from the \"Zhuliany\" weather station. The solar system is installed on the south-facing roof of the building and consists of 262 monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules of Trina Solar TSM-DE08M (II) type with a power of 370 W, installed at an angle of 30° to the horizon, and 8 Veissmann Vitosol 300-T SP3 vacuum tube collectors with a power of 1.3 kW installed at an angle of 35°. The placement of the solar elements was determined through modeling, considering their dimensions, the features of the roof structure, the placement of ventilation systems, and the shading of the roof surfaces by other elements of the building in Kyiv. As a result of energy modeling, it was determined that the amount of thermal energy obtained is 6.823 MWh/year, and the amount of electrical energy is -109.16 MWh/year, with a total inverter capacity of 95 kW, a traditional fuel replacement coefficient of 50% for the photovoltaic system and 75% for the solar system with collectors, payback periods of 4.3 years for the photovoltaic system, and 13 years for the hot water system when replacing electric boilers and 16 years when obtaining hot water from a district heating network. The reduction in harmful emissions is 45 tons/year of CO2, which is equivalent to 104.3 barrels of crude oil or 19,279 liters of high-octane gasoline or 15.5 tons of recycled waste. Based on the analysis of the data, it is recommended to install such systems in higher education budget institutions to reduce electricity or natural gas consumption and reduce harmful emissions into the environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The stable operation of a variable frequency pump is of great importance to the management of a water supply project. Analyzing the operation performance based on monitoring data is necessary for maintaining the stable operation of a variable frequency pump. Several sensors are installed at six monitoring points on the pump to collect signals including vibration velocity, vibration acceleration and vibration displacement. Monitoring signals are preprocessed by smoothing, adjusting waveform trend and filtering on the basis of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Then, the vibration features are extracted by power spectrum analysis and cepstrum analysis methods. According to the extracted features, the vibration law and actual operation performance of a variable frequency pump under different operating conditions are analyzed. Results indicate that the vibration amplitude of the pump varies sharply under the operating conditions of [15 Hz, 20 Hz] and [30 Hz, 35 Hz]. The operating condition of [0 Hz, 15 Hz] is the restricted operating area of the pump. The vibration and noise continue increasing under the operating conditions of [35 Hz, 50 Hz] and reach the maximum values at 50 Hz. Therefore, the optimal operating is within the range of [20 Hz, 30 Hz]. Finally, by analyzing the critical values of the operating conditions, the fault diagnosis and the evaluation of the operating status are conducted.</jats:p>"

Second, to reduce the defects of the single weight method, the subjective and objective weights of evaluation indicators are determined by combining the fuzzy best-worst method (BWM) and the entropy method, and then the combination weights are obtained through linear weighting. Third, the grey relational technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is further adopted to evaluate and rank the suppliers.

Sql server 2008 is applied to design the system database, including the establishment of E-R diagram and the design of the data table. There are two core functional units in the system: the power consumption statistics unit and the electricity accounting unit. The former unit obtains the power consumption data of users, and the latter unit completes the centralized accounting of electricity charges combined with the unit price. The results verify that under the designed system, the average absolute error of the user’s electricity charge reaches the relative minimum, which indicates that the accounting quality of the system is higher.</jats:p>",

The paper also examines the mediating role of process innovation in the relationship between trust and supply chain performance in Tanzania. Drawing from social exchange theory and relational exchange theory, the research posits that, there is a crucial link between trust and supply chain performance. The paper is hence guided by four hypotheses: H1, there is a positive and significant relationship between trust and supply chain performance. H2, there is a positive and significant relationship between process innovation and supply chain performance. H3, there is a positive and significant relationship between trust and process innovation. H4, process innovation mediates the relationship between trust and supply chain performance. The study collected survey data from 262 top managers of 128 companies involved in exporting agricultural products in Tanzania. Inferential statistics were used to assess the relationship between the variables. The findings suggest that both trust and process innovation have a positive and significant effect on supply chain performance. Additionally, the study found that process innovation mediates the relationship between trust and supply chain performance. The current study is unique in its analysis of the influence of group trust on supply chain performance and the mediation role of process innovation, which has received little attention in previous studies.</jats:p>"

In addition to the economic investments required to make their supply chains more effective with a developing sustainability understanding, companies should also consider the risks that environmental and social factors may bring, taking into account the level of uncertainty in the future and their decisions. While the risk factor is accepted as the uncertainty associated with the occurrence of any event; on the other hand, risk management is strategically important in the planning of contingencies. Risk management in the supply chain is effective in identifying and analyzing risk factors in the economic and production cycle and in producing proactive solutions against risks. With the effect of the rapidly increasing population of the world, there is a significant increase in textile consumption. In this study, for risk assessment in sustainable supply chain management for the textile sector; covered under the main headings of supply, production, distribution, customer, reverse logistics and within the framework of economic, social and environmental subheadings. Potential risks are determined by reviewing the literature and taking opinions from textile sector employees. As a result of the study, it is aimed to develop a comprehensive framework for Sustainable Supply Chain Risk Management (SSCRM). Important strategies such as the ability to transform textile wastes into the raw materials of value-added products with appropriate technologies, which are included in the sustainability of textiles, are presented.</jats:p>"

It is necessary to ensure the implementation of the specified algorithm of actions and take preventive measures to achieve economic security, and to build in accordance with the implemented policy and the formation of a strategy for its economic security. In this case, the strategy is considered as a long-term approach to achieve the company's goals.

It was found that all directions for each separate functional component of the enterprise's economic security provide an opportunity to strengthen the enterprise's economic security as a whole. The result of ensuring the economic security of the enterprise should be the stability of the functioning of the enterprise, the dynamism of its development, the efficiency of financial and economic activity and the personal safety of employees working at this enterprise.\nThe use of a scientific and methodical approach when building an effective system of comprehensive provision of economic security of the enterprise makes it possible to take into account all possible threats, while all the means of protection used, the developed measures must be interconnected.

This article reviews research on the influence of the pandemic and the Sino–US trade war on the international trade of wooden products and China’s forestry enterprises that import raw timber materials and export wooden products. Furthermore, with the analysis of trade data, we found that China’s forest product enterprises are facing a shortage of wood materials and rising import prices. Regarding export, they face the problems of increased trade costs and fluctuating product demand. Moreover, the influence of the global supply chain crisis causes China’s trade diversion effect.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Contemporary squeeze film dampers (SFDs) in air breathing engines are short in length to limit weight and part count, and lubricated with a low feed pressure to reduce oil storage and pumping power. In SFDs, O-rings (ORs) restrict side leakage and increase the viscous damping while a adding a modest centering stiffness. Continuing a long-term project characterizing SFDs for aircraft engines and extending the original work in Ref [1], the paper details measurements of the forced performance of an OR sealed damper (OR-SFD) with diameter D = 127 mm, land length L = 0.2 D, and radial clearance c = 0.0022 D. Lubricant ISO VG 2 supplied at 0.69 bar(g) fills an upstream oil plenum and flows into the middle of the land through a single orifice configured with a check valve. Measurements of applied single-frequency dynamic loads, along with the ensuing damper displacements and accelerations serve to identify the parameters of the test structure, ORs, and SFD. The tests encompass centered whirl motions with amplitude r = 0.05c to 0.45c, and a range of whirl frequencies, ω = 10 Hz to 130 Hz. Note the squeeze velocity vs = rω reaches 102 mm/s. The ORs force coefficients are nearly invariant with frequency but do depend on the orbit amplitude. The ORs’ stiffness (KOR) decreases by 75% as the motion amplitude increases, r → 0.45c, likely due to the large elastic deformations and slow recovery of the ORs material. For small amplitude motions (r/c = 0.05 and 0.10), the ORs damping coefficient (COR) is ∼10% of the overall coefficient for the lubricated system (CL), while for r/c &amp;gt; 0.25, COR ∼ 0.03 CL. For small amplitudes of whirl (r ≤ 0.25c), the SFD experimental viscous damping (CSFD) and added mass (MSFD) coefficients, identified over a shorter frequency range (vs &amp;lt; 30 mm/s) equal theoretical magnitudes for a fully sealed damper. As the orbit size grows to r = 0.45c MSFD drops nearly 75% and CSFD decreases by ∼40% due to the onset of both lubricant cavitation and air ingestion occurring for squeeze velocities vs ≥ 24.5 mm/s, as also seen in the recorded dynamic pressures and video recordings of a bubbly mixture leaving the damper. A comprehensive flow model predicts CSFD and MSFD about 8% and 12% larger than the experimentally identified coefficients. A novel approach enables the estimation of the gas volume fraction (GVF) generated in the damper and which rapidly increases as vs grows. The simple procedure draws into a deflated balloon the material contents in the squeeze film, weighs the sample, and identifies its volume to produce an estimate of the GVF. The procedure to quantify the GFV will assist in the validation of predictive tools.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>   RELEVANCE. Maintaining the required level of energy security (ES) and reliability of fuel and energy supply is one of the priority tasks in the management of the energy sector. In the functioning of the fuel and energy complex various threats are possible, which can lead to the violation of the reliability of fuel and energy supply and the emergence of shortages ofvarious types of energy resources. To assess the level of energy security, approaches are considered to form a mathematical model of the FEC, which combines all sectors of the energy sector. Despite the trends of transition to low-carbon energy sources associated with energy transformation, thermal power plants remain one of the main sources of heat and electricity.Due to the ability to generate large amounts of heat only thermal power plants can be a source of centralized energy supply of large territories. In this regard, when modeling the fuel and energy complex, it is necessary to develop mathematical models of TPPs, which will correctly reflect the technological processes that affect the reliability of energy supply.</jats:p><jats:p>   OBJECT. Development of mathematical models of interaction of electric power, heat supply and fuel systems within the framework of thermal power plants designed to study energy security and reliability of fuel and energy supply.</jats:p><jats:p>   METHODS. Mathematical modeling of fuel consumption dependences on electrical and thermal load at thermal power plants is used as methods. To obtain analytical dependencies, the least squares approximation of the consumption characteristics of thermal power plants was carried out.</jats:p><jats:p>   RESULTS. As part of the work, analytical dependences of fuel consumption on thermal and electrical load for various types of thermal units were obtained. For all considered steam turbines, linear dependences of theamount of heat supplied to the turbine on its load (electrical and / or heating depending on the type of turbine) were obtained. For boilers, an approximation of the dependence of efficiency on thermal load was carried out. According to the results of the approximation, a linear dependence is assumed. For gas turbine installations, an approximation of the dependence of the efficiency on the load was carried out, according to the results of which a second-order polynomial was obtained.</jats:p><jats:p>   CONCLUSION. The paper investigates the problem of mathematical modeling of the interconnected operation of fuel, heat and power and electric power systems within the framework of the functioning of the energy sector. Analytical dependences are obtained for different types of generating equipment, including boilers, steam turbines and gas turbine installations. The obtained dependences are necessary for the analysis of energy security and reliability offuel and energy supply. The models of thermal power plants presented in the paper are the most suitable for the analysis of energy security and reliability of fuel and power supply, as they provide the necessary accuracy of calculations and take into account the specifics of various generating equipment, without dropping to the level of microparameters.</jats:p>"

As small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99% of all businesses in the European Union (EU), this study mainly focuses on surveys of French textile and clothing SMEs. It aims to propose a practical and agile tool to help SC managers cope with sustainability challenges and assess the performance of CE implementation in the SC of the textile and clothing industries. To achieve this objective and to develop a relevant questionnaire enabling us to prepare and conduct surveys, we first identified 63 relevant indicators through an extensive exploratory study based on a leading group in luxury and fashion and a pioneer in corporate social responsibility (CSR). Second, we conducted a survey of 46 textile and clothing companies based in France. Finally, we proposed a new comprehensive SC manager dashboard under CE constraints. From the results, we found that there are several barriers to implementing the CE concept in the textile and clothing industry, such as a lack of sustainability performance, a lack of regulation, and a lack of mandatory responsibilities of SC actors. Hence, to cope with these barriers, the SC must be circular and sustainable by highlighting more circular practices such as recycling, eco‐design, compliance with regulations, reducing waste, minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, and water consumption. The results revealed that our new proposed dashboard highlights all these concepts that enable us to support textile and clothing SMEs to achieve high sustainable development goals. It can also be used as a decision‐making tool to help SMEs' managers, practitioners, and researchers make better sustainability decisions.</jats:p>",

The Teritip Dam has multiple purposes, including flood control and addressing the clean water crisis caused by a lack of raw water sources. The demand for clean water will continue to increase with population growth. This study aims to determine the contribution of the Teritip Dam in meeting the community's clean water needs through the Regional Drinking Water Company (PDAM) of Balikpapan. The study also seeks to provide input for potential contributions and conservation efforts. The analysis of domestic clean water demand involves evaluating the condition of clean water, identifying the supply and demand of clean water, analyzing population projections, and estimating the volume of clean water needed by the population. The study findings indicate that the Teritip reservoir provides a discharge of 8,891 m3/day, fulfilling only 14.3% of the clean water demand in Balikpapan. Therefore, implementing water resource conservation measures is crucial to meet the water demand in Balikpapan. These conservation activities include improving the supervision of water withdrawal and usage by considering conservation interests, raising public awareness about water issues, and controlling groundwater use for new drilling activities, particularly in critical groundwater areas.</jats:p>"

These problems pose serious threat to the growth and stability of Nigerian power sector. This study investigates the effects of erratic electricity supply on socio-economic activities in Kaduna South Local Government Area of Kaduna State between 2015 and 2019. The study was anchored on Structural Functional Theory. The study relied heavily on primary type of data and also utilised data collected from secondary sources on electricity supply. Frequency table and percentages were adopted for analysis of questionnaire for easy understanding. The study found that erratic power supply has affected socio-economic activities in Kaduna South LGA because small, medium and larger industries in it cannot sustain alternative power using generator due to high cost of fuel hence leaving business and the collapsed textiles industry in the study area culminating in increasing unemployment, poverty, security challenges such as armed robbery, frustration, political thuggery, which have negative effects on individuals, families and the society at large. Hence, the study recommends that government should license more electricity distributors in order to encourage competition for effective service delivery, metre all customers, use technology to detect interconnections and prevent vandalism among others which will go a long way in restoring the lost glory of power supply in Kaduna South Local Government Area in particular, Kaduna State and Nigeria in general.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Accurately predicting the seasonal streamflow supply (SSS), i.e., the inflow into a reservoir accumulated during the snowmelt season (April to August), is critical to operating hydroelectric dams and avoiding hydrology-related hazard. Such forecasts generally involve numerical models that simulate the hydrological evolution of a basin. The operational department of the French electric company Electricité de France (EDF) implements a semi-distributed model and has carried out such forecasts for several decades on about 50 basins. However, both scarce observation data and oversimplified physics representation may lead to significant forecast errors. Data assimilation has been shown to be beneficial for improving predictions in various hydrological applications, yet very few have addressed the seasonal streamflow supply prediction problem. More specifically, the assimilation of snow observations, though available in various forms, has been rarely studied, despite the possible sensitivity of the streamflow supply to snow stock. This is the goal of the present paper. In three mountainous basins, a series of four ensemble data assimilation experiments – assimilating (i) the streamflow (Q) alone, (ii) Q and fractional snow cover (FSC) data, (iii) Q and local cosmic ray snow sensor (CRS) data and (iv) all the data combined – is compared to the climatologic ensemble and an ensemble of free simulations. The experiments compare the accuracy of the estimated streamflows during the reanalysis (or assimilation) period September to March, during the forecast period April to August, and the SSS estimation. The results show that Q assimilation notably improves streamflow estimations during both reanalysis and the forecast period. Also, the additional combination of CRS and FSC data to the assimilation further ameliorates the SSS prediction in two of the three basins. In the last basin, the experiments highlight a poor representativity of the CRS observations during some years and reveal the need for an enhanced observation system.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, there is a massive use of electric vehicles in the world. This is due to the ever-increasing importance  and  severity  of  the  environmental  safety  issue.  Now,  there  is  no  more  convenient,  affordable,  popular and at the same time less harmful alternative to road transport. The annual global emissions are more than  25  million  tons  of  pollutants  of  various  origins,  which are extremely dangerous for nature in general. On average, they increase by 3% every year. The transport sector accounts for 23% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Electric vehicles can contribute enormously to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In 2025, sales of electric vehicles are expected to increase to 100 000 units. By 2030, the number of electric vehicles will reach 1.5 million units. However, widespread adoption of  electric  vehicles  will  cause  an  increase  in  electricity  consumption.  In  addition,  an  appropriate  charging  infrastructure is required to power electric vehicles. It is worth noting that the market for electric vehicles and charging  stations  is  developing  dynamically  with  an  annual growth rate up to 80%. The main barriers to the development of electric vehicles in Russia are their high cost and underdeveloped network of charging stations. The  relevance  of  the  problem  is  confirmed  by  an order  signed  by  Prime  Minister  Mikhail  Mishustin  in  March 2022 to allocate about 1.37 billion rubles for the creation of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in  Russia.  As  for  incentives,  there  are  many  of  them.  This is the need to solve the environmental problem in large cities, achieve the goal of reducing CO2 emissions and  pursue  industrial  policy,  including  the  policy  of  innovative  development  of  the  country.  Another  way  of  increasing  the  payback  of  charging  stations  is  the  employment  of  smart  services,  which  can  reduce  the  cost of technological connection through dynamic power distribution between the main facility and the charging station.  There  are  other,  more  advanced  solutions,  which are currently being piloted, such as optimization of  investment  in  network  infrastructure,  including  an  operator  of  a  regional  public  charging  infrastructure.  This  study  focuses  on  the  development  of  a  power  supply  system  to  connect  an  electric  vehicle  charging  station  to  a  substation  in  Novosibirsk.  The  connected  electric vehicle charger, being a non-linear load, can not only increase the load on the power grid infrastructure, but also cause a deterioration in the power quality due to  the  generation  of  harmonic  distortions.  Therefore,  special  attention  is  paid  to  the  analysis  of  the  power  supply  quality  during  the  operation  of  the  charging  station by using the model developed in the MATLAB Simulink software for the analysis of harmonics.</jats:p>",

In this work, a piped setup of distribution is evaluated for pre forecasted inhabitants for upcoming 50 decades. In any conventional schemes, the task of water transportation is made with the help of healthy premeditated distribution by optimizing appropriate dia-meter of conduits as it carriages the chief asset of the project. Planning, designing and cost optimization of a piped setup of distribution is a difficult and effort consuming job. These days bunch of pipe related software are accessible that can be worn rightfully for planning, designing and cost optimization purpose. Handling such software demands together capital and skills. Today every now and then, it is a requisite to carry out planning, designing and cost optimization of a simple piped network for which an easy technique will be suitable. In this present work, a trouble-free system is evaluated which can be worn appropriate for optimization and designing of piped setup of distribution. For this purpose Isapur village is selected. The crisis in this job has been sorted with a vision of cost optimization of piped distribution setup rewarding the required discharge for the Isapur village. Researchers in the current work made use of BRANCH software of version 3. It is a simple PC coding program that evaluates simulation of hydraulic behaviour within under pressure piped setups. This PC coding program tracks the water-flow in every conduit, the required pressure at every junction points, the staging height and the water head of every tank.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the expected increase in electric power demand in the coming decades and the economic and environmental issues caused by power generation from the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, the integration of renewable energy into the grids of remote islands has attracted attention. Among all renewable sources, tidal stream energy shows potential to contribute positively in areas with strong tidal currents due to the predictability and semi-diurnal periodicity of the resource, which makes it compatible with short-term energy storage. However, its performance in areas with lower available power density has not yet been addressed. In this paper, energy systems for the Goto Islands, Japan which combine solar, offshore wind, and tidal energy are evaluated based on whole-system performance indicators such as the annual energy shortage and surplus and the battery load factor. Without energy storage, an energy mix of 31% solar, 47% offshore wind, and 22% tidal energy provides the lowest values for annual energy shortage (29.26% of total power demand) and surplus (29.26%). When batteries are incorporated into the system, tidal stream energy is the main contributor to reducing these two parameters, with values up to 23.58% and 19.60%, respectively, for the solar and tidal scenario with 30 MW of installed storage capacity. These results show the advantages of tidal stream energy exploitation in stand-alone energy systems, even with relatively low capacity factors (0.33).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To factor in the retailer’s overconfidence when dealing with the inventory problem with supply uncertainty, this paper develops a distributionally robust optimization model by only considering the mean and variance of the yield rate distribution. We first show that overconfidence would prompt the retailer to order more under low-profit conditions, whereas it reduces the order quantity under high-profit conditions. The analysis results imply that the pull-to-center effect still exists when only supply uncertainty applies, and the asymmetry that the deviation is higher under low-profit conditions is proved. The performance of overconfidence is also characterized in the expected profits of both retailer and supplier. Numerical studies show that even though the retailer may suffer losses, the supplier can benefit from the retailer’s overconfidence in the low-profit case, which would positively increase the joint expected profit of the supply chain. Two extensions to the base model are also considered, including the scenario with both demand and supply uncertainties and an overconfident multi-product problem with budget constraints. This research provides tractable results to predict how the decision-maker is biased, and such insights would help the applications of de-biasing techniques in practice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Effective supply chain inventory management is crucial for large-scale manufacturing industries such as civil aircraft and automobile manufacturing to ensure efficient manufacturing. Generally, the main manufacturer makes the annual inventory management plan, and contacts with suppliers when some material is approaching critical inventory level according to the actual production schedule, which increases the difficulty of inventory management. In recent years, many researchers have focused on using reinforcement learning method to study inventory management problems. Current approaches were mainly designed for the supply chain with single-node multi-material or multi-node single-material mode, which are not suitable to the civil aircraft manufacturing supply chain with multi-node multi-material mode. To deal with this problem, we formulated the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model and proposed a multi-agent reinforcement learning method for supply chain inventory management, in which the dual-policy and information transmission mechanism was designed to help the supply chain participant improve the global information utilization efficiency of the supply chain and the coordination efficiency with other participants. The experiment results show that our method has about 45% performance improvement on efficiency compared with current reinforcement learning-based methods.</jats:p>"

Along with population growth and changes in people's lifestyles, the need for clean water grows daily. The people who live in Bulupitu village in Gondanglegi likewise recognize the importance of having access to clean water. Due to financial constraints, there are still a significant number of residents who lack access to local water company (PDAM). Therefore, the majority of people continue to rely on groundwater and river water. To maximize the use of water, therefore, a non-electrical gravity-based water pump technology is necessary. This pump operates without electricity, making it more cost-effective. This activity is implemented through surveys, discussions with partners, analysis of problems and needs, counseling regarding clean water, the development of water pump, evaluation, and monitoring. On the basis of an analysis of the needs and quantity of water required by the residents of Bulupitu, the acquisition of non-electric pumps can increase the total water supply by 7%. This is based on the estimation that each person requires 250 liters of water per day, given the total population of 3000. In order for the total water requirements of all residents to reach 750.000 liters. As a matter of fact, 24-hour pumps can produce between 47000- 52000 liters of water.</jats:p>"

Since the beginning of the pandemic researchers have studied various food supply chain issues influenced by the COVID-19 crisis, including impacts on consumer behavior, and logistical and organizational changes to food supply chains. Despite the proliferation of studies on food supply chains during the pandemic, only a few researchers have focused on short food supply chains and their resilience. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the resilience of short food supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic using a direct purchasing (DP) network as a case study. The study considered three research questions. (1) How has the functioning of the DP network changed during the COVID-19 pandemic? (2) What role do resilience elements (i.e., readiness to shocks, responsiveness to disruption, and recovery from the crisis) play in the short food supply chain response to the COVID-19 crisis?

The study used the methods of logical, comparative, structural and content anal- ysis. Results. A set of proposals has been formulated to improve user interaction with the web- site of online pharmacies, including: an indication of the actual expiration date of available drugs, an indication of a public offer and a license, information that the site is not an aggregator, information on labeling, and opportunities: the choice of analogues of a drug with taking into account their cost, online consultations with a pharmaceutical / medical professional, feedback, the ability to assess the pharma- cological compatibility of purchased / or used drugs. Conclusion. The study formulated a set of proposals for the standardization of digital services of online pharmacies on the basis of regulations governing the activities of phar- macy organizations. A model for improving sites is proposed, which provides for the expansion of functionality and the improvement of the quality of pharmaceu- tical assistance in the online trade of drugs and other pharmacy products, reducing the time and simplifying the procedure for ordering and purchasing them. The ad- vantage provided by the given set of criteria is the possibility of obtaining online pharmaceutical advice on the selection, use and storage of medicinal products, the pharmacological compatibility of medicinal products, the possibility of choosing analogues of medicinal products, taking into account the price and expiration date, as well as the ability to verify the authenticity of the medicinal product by labeling. The implementation of a set of proposals makes it possible to eliminate the short- comings inherent in online pharmacies at the moment and improve the quality of pharmaceutical services to the population in accordance with the legislative acts of the Russian Federation and the best practices of pharmaceutical activity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Isoniazid is a leading tuberculosis treating medication. Global supply chains provide essential medicines such as isoniazid to resource-limited areas. Ensuring the safety and efficaciousness of these medicines is essential to public health programs. Handheld spectrometers are becoming increasingly approachable in cost and usability. As supply chains expand, quality compliance screening of essential medications is necessary in site-specific locations. Here, a brand-specific qualitative discrimination analysis of isoniazid is approached by collecting data from two handheld spectrometers in two countries with the intent to build a multi-location quality compliance screening method for a brand of isoniazid. Methods: Two handheld spectrometers (900–1700 nm) were used to collect spectra from five manufacturing sources (N = 482) in Durham, North Carolina, USA, and Centurion, South Africa. A qualitative brand differentiation method was established from both locations by applying a Mahalanobis distance thresholding method as a measure of assessing similarity. Results: Combining data from both locations resulted in a 100% classification accuracy, at both locations, for brand ‘A’ and resulted in the four other brands classifying as dissimilar. Bias was found between sensors in terms of resulting Mahalanobis distances, but the classification method proved to be robust enough to accommodate. Several spectral peaks found in isoniazid references appear within the 900–1700 nm range, as well as variation in the excipients per manufacturer. Conclusions: Results show promise for compliance screening isoniazid as well as other tablets in multiple geographic locations using handheld spectrometers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, in connection with the difficult situation with energy supply, issues related to the application of new measures to conserve energy resources as well as the introduction of new promising technologies using alternative energy sources, such as mined methane, have gained great importance. The problem of methane from coal deposits is of particular importance. This problem primarily concerns the safety of miners' work, methane production as an alternative source of energy resources, and solving environmental problems related to methane emissions into the atmosphere of coal mining enterprises. The problem of reducing the efficiency of degassing is caused by the long length of the degassing pond and the depth of cleaning operations. The use of a mobile surface degassing unit makes it possible to effectively carry out degassing and achieve significant volumes of extracted gas with a methane content of up to 80%, but high costs of electricity complicate its operation. Therefore, the paper proposes an autonomous power supply for a mobile surface degassing plant. For the autonomous power supply of a mobile surface degassing plant, it is advisable to use an electric generator since an uninterrupted supply of electricity is important. Gas power plants are widely used in industrial enterprises. In accordance with the power consumption of the electrical equipment of the mobile surface degassing plant, the work justified and selected a gas power plant and electric power equipment for the autonomous power supply of the mobile surface degassing plant. The gas-piston power plant is designed for the production of electrical energy and can be both the main and backup source. As a fuel, mainline natural gas with an average supply pressure or methane mine gas is used. The basic configuration of the power plant is a liquid-cooled gas-piston engine based on a diesel unit. A technological scheme for connecting the gas power plant to a mobile vacuum pumping unit and its power supply scheme has been developed, which will increase the safety of cleaning works, solve the issue of methane utilization, significantly reduce electricity costs, and improve the environmental situation in the industrial region.</jats:p>",

Throughout history, the desalination industry has adapted to the specific needs of an era or different environmental conditions by incorporating cutting-edge technologies. The general theme of this paper is the past, the present, and the future of the desalination industry. As such, this research aims to examine the evolution of the desalination industry over time, understand its current state, and ultimately use this knowledge to highlight some important considerations for its future. This review highlighted the immense influence of the energy market on the prevalence of desalination technology in a given region and/or eras. The information gathered here indicates that other sectors, such as agriculture, may need to rely on this unconventional water supply in the future, but there are certain factors ranging from socioeconomic to environmental concerns that need continued and increased research to facilitate the long-term, sustainable development of this practice.</jats:p>",

Milbemycin A3 and A4 with high bioactivities are the main components of milbemycin-derived products, which require a component ratio A4:A3 of 2.3- to 4.0-fold. Streptomyces bingchenggensis BC04 is a promising milbemycin producer, whereas the component ratio of its products (A4:A3 of 9.0-fold) could not meet the requirement for industrial production. To address this issue, we reconstructed the precursor biosynthetic pathways to fine tune the supply of different acyl-coenzyme A precursors required for milbemycin biosynthesis. Based on an analysis of the intracellular acyl-coenzyme A precursors, we reconstructed stepwise heterogeneous biosynthetic pathways of extender units for milbemycin biosynthesis. Then, we coordinated the supply of milbemycin biosynthetic starter units with temporal promoters. Thanks to these manipulations, we obtained an engineered strain with 39.5% milbemycin titer improvement to 3417.88 mg/L and a qualified component ratio A4:A3 of 3.3-fold. This work demonstrated that coordinating the precursor supply is a simple and effective approach to optimize the component ratio of A4:A3 in milbemycin fermentation products. Moreover, this strategy might also be useful to construct high-yield strains with optimized component ratios of fermentation products in other Streptomyces.</jats:p>"

As this is a developing field, it is crucial to expand discussions on topics that have not yet been thoroughly examined, such as the intrinsic bias of indicators and metrics that may be associated with specific operational, economic, environmental perspectives, etc. Such perspectives should be considered in the decision-making process within the context of reverse logistics (RL) and waste management (WM). The aim of this research was to identify different perspectives employed in the development of proposed models in the literature. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to analyze thirty papers from Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases without time restrictions. Results: The review identified various ways in which authors grouped perspectives, including qualitative and quantitative, sustainability, and operational perspectives, among others. Conclusions: This study revealed several gaps in the field, including limited studies on RSC performance assessment and a lack of studies linking performance assessment to decision-making components.</jats:p>"

It is discovered that there are significant differences in the experimental data on temperature modes obtained by many authors. A new dynamic method of measurement of overheating temperature in the active region of p-n structures at pre-set direct current is applied. This method is based on registration of the transient processes of direct voltage changes during heating by pre-set current and cooling-down after switching-off of the heating current at constant low direct current. The formula is obtained for calculation of the proportion factor of direct-voltage temperature dependence for diodes with different techno structures accounting for the measurement current, the non-ideality factor of the voltage-current curve, and temperature. The experimental curves of the LED active region temperature dependence on heating current at its density of (10–110) A/cm2 and dissipated power of (0.025–0.45) W are obtained. The direct-voltage temperature dependence proportion factor was modelled at different values of measurement current for specific LEDs. It is demonstrated that the active region of LEDs based on wide-band-gap semiconductors overheats due to formation of hot charge carriers interacting with optic phonons in it at current densities, when the exponential nature of the voltage-current curve is disturbed.</jats:p>",

A stable quasi-arc operating mode of the lamp was reached with duration of radiation pulses of up to ten seconds when forcing power supply. The amplitude on time dependences of the lamp’s radiant exitance are formed by means of computer control of the temporal shape of the thyristor rectifier current pulses. For studying of the thermal overloads of the lamps, the methodology and IR-range optical pyrometry means were designed both, for the quartz bulb and for the electrode. The dependence of the latter’s temperature on energy deposition was studied using two custom-made radiometers. The load and radiation characteristics of the new lamp and the said analogue were compared. The new lamp is capable to operate rather reliably with high-power supply and energy deposition overload of up to 100 times in the single second-long flash mode with natural air cooling.</jats:p>",

We study the effects of competitive actions in the context of vertical buyer–supplier relationships. Specifically, leveraging insights from screening theory, we examine how a supplier firm's value‐diminishing competitive actions—moves that may negatively impact buyer firms—lead to subsequent reductions in the buyer's procurement allocations and how contextual factors moderate such adverse effects. We test the associated hypotheses using a panel dataset comprising 12,690 dyadic buyer–supplier observations. A series of econometric analyses provide consistent evidence that a supplier's value‐diminishing actions are associated with decreases in the buyer's purchases from the supplier, thus highlighting the “dark side” of competitive actions. Furthermore, we find that the supplier's downstream vertical relatedness and the degree to which rival suppliers pursue value‐diminishing actions moderate this effect. Our findings, thus, add to our understanding of factors that shape the success and continuity of supply chain relationships and help supplier firms evaluate the economic viability of their competitive actions.</jats:p>",

As such, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors that influence the supply of ESs is of paramount importance for effective forest management policies that ensure both ecological integrity and human welfare. This study aimed at identifying local specific interactions across three different spatial scales between landscape metrics and ESs using global and geographical random forest models. The findings showed that dense forest cover may have a positive effect on the supply of ESs, such as climate regulation and timber provision. Although landscape heterogeneity is considered among the main facilitators of ecosystem multifunctionality, this did not fully apply for the Marathasa region, as forest homogeneity seems to be linked with provision of multiple services. By assessing under which landscape conditions and characteristics forest ESs thrive, local stakeholders and managers can support effective forest management to ensure the co-occurrence of ESs and societal wellbeing.</jats:p>"

According to the above  regulations, a prerequisite for new construction and renovation of existing buildings is to ensure a high level of thermal insulation of the building and the use of renewable sources to cover energy consumption. The work carried out a feasibility study of the modernization of an office building in the city of Kyiv to the level of a highly energy-efficient building using a heat pump to provide the necessary heat supply. Estimation of generation of required heat supply of the building by the heat pump and used electrical energy by the heat pump is based on  the simulation results in the GeoTSOL software environment. In order to assess the economic attractiveness of the project for upgrading an existing building to the level of a highly energy-efficient  building using renewable sources for heat supply, the calculation of the energy demand for heating in the Design Builder software environment and the integral costs for heating the building using renewable and  traditional energy sources at different  levels of thermal protection was made. The results obtained indicate attractive, both from an economic and  environmental point of view, the possibilities of implementing the construction of a highly energy-efficient building that uses renewable energy sources for heat supply. </jats:p>"

This has led to a situation where the locally generated photovoltaic power cannot be consumed on-site, causing an increase in the voltage of the distribution network and potentially exceeding limits. Additionally, this results in an increase in network losses within the distribution network. Energy storage systems have a high degree of versatility and can be utilized to address the issue of misalignment between solar panel output and energy demand due to grid-connection of photovoltaic systems. This is achieved through the system’s quick charging and discharge capabilities, and its ability to control the charging and discharge state.This paper presents models for optimal energy storage allocation in both normal operations and failure situations. It outlines a process for allocating energy storage that balances economic considerations with power supply reliability. To illustrate the effectiveness of the energy storage system in enhancing the distribution network, a practical example is provided in a substation, both under normal and fault conditions.</jats:p>",

Effort to digitize company services is one option in empowering social capital through relationship strength to maintain supply chain resilience and company competitiveness. This research explores the role of service digitalization in the empowerment of social capital to generate supply chain resilience and company competitiveness. Data and information are collected from 446 Indonesia’s marine transportation services companies through online surveys and analyzed statistically using SEM WarPls. The results showed that social capital has a significant effect on the company’s supply chain resilience and also on the company competitiveness. Furthermore, service digitalization strengthens the influence of social capital on the supply chain resilience. Likewise, service digitalization strengthens the influence of social capital on company competitiveness. On the contrary, service digitalization actually weakens the influence of supply chain resilience on the company competitiveness.</jats:p>"

Then, sentiment analysis was utilized to uncover consumers' emotions. The results indicate that social media users in developing nations are increasingly concerned about the sustainability of the mobile supply chain. Also, developing nations tweeted primarily about socially sustainable practices, whereas developed nations were more concerned with environmentally sustainable practices. This study contributes to the theory of stakeholders and institutions by concentrating on external stakeholders and analyzing their perspectives to determine how to enhance sustainable practices in supply chains.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of policy documents for the purpose of exploring the approaches within China’s drug reform. The analysis reveals that the National Health Commission (NHC) is the leading department of China’s drug reform, demonstrating that the core objective of drug reform is to ensure drug supply meets healthcare needs. The reform has evolved from its initial stage to the deepening and adjusting stage, with policy instruments becoming more interactive and involving greater numbers of implementers. Along with supply, drug quality and safety are the top concerns of the drug reform, followed by drug accessibility and affordability. Rational drug use is receiving greater attention in the deepening and adjusting stage. Environmental and demand-side instruments are being used more frequently in policies, while the utilization of supply-side instruments shows the opposite trend. Government departments at all levels play crucial roles in policy instrument implementation, with the significance of this function increasing. The participation of consumers in policy implementation is also rising. While medical institutions and enterprises are important implementers, their role is diminishing.</jats:p>"

To fill this gap, this study aims to investigate the relationships among internal and external logistics integration capabilities, supply-chain integration (SCI), and financial performance (FP) in OC retailing based on the dynamic capability view. An empirical study is conducted based on a survey of 230 OC retailers in China’s market. Factor analysis and regression analysis are conducted to examine the hypotheses of the proposed conceptual model. The quantitative analyses show that the internal logistics integration capability is significantly related to the external logistics integration capability, and they both have positive effects on SCI, while the external logistics integration capability generates a higher impact (i.e., almost 1.5 times that of the internal logistics integration capability). The numerical results also demonstrate that the logistics integration capabilities and SCI have similar positive effects on FP (i.e., all the relevant regression coefficients show values around 0.25), and SCI plays a partial intermediary role in the relationships between logistics integration capabilities and FP. Furthermore, the quantitative evidence addresses the fact that the FP is not influenced by OC retailers’ characteristics, indicating a fair business environment in the OC retail industry.</jats:p>"

Our results show that the Regulation aims to enhance corporate accountability mechanisms through mostly state‐based hard regulation of commodity supply chains, reducing the role of market incentives and private regulation. This policy change is found to be the result of strategic policy‐oriented learning from perceived accountability failures of existing soft market‐based instruments, voluntary trade agreements, and experience with market‐correcting EU timber legality trade rules in a politically favorable context. The institutionalization of new forest‐risk commodity supply chain accountability norms in new EU trade rules would, by design, harden foreign corporate accountability for negative socio‐environmental externalities. However, the de‐facto hardening will depend on the final regulatory design, acceptance, compliance, implementation, enforcement improvements, and avoidance of leakage effects.</jats:p>",

Prior to the cost-benefit analysis, five Zn application treatments were evaluated; a control treatment (T1-no application); T2 was the application of 4.5 L H2SO4 + 3 kg ZnSO4 in 100 L H2O; T3 consisted of the application of 3 Kg ZnSO4 in 20 L of worm leachate measured at 100 L of H2O; T4 was with the addition of 3 kg ZnSO4 mixed in 25 kg of solid vermicompost; and T5 was the addition of 3 Kg ZnSO4 in 25 kg of compost. A total of two applications per treatment were made. The parameters evaluated were the concentration of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) in the leaf tissue and the yield in kilograms of walnut (kg ha-1). The highest nut yield was obtained with T2 with 1,400 kg ha-1 compared to 933 kg ha-1 that were harvested in the control treatment; that is to say, a differential of 467 kg of walnut.

Specifically, we focus on the dyadic relationships between farmers and different types of buyers, including besides lead firms, intermediaries, and wholesalers, which have received little attention in the scientific literature. Our analysis focuses on formal and informal contracts as governance forms between farmers and buyers, and explores the correlation between contract provisions (e.g., quality, quantity, and the provision of services), relationship attributes (i.e., satisfaction, trust, and opportunism) and adoption of SAPs. We gathered survey data from 352 vegetable farmers in Chile and employed analysis of variance and logit modeling for our analysis. Our findings indicate that small‐scale farmers primarily engage with intermediaries using informal contracts, while medium‐scale farmers trade with wholesalers through spot markets, and large‐scale farmers with lead firms using formal contracts. We also found that farmers who traded through informal contracts, mainly with intermediaries, reported greater satisfaction in the farmer‐buyer relationship than farmers trading through formal contracts. However, farmers engaging in informal contracts were less likely to adopt SAPs than farmers trading through formal contracts. Our results suggest that the governance form (contracts or spot market) adopted for the relationship between farmers and buyers influences the adoption of SAPs, while the impact of relationship attributes on SAP adoption is less clear. A deeper understanding of buyers and their relationship with farmers is essential to enhance policies encouraging SAP adoption in regional and local fresh food supply chains.

Many airports were completely destroyed and most of the major ports were occupied, making further operations impossible until Ukraine was completely victorious. Road transportation became the saving link for supply chains and further economic activity. One of the main problems in this situation is to choose the best mode of transportation and the most suitable carrier. Trucking companies continue to cooperate with air agencies, but the shift of their main hubs to neighboring countries may raise new questions about optimizing deliveries. Factors such as price, quality of service, distance and time will always play an important role in the supply chain.

This study evaluated the SCM for SARS-CoV-2 POC diagnostic services in resource-limited settings to determine the effect of SCM on accessibility to SARS-CoV-2 POC tests and to identify barriers and enablers of accessibility to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic services in Mopani District, Limpopo Province, South Africa. We purposively assessed 47 clinics providing POC diagnostic services between June and September 2022. One participant per clinic completed an audit tool developed by the authors with guidance from the World Health Organization and the Management Sciences for Health guidelines. The audit tool evaluated the following SCM parameters: selection, quantification, storage, procurement, quality assurance, distribution, redistribution, inventory management, and human resource capacity. Percentage rating scores between 90–100% indicated that the facility was compliant with SCM guidelines, while rating scores &lt; 90% indicated non-compliance. The clinic audit scores were summarized and compared across clinics and sub-districts. Clinics had compliance scores ranging from 60.5% to 89.2%. Compliance scores were the highest for procurement, redistribution, and quality assurance (all 100%), followed by storage (mean = 95.2%, 95% CI: 90.7–99.7), quantification (mean = 89.4%, 95% CI: 80.2–98.5), and selection (mean = 87.5%, 95% CI: 87.5%–87.5%). Compliance scores were the lowest for inventory management (mean = 53.2%, 95% CI: 47.9%–58.5%), distribution (mean = 48.6%, 95% CI: 44.6%–52.7%), and human resource capacity (mean = 50.6%, 95% CI: 43.3%–58.0%). A significant correlation was found between compliance score and clinic headcount (r = 0.4, p = 0.008), and compliance score and ideal clinic score (r = 0.4, p = 0.0003). Overall, the 47 clinics audited did not comply with international SCM guidelines. Of the nine SCM parameters evaluated, only procurement, redistribution, and quality assurance did not need improvement. All parameters are key in ensuring full functionality of SCM systems and equitable access to SARS-CoV-2 POC diagnostics in resource limited settings.</jats:p>"

Taking into account the strengthening of cooperation between road and rail transport, under modern conditions, combined transport within the international transport corridor is proposed as an alternative option to promote cargo flow in the supply chain. As a result of experimental studies carried out on the basis of the simulation model of the delivery process in the Petri Nets, the time characteristics of technological processes under alternative schemes depending on the input parameters of the model have been determined. A comparative assessment of alternative delivery schemes based on mathematical models has made it possible to establish that the rational scheme for the delivery of export cargo from Ukraine to Germany via the Pan-European Corridor III is the Rolling Highway technology, which ensures compliance with the cargo owner's requirements for delivery time and cost established by the contract. The proposed approach is recommended as a tool for making managerial decisions when planning and organising the delivery of export cargoes from Ukraine to the EU countries in order to effectively manage supply chains by minimising the cost of delivery and environmental damage. </jats:p>"

However, as the global market turns more volatile, the concept of mobile modularization has been adopted by increasingly more industrial practitioners. In mobile modular networks, modular units can be installed or removed at a particular site to expand or reduce the capacity of a facility, or relocated to other sites to tackle market volatility. In this work, we formulate a mixed‐integer linear programming (MILP) model for the closed‐loop supply chain network planning with modular distribution and collection facilities. To further deal with uncertain customer demands and recovery rates, we extend our model to a multistage stochastic programming model and efficiently solve it using a tailored stochastic dynamic dual integer programming (SDDiP) with Magnanti‐Wong enhanced cuts. Computational experiments show that the added Magnanti‐Wong cuts in the proposed algorithm can effectively close the gap between upper and lower bounds, and the benefit of mobile modules is evident when the temporal and spatial variability of customer demand is high.</jats:p>",

The study aims to explore the emission reduction behaviors of these enterprises in the context of China’s carbon trading market. Using the theory of system dynamics, an evolutionary game model was developed and simulated using AnyLogic software. The simulation analyzed the effects of carbon price, subsidies, and punishment strategies on the emission reduction decisions of supply chain enterprises, providing insights into their behavioral impact. The results demonstrate that punishment, subsidy intensity, and carbon price changes all influence the emission reduction decisions of upstream and downstream enterprises. Suppliers are more sensitive to carbon price, while manufacturers are more sensitive to subsidy intensity. Additionally, the closer the equilibrium carbon price, subsidy, and market are, the shorter the time for the emission reduction probability of both enterprises to stabilize. Therefore, it is recommended that supply chain companies increase their awareness of environmental responsibility and enthusiasm for green innovation, actively respond to the carbon trading system, improve their internal subsidy system, and promote green technology innovation.</jats:p>"

The aim of this work is to give evidence of the potential positive effects of ISCPs for the agricultural sector by considering the differences between ISCP beneficiaries (treated) and non-ISCP farms (non-treated). The materials used for the analysis are twofold: the Italian Rural Network database and the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) dataset. The analysis is based on a three-year period (2018–2020). The sample consists of 1693 farms, outliers excluded. The treated farms included in the FADN sample total 134. The variables used are both structural and economic. The statistical analysis carried out compares treated and non-treated farms using the Welch-t-test. The results show that some key variables are significant (area; labour; revenues and costs). In general, the treated farms are more likely to improve their production process through EU funding and through new investments. In conclusion, the ISCP could be a good opportunity to support the sector. This work suggests that beneficiaries could achieve higher economic performance, especially when carrying out diversified activities.</jats:p>"

Through structured interviews with 50 individuals involved in the wheat supply the study examines the impact of proactive capability, supply chain design, and reactive capability on the resilience of the wheat supply chain. The findings reveal that proactive capability in the wheat supply chain demonstrated flexibility in various aspects, except for sourcing. Integration among departments showed collaboration, but issues were encountered in information sharing and efficiency. The readiness of the supply chain showed detection ability but lacked training and strong security measures. Supply chain design complexities were observed in direct dealings and a lack of flexibility in flow. Reactive capability indicated challenges in quick response, crisis mitigation, and recovery, emphasizing the importance of response teams and financial readiness. The study provides valuable insights for supply chain managers, highlighting areas for improvement such as sourcing strategies, information management, quality control, and financial support. Future research could explore other sectors and agricultural products, investigating different geographical areas, and increasing the sample size. By further understanding the dynamics of supply chain resilience and flexibility, organizations can better prepare for and respond to disruptions, ensuring the continuity of critical food supply chains during crises.</jats:p>"

With the goal of transmitting power, a system equivalent parameter model is established to address the sensitivity of design parameters for the point‐to‐point long‐distance wireless power transmission system, and the main influencing factors that lead to system power transmission failure are analyzed. To effectively address the impact of high‐sensitivity parameters, a fast‐tuning method with redundant capacitance matrix compensation is proposed, which improves the deviation problem in system parameter design, improves the efficiency of offset parameter matching, and analyzes the impact of wireless energy transmission systems on high‐voltage insulator strings. Finally, an experimental platform was constructed to achieve power transmission at a distance of not less than 5 m at a resonant frequency of 50 kHz.

This inverter needs to be followed by an LCL filter as a filter for connecting the electromagnetic pump. But the LCL filter has a large resonance spike at the resonance point. This can cause relatively large interference to the control system and also increase the harmonics of the inverter power supply output current. Therefore, it is necessary to suppress the resonant spikes of the LCL filter. In this paper, an active filtering strategy based on a trap is proposed by comparing the existing passive filtering strategies. The trap can be used to generate an anti-resonant peak at the resonance point of the LCL, which is used to cancel the resonant spike of the LCL filter. This method ensures the resonant peak suppression effect without affecting the filtering effect of the LCL filter.</jats:p>",

Moreover, where and to what extent food waste is generated in the food supply chain (FSC) is unknown. This study aimed to quantify food waste through material flow analysis and estimate the percentage of loss and waste at each stage of the FSC. The results revealed that 34.1% of the total supply of fruits and vegetables, meat and cereals was lost and wasted in Korea in 2015. Given that the proportion of edible parts in the food supplied for human consumption usually reaches 94.9%, a considerable amount of the food must have been discarded even though they are mostly edible. Furthermore, 47.6% of the total losses and wastes occurred at the upstream stages in the FSC, which include the agricultural production and processing stages, and 52.4% occurred at the downstream stages, which included the consumption stage, that is, distribution and household stages. In particular, more fruit and vegetable FLW were generated in the upstream stages of the FSC, whereas more meat and cereal loss and waste were generated in the downstream stages. The efficiency of policy implementation can be enhanced if food waste reduction strategies involve focusing more on areas with high losses. </jats:p>",

The dynamic equilibrium allocation of water resources increment brought by new water source projects and regulation projects is realized, and the fine-tuning optimization of the water distribution scheme is realized. The results show that the optimal adjustment strategy of the water diversion scheme is to increase the upstream water allocation, and the adjustment range is 2.13%. The water allocation in the middle reaches was slightly increased by 0.25% to reduce the downstream and Hebei Province, Tianjin water allocation, and the adjustment range is −3.81%. The optimization scheme reflects the principle of ecological priority, guarantees the basic ecological environment water use in the Yellow River, balances the fairness and efficiency of economic and social water use outside the river, and provides technical support for water resources security in water-shortage basins.</jats:p>",

Given the network complexity, deeper insight into the sequencing orders of suppliers and assemblers is required to orchestrate the supply chain partner collaboration. Considering the overlapping community and multi-layered connectivity characteristics of the supply chain network, in this paper, we design a gravitation-based hierarchical community detection algorithm for structuring the supply chain network. The solution applies a functional modules identification strategy based on node gravitation and a hierarchical clustering strategy based on module gravitation to structure the supply chain network architecture. The key technique is to investigate the global gravitational influence of focal firms, segment the functional modules by characterizing the overlapping conditions among communities, and construct the dendrogram by measuring the gravitational forces between modules in order to map the hierarchical architecture of the dendrogram to structure the supply chain network. The proposed algorithm does not necessitate a prior knowledge about the network. It is adaptable to construct the supply chain network that exhibits scale-free, highly overlapped modular community, and hierarchical characteristics. Experimental results on synthetic benchmark and real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm.</jats:p>"

Sustainability increases when the chain as a whole reduces its carbon footprint. Resilience increases when increasing the supply chain's ability to recover from disruptive events. In principle, the objectives are antagonistic. Some sustainability approaches advocate that efficiency should increase, reducing supply alternatives and, consequently, the chain's resilience. This article proposes to combine two supply strategies, green hydrogen and industrial symbiosis, and a management strategy, blockchain, which can simultaneously increase sustainability and resilience. Adding sources such as green hydrogen and reusing material and energy waste generated by members of the same or another supply chain reduce the carbon footprint (by replacing fossil fuels and virgin raw materials). It also reinforces the supply chain, adding redundant edges. The article discusses the requirements of two models to optimize the implementation, one based on mixed integer linear programming and the other based on agent-based simulation. A cloud information system based on blockchain technology ensures data reliability.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, the textile industry has a complex supply chain in which many distant chain members try to act together under globalization and cost constraints. This situation makes the sustainability studies of the textile sector difficult. However, businesses that create a sustainable supply chain structure and continuously improve this structure are expected to create a competitive advantage. In this study, the nearshore supplier strategy is adopted to improve environmental sustainability. Therefore, old inbound transpostation has calculated to understand reduction of CO2 emissions.

The goal of this paper is to analyze the optimal decision and coordination of a competitive dual-channel supply chain under an interval uncertain demand. For this purpose, we establish a centralized decision model and a wholesale price contract model under both interval demand and channel competition, respectively. Meanwhile, both the satisfaction degree of interval and the order relation of interval number are proposed to convert interval uncertain optimization problems to deterministic ones. Then, we derive the optimal pricing decisions, ordering quantities, and performances of partners and the supply chain system. Meanwhile, a revenue sharing contract is proposed to coordinate the competitive dual-channel supply chain under interval demand. Moreover, we found that the bounds of interval demand and channel sensitivities affect the optimal strategies and revenue sharing contract under interval uncertainty. Finally, we present a numerical analysis to illustrate the proposed results in this paper and conduct sensitivity analyses.

The limited availability of free CoA (CoASH) in the matrix raises the question of how the local acyl-CoA concentration is regulated to prevent trapping of CoASH from overload of any specific substrate. Acyl-CoA thioesterase-2 (ACOT2) hydrolyzes long-chain acyl-CoAs to their constituent fatty acids and CoASH, and is the only mitochondrial matrix ACOT refractory to inhibition by CoASH. Thus, we reasoned that ACOT2 may constitutively regulate matrix acyl-CoA levels.<jats:italic>Acot2</jats:italic>deletion in murine skeletal muscle (SM) resulted in acyl-CoA build-up when lipid supply and energy demands were modest. When energy demand and pyruvate availability were elevated, lack of ACOT2 activity promoted glucose oxidation.

In mice fed a high fat diet, ACOT2 enabled the accretion of acyl-CoAs and ceramide derivatives in glycolytic SM, and this was associated with worse glucose homeostasis compared to when ACOT2 was absent. These observations suggest that ACOT2 supports CoASH availability to facilitate β-oxidation in glycolytic SM when lipid supply is modest. However, when lipid supply is high, ACOT2 enables acyl-CoA and lipid accumulation, CoASH sequestration, and poor glucose homeostasis. Thus, ACOT2 regulates matrix acyl-CoA concentration in glycolytic muscle, and its impact depends on lipid supply.</jats:p>"

Budgetary constraints in healthcare systems call for innovative solutions to meet this rising demand while safeguarding the quality of care. The current approach generally consists in reducing the price per device by aggregating buys, but this creates a misalignment in the value chains of suppliers and healthcare providers. Clinicians, already overworked, do not have access to technologies that could significantly decrease the time required per patient in the follow-up stages of the care pathway. Patients, on the other hand, receive lower-quality follow-up in a care pathway that is already fragmented and where general practitioners lack the necessary information to provide them with comprehensive care. RITMOCORE, a Public Procurement of Innovation (PPI) project funded by the European Union under Horizon2020, was set up in 2016 to transform the care pathway of patients suffering from bradycardias and implanted with a pacemaker. The model proposed by RITMOCORE posits a shift from buying devices to buying services, where payments are outcome based (thus distributing the risk between the parties) and where services are supported by advanced information and communications technology (ICT) systems that make remote monitoring possible.</jats:p>"

In addition, diesel power plants require regular maintenance, have a relatively short service life during continuous operation and produce a large amount of emissions into the environment. This article discusses various methods of placing solar panels in the space for the autonomous power supply of weather station equipment. The principles of these methods are described and their advantages and disadvantages are outlined. The optimal algorithms of functioning for photomodules are described and their comparison regarding the main, significant parameters is carried out. The choice of the most effective algorithm for use at a weather station is made. The effective positioning of solar panels is also calculated, and positioning conditions are determined depending on the territorial location and various environmental conditions. Simulation of the power supply system of a weather station consisting of solar panels, batteries and inverters is performed. As a result, a practical example of the application of the method of selecting the optimal composition of equipment for a hybrid power system of a weather station territorially located in Siberia with different configurations of equipment is considered. In numerical terms, it was possible to reduce the cost of power equipment operation by more than 60% with a fairly low payback period of 5.5 years and an increased reliability of the power system, which is very important for autonomous power systems of northern weather stations.</jats:p>"

Different thematic layers like hydrogeomorphology, land use/land cover, lithology, slope, topographic wetness index, drainage density, normalized difference vegetation index, lineament density, and aspect were prepared and processed with suitable weights on Saaty's scale. The delineated groundwater potential zones in the study area were categorized as low, moderate, and high. The results showed that approximately 49.38% (130.85 km2) of the total study area has a low potential for groundwater. The moderate zone includes approximately 35.5% (94.07 km2) and the high potential zone includes only 15.05% (39.88 km2) of the area. The potential map was validated with a 70.6% prediction rate using the spatial distribution of the springs in the area. The analysis shows that hydrogeomorphology, LULC, and lithology have a significant control on the occurrences of groundwater. The study signifies the scarcity of groundwater resources, which needs a better management plan and strategies for sustainable use.</jats:p>",

We find that total broccoli supply chain costs and food miles increased in the period 2007–2017. Nevertheless, eastern-grown broccoli has contributed to reducing regional food miles in the eastern region (from 365 miles in 2007 to 255 miles in 2017) and experienced only modest increases in supply chains costs (a 3.4% increase, compared to a 16.5% increase for broccoli shipped from western US) during the same period.

Secondary data from 394 firms operating in China show that four organizational groupings—brown, light brown, light green, and green—firms exist. Multinomial logistic regression results show that larger firms and firms in the electronics industry are more likely to be greener, indicating that firm size and industry play a strong role in discriminating GSCM practice adoption. Interestingly, no differences between domestic and foreign‐owned firms exist, implying that the gaps in institutional perspectives between Chinese domestic and non‐domestic ownership may be disappearing. This study provides practical implications for strategic benchmarking of GSCM practices. The results also have broader implications for firm operations within China and Chinese firms competing elsewhere.</jats:p>",

Decision makers need to choose a partner wisely to increase the profitability of the entire supply chain, especially in the competitive e-commerce environment. In this paper, we examine a two-echelon e-commerce supply chain with one retailer and one supplier using the most popular wholesale price contract to facilitate collaboration. Traditional research has shown that the classical expectation model cannot coordinate the supply chain. We apply the focus theory of choice to describe the retailer’s behavior as a follower, and we examine the impact of the retailer’s pricing decisions on the supplier under different focus preferences and the coordination for the entire supply chain. The lower the parameter φ, which represents the degree of positivity, and the higher the parameter κ, which represents the level of confidence, the closer the profit of the whole supply chain is to the coordination result—both are visualized through numerical experiments and images. In the case of φ determination, the lower the κ, the better the supply chain coordination. The finding implies that the retailer may be able to coordinate the supply chain and produce better results than the expectation model when he or she makes choices using a positive evaluation system that includes both higher levels of optimism and lower levels of confidence. The findings of the FTC model can simultaneously offer a theoretical foundation for expanding collaboration among supply chain participants and management insights for decision makers to choose cooperation partners.</jats:p>"

Responsible buyer direct financing has emerged as an important solution to motivate supplier ESR by pegging the interest rate to the supplier's ESR level. Motivated by real practices, we develop game‐theoretical models to explore the value of conducting blockchain‐assisted due diligence to inspect the borrowing supplier's ESR qualification in a two‐tier supply chain structure where the downstream buyer directly finances the capital‐constrained supplier. Conventional wisdom tells us that driving greater supplier transparency (e.g., conducting blockchain‐assisted due diligence) will motivate the supplier to strengthen environmental and social compliance. However, we identify the necessary and sufficient “backfiring condition” under which the blockchain‐assisted due diligence may “backfire” by reducing the supplier's ESR efforts. The supplier devotes more ESR efforts if and only if the due diligence cost is sufficiently high. Our result implies that the heavy cost of adopting blockchain technology is not necessarily bad from the responsibility perspective as long as the backfiring condition does not hold. Moreover, we identify the Pareto zone in which conducting blockchain‐assisted due diligence could benefit both supply chain members. We extend our model by examining the impact of a shift from profit orientation to social welfare orientation. Our findings provide managerial insights into the implementation of blockchain‐assisted due diligence to enhance supplier ESR and improve supply chain members’ profits.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Plants have evolved complex mechanisms to adapt to nutrient-deficient environments, including stimulating lateral root proliferation into local soil patches with high nutrient content in response to heterogeneous nutrient distribution. Despite the widespread occurrence of this phenomenon in soil, the effect of heterogeneous nutrient distribution on the accumulation of secondary compounds in plant biomass and their exudation by roots remains largely unknown. This study aims to fill this critical knowledge gap by investigating how deficiency and unequal distributions of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and iron (Fe) affect plant growth and accumulation of the antimalarial drug artemisinin (AN) in leaves and roots of <jats:italic>Artemisia annua</jats:italic>, as well as AN exudation by roots. Heterogeneous N and P supplies strongly increased root exudation of AN in half of a split-root system exposed to nutrient deficiency. By contrast, exposure to a homogeneous nitrate and phosphate deficiency did not modulate root exudation of AN. This indicates that a combination of local and systemic signals, reflecting low and high nutritional statuses, respectively, were required to enhance AN exudation. This exudation response was independent of the regulation of root hair formation, which was predominantly modulated by the local signal. In contrast to the heterogeneous supply of N and P, heterogeneous Fe supply did not modulate AN root exudation but increased AN accumulation in locally Fe-deficient roots. No modulation of nutrient supply significantly changed the accumulation of AN in <jats:italic>A. annua</jats:italic> leaves. The impact of a heterogeneous nitrate supply on growth and phytochemical composition was also investigated in <jats:italic>Hypericum perforatum</jats:italic> plants. Unlike in <jats:italic>A. annue</jats:italic>, the uneven N supply did not significantly influence the exudation of secondary compounds in the roots of <jats:italic>H. perforatum</jats:italic>. However, it did enhance the accumulation of several biologically active compounds, such as hypericin, catechin, and rutin isomers, in the leaves of <jats:italic>H. perforatum</jats:italic>. We propose that the capacity of plants to induce the accumulation and/or differential exudation of secondary compounds under heterogeneous nutrient supply is both species- and compound-specific. The ability to differentially exude AN may contribute to <jats:italic>A. annua</jats:italic>’s adaptation to nutrient disturbances and modulate allelopathic and symbiotic interactions in the rhizosphere.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a systematic literature review to explore the available peer-reviewed literature on how big data is widely optimised and managed within the supply chain management context. Although big data applications in supply chain management appear to be often studied and reported in the literature, different angles of big data optimisation and management technologies in the supply chain are not clearly identified. This paper adopts the explanatory literature review involving bibliometric analysis as the primary research method to answer two research questions, namely: (1) How to optimise big data in supply chain management? and (2) What tools are most used to manage big data in supply chain management? A total of thirty-seven related papers are reviewed to answer the two research questions using the content analysis method. The paper also reveals some research gaps that lead to prospective future research directions.</jats:p>",

The optimum pricing and CER strategies within both decentralized and centralized systems, respectively, are analyzed. The Stackelberg game is used in the decentralized system to determine the optimum PBM’s CER level and the retailer’s pricing. By analysis, it concludes that increasing the carbon trading price can stimulate prefabricated construction corporations to improve their CER level, and that the government subsidy rate has a great effect on the profits of the PBM. Numerical examples with sensitivity analysis are used to further evaluate the roles of important factors in the optimum CER and pricing solutions of the prefabricated building CLSC in two dissimilar systems.</jats:p>"

The proposed H–H configuration of modular EV powertrain system includes four voltage source inverters that combine the power modules with the open ends of the windings (OEW) of the module machine armature, and provide control of their operation. Based on the developed mode system of the OEW machine module operation for EV traction and braking, a general control algorithm for the proposed configuration of the modular EV powertrain system has been developed. It combines the control of the operating modes with the functions of maintaining the required SOC level of the SCM and equalizing the SOCs of the two battery modules.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ecological security pattern construction is a fundamental approach to ensuring regional ecological security and enhancing human welfare. Taking Henan Province, a typical region of China’s main agricultural production area, as the study area, we use multi-source spatial data to calculate the high-value areas of ecosystem services and identify ecological source sites. On the basis of calculating the degree of land use development and GDP per land and population density to determine high-demand areas of the ecosystem, the ecological resistance surface coefficient is modified with nighttime lighting data, and the ecological corridor between the source site and the high-demand area is extracted using the minimum cumulative resistance model, so as to construct and optimize the regional ecological security pattern. The following results are presented. (1) The total area of ecological source sites in Henan Province is 3.02 × 104 km2, accounting for 18.12% of the total study area, which is concentrated in the mountainous areas of East Henan and South Henan. (2) The high-demand area of ecosystem services has a total area of 4.1 × 104 km2, accounting for 24.73% of the total study area, mainly concentrated in the central and eastern regions of Henan, with poor spatial matching of ecosystem service supply and demand. (3) The total length of ecological corridors is 1062.3 km, and the overall pattern forms the main corridor axes. The identification of ecological corridors focuses on the ecological demand space and puts forward suggestions for the optimization of the regional ecological security pattern based on it.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the goal of carbon reduction, China has carried out a series of institutional reforms and innovations in renewable energy consumption. However, the existing allocation rules for peak-shaving costs concentrate on the power side only. In the context of high energy penetration rates, peak-shaving cost significantly increases, and the economic pressure on the power side sharply increases. As the beneficiaries of peak shaving, the load side, while enjoying clean energy, also needs to bear the responsibility of peak shaving and share part of the peak-shaving cost. In this regard, this paper proposes a peak-shaving cost allocation mechanism considering load-side participation. First, it uses the marginal contribution theory to establish the peak-shaving value evaluation model of the power and load. Then, based on the waveform similarity theory, it sets two indicators “Fluctuation Trend Similarity” and “Waveform Amplitude Difference” to evaluate each load’s renewable energy consumption responsibility. Finally, the peak-shaving cost allocation rules on the power source side and the load side are obtained. An example shows that the proposed allocation mechanism can initially realize the uniform distribution of power and load in peak-shaving cost. Furthermore, the method can promote the fairness of the peak-shaving market and guide users to reasonably participate in the peak-shaving market.</jats:p>"

Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) and potassium hydroxide were used to generate hydroxide ions, and their rate to reach the maximum pH was different by more than twofold. The supply rate of hydroxide ions caused the different morphology of ZnO nanomaterial due to the change in the seed of material formation. Although both samples could detect acetone gas up to 100 ppt, ZnO nanobelts synthesized by HMT exhibited higher sensitivity. The ZnO morphology influenced the exposed surface area, and a larger specific surface area could facilitate the generation of pre‐adsorbed oxygen species that are the main factor for sensitivity.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a new\nsystematic approach for selecting and computing SDHIs for monitoring drought\nfor human water supply from surface water and for river ecosystems. We\nrecommend considering the habituation of the system at risk (e.g., a\ndrinking water supplier or small-scale farmers in a specific region) to the\nstreamflow regime when selecting indicators; i.e., users of the DEWSs should\ndetermine which type of deviation from normal (e.g., a certain\ninterannual variability or a certain relative reduction of streamflow) the\nrisk system of interest has become used to and adapted to. Distinguishing four\nindicator types, we classify indicators of drought magnitude (water anomaly\nduring a predefined period) and severity (cumulated magnitude since the\nonset of the drought event) and specify the many relevant decisions that\nneed to be made when computing SDHIs. Using the global hydrological model\nWaterGAP 2.2d, we quantify eight existing and three new SDHIs globally. For\nlarge-scale DEWSs based on the output of hydrological models, we recommend\nspecific SDHIs that are suitable for assessing the drought hazard for (1) river ecosystems, (2) water users without access to large reservoirs, and (3) water users with access to large reservoirs, as well as being suitable for\ninforming reservoir managers. These SDHIs include both drought magnitude and\nseverity indicators that differ by the temporal averaging period and the\nhabituation of the risk system to reduced water availability. Depending on\nthe habituation of the risk system, drought magnitude is best quantified\neither by the relative deviation from the mean or by the return period of\nthe streamflow value that is based on the frequency of non-exceedance. To\ncompute the return period, we favor empirical percentiles over the\nstandardized streamflow indicator as the former do not entail uncertainties\ndue to the fitting of a probability distribution and can be computed for all\nstreamflow time series. Drought severity should be assessed with indicators\nthat imply habituation to a certain degree of interannual variability, to a\ncertain reduction from mean streamflow, and to the ability to fulfill human\nwater demand and environmental flows. Reservoir managers are best informed\nby the SDHIs of the grid cell that represents inflow into the reservoir. The\nDEWSs must provide comprehensive and clear explanations about the suitability\nof the provided indicators for specific risk systems.\n                    </jats:p>"

The paper considers the solution of the problem of designing the inverter mode of the power supply system for connecting the charging station of electric vehicles to the substation of the city of Novosibirsk. The connected charger of an electric vehicle, being a non-linear load, leads not only to an increase in the load on the power grid infrastructure, but can also be a source of power supply. They can also cause a deterioration in the quality of electricity due to the generation of harmonic distortion. Therefore, special attention is paid to the influence of the inverter mode of electric vehicle charging stations on the quality of power supply to the consumer in the power system.

As supply chains compete in a rapidly changing and growing market, the agility of the supply chain provides a significant competitive advantage to firms. An agile supply chain has the ability to respond flexibly and quickly to demands and problems. It benefits companies by adopting the right product, the right customer, the right transportation, and the right supply system. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the agile methods used in the supply chain management processes, and for this purpose, a multi-criteria model consisting of 12 criteria and 9 alternatives was proposed. This proposed model was solved with two-stage multi-criteria solution techniques, and in the first stage of the solution, criterion weights were calculated with the SWARA method, while the evaluation and ranking of alternative agile methods were carried out with the WASPAS method.

The academic literature has well discussed the causes of supply chain (SC) risk events, the impact of SC disruptions, and associated plans for SC resilience. However, the literature remains fragmented on the role of two fundamental elements in achieving SC resilience: the firm's size and the firm's industry as firms' contingent factors.

In addition, this study also aims to show how DMAIC (defined, measured, analyzed, improved and controlled) is operationalized for overall process improvement in ZITRON manufacturing. Lean management takes care of waste across all processes and focuses on speed and time within a firm while Six Sigma is a strategy that focuses on eliminating defects, reducing costs and also reduces process variability. As such, this study utilizes the Lean Six-Sigma approach as a tool to ensure more efficiency is achieved in terms of source, make, delivery and process efficiency. Methodologically, there are five phases in the Lean Six Sigma strategies which are defined, measured, analyze, improve and controlled (DMAIC). The findings show that Lean Six Sigma can help to eliminate waste, and cost-reduction, and help eliminate variations in processes within the manufacturing. However, SIX SIGMA tools have been used to solve the problem which is a delay in processes in manufacturing. Based on this research paper, focuses on the manufacturing problem which is a delay in processes. By using Six Sigma, the problem that existed in manufacturing has been solved through process improvement. This work is originally following a self-method in which the data is collected by using observation techniques to identify the existing problem and solution-seeking within the manufacturing.</jats:p>"

Multiple ventilators failed routine tests, including almost all of the ventilators in our intensive care unit. A faulty air compressor had led to water contamination of our centre's supply of medical air. Water entered the pipeline supply of air and, hence the ventilators and anaesthetic machines. The disruption of the machines' proportional mixer valve resulted in unreliable delivery of fresh gas flow. This malfunction was discovered during routine pre‐use checks, and backup ventilators were available to replace the faulty ventilators. A shortage of equipment was averted due to a serendipitous availability of ventilator stockpiles prepared for the COVID‐19 pandemic. Ventilator shortages are commonly described in mass casualty and pandemic scenarios. While there are multiple strategies described in literature to augment and maximise equipment available for mechanical ventilation, stockpiling equipment remains an expensive but necessary component of disaster contingency planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While climate change mitigation is a global concern that all countries must play a role in curbing, the costs and benefits of various strategies across geographic boundaries must be examined from a full supply chain perspective. In countries such as the United States (US) where the transportation sector is a leading source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, switching from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) to electric vehicles (EV) has emerged as one strategy to combat climate change. However, these EVs rely on critical minerals in their batteries, which are sourced largely from the global south, where there are not as many environmental and social protection regulations and practices. One such mineral, Lithium is found mostly in the Lithium Triangle (LT) in the South American countries of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. Lithium mining is negatively affecting natural resources and ecologies in the LT, in turn creating challenges for nearby communities including indigenous people in the area. Science diplomacy could strengthen relationships and communication between Northern and Southern American countries and more equitably distribute the social and environmental costs and benefits of lithium extraction and EV sales and operations. This paper explores how science diplomacy can foster the governance processes and scientific inputs needed to support more sustainable and just supply chains. It demonstrates higher benefits at the use stage of the EV supply chain in North America, and higher costs at the raw materials extraction for lithium in the EV supply chain in South America. This paper also calls attention to standards and measures that could be applied to sustainable mining. We document best practices, lessons learned, and gaps in collaborative potential between interdisciplinary and transitional stakeholders to develop definitions, measures, and goals across the entire supply chain of lithium for EV batteries.</jats:p>"

The research methods include instrumental methods for measuring and controlling thermophysical parameters, a method of mathematical modeling, and methods for comparing and analyzing the results obtained. The results of the work. A study of the influence of temperature regime parameters on the quality of heat supply was carried out on the example of one of the most energy-intensive objects of the district heating system in Chita during two winter months. During the study, the temperatures of the direct and reverse mains water, as well as the temperature of the indoor air in the premises of the facility were monitored. The analysis of the temperatures measured during the study revealed problems in regulating heat consumption that reduce energy efficiency. Based on the analysis, an optimal control method has been developed taking into account the thermal inertia of enclosing structures. Calculations show that the introduction of this method will reduce the deviations of the internal air temperature from the norm and the heating fee.</jats:p>",

Survey data from 310 international salespeople provide initial empirical evidence showing that S-SCM collaboration can positively predict international salesperson performance outcomes. To show that the effect is unique and provide rare empirical evidence, the authors simultaneously account for the effects of multiple forms of cross-functional collaboration (i.e., sales–marketing collaboration and sales–research and development collaboration). Matching the survey responses with objective country-level data, the authors also find that the value of S-SCM collaboration varies across countries. In particular, the positive effects of S-SCM collaboration were amplified by logistics capacity (or “logistics friendliness”) at the country level. The study's findings also indicate that the positive performance returns provided by S-SCM collaboration are even stronger for international salespeople focused on customer acquisition (vs. customer retention). Broadly, the study implies that, for optimal firm performance, those who are responsible for managing global supply chains should coordinate activities with those responsible for selling to global customers. </jats:p>",

The experiments were carried out on 11-12-week-old age guinea pigs, males and females in equal numbers. The animals were exposed to a single total radiation at a dose of 4.5 Gy (sublethal dose, LD 50/30). The studies were carried out on the 7th day after exposure to radiation (at the height of radiation sickness). The development of radiation damage was accompanied by intense erythropoiesis and the appearance of erythrocytes with a high resistance to hemolysis and an increased sedimentation rate. After acute gamma irradiation, depletion of the antioxidant system was noted. It manifested in a decrease in the activity of superoxide dismutase of erythrocytes by 19.7% (p&lt;0.01) and the concentration of serum ceruloplasmin by 21.5% (p&lt;0.01). The content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and their accumulation while the incubation of erythrocytes remained within the normal range. The erythrocytes of the irradiated animals exhibited increased procoagulant and decreased antiheparin activity, which reflects conformational changes in highly radiosensitive fatty acid chains of phospholipids in their membranes. A decrease in the fibrinolytic activity of erythrocytes in irradiated animals was found.</jats:p>",

This work investigates a problem regarding the optimal control of a supply chain by considering product design change in order to enable manufacturers to recover their disrupted supply chain quickly. A two-layer optimization model is developed, in which the lower model is used to optimize the product design change path, and the upper model is used to select the appropriate alternative suppliers and schedule the delivery of customer orders. To solve the developed model, a hybrid ant colony optimization (HACO) algorithm is designed, which is combined with a Gurobi solver and uses some special strategies. The validity of the proposed algorithm is illustrated experimentally through computational tests and systematic comparison with the existing methods. It is reported that the losses caused by supply chain disruptions are reduced significantly. The proposed model and algorithm can provide a potentially useful tool that can help manufacturers decide upon the optimal form of recovery control when a supply chain system experiences a massive supply disruption.</jats:p>"

In the Brazilian Amazon Biome, the state of Pará has become a new agricultural frontier over the last two decades due to a significant increase in soybean cultivation throughout its territory. However, it is essential to understand the associated effects on the environment at every point in the supply chain. This research aims to measure the effects on the environment of the soybean supply chain of two production poles utilising openLCA software and the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology in the northeast (Paragominas) and south (Redenção) of the state of Pará in Brazil. In addition, we determine which is the most efficient route between the shipment port and the ultimate destination. The Recipe Midpoint (H) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methods of environmental impact categories were used in accordance with the cradle-to-grave scope. The BRLUC regionalised model (v1.3) was used to quantify land use change (LUC). According to the observed results, LUC was primarily responsible (between 3.8 and 32.69 tCO2 Eq·ha−1·year−1) for the global warming potential (GWP) of the soybean supply chain when rainforest-occupied land was converted into cropland. The soybean harvest in the Redenção pole is better loaded through the port of Itaqui (TEGRAM), which is in São Luis (state of Maranhão), due to the use of multiple modes of transport (lorry + train), allowing for better logistical performance and less impact on the environment, despite the longest distance (road + railway = 1306 km). Due to the short road distance (approximately 350 km) and consequently lower environmental impact, soybean harvested in the Paragominas pole is better loaded through the ports around Barcarena in the state of Pará.</jats:p>"

As such the research question is whether supply chain management and dynamic flexibility for uplifting micro-entrepreneurial organizations are feasible in Bangladesh. The time of the study is 1st September 2022 to 5th January 2023. The study observed that microenterprises' supply chain management and dynamic flexibility of a micro-organization in Bangladesh are yet to be properly developed. Both the public and private sectors should work simultaneously to get rid of the problem. Local-level planning, the raising of the local economy, and projects/programs for the local sector in both urban and rural areas are being required to properly utilize mega projects as commented by the authors which in turn help to raise purchasing power, removing income inequality and help to develop the economy of the country.</jats:p>",

This paper discusses a closed-loop supply chain composed of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), an authorized remanufacturer (AR), that is licensed by the OEM to carry out remanufacturing activities in the presence of strategic consumers under carbon cap-and-trade regulations. We establish a Stackelberg game model to identify the optimal manufacturing/remanufacturing decisions made by chain members, and compare the impacts of two different carbon allowance allocation rules on the optimal production decisions and profits, and on the environment. The results showed that optimal decisions in a closed-loop supply chain are affected by the carbon price, carbon allowance allocation, and consumer preferences for remanufactured products. In addition, for high-emission enterprises, the grandfathering rule performs better than the benchmarking rule, yielding higher profits and less environmental impact. The government should take into account the actual economic and production technological developments, implement the benchmarking rule for low-emission enterprises, and apply the grandfathering rule to high-emission enterprises.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Since global warming is a crucial worldwide issue, carbon tax has been introduced in the global supply chain as an environmental regulation for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Costs, GHG emissions, and carbon tax prices differ in each country due to economic conditions, energy mixes, and government policies. Additionally, multiple countries have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). While FTAs result in their economic benefit, they also increase the risk of carbon leakage, which increases GHG emissions in the global supply chain due to relocation production sites from a country with stricter emission constraints to others with laxer ones. Method: This study proposes a mathematical model for decision support to minimize total costs involving carbon taxes with FTAs. Results: Our model determines suppliers, factory locations, and the number of transported parts and products with costs, FTAs, carbon taxes, and material-based GHG emissions estimated using the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database. The FTA utilization on the global low-carbon supply chain is examined by comparing the constructed supply chains with and without FTAs, and by conducting sensitivity analysis of carbon tax prices. Conclusions: We found that FTAs would not cause carbon leakage directly and would be effective for reducing GHG emissions economically.</jats:p>"

It is shown that in the diffuser there is a drop in the average velocity upstream, which is typical for all configurations of the supply tubes. It has been established that profiled tubes influence the shape of the velocity field. It was found that the values of turbulence intensity vary from 0.05 to 0.39 (the highest values were typical when air was supplied through profiled tubes).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing demand for energy and the severe environmental and economic repercussions have contributed to the development of renewables options. The scarcity of fossil fuels and their negative effect on the environment have sparked an alarming situation for alternative energy sources that are cleaner and more sustainable. Waste cooking oil is a valuable feedstock for biodiesel production, but it is often disposed of improperly, causing environmental pollution and health hazards. The current waste cooking oil supply chain in Pakistan and other countries is fragmented, inefficient, and often unregulated, leading to a lack of standardization and quality control. The study aims to develop a comprehensive supply chain model that integrates waste cooking oil collection, transportation, processing, and biodiesel production to create a sustainable value chain that benefits the environment, the economy, and society as a whole. The proposed optimization approach reduces the total expenses associated with the activities of the biodiesel supply chain. Modified possibilistic chance constrained programming (MPCCP) is used as a solution technique to represent this uncertainty. The MPCCP model is solved with the assistance of Lingo 18.0, while fuzzy logic demand forecasting was done using MATLAB. Accordingly, the fuzzy logic designer (FLD) simulation was conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of FLD simulation for the particular kind of issue being considered. The research, not only focuses on mitigating environmental and health risks associated with improper waste cooking oil disposal, resulting in reduced pollution and a cleaner environment but it also advocates for the efficient utilization of waste cooking oil as a valuable feedstock for biodiesel production, thereby promoting a more sustainable and renewable energy source. By optimizing supply chain activities and minimizing costs, the research contributes to enhancing economic growth and efficiency within the biodiesel industry. This research encourages further exploration and collaboration among researchers and stakeholders to expand the applications of the proposed model in waste management, renewable energy, and supply chain optimization.</jats:p>"

Transcriptome analysis showed that many genes related to ‘starch and sucrose metabolism’, ‘fructose and mannose metabolism’, ‘linoleic acid metabolism’, ‘fatty acids degradation’ and ‘glycerophospholipid metabolism’ were highly up-regulated at primordium germination period. Metabolomic analysis showed many metabolites regulated by these genes in these metabolism pathways were also markedly accumulated at this period. Consequently, we inferred that carbohydrate metabolism and β-oxidation pathway of palmitic acid and linoleic acid worked cooperatively to generate enough acyl-CoA, and then entered TCA cycle to provide energy for fruiting body initiation.

To help solve these problems, an emergency transit policy to be applied to the logistics path is an effective solution. However, optimal inventory control is needed. This paper proposes an optimization model to control ordering and inventory policies for decentralized and centralized supply chains. The model considers the logistics path damping coefficient, the logistics path acceleration coefficient, and the vehicle loading capacity ratio in emergency transit. Our major findings include the following. First, supply chain profits under centralization are confirmed to be higher than under decentralization. Second, a price discount mechanism can achieve supply chain coordination. Third, the manufacturers in a centralized supply chain are more inclined to choose a logistics path with a high acceleration coefficient in order to let their cargo arrive quickly and to reduce the impact of the lead time demand fluctuations. Finally, the implications of our research results for carbon emission reductions are discussed.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, we conduct research and analysis on grid planning methods under the spot market environment with the goal of maximizing social benefits. Unlike the pricing approach based on historical price data in traditional market simulation processes, a data-driven approach that combines experimental economics and machine learning is proposed, specifically using mixed empirical learning to simulate unit bidding strategies in market transactions. A simulation model for electricity spot market trading is constructed to analyze the performance of the planning results in the spot market environment. The case study results indicate that the proposed planning methods can enable the grid to operate well in the spot market environment, maintain relatively stable nodal prices, and ensure the integration of a high proportion of clean energy.</jats:p>"

However, with so many nodes and links in a network, building a model still requires some simplification. One such simplification is the ‘conservative approach’, which applies the principle of ‘lumped demand’, taking the demand only from nodes at the ends of pipes. Herein, the full effect of lumped demand on key water parameters is analysed, on a large-scale network based on as-built networks of Al Furjan and Dubai Silicon Oasis, Dubai, UAE for different conditions. Epanet and WDNetXL software are used for the analysis, and results show the impact of different levels of skeletonisation on the head and velocity values for the two models. The analysis indicates that the head changes are high for a branched network under the extreme condition of firefighting. It includes the effect of skeletonising local tanks, with changes being higher when all tanks are empty. These findings provide a critical evaluation of the performance of this method for the Middle East region and it is concluded that the considerable velocity changes observed in the models could lead to overdesign. </jats:p>",

The goal is to reduce fuel costs and emissions, including carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, while maintaining power balance and adhering to limit constraints. EED aims to minimize emissions and operating costs while meeting power demands. To solve the multi‐objective EED problem, the supply‐demand optimization (SDO) algorithm is proposed, which employs a price penalty factor approach to convert it into a single‐objective function. The SDO algorithm uses a swarm‐based optimization strategy inspired by supply‐demand mechanisms in economics. The algorithm's performance is evaluated on seven benchmark functions before being used to simulate the EED problem on power systems with varying numbers of units and load demands. Established algorithms like the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Moth‐Flame Optimization (MFO), Transient Search Optimization (TSO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) are compared to the SDO algorithm. The simulations are conducted on power systems with different numbers of units and load demands to optimize power generation output. The numerical analyses demonstrate that the SDO technique is more efficient and produces higher quality solutions than other recent optimization methods.</jats:p>",

The CMFMCs are located in the residential area of a megapolis and include manufacturing and service enterprises, residential and non-residential buildings, and a city logistics node. Demand monitoring and identification of the influence of seasonal and social environmental factors on its fluctuations is considered as a tool for identifying changes in the operating conditions of the water supply system (WSS) for the CMFMC facilities. To identify the typical operating conditions of water supply facilities, an approach is proposed that involves the analysis of daily water consumption profiles (WCPs). The formation of a database, the formation of groups of the same type of daily WCPs, and the construction of typical daily WCPs for typical groups and their description are the main stages of the proposed approach. The database contains a set of classification characteristics that describe the daily water consumption and its unevenness, as well as the shape of the daily WCP. The principal component analysis was applied to determine the dominant components of daily water consumption. A set of morphometric parameters was used to describe the shape of the daily WCPs. The methods of cluster and discriminant analysis were used to identify the influence of seasonality and social factors on water consumption and to form groups of the same type of daily WCPs. The analysis of sets of similar type of daily WCPs for typical days of typical seasons was carried out for a formalized description of the typical operating conditions of water supply facilities. The results of the analysis are the clarification of the equations of the dominant components of daily water consumption, the determination of the average values of the characteristics of daily water consumption, and the construction and description of typical daily WCPs for typical operating conditions of water supply facilities. The research results were obtained on the basis of the data of the monitoring systems for water supply enterprises in Ukraine and Poland in 2021–2022. The obtained results are the basis for planning the water supply process and adjusting the operation modes of WSS pumping stations for the CMFMC, as well as planning power consumption for typical operating conditions, which will contribute to increasing the efficiency of water and electricity use.</jats:p>"

Fifteen water\n            samples were randomly collected from different municipal wards and analyzed for various\n            physicochemical properties, including hydrogen ion concentration (pH), electrical\n            conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO), acidity, total\n            alkalinity (TA), total hardness (TH), arsenic (As), and iron (Fe) concentrations. The\n            results were compared with the Environmental Conservation Rules (ECR) and World Health\n            Organization (WHO) recommended standards. All the physicochemical parameters were found\n            to be within the prescribed permissible limits. The pH values, which ranged from 6.61 to\n            7.73, were neutral to slightly alkaline. The TH value varied from 204 to 284 mg/L,\n            indicating that the supply water type was hard. Hence, it was suggested that the local\n            water treatment plant should soften the water supply before consumption. In the case of\n            DO and Fe, the DO values varied from 2.0 to 3.9 mg/L, which were far below the levels\n            prescribed by the ECR recommended standards. Fe concentration in some areas exceeded the\n            WHO recommended standards, probably due to the corrosion of old metal pipelines and\n            improper treatment of groundwater before distribution in the supply network. The\n            existing water supply in Sirajganj Municipality was at a satisfactory level, but\n            weaknesses in the current water supply management system were identified, and there was\n            a continuous lack of service provisions.

По состоянию на 1 января 2021 г. средневзвешенное содержание подвижного калия снизилось в 17 регионах Нечерноземной зоны, в которых площадь дерново-подзолистых почв составляет более 66% пахотной площади.

Methods: Comparison of the composition and effectiveness of existing disinfectants. Results: The necessity of using various combinations of disinfectants to reduce the likelihood of resistance in microorganisms to biocides is indicated. The most promising method for treating structures is the aerosol method, which allows achieving the necessary disinfection effect with small doses of the reagent. The use of multi-component disinfectants (such as the “Silver Bullet” anolyte and biocide) is safe for humans and the environment due to their composition, it also helps prevent microbial habituation to the substances.

Therefore, firstly, the relationship between building cost–energy consumption–carbon emissions is explored, and then the global optimal calculation model of substation envelope–renewable energy is established, with the lowest life-cycle carbon emission of the substation as the optimization goal. Finally, the validity of the model is verified based on a case study of a typical 110 kV outdoor substation. The model calculation results show that, without considering the cost constraint, Harbin has the highest maximum carbon reduction of 180,350 kg, which is 25.15% and 13.74% higher than the maximum carbon reduction in Shanghai and Haikou, respectively. Furthermore, based on the comparison of the cost and benefits of each carbon reduction technology, a prioritization of various carbon reduction technologies is given for each climate zone. The model established in this paper can provide the optimal configuration of substation carbon reduction technologies with different incremental cost constraints, and provide a reference for the low-carbon design of substations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The influence of COVID-19 on individuals, businesses, and corporations is indisputable. Many markets, particularly financial markets, have been severely shaken and have suffered significant losses. Significant issues have arisen in supply chain networks, particularly in terms of financing. The COVID-19 consequences had a significant effect on supply chain financing (SCF), which is responsible for finance supply chain components and improved supply chain performance. The primary source of supply chain financing is financial providers. Among financial providers, the banking sector is referred to as the primary source of financing. Any hiccup in the banking operational systems can have a massive influence on the financing process. In this study, we attempted to comprehend the key consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic and how to mitigate COVID-19’s impact on Pakistan’s banking industry. For this, three extended hybrid approaches which consists of TOPSIS, VIKOR, and Grey are established to address the uncertainty in supply chain finance under q-rung orthopair probabilistic hesitant fuzzy environment with unknown weight information of decision-making experts as well as the criteria. The study is split into three parts. First, the novel q-rung orthopair probabilistic hesitant fuzzy (qROPHF) entropy measure is established using generalized distance measure under qROPHF information to determine the unknown weights information of the attributes. The second part consists of three decision-making techniques (TOPSIS, VIKOR, and GRA) in the form of algorithm to tackle the uncertain information under qROPHF settings. Last part consists of a real-life case study of supply chain finance in Pakistan to analyze the effects of emergency situation of COVID-19 on Pakistani banks. Therefore, to help the government, we chose the best alternative form list of consider five alternatives (investment, government support, propositions and brands, channels, and digital and markets segments) by using proposed algorithm that minimize the effect of COVID-19 on supply chain finance of Pakistani banks. The results indicate that the proposed techniques are applicable and effective to cope with ambiguous data in decision-making challenges.</jats:p>",

Since most of these problems involve uncertainty and hesitation on the part of decision makers (DMs), various studies have emerged recently that present SCM applications of techniques based on Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTSs) and HFLTS extensions. Given the relevance of this subject and the lack of literature review studies, this study presents a systematic review of HFLTS and HFLTS extension applications to SCM decision-making problems. In order to answer a set of research questions, the selected papers were classified in accordance with a group of factors that are pertinent to the origins of these studies, SCM, HFLTSs, and decision making. The results demonstrated that the Source and Enable processes have been studied with greater frequency, while the most common problems have to do with supplier selection, failure evaluation, and performance evaluation. The companies of the automotive sector predominated in the analyzed studies. Even though most of the studies used techniques based on HFLTSs, we identified applications of seven distinct HFLTS extensions. The main contribution of this study consists of presenting an overview of the use of HFLTSs and their extensions in practical examples of SCM, highlighting trends and research opportunities. It is the first study to analyze applications of decision-making techniques that deal with hesitation in SCM. Therefore, the results can help researchers and practitioners develop new studies that involve the use of HFLTSs and HFLTS extensions in decision-making problems, given that this study systematizes elements that should be considered in the modeling, application, and validation of these methods.</jats:p>"

These are integral for several components placed for example within electric vehicles and wind turbine generators. REE primary production is mainly realized in China (~80%) and no REPM recycling industry has been established. Hydrometallurgical recycling routes lead to iron dissolution (66 wt. % Fe in REPM), while pyrometallurgical approaches that utilize SiO2 risk contaminating the produced iron phase. A two-step process is presented that (i) creates an FeOx-CaO-Al2O3-REE2O3 molten slag at 1500 °C through oxidative smelting and (ii) separates an iron-depleted slag phase (CaO-Al2O3-REE2O3) and a molten iron phase via carbothermic or metallothermic reduction at 1700–2000 °C. The slag has been designed as a selective collector phase and the REE2O3 loading within the bulk slag can reach up 25 wt. % REE2O3 at 1700 °C. The contained minerals within the slag exhibit &gt;40 wt. % REE (a higher REE concentration than in the initial REPM). The resulting phases are characterized via ICP-OES, CS and SEM-EDX. In addition, the first results with regard to the downstream hydrometallurgical processing of the CaO-Al2O3-REE2O3 slag are presented aiming at the recovery of REE2O3, as well as of CaO and Al2O3. The latter compounds are to be reused during the first process step, i.e., the oxidative smelting of REPM. Slag leaching with methane sulfonic acid (MSA) and separation with alternative methods, such as solvent extraction, seems promising. Future work will include slag filtration with the aim to separate REE-rich solid phases (minerals) from the slag and also molten salt electrolysis of the produced REE2O3 oxides.</jats:p>"

This\ncontribution reviews the existing models proposed in the last 35 years and compares two of the most recent geographic information system (GIS)-based models by applying them to 40 catchments in Switzerland. Both models, which we call here the empirical GIS approach (EGA) and fuzzy-logic GIS approach (FGA), consider landslides, debris flows, bank erosion, and mobilization of instream wood as recruitment processes and compute volumetric estimates of LW supply based on three different scenarios of process frequency and magnitude. Despite being developed following similar concepts and fed with similar input data, the results from the two models differ markedly. In general, estimated supply wood volumes were larger in each of the scenarios when computed with the FGA and lower with the EGA models. Landslides were the dominant process identified by the EGA, whereas bank erosion was the predominant process according to the FGA model. These differences are discussed, and results are compared to available observations coming from a unique database. Regardless of the limitations of these models, they are useful tools for hazard assessment, the design of infrastructure, and other management strategies.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability is an element that is increasingly considered within the organisation. Therefore, the aim of this scientific article is to explore the contributions of supply chain management (SCM) to organisational sustainability. The study was based on a closed-ended question distributed to strategic managers from eleven business sectors, and the answers to this question were selected according to our objectives and grouped to generate six questions that were applied through a questionnaire to a total of 220 companies from the three economic sectors, companies that have implemented sustainable SCM practices. The main findings from the descriptive analysis used for the data show that sustainability practices integrated into SCM, such as sustainable sourcing, green design, and supply chain loop. Improving relationships with suppliers and customers by promoting closed-loop corporate social responsibility (CSR) values has a positive impact on organisational sustainability. These practices reduce environmental impact, improve financial performance, enhance reputation, and increase stakeholder satisfaction. The main conclusion of this study is that the adoption of sustainable SCM practices is critical to organisational sustainability. Organisations must prioritise sustainability in their SCM decisions to ensure their long-term success.</jats:p>",

In this paper, four water distribution users are used as categories, and the problem of renewable water resources allocation is transformed into a classification problem, which is included in the category of wireless virtualization processing problems, and wireless virtualization is selected to support the allocation of renewable water resources. Experiments show that the water shortage of the water distribution scheme obtained by the method in this paper is lower than that of the optimal water distribution scheme of the traditional intelligent optimization algorithm. It can also be seen from the water distribution cost and water shortage of a single user that the water distribution effect of the method in this paper is better than that of the traditional intelligent optimization algorithm (P&amp;lt;0.05). It shows that the research on the management and distribution method of renewable water resources based on wireless virtualization not only provides new ideas for dealing with configuration problems but also has important significance for alleviating the shortage of water resources in our country and the management and utilization of renewable water resources.</jats:p>",

In current studies, the influence of these factors is ignored. This paper proposes an electric bus scheduling optimization model based on energy consumption and battery loss. Firstly, the LSTM (long short-term memory) is used to estimate trip energy consumption. Subsequently, these results are combined with the optimization objectives of minimizing the fleet size and battery loss amount. Limitations on the buses’ number, travel time, battery safety thresholds, remaining charge, and total charge are also considered. By controlling the different battery charge and discharge thresholds to minimize battery losses, the goal of sustainability is achieved. NSGA-II (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II) is used to solve the model. The corresponding scheduling and charging scheme are determined. Electric bus route A is taken to validate the predictions. The results show that the annual fleet battery loss value decreases as the fleet size increases. The company has the lowest annual operating cost when the battery charge and discharge thresholds are set to [25%, 85%]. Optimizing the scheduling and charging scheme for electric bus can effectively reduce the operating cost.</jats:p>"

The main attention is paid to the aspects of formation of territorial heat supply systems, which are the basic components of the infrastructure of life support in harsh polar natural and climatic conditions. The impact of the growth of utility tariffs on the structure of consumer spending of households in the northern and arctic regions is assessed. It is shown that the state of the municipal energy sector determines the formation of the socio-economic environment and investment attractiveness of the Arctic munici-palities. Its renewal and modernization are the main conditions that contribute to reducing the rate of migration outflow of the local population, increasing industrial production and the state military–strategic presence in this important macro-region. Despite the predominance of energy sector specialization in the list of leading industrial enterprises, the presence of the necessary fuel and raw materials base and increased inflow of investment resources in the energy sector, there is further obsolescence and reduction of fixed assets of municipal energy supply units as well as the highest level of utility consumer costs in comparison with all-Russian indicators. The conclusion about the loss of previously available territorial infrastructure advantages of the Russian Arctic regions is substantiated: there has been a reduction in the total number of heat sources, territorial energy production, the length of heat communication networks. The increase of these energy threats is a factor limiting the socio-economic growth of Russia’s northern and arctic territories.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study a long‐term service agreement (LTSA) between an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a conventional power generator and a utility firm in the electricity supply chain. The OEM offers the LTSA to the utility firm, which specifies the service fee and the maintenance interval. The utility firm dynamically chooses among different resources (conventional, renewable, or emergency) to meet energy demand. An LTSA contracts on a generator's long‐term production schedule (i.e., the usage time and number of starts). We first characterize that the conventional generator's optimal operating mode (i.e., on or off) follows a two‐threshold policy, which shows a hysteresis phenomenon. Then, the optimal production from different resources can be obtained by minimizing the utility firm's cost of the current period. We prove that the OEM's optimal LTSA design on the maintenance interval and service fee can be solved sequentially, and capture the trade‐off between the service margin and the usage of conventional generator. Our numerical results show that the utility firm starts the conventional generator less often as the maintenance service fee of a start increases and the minimum conventional output decreases. The OEM has incentives to reduce the minimum output to make the conventional generator more flexible, but such improvement may not benefit the utility firm. Finally, increasing renewable penetration leads to more frequent cycling of the conventional generator and less conventional output. With more renewable generation and less conventional and emergency generation, higher renewable penetration reduces the utility firm's cost, the OEM's profit, and the total emission. </jats:p>",

However, there are some dilemmas caused by the extreme limitations of product service life. There has been little research on construction machinery leasing thus far and a lack of description of its unique characteristics in previous models. Focusing on the problem of pricing and coordination, a two-stage model of a leasing closed-loop supply chain based on the practical application of an Industrial Internet platform was proposed. Under centralized and decentralized decision-making scenarios, the prices of leasing and selling, maintenance effort, and recovery rate were calculated, respectively. By using the Shapley value method to optimize the selling price, and the two-part pricing contract to calculate the compensation fee, global profits can be reasonably distributed, while the supply chain can be improved. The effects of different contracts on the improvement of supply chain profit were investigated. Additionally, the correlation among parameters was explored via sensitivity analysis and numerical simulation. The findings show that the maintenance and recycling of construction machinery can be improved by using an Industrial Internet platform while achieving supply chain coordination via contracts. The enhancement of maintenance effort can decrease remanufacturing costs, which are positively correlated with the selling price and leasing price of products, further promoting the recovery rate of used products. The findings of this paper show that manufacturers can take advantage of the Industrial Internet platform to improve recycling efficiency as well as to decrease product prices and remanufacturing costs by promoting remanufacturing technologies. On the other hand, leasers need to enhance the maintenance of construction machinery. Strengthening cooperation via contracts can jointly promote leasing and recycling in the construction machinery industry and help achieve low-carbon sustainable development.</jats:p>"

In this paper, based on the synergy theory and by considering the green development of the supply chain, with logistic model deduction of the trading volume of the supply chain as the system order parameter, system dynamics simulation is performed, showing the influence of the coevolution mechanism of various subsystems and the complex evolution game process on the stability of the supply chain. These results indicate that excessive coevolution among subsystems is not conducive to the supply chain when it enters a stable and orderly state. Only when the coevolution ability is controlled within a certain range can each subsystem achieve maximum profit. At the same time, the simulation results demonstrate the positive impact of coevolution on the stability of the supply chain. Sensitivity analysis shows that environmental factors such as the recycling rate of rotten products and the levels of government regulation and environmental ethics regulation have a positive impact on the stability of the supply chain, for which the larger the climate impact factor is, the less conducive it is to the stability. This research report provides some guidance for the sustainable development of the fresh agricultural products supply chain. </jats:p>",

Presumptive HFB isolated from Nivens medium and Violet Red Bile Glucose (VRBG) agar were screened for histamine forming ability in Tripticase soy broth (TSB) supplemented with 1.0% L-histidine. HFB isolates were characterized by sequencing approximately 1400 bp of the 16S rDNA. Seven isolates that produced histamine in the range of 3000–4000 ppm in TSB isolated from ice samples, and a swab sample collected from the boat deck, were confirmed as Klebsiella aerogens (n=6) and Morganella morganii (n=1) respectively. Hafnia alvei (n=1), Serratia sp. (n=2), Citrobacter freundii (n=1), Rahnella sp. (n=1) and Aeromonas salmonicida (n=8) were also among the isolated histamine forming bacteria. Pseudomonas sp.

The natural ecosystems in the Kaidu-Kongque River Basin have experienced severe ecological degradation in recent years, and the ES supply and demand were contradicted due to water scarcity and excessive water utilization. In this paper, the supply–demand of five key ecosystem services were evaluated, and their spatial matching was also analyzed to provide total insights. The services assessed were food supply, water yield, carbon sequestration, habitat quality, and windbreak and sand fixation. We utilized various models, including InVEST, RWEQ, and GeoDa, to quantify and analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem service supply and demand between 1990 and 2020. Our findings indicate that the supply and demand for all ecosystem services in the basin have increased over the last 30 years. However, the spatial distribution of supply and demand for each ecosystem service is not completely consistent. Except for windbreak and sand fixation, where supply exceeds demand, there is a spatial mismatch between supply and demand for each service. Furthermore, we observed a positive and synergistic correlation between the supply and demand of each ecosystem service, with water yield services being the dominant and limiting factor. The spatial correlation between the supply and demand of ecosystem services was dominated by “low supply—low demand”, “high supply—high demand” spatial matching, and “low supply—high demand” mismatch, which could explain the variation in water yield from upstream to downstream. Based on our findings, we recommend policies and recommendations for ecological conservation and sustainable development in the Kaidu-Kongque River Basin. The ES supply and demand will become more reliable by increasing water supplies in the middle and lower reaches of the basin. Our results provide illumination for the maintenance and sustainability of ecosystem services in arid regions.</jats:p>"

On the one hand, the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is used to find the optimum air supply parameters for different target temperatures at multiple demand points. The one-parameter, two-parameter and three-parameter cases were considered, respectively, and the parameters obtained from the search for optimisation were verified, yielding mean deviations of 0.405 K, 0.368 K and 0.380 K and mean errors of 1.48%, 1.61% and 1.68%, respectively. The accuracy of the reconstructed results of the POD method and the reliability of the POD method for finding the best results are verified step by step with the help of the experimental platform. The validation results show that the average error between the reconstructed data and the experimental data for the POD method does not exceed 5%; the average errors between the measured and set demand temperatures at the target point are 1.2% and 0.8%. On the other hand, the gappy POD method is used to accurately fill in the elements of the system with arbitrary missing data and to reconstruct the flow field in the presence of missing (gappy) data with a limited number of sensors combined with POD. The errors of the gappy POD method reconstruction are 0.54% and 1.75%. POD and gappy POD methods can better create non-uniform temperature fields in practical scenarios according to actual needs. The results of the study can provide a methodological reference for real-time reconstruction and real-time control of the indoor flow field environment. It also serves as a help and suggestion for the actual project in terms of end-regulation system and reverse design method.</jats:p>"

The study takes into account the components of the time characteristics of the performance of preparatory work when establishing cooperation with institutions and organizations, as well as the direct service of the exporter. The application of the developed model in practical activities will provide an opportunity for exporters to obtain information about the duration and reliability of the stages of a foreign trade operation and the feasibility of involving consulting enterprises in cooperation. At the same time, the simulation results reflect the performance indicators of the proposed supply chains when delivering goods by road transport along various routes. The proposed simulation model will make it possible to reduce the time spent searching for links in the formation of a supply chain by 8–12 %, and the duration of a foreign trade operation by 10–14 %. Thus, the reliability of cooperation with intermediary organizations will increase by 8–11 %</jats:p>"

It is required to develop and study the effectiveness of the use of an autonomous power supply station with a variable speed based on a low-power frequency converter to reduce its cost with the possibility of saving ICE fuel by controlling the frequency as a function of the load. The description of the power plant and its control system is made at the structural and functional level. The study of its characteristics is carried out by means of computer simulation in the Delphi software package. To assess the potential fuel efficiency of the power plant, a multi-parameter characteristic of the YaMZ-238 internal combustion engine is used. The functional diagram of the power plant, the structural diagram of its control system without the use of a speed sensor are presented. The time diagrams for modeling work on an asymmetric load and its energy characteristics are given. It is shown that the developed power plant allows to provide an effective ICE speed control range of at least 2 with the limitation of the rated power of the converter at the level of 20 % of the rated power of the load. Thus, it creates the preconditions for significant fuel savings. The use of the power supply station in the proposed design makes it possible to reduce its cost by reducing the power of the converter and increase its energy efficiency by controlling the speed of ICE with a satisfactory accuracy of the output voltage under conditions of a significantly asymmetric load.

A general framework was provided for rainfed cultivation of wheat in arid and semi-arid regions. Moreover, the best time and amount of complementary irrigation and its effect on increasing yield production have been evaluated using grey wolf optimization algorithm. The results showed that rainfed cultivation of wheat in a humid regime could be suggested without complementary irrigation. Conducting two complementary irrigations in semi-humid regime can increase the final yield of wheat by more than 150 kg/ha. The maximum yields in sustainable management were obtained 4,844, 4,510, and 4,408 kg/ha for Longnan, Tianshui, and Dingxi, respectively.</jats:p>",

Before designing a clinical trial, researchers require a clear understanding of the potential therapeutic benefit cannabis medicines may have, the form and formulation of the product, and the dose to be investigated. Researchers must also be aware of the applicable pharmaceutical regulations in the country or jurisdiction where the research is to be undertaken, as well as manufacturing or licensing regulations that may be imposed at the source of the cannabis product. Importantly, collaborations with industry are a key to the successful outcome of cannabis medicines clinical trials.

The state and interstate regulation of the energy market, which manifests itself in the adoption of strategic trade and political decisions, requires the development and implementation of market mechanisms for the adaptation of supply chain participants and the creation of new economic ties. A customer-oriented approach to the design of supply chains in the energy market defines the introduction of digital technologies and services to create a more comfortable customer environment: increased transparency and ease of use, interconnection with other services, cheaper energy. There are defined the main directions of the introduction of digital logistics technologies and services. It is revealed that the differences in the design of supply chains in the energy market, taking into account their renewability, are based on the object of material flow management. In the supply chains of non-renewable energy sources, the object of management is resources (coal, oil and petroleum products, gas and gas chemistry products, etc.) and processes aimed at their exploration, production, processing, transportation, storage and consumption. In the supply chains of renewable energy sources, the object of management is the generated electric energy, as well as equipment and technologies for its production and storage – turbines for nuclear and hydroelectric power plants, wind generators, solar panels, storage devices for storing electric energy, etc. It has been inferred that certain digital logistics technologies and services in international supply chains on the energy market will take place subject to the resource renewability.</jats:p>",

It has been shown that Si availability can modify nutrient-use efficiency (e.g., N and P) of some Si-accumulating plants. However, it is unclear how Si availability might alter N uptake and assimilation between Si-accumulating plants such as bamboo compared to other species, particularly for different chemical forms such as ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−). To explore the influences of Si availability on uptake and assimilation rates for different forms of inorganic N between bamboo and other trees, we selected one-year-old seedlings of bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) and three other native subtropical species, namely Phoebe bournei, Schima superba, and Cunninghamia lanceolata. We applied three levels of Si and 15N tracers in a pot experiment and then measured the concentrations of Si (total Si, soluble Si, and exchangeable Si), C, N (total N, NH4+-N, and NO3−-N), and N uptake and assimilation rates for both roots and leaves. We found that there were higher inorganic N root uptake and assimilation rates for bamboo compared to other species, likely due to higher biomass accumulation and quicker turnover of fine roots. Moreover, Si supply did not change the uptake preference for N forms or overall uptake and assimilation rates in most species; however, a high concentration of the Si supply slightly increased NO3−-N uptake and assimilation rates in fine roots and leaves of P. bournei, particularly immediately following the addition of Si. These results have implications for predicting the coexistence and competition between bamboo and other trees through the uptake and assimilation of different forms of inorganic N (i.e., high Si-accumulating plants compared to other plants), particularly when Si availability is altered in ecosystems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The work examines the starting points on the formation of fuel markets in Europe within the framework of the concept of sustainable development of the countries’ economics, taking into account the main limitations, primarily the climatic and environmental consequences of fuels combustion. This approach has led in the past years to simultaneous increase in absolute volumes’ consumption of mineral (organic, carbon-rich) fuel’s flow rate and to reduction of their shares in the overall fuel balance. The relevant changes had occurred because of simultaneous production and consumption the alternative fuels, including renewable gas and energy sources. New schemes, methods and ways of fuel supply have been analyzed, including maritime transportation of liquefied fuels (liquefied natural gas LNG, liquid hydrocarbons LPG, ammonia NH3) along with creation of a modern tanker fleet with floating and land-based regasification and gas storage (FSRU) systems; systems of interconnecting the pipelines for fuel supply, including hydrogen-enriched natural gas (HENG). According to the cultivated opinion, the global warming is considered as a consequence of the carbonization of environment due to emission of C-rich combustion products (CO2) into the atmosphere. The specified contribution of CO2 to atmospheric pollution is caused by the insufficient efficiency of fuel use, for example, in heating furnaces (up to 40 % of the total amount of fuel consumed in the industry is burned in furnaces). If the emissions value of a conventional natural gas combustion systems in furnaces meets the level of emissions up to 0.45 kg СО2/kW.h, then in the case of equipping the furnace with an efficient waste gas heat recovery system, the emissions are reducing to 0.2–0.25 kg СО2/kW.h, (Wunning J.). The determinant role of the efficiency of fuel use ηf has been correlated with the scale of atmospheric pollution with greenhouse gases (CO2) emission by means of thermodynamic analysis of energy efficiency. The efficiency of fuel utilization: by enthalpy ηH and by exergy ηeff — has been computed for the cases of burning the widespread fuels and the comparative analysis has been performed. The calculations of thermal energy characteristics of the fuels have been carried out by using the original author’s methodology based upon assumption of equilibrium thermodynamics for the cases of using  the widespread gas fuels within the temperature range T from the standard T0 to the theoretical combustion temperature TT. In accordance with original author’s method the most important heat engineering characteristics of the fuels have been studied by means of approaches of equilibrium thermodynamics. Higher and lower combustion heat, higher and lower Wobbe numbers, theoretical (adiabatic) combustion temperature of the widespread fuels have been determined. An influence of hydrogen content in CH4/H2 gas fuel mixtures on the mentioned properties has been determined. From the list of firing engineering characteristics, the formation of the methane number MN for different organic and alternative fuels have been considered. The accumulated numerical values of MN for the widespread types of fuels have been stated and compared. Bibl. 38, Fig. 4, Tab. 1.</jats:p>"

Many business scenarios in the supply chain network have been highly important in research areas.

Yet, it is difficult to maintain security at every blockchain level, whereas it is suggested to use “public–private key cryptography.” The fundamental goal of this research work is to present new privacy preservation of data using hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms with blockchain technology. The secured supply chain network is built with blockchain technology. The privacy preservation of data sharing in blockchain technology is handled by the electric fish-Harris hawks optimization (EF-HHO). This new algorithm is utilized for the key generation phase of two processes like “data sanitization and restoration.” The optimal key generation follows a multi-objective problem is solved by the variables like “Hiding Failure (HF) rate, information preservation (IP) rate, and false rule (FR) generation, and degree of modification (DM)”.

Our results revealed that all three independent variables (organization, technology, and environment) positively affect both the supply chain management of pharmaceutical companies and, furthermore, the overall business effect.. Therefore, the overall business value of a company can likely be realized through dynamic adoption of big data in terms of organizational, technical, and environmental aspects, and that it can respond quickly through various surveys and systematic analysis in the rapidly changing market.</jats:p>",

Here, a two‐stage strengthened distributionally robust optimization (DRO) scheme is proposed for theself‐scheduling of a combined heat and power virtual power plant (CHP‐VPP) over a coupled electric power network (EPN) and district heating network (DHN). The CHP‐VPP operator maximizes its profits in the day‐ahead market and minimizes its cost in the real‐time market under the worst‐case realization of the uncertainties. Instead of assuming that the uncertainties follow known probability distributions or confidence bounds, a strengthened ambiguity set based on moment information and Wasserstein metric is built to provide more accurate characterizations of the true probability distribution of uncertainties. In addition, in order to enhance the flexibility of the system, a HOMIE model considering indoor activities and outside temperatures of each building is built to satisfy the comfortable indoor temperature. To make the whole problem tractable, linearisation and duality theory are adopted, and then a tailored column‐and‐constraint generation algorithm is developed to solve the problem. The validity and applicability of the strengthened DRO scheme are verified by an IEEE 33‐bus EPN and 14‐node DHN.</jats:p>",

In this study, we used qPCR to quantify and monitor green algae and cyanobacteria in Longhu Lake. Our results showed that green algae were dominant in Longhu Lake, accounting for 71.80–80.31%. The temporal and spatial dynamics of green algal blooms were consistent with that of total organic nitrogen (TON), indicating that organic nitrogen may be the key trigger of green algal blooms. Nitrogen and phosphorus were excessive, and the peak of ammonia nitrogen occurred during the blooms, implying that ammonia nitrogen may be one of the important factors stimulating green algal blooms. Spearman correlation analysis and RDA analysis showed that green algae and cyanobacteria were positively correlated with water temperature, TON, and ammonia nitrogen, indicating that they have similar favorable growth conditions in Longhu Lake. Our results indicated that the combined effects of elevated water temperature, excessive nitrogen and phosphorus, non-stratification, and short water retention time could favor the competitive dominance of green algae in Longhu Lake. The findings here improve our understanding of the competition between green algae and cyanobacteria in shallow lakes.</jats:p>",

This endorheic ecosystem is highly dependent on the annual flood that brings freshwater from the highlands of Angola to the North. However, in many places, the groundwater of the Delta is saline and contains very high concentrations of metal and metalloid elements, making it toxic to the flora and fauna. These saline waters have been largely studied and their formation is generally explained through evaporation and evapotranspiration processes. However, no studies have investigated the geochemical composition of the sediments that host the aquifers. Here, we provide a complete sedimentological and geochemical investigation (major, traces and rare earth elements, carbon and oxygen stable isotopes ratios, Sr and Nd isotope ratios) of the various geomorphological and ecological compartments that form the landscape of the SW Okavango Delta. We demonstrate that the non‐connected underground aquifer is capped by a clay layer corresponding to a major event of dust deposition from the Makgadikgadi pan. We suggest that this aquifer may extend outside the island, below the floodplain and that the hydrological structure of the Nxaraga area is indeed composed of two non‐connected aquifers of different origins. Challenging the model based on evaporation and evapotranspiration, we propose that the composition of that allochtonous clay and the in situ reactions between sediment, water and organic matter in a confined aquifer explain the geochemical enrichment of the water.</jats:p>",

The land’s spatial ecological restoration zones were determined, and the optimization strategies based on the supply–demand matching and coordination relationship were presented. The results revealed the following: (1) A considerable difference was identified between the supply and demand of ecosystem services in Liangjiang New Area of Chongqing, with “high in the northeast and low in the southwest” spatial patterns for supply and “high in the southwest and low in the northeast” spatial patterns for demand; (2) The supply–demand matching relationship of ecosystem services in Liangjiang New Area of Chongqing was characterized by spatial mismatches of high supply and low demand and low supply and high demand, with an average coordination degree index of 0.2, indicating uncoordinated supply and demand; (3) Based on the supply–demand relationship of ecosystem services, the regional ecological base, and the functional orientation of upper planning, Liangjiang New Area was divided into four zones: high supply–low demand, low supply–high demand, and high supply–high demand zones, for which the respective optimization strategies were presented.

Most studies evaluate the quality of life in life circles from either the living environment or public amenity supply perspective, and few adopt a composite perspective of these. This study developed an index system for evaluating the quality of life in life circles from both these perspectives, based on data from Changbai Island, Shenyang. We measured the living environment, amenity service, and quality of life indexes of urban life circles and analysed the spatial relationship between the living environment and amenity services, as well as the spatial effect of public amenities on the quality of life in communities. The findings are summarised as follows: (1) Quality of life tends to decline radially from the east to surrounding areas; (2) Life circles in Changbai Island are arranged in the following descending order according to the quality of life: life circles IV and II (equal), life circle III, and life circle I; (3) Various types of public amenities produce differentiated effects on the quality of life in life circles; specifically, middle schools can significantly improve the quality of life in surrounding communities, whereas community hospitals, large supermarkets, and community shops can have adverse effects if they are extremely close to residential areas. Our findings provide empirical evidence for evaluating the quality of life in urban life circles, evaluating methodology, and referencing for life circle governance.</jats:p>"

Specifically, a conceptual framework for a toolset has been designed in order to introduce a new approach for place-based assessments of change in relative ecosystem service supply in multiple services at a time due to changes in cumulative impacts. Central to the toolset are two pre-existing approaches for relative ecosystem service supply and cumulative impact assessments and tools that facilitate them. The tools take advantage of available data from various sources, including geodata and expert knowledge, and have already been proven to support maritime spatial planning in a real-world context. To test the new approach and demonstrate the outputs, an ecosystem service supply assessment was done manually using the two currently separate tools. The results of the test case ecosystem service supply assessment for the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea are also presented in this paper and illustrate the assessment steps and data needs. Although presently the focus of the illustrative assessment is the Gulf of Riga, the toolset will be able to accommodate analysis of cumulative impacts and service supply of any location, leaving the scope of the assessment to be determined by the objectives of the assessment as well as data availability (i.e., geospatial data availability and extent of expert knowledge).</jats:p>"

The displacement value is assumed to be equal to half the clearance value in the safety bearings of the unit under consideration. A mathematical model of a radial electromagnetic bearing, its design scheme, taking into account the displacement of the center of the magnetic system relative to the axis of rotation, a block diagram of a three-loop control system and formulas for calculating the parameters of regulators are presented. Regulator settings for a specific type of electromagnetic bearings are determined. A calculation model has been developed that makes it possible to study the operation of an electromagnetic bearing when the center of the magnetic system is displaced relative to the axis of rotation and the supply voltage is varied. The results of simulation in the Matlab Simulink software environment of the process of rotor ascent from safety bearings and rotor levitation in a displaced state at different values of the supply voltage are given. It is shown that the voltage reduction by 16.7% ensures stable operation of the electromagnetic suspension of the rotor in all possible modes. Therefore, shifting the center of the magnetic system can reduce the power consumption of electromagnetic bearings by 30%.</jats:p>"

The target energy was accelerated to a maximum of 2.4 MeV–20 mA by introducing a gas stripping device that converts negative hydrogen ions into positive ions. By using the tandem-type accelerator in this way, a high-voltage DC power supply was designed with 1.2 MV–45 mA as the maximum capability. The design was improved to reduce the number of stages of a Cockcroft–Walton voltage multiplier. Hence, the ripple risk of the DC flat top resulting from unwanted stray capacitance was lowered. The overall height and volume of the Cockcroft–Walton voltage multiplier were reduced to less than half those of the existing design method, making miniaturization possible. After such advanced design and manufacturing, performance tests were performed at 750 kV–45 mA under 23 stages of the Cockcroft–Walton voltage multiplier, which is the highest level that can perform at its maximum under in-air conditions. It demonstrated stable performance under in-air conditions without breakdown for 2 h, even at 620 kV–35 mA. To reach the final target of 1.2 MV–45 mA, the groundwork is laid for achieving experimental performance while satisfying the optimal requirements in SF6 gas.</jats:p>",

However, effective coupling between the three aspects at the air/liquid interface remains challenging. Herein, Au@Ag‐Pd trimetallic nanostructure/polystyrene (PS) microsphere Janus structures are designed as the solar absorber and thermal insulator. The Janus structures deposited on a water supply layer act as a 2D interfacial solar evaporator. The PS microsphere localizes heat at micrometer scale and enhances plasmonic absorption of the Au@Ag‐Pd nanocrystals supported on the microsphere. Meanwhile, the Janus structures divide the surface of water supply layer into multiple regions with sub‐micrometer depths, lowering the evaporation enthalpy. Owing to the synergic effects of these components, the evaporator realizes a solar‐to‐vapor conversion efficiency of 99.1% and an evaporation rate of 3.04 kg m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in pure water under 1 sun illumination. The efficient solar‐driven evaporation can last for over 40 h. Furthermore, the solar evaporator shows high‐performance seawater desalination with salt removal ratios of near 100%.

The Janus nano‐micro structure design can be extended to other systems for various solar‐thermal applications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Throughout history, the use of animals for agricultural and forestry work has been closely associated with human societies, with multiple references to animal power being utilized for various tasks since the Neolithic period. However, the advent of industrialization has fundamentally transformed the reality of society, leading to a significant shift towards the mechanization of processes. Despite this, animal traction continues to play an important role as a workforce in many developing countries and developed nations, where there is a renewed interest in the use of animal traction, particularly for tasks intended to have a reduced environmental impact and a smaller carbon footprint. The present study conducted a SWOT analysis to examine the potential of animal traction as an alternative for the recovery processes of forest residual woody biomass, particularly when the use of mechanical equipment is not feasible. This can contribute to the creation of value chains for residual products, which can be harnessed for energy recovery. The utilization of modern animal traction can promote the sustainable development of projects at the local and regional level, with efficient utilization of endogenous resources and the creation of value for residual forest woody biomass. This approach can thus facilitate the optimization of supply chains, from biomass to energy.</jats:p>"

As nitrogen (N) fertilizer price spikes threaten food security, differentiated responses are required to maintain staple cereal yields across over- and underfertilized agricultural systems. Through integrated management of organic and inorganic N sources in high- to low-input cereal production systems, we estimate potential total N-fertilizer savings of 11% in India, 49% in Ethiopia and 44% in Malawi. Shifting to more cost-effective, high-N fertilizer (such as urea), combined with compost and integration of legumes, can optimize N in N-deficient systems. Better targeted and more efficient N-fertilizer use will benefit systems with surplus N. Geospatially differentiated fertilization strategies should prioritize high-N fertilizer supply to low-yield, N-deficient locations and balanced fertilization of N, P, K and micronutrients in high-yield systems. Nationally, governments can invest in extension and realign subsidies to enable and incentivize improved N management at the farm level.</jats:p>"

The rational use of tourism resources is closely related to the increase in tourist flows and the number of accommodation establishments, i.e. tourism demand and tourism supply. The article deals with the relationship between tourist demand and tourist supply, using the example of destinations in Romania, and aims to identify destinations where there is a balance between accommodation units and overnight stays, and how to intervene to reduce the gaps between them. In this sense, quantitative methods such as Spearman and Kendall indicators were used to rank these destinations based on the statistical data provided by Tempo online during the period 2000-2021 for two periods 2000-2019 and 2019-2021. The research results show that highly specialized destinations are the most affected by seasonality. A solution to remedy this situation could come from Destination Management Organizations (DMOs). The study addresses the issue in a crucial period for tourism worldwide, not only in Romania, namely the period characterized by the pandemic COVID -19. Thus, both the period before the pandemic, when tourism reached its highest level, and the period after the pandemic, when a return to a normal situation, but marked by profound changes, is observed, are evaluated. The novelty of the article consists in the creation of a consolidated relationship between the destinations in Romania and the eight DMOs recently established in Romania, in order to allow a better management of the tourist activities.</jats:p>"

This study proposes an IoT water monitoring system in real time that allows the measurement of dissolved oxygen levels in water at several monitoring points in a difficult-to-access location, the Pirapo River, in southern Brazil, responsible for supplying water to large urban centers in the region. The proposed method can be used in urban and rural areas for consumption and quality monitoring or extended to a modern water infrastructure that allows water providers and decision makers to supervise and make optimal decisions in difficult times.

By leveraging the latest technologies of I4.0, pharmaceutical companies can gain real-time visibility into their supply chain (SC) operations, allowing them to make data-driven decisions that improve SC performance, efficiency, resilience, and sustainability. However, to date, no research has examined the critical success factors (CSFs) that enable the pharmaceutical industry to adopt I4.0 successfully to enhance overall SC sustainability. This study, therefore, analyzed the potential CSFs for adopting I4.0 to increase all facets of sustainability in the PSC, especially from the perspective of an emerging economy like Bangladesh. Initially, sixteen CSFs were identified through a comprehensive literature review and expert validation. Later, the finalized CSFs were clustered into three relevant groups and analyzed using a Bayesian best-worst method (BWM)-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework. The study findings revealed that \"sufficient investment for technological advancement\", \"digitalized product monitoring and traceability\", and \"dedicated and robust research and development (R&amp;D) team\" are the top three CSFs to adopt I4.0 in the PSC. The study’s findings can aid industrial practitioners, managers, and policymakers in creating effective action plans for efficiently adopting I4.0 in PSC to avail of its competitive benefits and ensure a sustainable future for the pharmaceutical industry.</jats:p>"

Комбикорм – это сложный продукт, рецептура которого формируется из пшеницы, сои, бобовых, подсолнечника, кукурузы, травяной, костной, кровяной муки, премиксов, витаминного комплекса и других элементов. Ввиду сложности состава комбикорма он имеет ограниченный срок хранения. Целью настоящего исследования было определение параметров установки для упаковки комбикорма в среде углекислого газа в мягкие контейнеры типа Биг-Бэг. Методология. В качестве объекта исследования выступал процесс упаковки комбикорма в мягкие контейнеры в среде углекислого газа. Для исследования применялась установка для упаковки комбикормов, снабженная устройством для подачи комбикорма и газа в мягкие контейнеры. Исследования потребляемой мощности при упаковке комбикорма направлены на обоснование мощности запаивателя при герметизации полиэтиленового вкладыша мягкого контейнера. При этом определялось количество углекислого газа, необходимое для заполнения мягкого контейнере с комбикормом. Использование углекислого газа для обеспечения сохранности комбикорма и его компонентов позволяет практически исключить развитие патогенной микрофлоры при упаковке комбикорма. Результаты. В результате исследования установлено, что для упаковки одного контейнера с комбикормом массой 650 кг. потребляемая мощность запаивателя составила 0,30кВт·ч., при этом масса углекислого газа, необходимого для заполнения мягкого контейнера, составила 0,8 кг. Величина потребляемой мощности запаивателя определялась прибором анализатора качества электроэнергии CHAUVIN ARNOUX C.A 8220. Заключение. Результаты исследований позволили обосновать затраты потребляемой мощности для запаивания полиэтиленового вкладыша мягкого контейнера с комбикормом.

Compound feed is a complex product, the formulation of which is formed from wheat, soybeans, legumes, sunflower, corn, herbal, bone, blood meal, premixes, vitamin complex and other elements. Due to the complexity of the compound feed composition, it has a limited shelf life. The purpose of this study was to establish the parameters of the installation for packaging compound feed in a carbon dioxide environment in soft Big-Bag containers. Methodology. The object of the study was the process of packaging feed in soft containers in a carbon dioxide environment. For the study, an installation for packing compound feed was used, equipped with a device for feeding compound feed and gas into soft containers. Studies of power consumption during the packaging of compound feed are aimed at substantiating the power of the sealer, when sealing the polyethylene liner of the soft container. At the same time, the amount of carbon dioxide necessary to fill the soft container with compound feed was determined. The use of carbon dioxide to ensure the safety of compound feed and its components makes it possible to practically exclude the development of pathogenic microflora during the packaging of compound feed. Results. As a result of the study, it was found that for packing one container with compound feed weighing 650 kg. the power consumption of the sealer was 0.30 kWh, while the mass of carbon dioxide required to fill the soft container was 0.8 kg. The study of the power consumption of the sealer was determined by the CHAUVIN ARNOUX C.A 8220 power quality analyzer. Conclusion. The results of the research made it possible to justify the cost of power consumption for sealing the polyethylene liner of a soft container with compound feed. Research has also established the amount of carbon dioxide to fill a soft container with compound feed, which contributes to the long-term storage of compound feed and its components.</jats:p>",

However, excessive supply on discharge can increase patients’ risk of persistent opioid use and contribute to the reservoir of unused opioids in the community that may be misused. This study aimed to evaluate the use of opioids in Australian surgical patients after discharge and patient satisfaction with the provision of opioid information after discharge. This prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary referral and teaching hospital. Surgical patients were called 7–28 days after discharge to identify their opioid use and the information that they received after discharge. In total, 66 patients responded. Most patients underwent orthopaedic surgery (45.5%; 30/66). The median days of opioids supplied on discharge was 5 (IQR 3–5). In total, 40.9% (27/66) of patients had &gt;50% of their opioids remaining. Patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery were less likely to have &gt;50% of their opioids remaining ( P = 0.045), whilst patients undergoing urological or renal surgeries were significantly more likely ( P = 0.009). Most patients recalled receiving information about their opioids (89.4%; 59/66). However, the majority (51.5%; 34/66) did not recall receiving any information about the signs of opioid toxicity and interactions between opioids and alcohol. In conclusion, around 40% of patients had more than half of their opioid supply remaining after they ceased taking their opioid. Although most patients recalled receiving information about their opioids, more than half did not recall receiving any information about the signs of opioid toxicity or interactions between opioids and alcohol. </jats:p>",

The model was built on the basis of open data sources according to the specific structure of technological methods by L.V. Kantorovich, which, unlike the known ones, uses subsystems for the production of abstract products that correspond to the range of outputs and inputs of the product energy balance, and also uses procedures for their selective aggregation to build various forms of inter-product balance matrices. This allowed us to obtain a tool for forecasting and assessing energy balances that is resistant to the growing limitations of information support, which is distinguished by a new system of conditions for a production-type model for the expanded range of the International Energy Agency's product energy balance, as well as a set of technological methods proposed for the first time by L.V. Kantorovich, which together determined the structure of output, costs and product links of individual producers of the energy supply system within the framework of a mutually agreed multi-product balance. The proposed model provides opportunities for using statistical and technological approaches to determining output and cost coefficients in solving forecasting problems, applying inherent means of analyzing retrospective balances to identify unaccounted volumes of FER, as well as volumes of their consumption and transformation in the country's energy sector with significant changes in the structure of electricity and heat generation capacities. The forecasted volumes of supply of the main types of energy resources obtained in the calculations using the developed energy supply model allowed us to assert that, given the indicators of energy efficiency achieved in 2020, the country's energy supply system is able to meet the country's needs mainly through the development of domestic fuel bases.

Although addressing this challenge requires huge financial investment, the value households attach to accessing private water supply services at their premises is not clear. This study used data from 243 households to determine their willingness to pay (WTP) for private water supply services. The analysis applied the Heckman model to check for sample selection bias, and the contingent valuation method (CVM) to estimate the WTP. The mean WTP was estimated at UGX 203.07 (USD 0.06) per 20 litre jerry can. Socioeconomic and demographic factors that influence WTP were also determined. These findings could guide the design of policies on sustainable water supply and cost recovery in the long run.</jats:p>",

However, despite the wide application of resilience thinking to sustainability research and the multiple dimensions of social-ecological sustainability, it can be difficult to ascertain how to make a supply chain both resilient and sustainable. In this review, we draw upon the socio-ecological resilience and sustainability literature to identify links and highlight concepts for managing and monitoring adaptive and equitable seafood supply chains. We then review documented responses of seafood supply networks to disruption and detail a case study to describe the attributes of a resilient seafood supply system. Finally, we outline the implications of these responses for social (including wellbeing and equity), economic and environmental sustainability. Disruptions to supply chains were categorised based on their frequency of occurrence (episodic, chronic, cumulative) and underlying themes were derived from supply chain responses for each type of disruption. We found that seafood supply chains were resilient when they were diverse (in either products, markets, consumers or processing), connected, supported by governments at all scales, and where supply chain actors were able to learn and collaborate through trust-based relationships. With planning, infrastructure and systematic mapping, these attributes also can help to build socio-ecological sustainability and move towards more adaptive and equitable seafood supply.</jats:p>",

To fill this gap, this study aims to determine the crucial CSCY attributes in I4.0 together with their interrelationships. A hybrid method including text mining, cluster analysis, the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), the fuzzy decision‐making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL), and the analytical network process (ANP) is utilized. Five aspects and 25 criteria from the original set of attributes are validated. In the results, the causal group consists of circular production strategy and technological advancement, while the effect group includes waste circulation, a circular product‐service system (PSS), and circular integration. The critical criteria cover cleaner production, resource efficiency, the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics applications, and industrial symbiosis.</jats:p>",

Two workshops were organised to conceptualise the following scenarios: mobile packaging, cooperative and individual ownership. A novel approach to the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats‐analytical hierarchy process methodology was used to compare stakeholder perceptions and preferences for different scenarios within one case study. Financial benefits played a key role in each collaborative scenario. The most suitable scenario was found to be the mobile packaging, offering flexibility and no initial investment cost while enabling collaborations. The cooperative scenario has the potential for centralised logistics and marketing while being conscious of its organisational structure. Individual ownership should also focus on centralised logistics and marketing while considering food safety and flexibility limitations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Stockyard–port planning is a complex combinatorial problem that has been studied primarily through simulation or optimization techniques. However, due to its classification as non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard), the generation of optimal or near-optimal solutions in real time requires optimization techniques based on heuristics or metaheuristics. This paper proposes a deterministic simulation and a meta-heuristic algorithm to address the stockyard–port planning problem, with the aim of reducing the time that ships spend in berths. The proposed algorithm is based on the ore handling operations in a real stockyard–port terminal, considering the interaction of large physical equipment and information about the production processes. The stockyard–port system is represented by a graph in order to define ship priorities for planning and generation of an initial solution through a deterministic simulation. Subsequently, the Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) meta-heuristic is used to improve the initial solution. The convergence time of VND ranged from 1 to 190 s, with the total number of ships served in the berths varying from 10 to 1000 units, and the number of stockyards and berths varying from 11 to 15 and 3 to 5, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in determining the best allocation of stockpiles, berths, car-dumpers, and conveyor belts. The results also show that increasing the number of conveyor belts is an important strategy that decreases environmental impacts due to exposure of the raw material to the atmosphere, while also increasing the stockyard–port productivity. This positive impact is greater when the number yards and ship berths increases. The proposed algorithm enables real-time decision-making from small and large instances, and its implementation in an iron ore stockyard–port that uses Industry 4.0 principles is suitable.</jats:p>"

Energy-corrected milk production was increased by EAA infusion into 13.2% CP, but not into 14.6% CP diet (p = 0.09), reaching the positive control value. Infusions increased mammary affinity for non-infused EAA (Ile, Phe, Thr, and Trp), allowing the same MPY despite lower arterial concentrations of these AA. Higher arterial concentrations of infused EAA did not increase their mammary uptake and MPY (p = 0.40; p = 0.85).

We focus on the domestic manufacturing ramp-up of surgical masks, respirators, and their intermediary products in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We develop a novel method for timely identification and validation of the evolving state of domestic manufacturing. To unpack the activities of domestic manufacturers and related institutions, we triangulate across 56 qualitative interviews, certifications, Thomasnet.com®, industry associations, and other public data. We find that while large manufacturers could rapidly scale up, onshore, or diversify production to enter into domestic production of critical medical supplies, these large manufacturers alone were insufficient to meet the spike in demand. In face of this shortage, small and medium enterprises (SME), who entered into mask and respirator production as de novo firms, spin-offs, and by diversifying, were important in increasing overall domestic capacity and serving markets unmet by large hospital distributors. These firms often had fewer competencies and resources compared to larger firms, and received less effective government support. Despite these disadvantages, a number of SMEs succeeded in entering into domestic production, and our interviews suggest this capacity could have been better integrated into the national response. We propose new theory for how and when federal and state governments should support short-term economic dynamism (firm entry into target products and/or markets) during crises to address supply shortages, and the types of market and network failures federal or state governments may be most effective at addressing.</jats:p>",

The findings indicate that DIF can enhance the financial performance of construction enterprises, and SCF is one of the mechanisms through which DIF affects the financial performance of construction enterprises. Moreover, the cross-sectional analysis reveals that the impact of DIF on financial performance is more pronounced in firms with characteristics of private capital-holding and high operating pressure.

The hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria Cupriavidus necator efficiently uses CO2 as its sole carbon source, H2 as electron donor and O2 as electron acceptor. Surplus CO2 is stored in microbial storage material poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate. O2 supply is the most critical parameter for growth and poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate formation. A narrow O2 optimum between ~0.2 and ~4 mg/L was previously reported. Here, a standard benchtop bioreactor was redesigned for autotrophic growth of C. necator on explosive mixtures of CO2, H2 and O2. The bioreactor was equipped with mass flow control units and O2 and CO2 sensors. A controller for automated gas dosage based on a mathematical model including gas mass transfer, gas consumption and sensor response time was developed. Dissolved O2 concentrations were adjusted with high precision to 1, 2 and 4% O2 saturation (0.4, 0.8 and 1.5 mg/L dissolved O2, respectively). In total, up to 15 g/L cell dry weight were produced. Residual biomass formation was 3.6 ± 0.2 g/L under all three O2 concentrations. However, poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate content was 71, 77 and 58% of the cell dry weight with 1, 2 and 4% dissolved O2, respectively.</jats:p>"

The current study investigates the relationship between the final product’s green service level and integration and non-integration methods within two separate supply chain models, namely the Nash competition and Stackelberg game models. To attain its goals, the study utilises an inverse derivation technique and comparative analysis. The current study investigates the best integration approach depending on the level of environmental investment in the supply chain’s final product. The findings revealed that the inter-chain rivalry in green investment and the sensitivity coefficient associated with green investment impacted the integration decisions of competing chains in the Nash competition. Furthermore, when the coefficient of the sensitivity to green investment was greater than 0.375, the choice to integrate logistics service supply chains in a horizontal Nash competition was independent of the amount of service competition intensity. In such cases, taking a different strategy than the rival chain might potentially increase the grade of eco-friendly services provided by one’s own chain.</jats:p>"

The paper performs - in a note of originality - a cluster analysis of the European countries by the correlation between the evolution of the graduates with higher education and that of the employment rate of the highly qualified, in order to identify the main behavioral patterns. As a novelty element, the paper tests the hypothesis of the existence of statistically significant changes from the perspective of the share of tertiary graduates and that of the employment rate of highly educated, during the current pandemic crisis compared to the previous global financial crisis. The results indicated an important improvement only of the second indicator, which shows the need to develop policies to stimulate the youth to raise their education level, and thus improve the situation on the labor market, even in crisis times.</jats:p>"

Consequently, the cyber security of the supply chain becomes a major concern as new threats emerge. Cyber ranges can be used to prepare for such cyber security threats by creating realistic scenarios mimicking real-world systems and setups. Organizations can participate in cyber security training and exercises that present them with these scenarios. Cyber ranges can also be used efficiently for research and development activities, because cyber ranges are realistic environments and can be used for the generation of realistic data. The aim of this study is to describe a digital twin of the food supply chain built for cyber range-based cyber security exercises. The digital twin mirrors the real-world situation with sufficient detail, as required by the cyber exercise. This research uses the design science methodology, which describes the construction and evaluation of the proposed system. The study explains the general capabilities of the food supply chain digital twin and its use in the cyber range environment. Different parts of the supply chain are implemented as Node.js services that run on the Realistic Global Cyber Environment (RGCE) platform. The flow of ingredients and products is simulated using an apparatus model and message queues. The digital twin was demonstrated in a real live cyber exercise. The results indicate that the apparatus approach was a scalable and realistic enough way to implement the digital twin. The main limitations of the implemented system are the implementation on one specific platform, and the need for more feedback from multiple exercises. Creation of a digital twin enables the use of cyber ranges to train organizations related to the food supply chain.</jats:p>"

In the CTSmax protocol, warming caused a profound increase in the rate of oxygen uptake (ṀO2), culminating in a gait transition from steady aerobic towards unsteady anaerobic swimming, then fatigue at 30.3±0.4°C (mean±s.e.m.). Gait transition and fatigue presumably indicate an oxygen limitation, which reflects the inability to meet the combined demands of swimming plus warming. The CTmax protocol also elicited an increase in ṀO2, culminating in LOE at 34.0±0.4°C, which is significantly warmer than fatigue at CTSmax. The maximum ṀO2 achieved in the CTmax protocol was, however, less than 30% of that achieved in the CTSmax protocol. Therefore, the static CTmax did not exploit full cardiorespiratory capacity for oxygen supply, indicating that LOE was not caused by systemic oxygen limitation. Consequently, systemic oxygen supply can be significant for tolerance of acute warming in seabass but this depends upon the physiological context and the endpoint used.</jats:p>",

The blades are foldable and made of transparent plastic for reducing the resistance for the oncoming flow, which increases the speed of rotation of the wind wheel. An increase in the efficiency of photovoltaic modules and a reduction in their degradation is achieved due to their rotation around the axis of a truncated pyramid with an octagonal base. A laboratory model was constructed for conducting field experiments and testing the design of the security system.

In this study, the daily monitoring data of one water supply plant from 2021 to 2022 was used to predict the effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) during low temperature and turbid periods by using black box artificial intelligence models (AI), such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Backpropagation Neural Network (BP). The results of a single model show that the DT model has better results than the other single models. In ensemble modeling, the performance of single artificial intelligence models can be improved by using neural network integration. In the validation phase, the ensemble model can improve the prediction accuracy by about 15%. At the same time, the model also obtained a reliable prediction effect in the same region, water source, and the process of the water supply plant.</jats:p>",

However, from the current situation, due to the high uncertainty and challenges of entrepreneurship, China’s college graduates’ willingness to start their own business is generally low, and entrepreneurship policy, as a pioneering factor, has an important influence on college graduates’ willingness to start their own business. This study investigates college graduates in more than 20 representative cities, such as Shenyang, Xi’an, and Hangzhou, and examines the influence path and mechanism of entrepreneurship policy on entrepreneurship behavior based on MOA (Model of Attraction) model. This study used SPSS and AMOS to empirically analyze 288 valid questionnaires, verifying that there is a significant positive relationship between entrepreneurship policy, entrepreneurship willingness, and entrepreneurship behavior of college graduates. Entrepreneurship willingness plays a part in mediating the effect between entrepreneurship policy and entrepreneurship behavior, and the willingness to use entrepreneurship policy moderates the path of influence of entrepreneurship policy on entrepreneurship willingness. At the same time, it provides a reference for the promulgation of government entrepreneurship policies and the optimization of the implementation effect of entrepreneurship policy, provides suggestions for universities to improve entrepreneurship education, and has guiding significance for stimulating the entrepreneurship behavior of college graduates.</jats:p>"

We obtain the following results. (1) Economic policy uncertainty significantly promotes technological innovation in agricultural firms, and this finding holds under various robustness checks, and works mainly through two paths: tightening financial flexibility and highlighting managerial capabilities. (2) From the heterogeneity results, the incentive effect of economic policy uncertainty on technological innovation in agricultural firms is more pronounced in state-owned agricultural firms, basic agricultural firms, and high adjustment cost agricultural firms. (3) Government subsidies strengthen the role of economic policy uncertainty in promoting technological innovation in agricultural firms. The results of this study provide data support for agricultural firms technology innovation decisions and have important implications for the guidance of national economic policy formulation.</jats:p>"

Finally, the set pair analysis-variable fuzzy set model was used to evaluate the risk levels of subsystems, and the risk matrix was applied to assess provincial WEF-R levels in China from 2009 to 2018. The results showed that the stability subsystem had the greatest influence on provincial WEF-R, followed by the sustainability subsystem. The provinces with a higher risk of the stability subsystem and lower risk of the sustainability subsystem were mainly centralized in southeast coastal and central regions, which were consistent with the provinces with better socio-economic development. The provinces with lower risk of the stability subsystem and higher risk of the sustainability subsystem were mainly concentrated in northwest regions, which correspond with the provinces with better natural resources endowment but lower socio-economic development. As for the temporal evolution of risk levels, the risk levels of the coordination and sustainability subsystems showed downward trends during the study period, while the risk level of the stability subsystem displayed a small fluctuation, and the provincial WEF-R level in China presented a decreasing trend.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Nitrogen (N) is a vital major nutrient for rice (<jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic>). Rice responds to different applications of N by altering its root morphology, including root elongation. Although ammonium () is the primary source of N for rice,  is toxic to rice roots and inhibits root elongation. However, the precise molecular mechanism that ‐inhibited root elongation of rice is not well understood. Here, we identified a rice T‐DNA insert mutant of <jats:italic>OsMADS5</jats:italic> with a longer seminal root (SR) under sufficient N conditions. Reverse‐transcription quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the expression level of <jats:italic>OsMADS5</jats:italic> was increased under  compared with  supply. Under  conditions, knocking out <jats:italic>OsMADS5</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>cas9</jats:italic>) produced a longer SR, phenocopying <jats:italic>osmads5</jats:italic>, while there was no significant difference in SR length between wild‐type and <jats:italic>cas9</jats:italic> under  supply. Moreover, <jats:italic>OsMADS5</jats:italic>‐overexpression plants displayed the opposite SR phenotype. Further study demonstrated that enhancement of <jats:italic>OsMADS5</jats:italic> by  supply inhibited rice SR elongation, likely by reducing root meristem activity of root tip, with the involvement of <jats:italic>OsCYCB1;1</jats:italic>. We also found that OsMADS5 interacted with OsSPL14 and OsSPL17 (OsSPL14/17) to repress their transcriptional activation by attenuating DNA binding ability. Moreover, loss of <jats:italic>OsSPL14/17</jats:italic> function in <jats:italic>osmads5</jats:italic> eliminated its stimulative effect on SR elongation under  conditions, implying OsSPL14/17 may function downstream of OsMADS5 to mediate rice SR elongation under  supply. Overall, our results indicate the existence of a novel modulatory pathway in which enhancement of <jats:italic>OsMADS5</jats:italic> by  supply represses the transcriptional activities of OsSPL14/17 to restrict SR elongation of rice.</jats:p>",

It is noted that with increased rain intensity and, accordingly, increased puddle formation in the zone of movement of running systems, intensive rutting is observed, leading to a bend in the water supply pipeline and, ultimately, to the operation of the protection system. This drawback has a negative impact on the shift time utilization rate and, consequently, on the overall performance of the SM. A progressive decrease in the intensity of the SM water supply is proposed to be used to eliminate it, which will lead to an increase in the bearing properties of the soil. It was determined that when working on slopes, the rain intensity at the end of the SM is 0.4 mm/min. It has been experimentally established that a decrease in the intensity of rain can be achieved by reducing the consumption of sprinklers, as well as by increasing the spray area of the jet. Installation of control devices is proposed to reduce the intensity to 0.3 mm/min. But it has been established that further regulation of rain intensity values is limited by the maximum allowable length of the decrease in the irrigation radius by sprinklers. The installation of stubble-type spreaders for spraying the jet of sprinklers is proposed to reduce the intensity of rain to 0.2 mm/min. An analysis of the experimental data on the dependence of the soil bearing capacity on the intensity of rain and the magnitude of surface runoff showed that with a progressive decrease in the intensity of rain, control devices and dividers provide an increase in the bearing capacity of the soil from 43–47 kPa without control devices to 72–82 kPa with them. Ultimately, the provision of sufficient support properties makes it possible to achieve productive operation of the Kuban-LK1 DM on slope areas.</jats:p>",

This study yields the following findings: the relative benefits of rice and corn are the key factors affecting the corn-to-rice project. When the project can improve farmers’ income, their willingness to participate increases significantly; the number of farmers’ family members providing labor is an important factor affecting the decision of corn-to-rice conversion. Accordingly, when the family labor is abundant, they are more willing to change from corn to rice. Farmers will choose the results that are beneficial to them according to their own conditions, and their choices can bring them greater economic benefits.</jats:p>"

Methods: A literature search was undertaken to identify technical reports and equipment investigations associated with diving accidents. The information was assimilated to create a process and checklist for specifically assessing the hookah apparatus. The checklist was then applied in a gap analysis of Tasmanian hookah diving fatality technical reports from 1995 to 2019. Results: As no papers specifically describing technical evaluation of hookah equipment were identified, references evaluating scuba equipment were used to create a hookah technical assessment process incorporating unique features of the hookah. Features included: owner responsibility for air quality; maintenance, function; exhaust proximity to air intake; reservoir volume; output non-return valves; line pressure; sufficiency of supply; entanglement; hose severance risk; gas supply failure and hosing attachment to the diver. Seven hookah diving deaths occurred in Tasmania (1995-2019) of which three had documented technical assessment. Gap analysis identified inconsistent structure between reports with variability in the case descriptors. Missing technical data included: overview of the hookah systems; accessories; weights; how the apparatus was worn by the diver; compressor suitability; assessment of hookah function; breathing gas output and exhaust position relative to air intake. Conclusions: The study demonstrated a need to standardise technical reporting of hookah equipment after diving accidents. The checklist generated may serve as a resource for future hookah assessments and inform strategies for preventing future hookah accidents.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> 2046 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: Although the Stupp protocol (radiotherapy + temozolomide (TMZ)) remains the mainstay of glioblastoma (GBM) first line treatment after extended surgery, the prognosis is still poor. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, may improve GBM outcomes by enhancing cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation and TMZ. The non-dividing nature of normal brain cells allows a dedicated tumor radiosensitization. We implemented a phase I/IIa trial to assess safety and efficacy of olaparib combined with TMZ concomitant with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) as a first line treatment in unresectable GBM patients (pts). We herein present results of the phase I step. Methods: Based on the Stupp protocol, 2 treatment periods were considered. The radiotherapy period (RT) occurs after surgery: pts received IMRT (60 Gy/30 fractions/6 wks), oral TMZ (75 mg/m²) during IMRT, and olaparib orally given at the same dose until 4 wks after the end of IMRT. For the maintenance period (MT) from 4 wks after IMRT, pts received TMZ (150 mg/m², days (D) 1-5 every 28 days, for 6 cycles) plus olaparib at the MT dose level up to disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The phase I included 2 sequential dose escalations (DE1, DE2) of olaparib to split both periods for DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicities) assessment. Olaparib dose levels (DL) were: 50 mg Q12H D 1-3 (DL1), 100 mg Q12H D1-3 (DL2) or D1-5 (DL3), 200 mg Q12H D1-3 (DL4) or D1-5 (DL5) or 200 mg Q12H continuously (DL6). Pts in DE1 received olaparib only during RT to determine the MTD1 (Maximum-Tolerated Dose), by assessing DLT on this period. Next, after olaparib administered at MTD1 during RT, pts in DE2 received olaparib during MT to determine MTD2 (≤MTD1) during the MT period, assessing DLT from the first 2 cycles. DE1 and DE2 were performed by a TITE-CRM (TIme-To-Event Continual Reassessment Method). Results: From 2017 to 2021, 30 pts were enrolled: 20 (67%) men, median age 59 yrs [range 25-70]. 16 and 11 pts were assessable for determining MTD1 and MTD2, respectively. In DE1, 2 pts received olaparib at DL1, 6 at DL2, 6 at DL3, 1 at DL4 and 1 at DL5. 4 pts observed DLT (3 at DL3, 1 at DL5): thrombocytopenia G3-4 (n=4) + neutropenia G4 (n=2). MTD1 was defined as DL2 with estimated probability of DLT of 22.1% [95%CI 8-40.5]. In DE2, 2 pts were treated at DL1, 9 at DL2. 1 pt observed DLT at DL2: thrombocytopenia G4. MTD2 was defined as DL2 with estimated probability of DLT of 13.3% [0.2-0.35]. No interruption of IMRT for toxicity was observed. Excepted DLT, permanent olaparib discontinuation for toxicity was observed in 1 pt during RT and 2 pts during MT. Toxicity induced temporary TMZ interruption in 4 pts, none with permanent discontinuation. No toxic death was observed. Conclusions: Olaparib 100 mg Q12H D1-3 in concomitant with the Stupp protocol has an acceptable safety profile in unresectable GBM pts: it warrants efficacy determination, in the ongoing phase IIa step.

A field study was conducted to determine the response of alfalfa’s winter survival rate, yield, and yield components to different gradients of phosphate (P) fertilizer (0, 45, 90, and 135 kg P2O5 ha−1) in two types of low-phosphorus alkaline soils. The results show that the winter survival rates and forage yield increased at first and then decreased with the increase of P application; the greater winter survival rates were achieved at 45~90 kg ha−1 of P fertilizer applied, while the greater forage yield were achieved at 90 kg ha−1 in the two sites, and the suitable P fertilizer application rates for greater winter survival were less than those for greater forage yield; plant height and shoot mass made a greater contribution to forage yield than other yield components. To pursue greater forage yield, the suitable P fertilization rates for aeolian sandy soil and silt loam soil are 108.1 and 78.3 kg ha−1, respectively, based on the regression equations. Therefore, in cold winter and soil P deficiency areas, applying P fertilizer can be used as an effective strategy to improve alfalfa’s forage yield and persistence, and the most appropriate amount of fertilizer should be determined according to climate and soil conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> 11502 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: The immunogenic death caused by certain chemotherapy agents consists of molecular changes in tumor dying cells that stimulate immunogenicity and enhance antitumor effects. Doxorubicin is one validated drug related to immunogenic death, mainly through calreticulin membrane translocation that elicits immunogenic signals as phagocytosis by dendritic cells. Doxorubicin+pembrolizumab was explored in a phase I/II trial treating patients with metastatic/unresectable sarcomas, achieving 22% PR, 59% SD, and 19% PD, with mPFS of 8.1 months superior to historical controls. We hypothesized that the addition of an anti-PD1 (nivolumab) would increase the antitumor activity of commonly used upfront polychemotherapy in leiomyosarcoma (LMS) of doxorubicin plus dacarbazine. We present here the phase Ib, cohort 7b of ImmunoSarc2 trial. Methods: Adult patients (pts), with ECOG 0-1, naïve of previous anthracycline-containing treatments and with centrally confirmed diagnosis of advanced/metastatic leiomyosarcoma (LMS) were eligible. Initial dose level 0 (L0) was defined as doxorubicin (DOX) 75 mg/m2/d 20 min on D1 followed by dacarbazine (DAC) 400 mg/m2/d 60 min on D1 and 2, plus nivolumab (NIV) 360 mg on D2 after DAC Q3W with GCSF support. This combo would be given up to 6 courses of 21-day cycles, followed by 1-year NIV maintenance. A -1 dose level (L-1) was defined with the same regimen but with NIV 240 mg. A classic 3+3 phase 1 design was used to determine the MTD based on DLTs (main endpoint) observed during the first 21-day cycle. The cohort was foreseen to be extended with the RP2D up to 20 evaluable patients. Secondary endpoints included ORR and safety profile among others. Results: Between January 2022 and February 2023, 20 pts (M/F 6/14), ECOG 0/1 (15/5), with median age 54 years (31-72) were enrolled. All patients were treated with the initial L0 scheme and no DLTs were observed being L0 the RP2D. Grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (20%), anemia (10%), febrile neutropenia, asthenia, and GGT increased (5% each). Four pts are not evaluable for efficacy (1 due to uncompliant dosing and 3 for not reaching the first tumor assessment yet). Of 16 efficacy-evaluable pts, RECIST ORR according to local clinical site assessment was 9 PR (56.2 %), 6 SD (37.5%), and 1 PD (6.3%) (2 SD cases had tumor size reductions &gt; 20%). Five pts ended treatment due to progression (4 radiological, 1 clinical) and 15 pts remain under the trial therapy. mPFS for evaluable patients was 8.67 months (95% CI: 7.96-9.37) with a median follow-up of 8 months (2-12). Conclusions: DOX 75 mg/m2/d on D1 followed by DAC 400 mg/m2/d on D1 and 2, plus NIV 360 mg on D2 after DAC Q3W, followed by 1-year NIV maintenance is a feasible and well-tolerated scheme. Clinical activity is encouraging improving historical efficacy outcomes in first line of advanced LMS, which deserves further testing in phase II trials.

The experiment was conducted in a plastic greenhouse into two independent sectors, one for soil-bound cultivation and another equipped for soilless cultivation. The crop was subjected to a high compared to a low-input fertilization program. Ion exchange chromatography, spectrophotometrically, and microbiological techniques were utilized. The soil-bound treatments increased the fresh weight, leaves number, chloride content, and microbial load. Exogenous application of higher nitrogen levels significantly boosted the ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide levels. Wild rocket growth in soilless showed a higher content of sulphates and polyphenols, and enhanced activity of the antioxidant enzymes dehydroascorbate reductase and monodehydroascorbate reductase. The fertilization rate and the cultivation system did not modify the content of nitrates, except in the soilless system treated with high fertilization program, where nitrate levels slightly exceeded regulatory limits. The yield and overall quality of wild rockets can be improved by combining the proper fertilizer dose with the growth system (soilless or soil) and suggested fertilization management is provided.</jats:p>",

However, it doesn’t guarantee the authenticity of data before it enters the chain. In this study, we developed a three-party dynamic evolutionary game model involving core enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and financial institutions. Our findings indicate that a blockchain supply chain (BSC) generates more economic benefits than a traditional supply chain (TSC). We then built a dynamic evolutionary game model between core enterprises and SMEs, which revealed that SMEs are influenced by core enterprises and tend to adopt the action strategies of the latter. Additionally, we developed a dynamic evolutionary game model between core enterprises and financial institutions and compared the reward and punishment mechanisms with the synergy payoff mechanism. In the reward and punishment mechanisms, the game is a zero-sum game, where one party’s gains come at the expense of the other party. This mechanism has certain limitations and must meet specific conditions to improve the willingness of enterprises to share data. On the other hand, the synergy payoff mechanism enhances the authenticity of shared data by increasing the payoff for participants. When core enterprises play games with SMEs, the probability of core enterprises uploading real data and the distribution ratio of synergy payoff show an inverted U-shape. Similarly, core enterprises and financial institutions have comparable results in allocating synergy payoff. To leverage the synergy payoff mechanism, the distribution proportion of players participating in the synergy payoff should be considered fair. Finally, we validated our findings by simulating the models. If we can use blockchain technology to enhance the mutual trust between enterprises and banks, both banks and enterprises can achieve sustainable development.</jats:p>"

The developed method is based on direct mixing of fuel with water, dispersion of the resulting mixture and feeding into the combustion chamber of the internal combustion engine when the fuel temperature exceeds a given value, and depending on the temperature, as well as the number of revolutions of the internal combustion engine and from different levels of the mixing tank. The versatility of the developed devices for the implementation of the proposed method is that they can be used not only in stationary conditions, but also on board the equipment during its operation. The implementation of the developed method and technical devices will ensure effective removal of carbon deposits due to the interaction of red-hot carbon particles with water droplets (steam), which will lead to an increase in the resource of diesel internal combustion engines, restoration of operational and technical characteristics of especially worn-out diesel internal combustion engines and ultimately increase the readiness of individual samples of ATT and, in general, the technical readiness of the machine and tractor fleet.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ship industry is currently facing numerous challenges, including rising fuel prices, limited fuel resources, and increasingly strict regulations related to energy efficiency and pollutant emissions. In this context, the adoption of green-ship wind–photovoltaic–electricity–fuel multi-energy supply systems has emerged as an efficient and clean technology that harnesses multiple energy sources. These systems have the potential to increase the utilization of renewable energy in ship operations while optimizing management practices in order to enhance overall energy efficiency. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive energy supply system for ships that integrates multi-energy sources for cold–heat–electricity supply. The primary components of this system include fuel cells, photovoltaic equipment, wind turbines, electric heating pumps, electric refrigerators, thermal refrigerators, batteries, and heat storage tanks. By ensuring the safety of the system, our approach aims to minimize daily operating costs and optimize the performance of the multi-energy flow system by running scheduling models. To achieve this, our proposed system utilizes dynamic planning techniques combined with ship navigation conditions to establish an optimized management model. This model facilitates the coordinated distribution of green ship electricity, thermal energy, and cooling loads. The results of our study demonstrate that optimized management models significantly reduce economic costs and improve the stability of energy storage equipment. Specifically, through an analysis of the economic benefits of power storage and heat storage tanks, we highlight the potential for reducing fuel consumption by 6.0%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 2.9% through the use of electric–thermal hybrid energy storage conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is increasingly used to secure drinking water supply worldwide. The city of Amsterdam (The Netherlands) depends largely on the MAR in coastal dunes for water supply. A new MAR scheme is proposed for the production of 10 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year, as required in the next decade. The designed MAR system consists of 10 infiltration ponds in an artificially created sandbank, and 25 recovery wells placed beneath the ponds in a productive aquifer. Several criteria were met for the design, such as a minimum residence time of 60 days and maximum drawdown of 5 cm. Steady-state and transient flow models were calibrated. The flow model computed the infiltration capacity of the ponds and drawdowns caused by the MAR. A hypothetical tracer transport model was used to compute the travel times from the ponds to the wells and recovery efficiency of the wells. The results demonstrated that 98% of the infiltrated water was captured by the recovery wells which accounted for 65.3% of the total abstraction. Other sources include recharge from precipitation (6.7%), leakages from surface water (13.1%), and natural groundwater reserve (14.9%). Sensitivity analysis indicated that the pond conductance and hydraulic conductivity of the sand aquifer in between the ponds and wells are important for the infiltration capacity. The temperature simulation showed that the recovered water in the wells has a stable temperature of 9.8–12.5 °C which is beneficial for post-treatment processes. The numerical modelling approach is useful and helps to gain insights for implementation of the MAR.</jats:p>",
