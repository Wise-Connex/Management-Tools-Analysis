The material was divided into the following 4 groups on radiological and pathomorphological grounds: 1. normal navicular bones (46), 2. navicular bones with changed sesamoidian canals (33), 3. navicular bones with central collapse (9) and 4. navicular bones after a penetrating injury (2). The characteristic radiological picture of the arterial blood vessel distribution is described for each group. By comparing and differentiating the radiological arterial blood supply of the different groups, it can be concluded that the blood supply to the navicular bone changes with radiological and patho‐morphological changes.</jats:p>",

The largest number of innovations occur on the ‘supply side’ of the model, including new equations for manufacturing employment, investment, exports, imports prices and average earnings. Two equally important developments involve the interaction between company sector liquidity and decisions about real variables, and between the flow of consumer credit and personal consumption. There are new equations for the exchange rate, unemployment and a host of more minor variables. In all about half of the model's equations have been re-estimated, and 30 new variables added to the model. These changes constitute the largest and most significant development of the Institute's UK model since the introduction of rational expectations with Model 8. This note summarises these changes, and discusses their implications for various standard policy simulations. A full model listing is also published by the Institute.</jats:p>",

Planning criteria for programme and project assessment should emphasize the need to consider different alternatives for augmentation of available water supplies. Sectoral planning and organization of executing agencies must take into account the active participation and support of users. Operation and maintenance can be improved through appropriate monitoring, rehabilitation and special training. Adequate operation, maintenance and rehabilitation will reduce investment needs.

The principal factor that led to the adoption of ORT is its apparent low cost per diarrheal death averted in children when compared with WS&amp;S. However, WS&amp;S provides many more benefits that are essential to sustaining the lives saved by ORT and vital to maintaining and enhancing the lives of adults and children. Among many other benefits WS&amp;S prevents spread of the causes of diarrhea, controls many other water- and sanitation-related diseases, releases women from the heavy and time-consuming burden of carrying water from distant sources, and improves the quality of life in the community. Cost comparisons between WS&amp;S and ORT are misleading. WS&amp;S is a long-term investment in preventive health while ORT is a response to an immediate life-threatening situation. WS&amp;S interventions eliminate unsanitary conditions leading to illness and death while ORT has no effect on the causes of diarrheal morbidity. The costs of WS&amp;S are not high: $5 to $10 per capita annually. Without WS&amp;S and hygiene education ORT programs are not likely to effect long-term improvement in child health status.

For supply and demand curves that are linear or power functions, a small downward pivot of the supply curve will increase producers' surplus only if the equilibrium point is far enough into the elastic region of the demand curve, and any downward pivot of the supply curve will decrease producers' surplus if the equilibrium point is in the inelastic region of the demand curve.

As a result the metabolic pathways followed by these fats in an organism are different and simpler, or identical but more rapid, than those followed by long‐chain triglycerides (LCTS) and long‐chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Consequently the MCTs have found numerous applications in oral or enteral nutrition and, more recently, in parenteral nutrition. The infusion of conventional fat emulsions in stress and sepsis is still controversial. A main question is whether an MCT supply can be beneficial for these patients. In this review, we will discuss different aspects of modified lipid and protein metabolism: exchanges between exogenous fat particles and lipoproteins; exogenous fat clearance, storage, and oxidation; reticuloendothelial system function; nitrogen balance; and hepatic function. For each of these perturbations, the MCT/LCT and structured lipid emulsions are theoretically capable to provide an appropriate solution. The efficiency of these emulsions has been demonstrated experimentally on animal models of stress and sepsis. However, the value of MCT‐based fat emulsions for these pathological states has still to be ascertained by clinical studies. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 12:82S‐88S, 1988)</jats:p>",

This paper indicates how one can design and implement a GPIB interface and use it economically but effectively in testing and measuring the performance characteristics of the power supply. The overall system and associated software developed for the control and monitoring of the power supply are also described. The advantages of the system are stable operation, simplicity of hardware, the friendliness of software.</jats:p>",

A dynamic econometric model is used to simulate the changes in equilibrium prices, quantities, producer and consumer welfare, and government costs that would occur if mandatory controls were adopted. The results show that while such a change in policy would eliminate the costs associated with current price supports, the benefits accruing to producers would be achieved at the expense of consumers and processors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Previous measures of the welfare impacts of supply‐restricting marketing boards in Canada were rather simplistic but, in this study, it is shown that the simple measures are a close approximation of the true welfare loss. The empirical results suggest that consumer surplus is a relatively good measure of equivalent or compensating variation – a measure of the true loss in welfare. It is estimated that consumers probably lose between $1.01 and $1.14 for every $1 transferred to producers as a result of marketing boards in poultry products and eggs.</jats:p><jats:p>Les measures antérieures des incidences, sur le bien‐être, des offices de gestion des approvisionnements au Canada étaient plutôt simplistes.

Nos résultats empiriques donnent à conclure que le surplus à la consommation est une mesure relativement exacte de la variation équivalente au compensatoire, une mesure de la perte réelle au chapitre du bien‐être. On calcule que les consommateurs perdent probablement entre 1, 01 $ et 1, 14 $ pour chaque dollar transféré aux producteurs par suite de ľintervention des offices de commercialisation dans les secteurs des oeufs et de la volaille.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The retina of the honeybee drone is a nervous tissue in which glial cells and photoreceptor cells (sensory neurons) constitute two distinct metabolic compartments. Retinal slices incubated with 2-deoxy[3H]glucose convert this glucose analogue to 2-deoxy[3H]glucose 6-phosphate, but this conversion is made only in the glial cells. Hence, glycolysis occurs only in glial cells. In contrast, the neurons consume O2 and this consumption is sustained by the hydrolysis of glycogen, which is contained in large amounts in the glia. During photostimulation the increased oxidative metabolism of the neurons is sustained by a higher supply of carbohydrates from the glia. This clear case of metabolic interaction between neurons and glial cells supports Golgi's original hypothesis, proposed nearly 100 years ago, about the nutritive function of glial cells in the nervous system.</jats:p>",
