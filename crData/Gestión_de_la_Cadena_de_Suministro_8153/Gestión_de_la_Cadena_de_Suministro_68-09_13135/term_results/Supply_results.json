The Potential Gas Committee considers broad economic and technologic determinants in its definition of potential supply. Its estimate is based on a fair but reasonable price and normal improvements in technology. The ability of natural gas to compete with other forms of energy at the market place is therefore one of the ultimate determinants of the potential supply of natural gas. Another is the producers' willingness to enter into the producers' willingness to enter into the hazardous search for and development of sufficient gas supply at prevailing costs and wellhead prices. Hence the estimate is elastic and subject to revision as determinants change. Other factors, although exerting influence on the potential supply, are more important potential supply, are more important in determining rate at which new supply is made available.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>According to the Potential Gas Committee's estimates, the potential supply of natural gas should not cause concern from 1968–80. The Committee makes no predictions in regard to the rate at which the potential supply will be developed and produced, perhaps the most important factor. The annual average rate of additions to new supply has been only 19.7 Tcf for the past 12 years. There seems to be no compelling reason for its increase. An increase to an average of at least 23 Tcf per year is necessary simply to supply forecasted need for at least 300 Tcf during the period. And this quantity only meets increasing requirements. If a reserve life index of 15 years is to be maintained, the rate must be considerably higher.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Direct observations of the calcium-45 distribution around the roots of plants growing in soil showed a pattern in direct contrast to that predicted from calculations based on the calcium concentration of the soil solution, transpiration rates, and plant calcium content. Whereas calcium-45 accumulation at the root surface was predicted, depletion was observed. It is suggested that preferential water movement in larger pores may decrease the expected solution calcium accumulation at the root surface. However, autoradiographs may give no indication of soil solution concentration depletion or accumulation because of the relatively high level on the colloid surface. The nature and extent of the depletion indicates how profoundly the plant root alters its immediate environment in the soil.</jats:p>",
