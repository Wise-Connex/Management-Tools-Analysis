The number of engineers hired, including petroleum, will decrease in 1995 but rebound in 1996 to 1994 levels. The number of petroleum engineering graduates seeking U.S. employment is forecast to decline slightly over the next two academic years. These graduates, however, should find improved employment outlooks in 1996 and 1997.</jats:p>",

In 1991, Martin Parry was appointed to be the first IBM Director of the newly established Environmental Change Unit in the University of Oxford and became a Professorial Fellow of Linacre College. He has held a number of visiting appointments overseas, including that of Director of the Climate Impacts Project at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. In 1993 Professor Parry was a joint winner of the Norbert Gerbier-Mumm International Award for work in applied meteorology.

To reduce inventory and improve order fulfillment, HP called on an internal team of industrial engineers and management scientists augmented by academic collaboration. The team used an iterative process, enriched by the interaction of model development and application. HP reaped benefits well beyond its manufacturing operations, extending to diverse functions throughout the organization. Similarly, the academic partners have infused their research with real-life experience. The supply-chain methodology is now mature, and HP is transferring the technology into the product divisions. </jats:p>",

The CSC is shown to be derivable from a production isoquant, and not to be a true supply curve. The traditional algorithm for constructing a CSC from discrete measures is shown to be suboptimal, contrary to prior claims. Omitting conservation measuresfrom consideration can lead to systematic, excessive conservation. The CSC concept is extended from constant-service to constant-utility measures, and an improved approximation is suggested for the cost of conserved energy (CCE) of measures that cause rebound. The appendix provides a formula for CCE that is simple yet more general than the one currently in use, but shows that even with this generalization, CSCs cannot be constructed for a world with fluctuating energy prices. </jats:p>",

Using data from Nkayi district, evidence is presented to show how access to water rather than land has been the critical factor in its settlement and development. Water supplies were provided by the state during the first half of the century to support economic and fiscal policies and to render forced resettlement possible. During the years of struggle preceding and including the Liberation War, control over water was used as a weapon, and this remained a significant issue in the post-Independence period. Examples are offered of people's resistance to such control through non-cooperation in water development activities and the evolution of a culture of minimal water use strongly associated with concepts of solidarity and survival. Finally the implications of this historic legacy for current development initiatives are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Partitioning the forest into sustained yield units is a complex task that involves assessing timber supply, allocation of cutting rights, and social, economic, and environmental impacts. There are numerous ways to vary the timing and intensity of harvests within individual drainages while still meeting the objectives of sustained yield. In this paper we use a spatial forest planning model to examine economic and environmental implications of varying the sustained yield unit size. Harvests for a Timber Supply Area in British Columbia are calculated using 4 sizes of sustained yield units: 1)12 small units, 2) four moderately sized units 3) two large units, and 4) one unit representing the entire forest. Relative to the 12 small units, short-term (20 year) harvest levels for the Timber Supply Area increased by 7.6%, 10%, and 10.8% for the 4, 2 and 1 unit aggregations, respectively. Medium-(21-60 years) and long-term (61-120 years) increases in harvest levels averaged approximately 75% and 40%, respectively, of those realized in the short-term. Reductions in the length of active road and delivered wood costs were also observed as sustained yield units increased in size. Small units often restrict short-term timber supply and provide continuous road access to important wildlife habitat. While larger units afford greater flexibility in meeting short-term harvests, the intensity of the harvest within individual drainages increases. However, with large units the inactive drainages can be closed for extended periods, thus limiting human access to the active drainages. Key words: timber supply, sustained yield unit size, spatial modelling, economics </jats:p>",

In the second year, trees that had been preconditioned to a low-N supply received 3-week pulses of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N at either the low rate of application or at the high rate to simulate a single application of N fertilizer. In spring of the first year, N treatment had no effect upon tree growth. Low-N trees increased the partition of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N uptake to roots, but the partition of <jats:sup>32</jats:sup>P was not affected by N supply and was similar to the partition of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N in the high-N treatment.

During the second year, the additional <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N given to Low-N trees to simulate fertilizer application was partitioned predominantly to current shoots and roots.

The kinetic analysis of the experimental data obtained for the mutant revealed that, as in normal nerves, two metabolically and kinetically independent pathways are implicated in the biosynthesis of the major peripheral nerve sphingolipids: the ceramide pathway and another pathway in which there is no detectable labeled intermediate (“direct amidification”). The results also show that, in the Trembler mouse sciatic nerves: (a) The severely deficient sphingolipid biosynthesis results from the constitution of a qualitatively and quantitatively abnormal fatty acid substrate pool destined for metabolism via the ceramide pathway, which ensures the totality of the galactocerebroside labeling and two‐thirds of that of sphingomyelin. The ceramide intermediates of this pathway are labeled only on their fatty acyl moiety, which contains only 16‐carbon atom chains. (b) “Direct amidification” events implicated in sphingolipid labeling are decreased compared with normal and account for the remaining sphingomyelin formation.</jats:p>",

In this study, we investigated the influence of phosphate pulses on the regulation of uptake behavior during reestablishment of the threshold value. Short‐term pulses had only a slight effect on uptake kinetics and, hence, on the threshold value, even if the population had been exposed several times to elevated concentrations above the steady‐state level in the growth medium. The threshold value was also practically insensitive to the amount of phosphate stored during these short‐term fluctuations. Long‐term phosphate pulses resulted in a transition to a metastable state that was characterized by a severalfold higher threshold value. This transition, apparently an adaptation to the transiently elevated phosphate concentrations, was further studied by following the influx of <jats:sup>32</jats:sup>P‐phosphate at constant external concentrations and was shown to be complete after a period of 10–20 min. After adaptation to pulses, the uptake behavior followed a linear flow‐force relation over a wide range of external concentrations. This behavior was explained by the simultaneous operation of at least two uptake systems with different, but coordinated kinetic parameters. This linear flow‐force relation facilitated a direct determination of the threshold value from uptake measurements. For applicability in the field the force‐flow relation can be a diagnostic tool to assay for fluctuating phosphate and to establish threshold values below the normal measurable range</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",
