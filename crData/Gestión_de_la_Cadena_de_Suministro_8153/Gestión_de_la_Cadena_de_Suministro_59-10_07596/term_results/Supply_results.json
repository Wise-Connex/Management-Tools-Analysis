Therefore, I think it fitting and proper for you to invite a\" gas man\" to participate in your deliberation. I appreciate your confidence and an opportunity to better acquaint you with the gas industry:Its BackgroundWhere We Are TodayWhat the Future Holds</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Being semi-retired and a so-called Senior Member (39 years), I shall endeavor to bring the natural gas industry on the Pacific Coast into its proper perspective by briefly reviewing sane of the important historical dates.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The forerunner of natural gas was, as in all other districts throughout the United States, manufactured gas. Here in California the industry dates back to 1854, when on Feb. 11, the streets of San Francisco were lighted for the first time with gas. The manufacturing plant was located at the water front as the burning of coal was anticipated. This was followed in 1859 by the Portland Gas and Coke Co. at Portland, Ore.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In 1867, the Los Angeles Gas Co. completed its \"gas works\" in Los Angeles. By the turn of the century, all populated centers had their local \"gas works\".</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The transition from manufactured gas to natural gas came slowly. Its earliest utilization in California was at Stockton in 1864. The wells were shallow, production became intermittent and, therefore, finally abandoned. However, it was not until 1907 — when the Santa Maria Gas Co. became the first utility to serve oil-well gas to its customers — that natural gas obtained from oil fields assumed any economic importance. In 1910 a natural gas line was laid from Buena Vista Hills to Bakersfield, and by 1913 a line had been completed from this same source to Glendale.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>During the period 1914 to 1921 market facilities were expanded in the Los Angeles Basin, but it was the discovery of oil and gas on Signal Hill early in 1921 that gave the real impetus to the rapid expansion of marketing facilities throughout Southern California.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Natural gas reached San Francisco in Aug., 1929, from the San Joaquin Valley, extending its distribution throughout the more heavily populated areas in California.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",
