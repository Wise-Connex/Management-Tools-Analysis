      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An observation network design method, which simultaneously minimizes parameter uncertainty and exploration cost, is developed for locating water supply wells. Observation networks combining wells and geophysical measurements are considered for delineating the ‘best’ areas for wells. An area is considered the ‘best’ where the sustainable pumping rate and the degree of protection for the well are the possible maximum. The level of protection is measured by the travel time for a fixed radius protection zone around a well. The ‘most appropriate’ measurement network is selected based on two often conflicting objectives: (1) minimization of the uncertainty in characterizing the spatial distribution of the expected yield and travel time; and (2) minimization of the observation cost. The accuracy of estimation is characterized by the average and maximum kriging variance for yields and travel times calculated from measured hydrogeologic parameters. The parameters to be measured by an observation network for estimating yields and travel times are layer thicknesses, porosity, hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content. They may be obtained from direct measurements (e.g. well logs, specific capacity test, and pumping tests) or estimated indirectly from geoelectric measurements. The approach combines two common techniques, geostatistics and multi‐criterion decision making (MCDM), to determine the ‘best’ measurement network. Geostatistics are used to determine the spatial distribution of the estimation variance for yield and travel time calculated from different sources of data. MCDM is utilized to evaluate observation network alternatives based on the estimation variances and the costs associated with them. The methodology is illustrated for a study area located near Ashland, Nebraska.</jats:p>",

Supply formulations that account for the quality and vintage distribution of forest capital will be necessary for improving medium‐ and long‐run forecasts. This will be especially important for examining the potential impacts of structural changes in forest production and timber markets.

The growth conditions reached only nearly optimal temperature for biomass allocation in a short period of July and August 1990. The plant productivity was stimulated due to higher N uptake and N utilization to values of nearly 1600 g ha<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup>. The N efficiency decreased with increasing N fertilization.</jats:p><jats:p>A greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the effects of varied nitrogen nutrition on the development of maize plants under standardized growth conditions, comparable to the sub optimal growth conditions of the field experiment. Physiological and anatomical parameters were measured. Within a range of 0.2—1.0 mg N cm<jats:sup>‐2</jats:sup> of leaf nitrogen, the chlorophyll concentration and the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> exchange rate showed a linear relationship with the reduced N in the leaf. Above 1.0 mg N cm<jats:sup>‐2</jats:sup> no further increases in chlorophyll levels or photosynthesis were observed. Nitrate reductase activity was stimulated throughout the N range supplied. The activities of photosynthetic enzymes (PEP carboxylase, N<jats:sc>adp</jats:sc> malic enzyme, RubP carboxylase) was increased from the low (0.19 g N kg<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> soil) to the middle N level (0.37 g N kg<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> soil). Under conditions of a high N supply (0.75 g N kg<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> soil) the activity decreased, except N<jats:sc>adp</jats:sc> malic enzyme. This effect was accompanied by alterations of the internal structure of the leaf. Leaf thickness and size of the mesophyll parenchyma were less at the medium nitrate supply. Other anatomical parameters were influenced in proportion to leaf nitrogen status. Stomatal index was not affected by N supply, but lengths and widths of epidermal and stomatal cells as well as the distance between stomata and vascular bundles were increased by high N supply. It is proposed that above an optimal range of leaf nitrogen, maize plants cannot use the potential advantage of the C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> mechanism and the N utilization shows maximum efficiency in the intermediate N level under the sub optimal growth conditions used in the greenhouse experiment.</jats:p>",

The aim was to determine the relative contributions of root growth, formation of new infections and growth of infections within the root to the % colonization. Plants were harvested daily between 7 and 24 d. Added P had no effect on root or shoot f. wt or on root length up to 14 d. After that time plants given additional P grew well, but those with no added P grew poorly and showed signs of P deficiency. Increase in root length with added P was due both to an increase in the number of root apices produced per unit length of root per unit time and to an increase in the mean rate of extension of those apices. Effects of P on the % colonization of the roots by the mycorrhizal fungus <jats:italic>Glomus intraradices</jats:italic> Schenk and Smith were apparent before any effects on root length were observed. The length of the lag phase was not affected by addition of P. The rate of formation of new entry points was similar with and without added P up to 15 d, and reduction in % colonization up to this time could be attributed entirely to reduction in the rate of growth of infection units within the roots. Later, there was a marked increase in the rate of formation of (secondary) entry points in the absence of added P, which was not observed when P was added. At 15, 20 and 25 d, additional plants were harvested to quantify the development of arbuscules and vesicles in colonized regions of the roots. At all three times, numbers of arbuscules and vesicles were lower with added P. We conclude that at very early stages of colonization P exerts its effect <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> reduced growth of infection units. After approx. 2 wk, an increase in the rate of growth in length of roots and low rates of formation of secondary infections also contribute to the low values of % colonization.</jats:p>",

As an emergency control procedure the incoming mains water was chlorinated continuously. Additional modifications to improve temperature regulation and reduce stagnation also failed to eliminate the legionellae.</jats:p><jats:p>A perspex test-rig was constructed to model the pre-existing hospital water supply and storage system. This showed that through the hydraulic mechanism known as ‘temperature buoyancy’, contaminated water could be efficiently and quickly exchanged between a stagnant spur pipe and its mains supply.

We recommend that hospital water storage tanks are supplied by a dedicated mains pipe without spurs.</jats:p>",

IAA concentrations in lateral roots of <jats:italic>L. color‐inoculated seedlings were positively related to X supply.</jats:italic> A rise in N supply reduced the development of extramatrical mycelium of <jats:italic>L. bicolor</jats:italic> and the fungal biomass in lateral roots of <jats:italic>Hebeloma crustuliniforme</jats:italic>‐inoculated seedlings. High N supply reduced concentrations of starch, Ca and Mg in shoots but increased those of glucose and fructose. P had no effect on fungal growth or on concentrations of IAA. Fungal growth was negatively correlated with levels of soluble carbohydrates in shoots, shoot concentrations of N, P and K, relative growth rate and the shoot: root ratio of the seedlings. Starch, Mg and Ca concentrations in the shoot were positively correlated with fungal growth. No support was found for the hypothesis that IAA is important in regulating mycorrhizal colonization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This paper focuses on the spatial impacts of transport supply distribution and on issues of equity of access to the networks. More specifically, the methodology we are presenting is based on a cross-analysis of the territorial distribution of supply on the one side, and the spatial coverage of the population by the Paris urban rail transit network on the other side. This methodology resorts to various concepts, indicators and methodologies from Graph Theory, Multicriteria Analysis for decision-making, and recent microcomputer-based network graphic design techniques. Within the field of network planning methods, this type of analysis gives shape to the concept of multimodality, often praised but not so often applied by transport operators and their institutional and political counterparts.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p xml:lang=\"fr\">Les effets territoriaux de la distribution de l'offre et les problèmes d'équité d'accès au réseau constituent le point de départ de cet article. Plus spécifiquement une méthodologie d'analyse croisée de la distribution territoriale de l'offre et de la couverture spatiale de la population par le réseau ferroviaire parisien est ici présentée, faisant appel à un ensemble de concepts, d'indicateurs ou de méthodes inspirés notamment de la théorie des graphes, de l'école française d'aide multicritère à la décision et des techniques microinformatiques récentes en matière de représentation graphique des réseaux. Cette analyse permet de rendre opératoire, en matière de planification de réseau, la notion de multimodalité, évoquée de façon souvent incantatoire, à la fois par les entreprises-exploitantes du transport et leurs tutelles politiques et/ou territoriales.</jats:p>"
