This is particularly true for organisations competing internationally, where the complexity of the supply chain must be managed within a global network. A conceptual model is presented that identifies three basic dimensions of this complexity. Results support the linkage of uncertainty with performance, however, no evidence was found that increased technological intricacy or more complicated organisational systems hamper delivery performance. Managers appear to have adopted mechanisms to accommodate these last two dimensions of complexity.</jats:p>",

Can anyone imagine a women who asked for an expensive unnecessary caesarean section being told, ‘You can’t have it on the NHS, go private'? Of course not. On the contrary such a request is welcomed by many obstetricians because it helps them to claim that the reason their section rates are sky high is that women are ‘demanding’ them and they have to comply. Choice is apparently all right provided women choose what the management approves. Meanwhile women without the funds to pay a private midwife, or without one in their area, are in limbo. They fear they will have no alternative but to give birth alone. </jats:p>",

As a result, firms and agencies are engaging in long-term contracts for labor supply. We develop mathematical models of the interaction between firms and labor supply agencies when demand and supply are uncertain. We consider two models of labor supply uncertainty, termed productivity and availability uncertainty, and study how each affects the nature of the contracts formed. These models reflect two major roles played by the labor supply agency. In the case of productivity uncertainty we find that it is possible to construct a contract that coordinates the firm and agency hiring in an optimal way. In contrast, we show that in environments characterized by availability uncertainty, optimal contracts are not possible. However, there is a large range of contract parameters for which both parties would benefit from a contract. We analyze these and discuss the trade-offs that should be considered in contract negotiation. </jats:p>",

A network orientation is proposed to encourage more integrated levels of I‐commerce adoption which, in turn, further strengthens the relationship between a network orientation and its implementation.

It also shows how the implementation of cost reducing reengineering projects naturally lead to sub‐optimization and a need to consider higher‐level processes. In the Volvo illustration a manufacturer’s reengineering of its distribution chain evolved into a complete recasting of its order fulfillment process, and an adoption of a process management structure. The paper traces the effects on the network of distributors and dealers and shows how Volvo’s new structure curtails the distribution role of foreign sales subsidiaries and shifts their tasks towards market analysis, demand forecasting and customer service in foreign markets. It also shows how a process management perspective impacts a firm’s value chain, marketing function and organizational structure. In the end, the case demonstrates how a division can cut costs and still become more customer‐oriented – and become a more valuable asset for a diversified corporation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>It is a paradox that the pursuit of ethical practice can sometimes produce distinctly unethical results. Pathologists seek to study diseased human tissues for the benefit of mankind, but in the UK there has been a sudden restriction in the availability of this basic resource, supposedly on ethical grounds. This was triggered by adverse publicity about the inappropriate retention of whole organs at paediatric post‐mortem, but the reaction has spread to influence the use of ‘surgical waste’ left over after routine analysis of therapeutic resections, diagnostic biopsies, and even blood samples. The use of such material for research is being restricted, and its use in teaching and laboratory quality control is being questioned. This has occurred despite the facts that public opinion favours using such ‘waste’ material for research; that the tissues would otherwise be incinerated; and that until very recently, such tissues were regarded as having been ‘abandoned’ by the patient. This review attempts to chart how this dramatic change has occurred. It then considers some of the ethical problems in using such ‘surplus’ tissues and proposes mechanisms by which this valuable resource can remain available for most biomedical research, while maintaining or enhancing the autonomy of individual patients. This crisis has shown a tendency for regulatory authorities to apply very restrictive, oversimplified rules, without due consideration of the character of each project. The motivation is to avoid the possibility of media criticism, even though such rules block ethically sound work which is of value to all, including the individuals whose protection is supposedly being sought. The moral need for logical ethical arguments instead of such ‘one size fits all’ regulations is emphasized. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

We analyse the role of these two cultural fields in the social formation of Indre Nørrebro as a neighbourhood and in the local citizens' process of producing locality and a sense of belonging. How are these cultural fields structurally configured and organized, and what role do they historically and contemporarily have in the neighbourhood? The implicit assumption is that both these cultural fields play significant roles as social and cultural mediators in the production of locality. </jats:p>",

First, we derive the buyer's optimal menu of contracts when the supplier has private information about setup cost, and we show how consignment stock can help reduce the impact of this information asymmetry. Next, we study consignment and assume the supplier cannot observe the buyer's backorder cost. We derive the supplier's optimal menu of contracts on consigned stock level and show that in this case, the supplier effectively has to overcompensate the buyer for the cost of each stockout. </jats:p><jats:p> Our theoretical analysis and the case study suggest that consignment stock helps reduce cycle stock by providing the supplier with an additional incentive to decrease batch size, but simultaneously gives the buyer an incentive to increase safety stock by exaggerating backorder costs.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Photovoltaic pumping systems are used nowadays as a valuable alternative to supply water to communities living in remote rural areas. Owing to the seasonal variation and the stochastic behavior of solar radiation, at certain times the supply of water may not be able to meet demand. A study has been made of the relationship between water pumping capacity, reservoir size and water demand, for a given water deficit. As a result, curves of equal water deficit (iso‐deficit lines) can be obtained for various combinations of PV pumping capacity and reservoir size. A methodology to generate those curves is described, using as its main tool the characteristic curve of the system, that is, the relationship between water flow and collected solar radiation. The characteristic curve represents the combined behavior of the water pumping system and the well. The influence of the minimum collected solar radiation level, necessary to start the system's operation (the critical radiation level I<jats:sub>C</jats:sub>), is also analyzed. Results show that PV pumping systems with different characteristic curves, but with the same critical levels, yield the same set of iso‐deficit lines. This drastically reduces the number of necessary solutions to those corresponding to a few values of I<jats:sub>C</jats:sub>. Iso‐deficit lines, calculated for the locality of Recife (PE), Brazil, are used to illustrate the sizing procedure PV water supply systems. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

All customer demand is served from stage 1, where the product is stored in its final form. If the demand exceeds the supply at stage 1, then stage 1 is resupplied from stocks held at the upstream stages 2 through <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>, where the product may be stored in finished form or as raw materials or subassemblies. All stocking decisions are made before the demand occurs. The demand is nonnegative and continuous with a known probability distribution, and the purchasing, holding, shipping, processing, and shortage costs are proportional. There are no fixed costs. All unsatisfied demand is lost. The objective is to select the stock quantities that should be placed different stages so as to maximize the expected profit. Under reasonable cost assumptions, this leads to a convex constrained optimization problem. We characterize the properties of the optimal solution and propose an effective algorithm for its computation. For the case of normal demands, the calculations can be done on a spreadsheet. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Naval Research Logistics 48:506–517, 2001</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A site at Owens Dry Lake was observed for more than 4 years. The site was a vegetation‐free saline playa where the surface formed “ephemeral crusts,” crusts that form after rainfall. Sometimes these crusts were destroyed and often a layer of particles on the crust would engage in vigorous aeolian activity. Three “phases” of active sand drifting are defined as almost no movement (extreme supply limitation), loose particles on crust with some degree of sand drift (moderate supply limitation), and unlimited source movement corresponding to a destroyed surface crust (unlimited supply). These “phases” occurred 45, 49, and 6% of the time, respectively. The accumulation of loose particles on the crust was mostly the result of in situ formation. Crusted sediments with loose particles on top can exhibit mass flux rates about the same as for noncrusted sediments. Crusted sediments limit or eliminate sand drift in two conditions: for rough crusts that effect a sufficiently high threshold friction velocity (above the wind friction velocity) and for limited amounts of loose particles on the crust where particle supply is less than would be transported in normal saltation for a thick sandy surface. These “supply‐limited” cases are similar to wind erosion of limited spilled material on a hard concrete surface. We quantified “supply limitation” by defining a “potential” or “supply unlimited” sand drift function <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> = <jats:italic>AG</jats:italic> where <jats:italic>A</jats:italic> represents supply limitation that decreases as the particle source is depleted.

Hard crusts (usually formed in the summer) tended to show almost no change of threshold friction velocity with time and often gave total protection from wind erosion. Rough crusts provided sufficient protection expressed as high threshold friction velocities. For these high threshold friction velocities, aeolian activity was greatly reduced or practically prevented. The softest crusts, usually formed in the winter, provided much less protection and sometimes were destroyed by the wind. Following this destruction the “potential” or “supply unlimited” sand drift would be observed.</jats:p>",

Seasonal and annual fluctuations in the abundance of granivorous birds were studied at three sites in the Northern Monte Desert, Argentina. The way in which these changes were related to seed supply was also studied. Granivore abundance and biomass, as well as seed abundance, were greater in winter. Changes in total granivore abundance were mostly because of variations in numbers of the most mobile bird species, all of which were found to have similar patterns of variation in their abundance. Evidence suggests that during the non‐breeding season, the most mobile species are able to track patches of high seed availability over long distances, whereas the abundance of less vagile species largely depends on the local ecological conditions. Seed supply is a proximate factor that limits the abundance of granivorous birds in the Monte Desert during the winter, but does not limit species richness. Granivore abundance was not correlated with seed supply in spring.</jats:p>",

In addition mammary glucose uptake was studied in response to somatotropin (ST) treatment in mid-lactation and acute increases in glucose concentration induced by sodium-propionate challenge in early lactation. Mammary glucose uptake was independent of arterial glucose, insulin and Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations during lactation and during acute increases in arterial glucose concentration. Glucose uptake in the lactating mammary gland of the goat must therefore be carried out by an insulin-independent carrier, possible GLUT1, and glucose supply is not a limiting factor for uptake under <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> conditions. Extraction of glucose uptake changed markedly during the normal course of lactation, following the overall changes in milk yield. Concentrations of glucose in skimmed milk, believed to reflect intracellular glucose concentration, changed in opposite directions, resulting in decreasing ratios of arterialratioskimmed milk glucose concentration with progressing lactation. Thus, mammary synthetic capacity also involves a capacity for glucose uptake, which may be influenced by variations in glucose carrier numbers, as well as mammary metabolic activity (intracellular glucose concentration). In contrast to the situation during the normal course of lactation, ST stimulated milk yield, despite less efficient glucose extraction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the human heart, anterior and posterior septal branches are mainly responsible for the arterial supply of the interventricular septum. These arteries are the basis of efficient intercoronary collateralization. The right and left superior septal arteries also contribute to the nourishment of the septum and to any eventual collateralization. Because the right superior septal artery (RSSA) is small in diameter, short, and has a variable origin either at the proximal stem or in the ostial area of the right coronary artery, it is difficult or almost impossible to visualize it angiographically. During investigation of the arterial supply of the interventricular septum in 84 human heart specimens and 16 corrosion casts, we found a few peculiarities in the origin and pattern of the RSSA in four specimens. The RSSA was found in 27 cases (27%); in most it was a single vessel and arose from three different locations: (a) the proximal part of the right coronary artery (21 cases); (b) the right coronary ostial area (four cases); and (c) from the floor of the right (anterior) aortic sinus (two cases). Macroscopically, in 16 cases the RSSA had a length of less than 10 mm; in nine cases the arteries were between 11 and 17 mm long. In two cases the RSSA was of more substantial appearance and up to 36 mm in length; it nourished almost the entire upper third of the septal myocardium. In these two cases, two courses could be differentiated: an extramural course with the RSSA descending to the subvalvular fibrous tissue, and an intramural course with ramification in the myocardium of the crista supraventricularis and the superior parts of the interventricular septum. One cadaveric heart specimen and one corrosion cast showed RSSAs that originated “early” (ectopically) on the floor of the right (anterior) aortic sinus; their total lengths were 16 and 17 mm, respectively. Such ectopic ostia of RSSAs have never been described before in the anatomical literature. Given the intense clinical concern with the identification of possible bypass vessels in the myocardium, we assume that the RSSA may have a potential as a collateral route. These findings were also discussed in light of developmental and comparative anatomy. Clin. Anat. 14:312–319, 2001. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

Contributions of the RV oxygen extraction reserve and the RC flow reserve to exercise-induced increases in RV oxygen demand were measured. Strenuous exercise caused a 269% increase in RV oxygen consumption. Expanded arteriovenous oxygen content difference (A-VΔO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) provided 58% of this increase in oxygen demand, and increased RC blood flow (RCBF) provided 42%.

A system for quantitative analysis of 3‐oxo ester reduction was developed and allowed construction of full mass and redox balances as well as determination of the influence of different process parameters on aerobic ketone reduction. The nature of the electron donor (ethanol or glucose) and its specific consumption rate by the biomass (0–1 mol.kg dw<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) affected the overall stoichiometry and rate of the process and the final enantiomeric excess of the product. Excess glucose as the electron donor, i.e. a very high consumption rate of glucose, resulted in a high rate of alcoholic fermentation, oxygen consumption, and biomass formation and therefore causing low efficiency of glucose utilization. Controlled supply of the electron donor at the highest rates applied prevented alcoholic fermentation but still resulted in biomass formation and a high oxygen requirement, while low rates resulted in a more efficient use of the electron donor. Low supply rates of ethanol resulted in biomass decrease while low supply rates of glucose provided the most efficient strategy for electron donor provision and yielded a high enantiomeric excess of ethyl (<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>)‐3‐hydroxybutanoate. In contrast to batchwise conversions with excess glucose as the electron donor, this strategy prevented by‐product formation and biomass increase, and resulted in a low oxygen requirement.  © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

Three weeks after BMI, regional blood flow and capillary densities were significantly higher (4.6- and 2.8-fold, respectively), and cardiac function was improved. Angiography revealed that there was a marked increase (5.7-fold) in number of visible collateral vessels. Implantation of porcine coronary microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) did not cause any significant increase in capillary densities. Labeled BM-MNCs were incorporated into ≈31% of neocapillaries and corresponded to ≈8.7% of macrophages but did not actively survive as myoblasts or fibroblasts. There was no bone formation by osteoblasts or malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Time-dependent changes in plasma levels for cardiac enzymes (troponin I and creatine kinase-MB) did not differ between the BMI, CMEC, and medium-alone implantation groups. BM-MNCs contained 16% of endothelial-lineage cells and expressed basic fibroblast growth factor≫vascular endothelial growth factor&gt;angiopoietin 1 mRNAs, and their cardiac levels were significantly upregulated by BMI. Cardiac interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA expression were also induced by BMI but not by CMEC implantation. BM-MNCs were actively differentiated to endothelial cells in vitro and formed network structure with human umbilical vein endothelial cells.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>\n              <jats:italic>\n                <jats:italic>\n                  <jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>\n                </jats:italic>\n              </jats:italic>\n            </jats:bold>\n            BMI may constitute a novel safety strategy for achieving optimal therapeutic angiogenesis by the natural ability of the BM cells to secrete potent angiogenic ligands and cytokines as well as to be incorporated into foci of neovascularization.\n          </jats:p>",
