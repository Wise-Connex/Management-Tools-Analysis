Furthermore full capacity limits lead to viable dynamics from the global point of view if the steady state is locally attracting and to corridor stability with persistent fluctuations when it is repelling. These findings can to some extent also be obtained for a three‐dimensional growth cycle extension of the Skott model, which includes real wage dynamics as in Rose's employment cycle, now turned into economically viable dynamics through appropriate non‐linearities in the assumed adjustment processes of output and prices in the case when the steady state is locally repelling.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Contemporary monetary theory is characterized by the predominance of the monetarist thesis. Paradoxically, the widespread acceptance of the monetarists' conclusions has coincided with the disappearance of the stable relation between money stock and nominal income from the 1980s onwards. These results did not call the monetarist theory into question, but instead stimulated the elaboration of various proposals for the modification of the monetary authorities' operative schemes. Each of these proposals gives rise to some perplexity. These anomalies provide the justification for this paper, which sets out to analyse the characteristics of the money supply endogeneity theory, a theoretical approach initiated in the 1970s thanks to Kaldor's seminal contribution, with the objective of demonstrating the inconsistencies in the monetarists' conclusions. It is intended to show that the debate on the endogeneity theory developed by the post‐Keynesians has overlooked an essential aspect of Kaldor's theory, the examination of which permits: (a) the elaboration of an important criticism of monetarism; and (b) the development of a theory of credit and of financial intermediaries that highlights elements of Keynes's theory that have been neglected by the traditional interpretation.</jats:p>",

Thus, the model can explain why even in countries with flexible labor markets and full employment of skilled labor an employment problem exists at the bottom of the skill spectrum. The model is used to evaluate the impact of technological change and increased skill supply on the employment of low‐skilled workers. It is shown that a switch to technologies with higher skill requirements unambiguously leads to a rise in unemployment of low‐skilled workers. An increase in the supply of high‐skilled labor has a positive effect on the employment level of low‐skilled labor.</jats:p>",

Each installation includes 2–4 replications of N and P addition in a two-way factorial design. By approximating the constraints on nutrient use as elements in a linear programming problem, and estimating the parameters of the problem using least squares, we were able to identify baseline soil supply rates and fertilization efficiencies for N and P for each installation. Estimated N supply ranged from 47 kg ha-1 yr-1 to 103 kg ha-1 yr-1, while P supply ranged from 5.5 to 12.4 kg ha-1 yr-1. Fertilization efficiencies were extremely variable, ranging from 23% to 100% for N and 0% to 78% for P. A lower bound to the baseline supply rate was identified for K, Ca, and Mg for each site. While only three sites were P-limited, P limitation was imminent on all sites with operational doses of applied N. While the accuracy of NUTREM is limited by the availability of basic process-level data, the method suggests possibilities for predicting growth response to nutrient amendments. FOR.

Noting that only 27 per cent of the buyers are currently in any alliance relationships, and most are not planning to be in one, the study reveals that buyers expressed a lukewarm, and sometimes negative, attitude toward the formation of alliances. There are no attitudinal differences between firms in alliance relationships, compared with those without, in five of seven questions on alliance and in the relative importance given 14 of 15 purchasing criteria. With most suppliers willing to provide the buyers with the same benefits, irrespective of whether they are in alliance relationships, it appears that the limitations imposed by the small supply base tend to exert competitive pressures on the suppliers, discouraging buyers from forming partnership relationships.</jats:p>",

It is present in various chemical species with different iron to sulfur ratios. Iron sulfide species with high iron content is soluble in acids, whereas those rich in sulfur are almost insoluble in acids. Iron sulfide scale was detected in several water supply wells where a sour gas is used for gas lifting operation. The objectives of this study were to determine the mechanism that led to the formation of this type of scale, to characterize this scale and determine the most effective chemical treatments to remove and prevent reoccurrence. Lab work included characterization of the scale, and examine various acids and non-acids formulae to remove various iron sulfide species.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Several wells in a sandstone aquifer are used to supply water needed for the operation of gas oil separation plants (GOSPs). The reservoir pressure is low, therefore the water is produced using gas lifting. The gas used is an associated gas that is produced with the oil from a carbonate reservoir. The gas is sour with a hydrogen sulfide content of 2 mol%. In addition, the supply water contains total iron at 5–10 mg/L. Hydrogen sulfide reacts with the iron present in the aquifer water and precipitates iron sulfide on the well tubulars and gas injection nozzles. Accumulation of iron sulfide has caused many operational problems.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Lab results indicated that iron sulfide scale deposited on the inside wall of the well tubulars. The scale was uniform with a thickness that increased from 0.025\" above the gas injection point to 0.25\" at the well head. The composition of the scale changes with the length above the gas injection point. Just above the gas injection point, the scale was identified as FeS whereas close to wellhead, the scale was identified as FeS2. Acid solubility varied across the length of tubing. In areas where there is FeS, acid solubility in 20 wt% was 85–90 wt%. On the other hand, acid solubility was only 3–5 wt% in areas where FeS2 was present. Experimental results showed that 20 wt% could be used to remove a portion of the scale, however a suitable hydrogen sulfide scavenger should be added to the acid.

Reorder point policies manage inventories at every location. Average inventory, backorders and fill rates are evaluated exactly for each location. Safety stock is evaluated exactly at the lower echelon and a good approximation is detailed for the upper echelon. Numerical data are presented to demonstrate the model's utility. It is found that system costs generally increase substantially if the upper echelon is restricted to carry no inventory, of if the upper echelon is required to provide a high fill rate. In many cases it is optimal to set the upper echelon's reorder point to yield near zero safety stock, yet in some cases this simple heuristic can significantly increase supply chain operating costs. Finally, policies selected under the assumption of continuous inventory review can perform poorly if implemented in an environment with periodic review. </jats:p>",

To overhaul its supply-chain-management applications to handle the new business, it developed intelligent models to match assets with demand to determine which demands it could meet when and to provide manufacturing guidelines. In 1994, the PROFIT team began applying OR techniques to build these tools, interweaving linear programming with a traditional material resource planning algorithm and a heuristic matching process based on clues established in the explosion algorithm. The team has deployed three core applications: a weekly division run that determines customer commitments and manufacturing requirements, daily manufacturing runs that identify the best use of manufacturing resources to meet division requirements, and a division available-to-promise application that facilitates fast response to customers placing orders (not described). This work has improved manufacturing utilization and customer-order response time. </jats:p>",

Using 1990 census data and Illinois's 1994 Long-Term Care Facility Survey, census tracts were compared by need for long-term care, bed supply, and nursing home characteristics. While facilities cluster on the north side, and the number of beds follow the elderly, the supply of beds per elderly is actually greater in tracts with high proportions of poverty, disability, and African American residents due, in part, to the predominance of larger facilities. Ironically, economic segregation may work together with Medicaid's policy of serving the poorest to increase the supply of beds to those who might otherwise remain unserved. Nursing homes in the poorest communities have high percentages of Medicaid residents, are larger, and employ fewer staff per resident; homes with a high Medicaid population are more likely to employ LPNs, which may reflect labor supply differences.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the last decade Austria has successfully coped with extraordinary political and economic changes; most important among these was the accession to the European single market. Contrary to widespread expectation, Austro-corporatism did not continue to decline but made an astonishing comeback. This was accomplished despite no longer being able to rely on the government's traditional policy of explicit demand management. Left without a fiscal stimulus, and having to cope with the twin effects of economic internationalization and modernization, it was necessary to develop a new basis for the legitimacy of Austro-corporatism. This was made possible by a transition to supply-side corporatism, which appears uniquely suited to complement and take advantage of market liberalization, modernization, and economic integration. Under supply-side corporatism, corporatist actors function primarily as producers of collective goods not provided by an opportunistic market or by a political system constrained by a loss of economic competencies and political fragmentation. The competitive advantage of supply-side corporatism lies in achieving organized ‘flexibilization’ and decentralization; upgrading, that is, succeeding in market segments of high value-added products; macro-level coordination; and by rendering vital public policy support. A high level of macro-level coordination and concerted effort continues to be necessary to channel infrastructure development, investment in human capital, skill formation, and public investments into those niche segments of the industry in which Austria enjoys a natural advantage over its competitors. </jats:p>",

We examined the activity of 118 neurons in the CM and 62 neurons in the Pf nuclei of the thalamus and 310 tonically active neurons (TANs) in the striatum in awake behaving macaque monkeys and analyzed the effects of pharmacologic inactivation of the CM-Pf on the sensory responsiveness of the striatal TANs. A large proportion of CM and Pf neurons responded to visual (53%) and/or auditory beep (61%) or click (91%) stimuli presented in behavioral tasks, and many responded to unexpected auditory, visual, or somatosensory stimuli presented outside the task context. The neurons fell into two classes: those having short-latency facilitatory responses (SLF neurons, predominantly in the Pf) and those having long-latency facilitatory responses (LLF neurons, predominantly in the CM). Responses of both types of neuron appeared regardless of whether or not the sensory stimuli were associated with reward. These response characteristics of CM-Pf neurons sharply contrasted with those of TANs in the striatum, which under the same conditions responded preferentially to stimuli associated with reward. Many CM-Pf neurons responded to alerting stimuli such as unexpected handclaps and noises only for the first few times that they occurred; after that, the identical stimuli gradually became ineffective in evoking responses. Habituation of sensory responses was particularly common for the LLF neurons. Inactivation of neuronal activity in the CM and Pf by local infusion of the GABA<jats:sub>A</jats:sub> receptor agonist, muscimol, almost completely abolished the pause and rebound facilitatory responses of TANs in the striatum. Such injections also diminished behavioral responses to stimuli associated with reward. We suggest that neurons in the CM and Pf supply striatal neurons with information about behaviorally significant sensory events that can activate conditional responses of striatal neurons in combination with dopamine-mediated nigrostriatal inputs having motivational value. </jats:p>",

The effects of light and nutrient supply markedly differed. Light availability positively affected both photosynthetic capacity on an area basis (but not on a mass basis) and leaf N allocation to ribulose‐1,5‐biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), thereby increasing photosynthetic capacity per unit nitrogen. By contrast, nutrient supply in high‐light affected photosynthetic capacity both on an area and a mass basis, but did not affect the allocation of N within the photosynthetic apparatus. Fluorescence parameters indicated that shade‐grown seedlings transferred to high‐light with low‐nutrient supply, underwent prolonged photoinhibition.

Under these conditions, the currents that supply seston cannot offset ingestion by the bivalves and the carrying capacity is exceeded. We conducted a field and modelling study to examine factors affecting seston supply to a culture of suspended sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) in Whitehaven Harbour, Nova Scotia. Even though seston flux to the scallops was reduced by 40% due to the attenuation of flow by culture gear, a reduction in seston concentration was not observed. The field data were then used to parameterize a quasi two-dimensional advection-diffusion model that quantified the relationship between the tidally driven seston supply and consumption by scallops. The model predicted a minimal reduction in seston concentration (&lt;5%) within the lease (80 × 50 m), consistent with field observations. However, expanding the lease to occupy the area available for cultivation (1000 × 250 m) reduced the seston concentration in the centre of the lease by 20-50%, potentially limiting growth. Modelling results emphasized that by altering the lease geometry (lease width to length ratio), the supply of seston can be optimized.</jats:p>",

In this study, the effect of the exogenous 2′-deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphate (dNTP) supply on the average replication speed in a synchronised population of human HeLa cells was tested. The speed of replication fork movement was measured on extended DNA fibers labelled with 2′-deoxythymidine analogues 5-chloro-2′-deoxyuridine and 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine. We show that the introduction of exogenous dNTPs accelerates the replication process at the beginning of DNA synthesis only. In late S-phase, the administration of additional dNTPs has no effect on the speed of replication forks. The availability of 2′-deoxynucleotides seems to be a rate-limiting factor for DNA replication during early S-phase.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Retention of green leaf area in grain sorghum under post‐anthesis drought, known as stay‐green, is associated with greater biomass production, lodging resistance and yield. The stay‐green phenomenon can be examined at a cell, leaf, or whole plant level. At a cell level, the retention of chloroplast proteins such as LHCP2, OEC33 and Rubisco until late in senescence has been reported in sorghum containing the KS19 source of stay‐green, indicating that photosynthesis may be maintained for longer during senescence in these genotypes. At a leaf level, longevity of photosynthetic apparatus is intimately related to nitrogen (N) status. At a whole plant level, stay‐green can be viewed as a consequence of the balance between N demand by the grain and N supply during grain filling. To examine some of these concepts, nine hybrids varying in the B35 and KS19 sources of stay‐green were grown under a post‐anthesis water deficit. Genotypic variation in delayed onset and reduced rate of leaf senescence were explained by differences in specific leaf nitrogen (SLN) and N uptake during grain filling. Matching N supply from age‐related senescence and N uptake during grain filling with grain N demand found that the shortfall in N supply for grain filling was greater in the senescent than stay‐green hybrids, resulting in more accelerated leaf senescence in the former. We hypothesise that increased N uptake by stay‐green hybrids is a result of greater biomass accumulation during grain filling in response to increased sink demand (higher grain numbers) which, in turn, is the result of increased radiation use efficiency and transpiration efficiency due to higher SLN. Delayed leaf senescence resulting from higher SLN should, in turn, allow more carbon and nitrogen to be allocated to the roots of stay‐green hybrids during grain filling, thereby maintaining a greater capacity to extract N from the soil compared with senescent hybrids.</jats:p>",

In the case of <jats:italic>G. sepium</jats:italic>, cytochrome pathway activity remained unchanged whereas the alternative pathway activity increased with low nutritional phosphorus. At low phosphorus, alternative oxidase protein levels increased in the leaves of bean and <jats:italic>G. sepium</jats:italic> but not in tobacco, suggesting a dependence of alternative pathway activity on protein level. Alternative pathway activity was also not correlated with soluble carbohydrate concentration in bean or tobacco at any phosphorus level. These results show that the alternative pathway does not always act as an electron bypass in response to the downstream restriction of the cytochrome pathway imposed by low phosphorus supply. These results suggest that factors in addition to cellular carbohydrate level and adenylate control can act to regulate alternative pathway activity.</jats:p>",

The current standard for<jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>typing based on IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) suffers from the difficulty of comparing data between independent laboratories. Here, we propose a high-resolution typing method based on variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) of genetic elements named mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs) in 12 human minisatellite-like regions of the<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>genome. MIRU-VNTR profiles of 72 different<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>isolates were established by PCR analysis of all 12 loci. From 2 to 8 MIRU-VNTR alleles were identified in the 12 regions in these strains, which corresponds to a potential of over 16 million different combinations, yielding a resolution power close to that of IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>-RFLP. All epidemiologically related isolates tested were perfectly clustered by MIRU-VNTR typing, indicating that the stability of these MIRU-VNTRs is adequate to track outbreak episodes. The correlation between genetic relationships inferred from MIRU-VNTR and IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>-RFLP typing was highly significant. Compared with IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>-RFLP, high-resolution MIRU-VNTR typing has the considerable advantages of being fast, appropriate for all<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>isolates, including strains that have a few IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>copies, and permitting easy and rapid comparison of results from independent laboratories. This typing method opens the way to the construction of digital global databases for molecular epidemiology studies of<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",
