      "abstract": "<jats:p> Mathematical decision rules for the control of inventories in a large supply system are derived. These rules allow the minimization of total system shortages where this minimization is subject to specified system expenditures. Alternatively, the rules permit the minimization of system expenditures for a given level of system shortages. The mathematical model used to derive these rules includes the features random demands, random lead times, set-up and order costs, interest costs, obsolescence costs, physical holding costs, item unit costs, relative essentialities of items, and a measure of shortage costs which takes into account the durations that shortages persist. Derivation of the optimal rules employs an iterative solution of a nonlinear programming problem. Comparisons with presently-used decision rules for a large supply system indicate that significant improvements in system effectiveness can be obtained by the use of the optimal rules. </jats:p>",

Wild oat seedlings were smaller than the corresponding cultivated cereals in total dry weight, total nitrogen content, leaf area and number of shoots. However, very young wild oat plants had higher net assimilation rates than the cultivated cereals and soon caught up and passed them. The difference in net assimilation rate did not persist, and in the later stages of growth differences in dry‐matter production depended mainly on differences in leaf area. Another important difference between wild oats and cultivated cereals was that 98–100% of the wild oat seeds and none of the crop seeds were dormant 2 months after harvest.</jats:p><jats:p>Ear emergence in wild oats spread over a longer period, the range of ear heights was greater and the tallest ears were taller than in the corresponding cultivated cereals. Assimilation in the ear appeared to account for less of the total dry matter of the plants of wild and cultivated oats than of wheat. The wild oats produced more seeds per plant than the cultivated cereals, but the 1000‐grain weight, and hence the total dry weight of seeds, was lower in the weeds than in the crop.</jats:p><jats:p>Addition of nitrogen to the soil affected the growth of the wild oats in the same ways as the cultivated cereals; they took up the same amount of nitrogen per plant as winter oats and winter wheat but more than spring barley.</jats:p><jats:p>It is concluded that wild oats are most susceptible in the seedling stage to competition from the crop and that nitrogenous fertilizer applied to an infested field is unlikely to alter the balance between the yields of crop and of wild oats.</jats:p>",
