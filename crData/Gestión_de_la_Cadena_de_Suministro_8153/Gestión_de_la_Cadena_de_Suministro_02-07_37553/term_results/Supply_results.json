Frauwirth\n            <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>\n            provide evidence that costimulation of the T cell receptor complex by CD28, which stimulates a prolonged activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt that is downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), directly stimulates glucose uptake and glycolysis. CD28 costimulation stimulated the expression of the Glut1 glucose uptake transporter, stimulated glucose uptake, and stimulated glycolysis with a concomitant secretion of lactate. Thus, the stimulated T cells adjust glucose availability and metabolism in response to receptor and coreceptor stimulation, instead of in response to depletion of cellular energy stores. The secretion of lactate is interpreted to mean that the cells are not responding to a drop in cellular adenosine triphosphate concentration, but are increasing glycolytic flux in excess of the cellular metabolic requirements. Thus, through a mechanism analagous to that initiated by insulin, CD28 costimulation enhances glucose availability and metabolism through activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, allowing the cells to meet, indeed even exceed, their metabolic requirements through increased glycolytic flux.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            K.

Experiments indicate that nitrosamine formation during chlorination of wastewater is consistent with a reaction scheme involving the slow formation of a hydrazine intermediate from a secondary amine and monochloramine, followed by its rapid oxidation to the corresponding N-nitrosamine. A survey of precursors indicates that secondary amines form their corresponding N-nitrosamines to the greatest extent. However, molecules containing the secondary amine as a functional group can also form the corresponding N-nitrosamine. NDMA is the predominant N-nitrosamine found in chlorinated wastewater. However, other nitrosamines are detected. These N-nitrosamines may be important if the summed risk posed by the exposure to all N-nitrosamines is considered.</jats:p>",

Recognition of the outbreak came from non-official sources. In the absence of any meaningful investigations by the public health authorities of both the countries, a tour operator undertook an investigation. The epidemiological studies were restricted but it was concluded that the outbreak was associated with contaminated swimming pool water at the hotel. The initial source of contamination was most probably a hotel guest who was excreting cryptosporidium oocysts. Examination of the water treatment system revealed some deficiencies in the sand filters but the effect on the course of the outbreak could not be determined. Although the media in the filters was thoroughly cleaned and the filters refreshed, oocysts could still be detected in pool water and further cases occurred. The challenges of an outbreak involving more than one country and the measures necessary to reduce the risks of cryptosporidium infections associated with hotel swimming pools are discussed.</jats:p>",

The role of contact time (up to 2 hours), chlorine dose (3 levels), pH and temperature on the formation of THM was evaluated. THM formation, as measured by individual concentration as well as formation potential, was high for the nitrified secondary effluent, while for the partially nitrified effluent the respective concentrations were low, due to the reaction of chlorine with ammonia to form chloramines. In general, THM concentrations progressively increased as contact time, pH and chlorine dose increased. Increase in temperature (from 15-25°C) showed a rather limited effect. In addition, coagulation tests were applied prior to chlorination of the nitrified effluent for removing organic carbon and thereby controlling the formation of THM. Alum was used as the coagulant in doses varying from 0.1 mM to 2.5 mM. As the coagulant dose increased, the removal of both DOC and absorbance at 254 nm increased, while THM formation decreased. The reduction in THM formation was more pronounced for coagulant doses higher than 1.5 mM.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The initial pre-disinfection was one of the stages that most contributed to the formation of a large number of halogenated disinfection by-products (DBPs). The threat and awareness to the formation of chlorine disinfection by-products, refrained from using pre-disinfection with chlorine in the treatment of contaminated raw waters, to be used as drinking water. The main purpose of this research was to study whether chlorine dioxide can be used for pre-disinfection in the treatment of highly polluted wastewaters and surface waters. Chlorine dioxide was found suitable, as a replacement for chlorine, for disinfection of water containing natural organic substances, effluents’ organic materials and ammonium ions, due to its advantages, and especially because it is an effective disinfectant for killing pathogenic microorganisms and destroying viruses. Chlorine dioxide does not form THMs and barely creates chloroorganic compounds. However, the main disadvantage of the chlorine dioxide is the creation of undesirable chlorite and chlorate ions, which are suspected of being toxic. This research showed that the undesirable chlorite ions can be removed completely by adding Fe+2, which reduces ClO2- to the harmless Cl-, and is oxidized to Fe+3, to form the ferric polyhydroxo complexes, that can be used as the flocculant, in the next flocculation step, for the achievement of safer drinking water.</jats:p>",

We tested the efficiency of five protocols for the extraction of either genomic DNA or total RNA from Giardia cysts: two of these protocols were previously cited in the literature and three consisted of commercial DNA extraction kits. The brands of enzyme were determined according to the primers chosen and the amplification conditions were optimised: 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM primers and 60°C for annealing temperature. A semi-nested PCR method and an RT semi-nested PCR procedure were developed to detect mRNA from these three genes and to estimate the viability of Giardia cysts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Biodosimetry, that is the application of microorganisms for the measurement of radiation, is already in wide use in the field of UV disinfection. The measurement of the mean fluence in flow-through systems with a biodosimeter (microorganisms with calibrated UV sensitivity) results in the Reduction Equivalent Fluence (REF). In the case of quasi monochromatic radiation (mercury low pressure lamp, 253.7 nm), the flow pattern of the water through the inhomogeneous radiation field, together with some other parameters, strongly influences the REF but the spectral sensitivity of the biodosimeter plays no role. If microorganisms with shouldered survival curves are used as biodosimeters two parameters (k and d) are necessary to describe their survival curves. In general, both parameters are wavelength dependent and the functions k(λ) and d(λ) must be known if medium pressure mercury lamps are used, which emit polychromatic UV radiation. The knowledge of k(λ) also is necessary for selecting an appropriate UV sensor which controls the function of the UV lamps during the operation of the disinfection plant. In literature many different spectral sensitivity curves were published but they all differ somehow. The functions k(λ) and d(λ) were measured for spores of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 in using quasi-monochromatic UV radiation and the results were tested in using polychromatic UV radiation.</jats:p>",

Specific aims included measuring the recovery of protozoan control material from representative source waters, identifying laboratory errors and assessing the utility of pre-stained reference oo/cysts. Five experienced laboratories were provided with coded vials containing oo/cysts or blanks for spiking 10 L water samples (11 replicate environmental, 5 filtered) or to be analysed directly (16 Count Control vials). Each laboratory reported both their standard counts and details of how each oo/cyst image was interpreted and confirmed. A sixth laboratory provided flow cytometry prepared seed material and reference analyses. Average recoveries for 10 L samples ranged from 0-67% and 0-72%, for environmental and filtered tap water respectively, depending on laboratory and sample type. The best performing laboratory obtained high recoveries, ranging from 45% to 66% for tap water and 63% to 81% for environmental water. Nonetheless, recovery from tap water and environmental sample analysed simultaneously by the same laboratory could differ markedly (1% v. 48% in one case). Poor recovery and false positives were encountered despite the experience of the participants. Inconsistencies in reporting were introduced by the different procedures for confirming oocysts and cysts. The trial showed that obtaining reliable estimates of environmental protozoan loads is still a concern for water managers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A laboratory based microcosm study utilising intact non-sterile sediment cores was undertaken to determine the survival of the faecal indicator organisms Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and somatic coliphage in both recreational coastal water and sediment. Overlying water was inoculated with the test organisms and incubated at 10°C, 20°C or 30°C. E. coli, enterococcus and coliphage were enumerated from the water column and sediment by the membrane filtration method, Enterolert (IDEXX Laboratories) and the double-agar overlay methods respectively on days 0, 1, 2, 7, 14 and 28 following inoculation. It was demonstrated that for all organisms, greater decay (k; d-1) occurred in the water column compared to sediment. Sediment characteristics were found to influence decay, with lowest decay rates observed in sediment consisting of high organic carbon content and small particle size. Decay of E. coli was significantly greater in both the water column and sediment compared with enterococcus and coliphage under all conditions. Decay of enterococcus was found to closely resemble that of coliphage decay. Survival of all organisms was inversely related to temperature, with greatest decay at 30°C. However, increased temperature had a less significant impact on survival of enterococcus and coliphage compared with E. coli. The importance of this study for estimating risk from recreational exposure is great if some pathogenic microorganisms behave similarly to the organisms tested in this study. In particular if survival rates of pathogens are similar to enterococcus and coliphage, then their ability to accumulate in coastal sediment may lead to an increased risk of exposure if these organisms are resuspended into the water column due to natural turbulence or human recreational activity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the purpose of destroying helminth eggs, laboratory tests were carried out using a batch reactor of 1 L with 500 mL of eggs in suspension (1 × 105 eggs/L). In all the tests, a 36.8 mg O3/L concentration of gas-phase ozone was applied at the bottom of the reactor, with flows of 0.25 and 0.5 L/min to achieve rates of 9.2 and 18.4 mg O3/min, respectively. The results (first stage) showed that the eggs of Ascaris suum were destroyed at a pH of less than 5, with a dose of 18.4 mg O3/min., giving a 94% success rate; these results were improved when applying a pH 3 (second stage) with 18.4 mg O3/min for an hour, and 96.7% of the eggs showed damage to their external covers. In comparison with other species, total destruction was achieved in 1 hour and 45 minutes at pH 3 for the case of the Fasciola hepatica and the Strongiloides sp. The destruction of the Dypilidium caninum was completed after 3 hours. However, with regard to the Toxocara canis, eggs still remained, but they were observed to be seriously damaged. The degree of COD removal in the tests with the Ascaris suum was 75% after 2 hours. In the case of the other species, the COD removal was better since it varied from 85-94% after 2 hours of treatment. It can be concluded that during the process of oxidation in an acid environment, ozone hydrolyzes the amino acids that characterize the proteins of the layers covering the egg, and at the same time it breaks the cover of the egg and disperses the cytoplasm of the eggs into the solution, therefore making it impossible for the eggs to become reactivated.</jats:p>",

Coxsackie B viruses (CBV) were used as a model in these assessments. A high proportion of Coxsackie B virus infections are asymptomatic. However, clinical manifestations may range from mild, undifferentiated febrile illness or upper respiratory tract infection to a severe, systemic and sometimes fatal disease of sensitive populations. Dose-response studies suggested that an exponential model best describes infectivity of CBV. The analysis of 172 samples of treated drinking water supplies described in this study revealed the presence of CBVs in 11% (water treatment unit A) and 16% (water treatment unit B) of the samples. This incidence of CBV was used as a basis for risk assessment. The results indicated that the drinking water supplies concerned constitute a risk of CBV infection of 3.91 × 10-3 (unit A) and 7.4 × 10-3 (unit B) per year. The estimated risk of infection are about an order of magnitude higher than the yearly acceptable risk of one infection per 10,000 consumers proposed for drinking water supplies.</jats:p>",

In a first epidemiological survey Cryptosporidium was found in high prevalence (17 of 24 species examined; n = 490), whereas Giardia was detected in two animals. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutation scanning technique was established for identification of C. parvum to the strain level from oocyst isolates. This so-called single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique allows high-resolution analysis of genetic variability within and between populations of C. parvum. In a blind test, SSCP genotyping of 23 DNA samples representing C. parvum from different host and geographical regions demonstrated that the method could correctly type samples identified previously using a range of other methods, and displayed higher levels of sequence variability compared with conventional approaches. Hence, the method provides a powerful epidemiological tool for diagnosis as well as for identifying the source of waterborne outbreaks. Future molecular epidemiological surveys of cryptosporidosis/Cryptosporidium will be conducted together with Australian and European collaborators, with a particular emphasis on human cryptosporidosis.</jats:p>",

From the 5 years data collected from eight water treatment plants, the algal removal showed 0.63 - 1.83 log in coagulation and 1.66 - 4.17 log in sand filtration including coagulation. In jar tests, zeta potentials of flocs at an ALT ratio of 0.05 were -8.5 mV, -8.5 mV, -7.0 mV and -10.5 mV, and the removal rates at pH 7 were 2.05 log, 1.15 log, 1.51 log and 1.49-log for Microcystis viridis, Microcystis aeruginosa, Selenastrum capricornutum and C. parvum oocysts, respectively. In direct filtration tests, the removal rates of algae and C. parvum oocysts, except for M. aeruginosa, were around 3-log during the filtration time of 15-45 minutes when the best removal occurred. S. capricornutum, out of the three species of algae, showed almost the same coagulation characteristics as C. parvum oocysts and also behaved in a filtration pattern similar to C. parvum. From these results, algae were considered useful surrogate indices for the removal of C. parvum oocysts, and S. capricornutum was thought to be an appropriate one in rapid sand filtration.</jats:p>",

Given that NHS dentistry is subject to a fixed price system, the study focused mainly on non‐income supply‐side factors. Using data from a postal survey of a national random sample of dentists practising in the NHS in England in 1997, the study found that the strategies adopted by dentists in the management of NHS lists and the evidence that dentists spent significantly more time in private consultations compared with NHS consultations support concerns over equity of access to dental care and the quality of NHS dentistry. Dentists' attitudes to NHS and private dentistry revealed considerable ambiguity towards the NHS. While, on the one hand, the lack of sufficient demand for private dentistry emerged as a strong reason for remaining in the NHS, on the other, there was evidence that equity in access to dental treatment is still seen as an important principle. The implications of these findings in the context of recent discussion of the future of NHS dentistry are considered. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Evidence has been presented that some heterotrophic bacteria often detected in drinking water supplies possess features associated with pathogenicity. This suggests that even the low numbers of heterotrophic bacteria considered acceptable by drinking water specifications may constitute a health risk, particularly to immunocompromised consumers. In this study, 339 bacteria were isolated at random from routine heterotrophic plate count (HPC) tests on selected drinking water supplies in South Africa. In a first screen for potentially pathogenic properties, 188 of the isolates (55.5%) displayed a- or b-haemolysis on blood agar. Further analysis of the haemolytic isolates for enzymes associated with virulence revealed the presence of chondroitinase (5.3%), coagulase (16.0%), DNase (60.6%), elastase (33.0%), fibrinolysin (53.7%), gelatinase (62.2%), hyaluronidase (21.3%), lecithinase (47.9%), lipase (54.8%) and proteinase (64.4%) of the isolates. No fluorescein or pyocyanin was detected in any of the isolates. Among the haemolytic isolates 68.6% were resistant to oxacillin (1 μg), 59.6% to penicillin G (2 units), 47.3% to penicillin G (10 units), 53.7% to ampicillin (10 μg) and 42.6% to ampicillin (25 μg). Cytotoxicity, invasiveness and adherence properties of the haemolytic isolates was determined on HEp-2 and Caco2 cell lines. Among the haemolytic isolates 96% were cytolytic on the HEp-2 cell line. All the haemolytic isolates adhered to HEp-2 and Caco2 cells but gram-negative isolates tended to adhere in larger numbers than gram-positive isolates. HEp-2 cells were invaded by 42% of the haemolytic isolates. Heterotrophic bacteria, which most frequently revealed the above features associated with pathogenicity included species of the following genera: Aeromonas, Acinetobacter, Aureobacterium, Bacillus, Klebsiella, Moraxella, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Tsukamurella and Vibrio. The results obtained in this study support earlier indications that bacteria detected by routine heterotrophic plate counts on drinking water supplies may include bacteria associated with potentially pathogenic properties. The extent to which these bacteria in drinking water supplies may constitute a health risk remains to be investigated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We investigate the role of options (contingent claims) in a buyer-supplier system. Specifically using a two-period model with correlated demand, we illustrate how options provide flexibility to a buyer to respond to market changes in the second period. We also study the implications of such arrangements between a buyer and a supplier for coordination of the channel. We show that, in general, channel coordination can be achieved only if we allow the exercise price to be piecewise linear. We develop sufficient conditions on the cost parameters such that linear prices coordinate the channel. We derive the appropriate prices for channel coordination which, however, violate the individual rationality constraint for the supplier. Contrary to popular belief (based on simpler models) we show that credit for returns offered by the supplier does not always coordinate the channel and alleviate the individual rationality constraint. Credit for returns are useful only on a subset of the feasibility region under which channel coordination is achievable with linear prices. Finally, we demonstrate (numerically) the benefits of options in improving channel performance and evaluate the magnitude of loss due to lack of coordination. </jats:p>",

The PAGE patterns resulting from the procedure consisted of from 8 to 18 bands in the 300 to 3,000 bp size range. Application of the procedure revealed widely divergent PAGE banding among the geographically diverse samples. Consistent banding patterns were observed among multiple calf hosts from the same dairy herd sampled over 1 to 2 year periods. Some differences were observed in PAGE banding between samples in different time periods although all independent samples in each sampling period (up to 5 shown) were homogeneous. Analysis of DNA from samples of the Iowa defined strain of C. parvum isolated in 1998 and in 2000 from the same source (University of Arizona) resulted in PAGE banding that was homogeneous. The sub-type differentiation effectiveness of the M+T PAGE procedure was observed to be substantial. Reference to work being prepared for publication elsewhere indicates that it is similarly effective for Type 1 samples.</jats:p>",

Biofilm growth was followed by transmission light microscopy for 81 days and showed a biofilm consisting of microcolonies separated by a monolayer of cells. Protozoans (ciliates and flagellates) were often seen attached to the microcolonies. The biofilm was hybridized with oligonucleotide probes specific for all bacteria and the α- and β-subclass of Proteobacteria and visualized with a scanning confocal laser microscope. Hybridization showed that the microcolonies primarily consisted of a mixed population of α- and β-Proteobacteria. 65 strains from the inlet water and 20 from the biofilm were isolated on R2A agar plates and sorted into groups with amplified rDNA restriction analysis. The 16S rDNA gene was sequenced for representatives of the abundant groups. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of the isolated strains from the bulk water and biofilm were affiliated to the family of Comamonadaceae in the β-lineage of Proteobacteria. The majority of the strains from the α-lineage were affiliated to the family of Sphingomonadaceae. We were unable to detect any strains from the Pseudomonas genus and found a low abundance of bacteria affiliated to the γ-subclass of Proteobacteria where Pseudomonas and E. coli are positioned. The analysis revealed a high bacterial diversity in the water phase as well as the biofilm, but no strains were found in both environments.</jats:p>",

It begins by identifying a number of the factors which make global supply chains so difficult to manage. It goes on to outline a framework of different approaches that can be taken to managing the supply chain with relation to child labour, moving from national and international regulation, through to the role of NGOs and the companies themselves. Focusing on an ‘engagement’ strategy for dealing with child labour, the paper traces a case study of Adidas‐Salomon and its attempts to implement their ‘standards of engagement’ in this area with relation to one of their supplier factories in Vietnam. The research draws on the direct involvement of one of the authors who visited the site and was able to interview staff and observe the operation in practice. Her findings are supported by wider work on the implementation of corporate approaches to human rights at a range of companies interviewed by another of the authors. The paper aims to highlight the issues needing to be addressed for companies considering the ‘involvement’ approach to child labour. It also aims to develop theory on our understanding of different approaches to corporate rights.</jats:p>",

A model to describe the bacterial water quality change was developed on the basis of investigations. In contrast to other models, a consideration of the formation of BOM as a result of NOM oxidation by disinfectant residuals as well as the decreasing effect of inactivation of released bacteria by the decreasing disinfectant residual concentration, were necessary.</jats:p>",

Improved DOC removal was achieved with the inclusion of MIEX® treatment in the process. The DOC remaining after each treatment strategy was different in character. The molecular weight distribution results indicated that MIEX® treatment removed a broad range of compounds, whilst alum treatment targetted the removal of high molecular weight compounds. In addition, the DOC remaining after MIEX® treatment consisted of compounds with lower specific UV absorbance (SUVA). Including MIEX® in the treatment stream provided better DOC and bromide removal thus reducing chlorine decay and trihalomethane (THM) formation. The ability of the water to support bacterial growth as measured by bacterial regrowth potential (BRP) was the lowest after MIEX® treatment (option c) compared with the three other treatments (options a, b and d). In summary, laboratory tests show that including MIEX® in the treatment process can improve treated water quality. (*MIEX® is a registered trademark of Orica Australia Pty Ltd)</jats:p>",

The results showed that all the monitored pathogens could be detected, and that enteric viruses were present at considerable concentrations in sewage. High concentrations of astrovirus in raw sewage were observed during a diarrhea epidemic in the local day-care centre.

Metabolic demand per unit mass thus decreases as body mass increases. Metabolic rates reflect both the ability of the organism's transport system to deliver metabolites to the tissues and the rate at which the tissues use them. We show that the ubiquitous 3/4 power law for interspecific metabolic scaling arises from simple, general geometric properties of transportation networks constrained to function in biological organisms. The 3/4 exponent and other observed scaling relationships follow when mass-specific metabolic demands match the changing delivery capacities of the network at different body sizes. Deviation from the 3/4 exponent suggests either inefficiency or compensating physiological mechanisms. Our conclusions are based on general arguments incorporating the minimum of biological detail and should therefore apply to the widest range of organisms.</jats:p>",

Most studies that have examined the removal of these and other pathogens by filtration have been conducted under steady-state conditions with optimized pre-treatment. The research on which this paper is based evaluated the removal of Cryptosporidium and surrogates at various points in the filter cycle and under non-optimal conditions, at several pilot plants. The focus of this paper is on the relationship between removals of Cryptosporidium, and turbidity and particle counts. Under stable or optimal operating conditions all pilot plants produced similar low filter effluent turbidity and particle counts. Average Cryptosporidium removal varied among locations, however, by more than two log units. Cryptosporidium removal was impaired under all of the non-optimal conditions. Particle and turbidity performance was also worse, but the relationship of these parameters to Cryptosporidium removal varied. Particle counts show greater promise than turbidity as a tool to monitor filter performance in real time for possible deterioration in Cryptosporidium removal capability.</jats:p>",

Toxin synthesis can be stimulated by the induction of integrated toxin-converting phages from the host E. coli O157:H7 organism by ultra-violet (UV) exposure. The UV-mediated DNA damage of E. coli O157:H7 triggers a bacterial SOS response resulting in phage release. Free ranging phages outside their E. coli O157:H7 hosts were detected but could not be isolated directly from environmental samples such as sewage and river water. E. coli O157:H7 colonies carrying the genes coding for Stx2 were isolated from 1 sewage sample (0.76% of positive samples), 8 cattle faecal samples (16.67% of positive samples) and 2 pig faecal samples (14.28% of positive samples). Characterization of E. coli O157:H7 was done by repetitive sequence analysis using ERIC-PCR to determine the relationships between the individual E. coli O157:H7 strains. The ERIC-PCR analysis revealed distinct patterns for all E. coli O157:H7 strains with some small differences between the strains. DNA sequencing of some of the E. coli O157:H7 positive isolates carrying the Stx2 genes were performed confirming the amplified DNA nucleotide sequences of Stx2. Electron microscopic analysis revealed, for the first time in South Africa, that Stx2-converting phages induced from E. coli O157:H7 have different morphologies to that of phage lambda which was previously described. The role of the induced integrated Stx2 phages in natural environments such as river and dam water remains unclear. With the induction of Stx2-converting phages from environmental E. coli O157:H7 isolates, it is now possible to determine the potential of these phages to convert non-pathogenic E. coli strains and other enterobacteriaciae into pathogenic strains.</jats:p>",

Firstly, nominal and degraded modes of each step of the treatment line are analysed, in order to obtain transfer functions (which give output concentration of parameters in function of the input concentration) for each step of the treatment and each quality parameter, in nominal and degraded functioning. The transfer function of the whole treatment process can thereby be obtained by combination of transfer function of each step, and failure conditions of the whole treatment process and corresponding degraded global transfer function could be determined. Secondly, an inversion of both global function (nominal and degraded) permits to estimate probability for the resource to exceed thresholds fixed by regulation (in that case, a scenario of non-compliant drinking water exists), and to obtain a compliant water availability. Finally, this paper presents a software tool realised to evaluate the risk of non-compliant produced water, using the described methodology. Finally, an approach of risk assessment for Cryptosporidium is also presented. This method allows to identification and puts priorities for utilities presenting the highest risk.</jats:p>",

In the case of Neuilly-sur-Marne ozone contactors, four ozone doses were studied at 5°C and at 22°C. Results showed a sharp decrease of the disease burden with the application of ozone, and then a slight increase as the ozone dose was increased. Minimal DALYs were obtained with ozone doses of 1.5 mg/L at 22°C and 2.5 mg/L at 5°C. Nevertheless, these two ozone doses do not comply with the 10 μg/L bromate standard, as an average of 12 at 5°C and 11 at 22°C are produced.</jats:p>",

In this review, we discuss the anatomy and nomenclature of the lesion, emphasising the variability that can occur in pulmonary arterial anatomy, particularly in the presence of systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries. We speculate on the likely embryologic origins of these connections. Then by means of anatomic-clinical correlations, we emphasise the diagnostic approach to delineating the origin and extent of the pulmonary vasculature.</jats:p>",

Free peptides were detected in the fermenter liquid for 4 h after feeding in the AC treatment, for 10 h in the PS treatment, and at all times with the PC treatment. Treatments had no effect on DM degradation. Approximately 40 % of the degradation occurred during the time no peptides were detected in the PS treatment. Microbial N flow tended to be higher with the peptide additions (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0·061), with no significant difference between the two peptides treatments.

However, LAM only accounted for 20–30 % total microbial population. Our main conclusion was that peptides had a small stimulatory effect on the fermentation, but there was no indication that synchrony of supply of energy and amino acid-N in the fermenter promoted a more efficient fermentation than non-synchronous supply. This conclusion must be qualified, however, because some N remained in the fibre and may have become available progressively as the fibre was digested by the micro-organisms.</jats:p>",

We examine two different voluntary standards, one for the management of design for environment (DfE) in the semiconductor fabrication equipment sector and the other for assessing the implementation and use of environmental management systems throughout the computer industry supply chain. We compare and contrast the two standards to explain why the former was widely adopted and has helped integrate DfE into buyer‐supplier relations among adopters, whereas the latter failed to gain acceptance. In line with NIE logic, both standards aimed to lower transaction and customization costs by setting “rules of the game” for interfirm transactions that would help simplify and routinize novel environmental supply‐chain programs and activities. Their differential success can be elucidated in terms of how well each met the NIE criteria for remediableness and legitimacy. We conclude that voluntary standards have the potential to play an important role in promoting DfE in industrial supply chains. We further conclude that NIE provides a conceptual framework of great value to industrial ecologists who analyze how industry standards and other institutions help firms move toward more sustainable supply‐chain management practices.</jats:p>",

To maintain sustainable competitive advantage, companies need to align business goals and objectives with their supply chain strategies. In this paper, the authors emphasize the need for organizations to break down their internal functional barriers and view the organization in a holistic manner in order to reap the benefits of an integrated supply chain. To do this, organizations need to imbibe a new mindset. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pathogen concentrations are most often monitored during dry weather. Generally in Australia, however, loads mobilised during storms are of more concern. The filling of reservoirs commonly occurs from heavy rain events, and flood inputs may destabilise reservoir hydraulics leading to short-circuiting of contaminates to water supply off-takes. To capture storm events that can occur rapidly in remote locations at any time, automated sampling would seem appropriate. Unfortunately no commercial sampling system appears suitable for collecting multiple large volume samples along a hydrograph. We report here the development of an Event Sampling System (ESS) and associated resources, designed to address the special needs of microbiological sampling and varying event and site characteristics. The resultant ESSs consist of a standardised sampling module, enclosed in housings suited to different circumstances that is currently being field tested at six sites. Sampling module components include ISCO samplers modified to collect 24 ten litre ambient and 24 one litre refrigerated samples at remote sites along with in situ stream data. Essential to this hardware are sample collection and ESS management protocols covering issues such as storm warning, collection team mobilisation, laboratory coordination, ESS commissioning and maintenance. Some issues remain to be addressed, hence the resulting ESSs are seen as prototypes in the development of standardised storm-event based microbiological sampling well suited to remote locations.</jats:p>",

Model outputs of economic cost, nitrogen oxides (NO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>) emissions, and transport distributions are visualized using an Internet‐based graphic user interface.

Costs and pollution emissions can be reduced by enlarging coke‐making plants near the rail stations and closing down other plants. Preferential minimization of transportation costs gives a lower total cost than simply minimizing plant costs. Therefore, policy makers should consider transportation costs when planning the reallocation of coke‐making capacity in Shanxi Province. Increasing rail‐transport capacity is less effective than aggregating plant capacity. On the other hand, transfer of low‐pollution truck technology results in a large emission reduction, however, reflecting the importance of truck transportation in the Shanxi Province coke‐making industry.</jats:p>",

In particular, decreasing grazing pressure combined with abandonment of agricultural uplands favoured the development of Mediterranean forests with a corresponding reduction of open habitats and landscape diversity. In some parts of the Mediterranean basin, including our study area, the reduction of open landscapes took place at the same time as a rapid decline in rabbits as a result of myxomatosis. This study assesses the impact of past changes in landscape and rabbit density on the density and the breeding performance of the eagle owl <jats:italic>Bubo bubo</jats:italic>, one of the largest predators of Mediterranean ecosystems. Eagle owl density, nest site structure and composition at the landscape level, diet and fecundity of 35 eagle owl nesting territories was analysed for 27 years. The study area is characterized by two distinct areas, the border of the massif and the interior, in which past changes acted differently. Eagle owls in the interior were simultaneously affected by the loss of rabbits, a shift to smaller prey, and by open areas reverting to forest. All of these factors reduced the foraging efficiency of the owls. When myxomatosis decimated the rabbit population, owls in the border area switched to other mammals, birds and fish, whereas in the interior, alternative prey were less abundant. The main impacts of reduced prey availability and landscape diversity on interior pairs were: (1) lower density of breeding pairs; (2) lower diversity in landscape structure and closer habitats; (3) lower richness and diversity in the diet; (4) later egg‐laying dates; (5) lower productivity.</jats:p>",

Ames test and three genotoxicity plant tests, Allium tests and Tradescantia/micronuclei (TRAD/MCN) test, were used to evaluate the mutagenic activity of disinfected water samples. Chemical analysis, using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), was also performed to identify disinfection by-products (DBPs). A slight bacterial mutagenicity was found in raw river water and similar activity was detected in disinfected water samples. Plant tests gave genotoxicity only for raw river water. DBPs identified in PAA-treated water included carboxylic acids, a few non-halogenated alcohols and carbonyl-containing compounds, whereas some potentially mutagenic halogenated by-products were found in NaClO-treated samples. Although PAA appears to be promising for water potabilization, these results must be confirmed with different source waters and with higher concentrations of PAA.</jats:p>",
