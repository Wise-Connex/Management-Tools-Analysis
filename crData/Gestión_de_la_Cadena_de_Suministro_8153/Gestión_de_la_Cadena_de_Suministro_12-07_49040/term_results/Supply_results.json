      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global supply chains have a distinct geography that involves the dimensions of production, distribution and consumption. This geography, at the heart of many sourcing strategies, is often neglected by supply chain managers, or at least scholars investigating supply chain management. However, this essay underlines that this geography reveals patterns that depict well the organization and structure of outsourcing with distribution systems supporting the dichotomy between the geography of production and consumption. Significant segments of supply chain management exist solely to support this spatial divergence. Global processes are also reflected in regional structures and the case of third party logistics providers is investigated. Depending on the gateway and the type of supply chain being serviced, North American 3PLs display a clustering that is particularly prevalent around airport terminals and crossborder ports of entry. Such firms are highly flexible and changes in the locational behavior are likely to reflect changes in outsourcing and supply chain management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Trade facilitation (TF) is the rubric that covers the research and policy analysis on impediments to global sourcing and multinational supply chains that are not the traditional border barriers such as tariffs or quotas. Trade‐facilitation research offers a macroeconomic perspective on how policymakers should change the environment facing business to promote international trade and economic growth, whereas the microeconomic perspective of supply‐chain logistics considers how a business should organize its operations given the policy environment. Four approaches to trade‐facilitation research that are oriented toward measuring the policy environment facing business are covered in this review: country benchmarking, country or product case study, deep econometric analysis of one type of trade facilitation and econometric analysis of multiple trade‐facilitation issues faced by businesses across multiple countries. All told, the research shows that the links between improved trade‐facilitation policies and business global sourcing through international trade are positive, although which policy reforms support more global sourcing is unique to each country, depending on the products and supply chains that the country is part of, and initial conditions. Even so, a key finding that spans the research is that unilateral policy reforms within a country can expand international trade more than multilateral trade negotiations, and that trade‐facilitation reforms tend to improve the country's supplier position more than its buyer activities. Moreover, adherence to International Organization for Standardization (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ISO</jats:styled-content>) and use of information technology are particularly important, confirming that <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ISO</jats:styled-content> certification has become the “price of admission” for many supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While environmental management is an important topic in supply chain management, there is little theoretical understanding of how firm practices (supervisory support, rewards, and training) relate to employee engagement in environmental behaviors. Drawing upon behavioral research literature, the purpose of our article is to use organizational support theory to develop a model of how employee perceptions of management practices influence employee engagement in environmental behaviors such as participating in environmental management activities, promoting environmental initiatives, and proposing innovative environmental practices. The theoretical model was evaluated using a sample of supply chain management employees employed by a major retailer and support was found for all of the hypothesized relationships except those entailing rewards. Study findings demonstrate the importance of employee perceptions in advancing employee‐level involvement in environmental behaviors and how organizations can modify their internal infrastructures to champion environmental behaviors through their effects on employee perceptions of support for the environment and commitment to the environment. Additionally, the research illustrates how an extant behavioral theory, organizational support theory, can profitably be modified and adopted to explain behavior in the field of supply chain management.</jats:p>",

As a foundation for this, historical perspectives of manufacturing chronology, along with supply chain modifications resulting from changing market conditions are discussed. Managerial implications are offered reflecting pathways towards sustainability.As production power shifted from manual operation to steam, technology became the main driver for supply chain development leading to a variety of types seen in industry today. Today's supply chain types emerged due to increasing market complexity and competitive pressure. More recently, an additional driver occurred catalyzing the Green Supply Chain - the Environmental Movement. This chain is positioned as the next step in today's supply chain evolution, balancing environmental, economic, and societal needs with customer growth.</jats:p>"

By combining Lean and Six Sigma it is possible to achieve highly effective improvements in a company’s operations. Six Sigma doesn’t focus on speed. And, Lean cannot bring a process under statistical control. Lean Six Sigma efforts tend to be aligned by organizational functions rather than supply chains. This can result in departmental improvements, but fall short in achieving end to end supply chain improvements. Supply chain management (SCM) is a major issue in many industries as organizations begin to appreciate the criticality of creating an integrated relationship with their suppliers and customers, as well as all other stakeholders. It is concerned with smoothness, economically driven operations and maximizing value for the end customer through quality delivery. Hence, research is undertaken to integrate lean Six Sigma and SCM that will focus on how their integration drives rapid focused product and process improvements which result in controlled, sustainable, and validated improvements to the bottom line.</jats:p>",

To achieve such a result, technological tools to collect suitable information within shortest delays are required. Devices such as RFID or GPS positioning systems deliver real-time information on material flows. However, data fragments need to be integrated in a global information sharing system where each of the involved actors can perform computations as well as operations to take autonomous action and manage resources at best. In this perspective, the paper presents a research aimed to build an e-collaborative software system for outbound logistic actors. Advanced knowledge representation models are used, notably a framework driven by the core services provided by the involved actors and structured using the classical three decision layers. The actor’s rationale is then detailed which further leads to the design of a multi-agent system. The proposal is validated using a critical success factors framework for IT evaluation in SCM.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the intersecting effects of power, trust and supplier network size on five dimensions of supplier performance (delivery, quality, cost, innovation and flexibility). When assessing main effects, coercive power shows a negative relationship with supplier quality and innovation, referent power shows a positive relationship with all dimensions of supplier performance and legitimate power shows a positive relationship with supplier delivery, cost and flexibility. The supplier's trust in the buyer also shows a positive relationship to all five supplier performance dimensions. While exhibiting no main effects, supplier network size moderates these power–performance relationships. Increasing supplier network size appears to attenuate the impacts of coercive and referent power upon supplier performance, while strengthening this connection in the case of legitimate power. Contrary to our hypotheses, expert power use exhibits a negative relationship with supplier delivery performance, an effect which is exacerbated with increasing supplier network size. Overall, this study suggests that while not as independently important as perhaps thought, selecting the right number of suppliers may have considerable contextual influence on the interplay between power, trust and performance in buyer–supplier relationships.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Real Options (RO) has been a universally accepted concept in a number of major industries. However,  its  use  in  the  construction  supply  chain  management  (CSCM)  sector  has  been  limited. Some rare supply chain management RO studies have shown a number of limitations. First,  there  is  a  lack  of  a  rigorous  theoretical  RO  framework  pertaining  specifically  to  CSCM.  All  such  supply  chain  management  RO  studies  are  based  off  RO  theories  or  models  developed  for  other  sectors  (engineering,  infrastructure,  natural  resources).  And  second,  attempts  to  extend  real  option  to  wider  uses  in  CSCM  seem  premature  at  the  present.  This paper  reviews  all  recent  literature  pertaining  to  real  options  and  real  options  applied  specifically to  the  construction  supply  chain  management  area. The study proposes a research  programme pertaining to CSCM  in  New Zealand in order to enhance the current  understanding of RO in this area and in the process develop a comprehensive theory for theRO application in New Zealand CSCM.</jats:p>"

Clan mechanisms  of  organisational  governance  are  described  as  hybrid  structures  of  exchange, neither   pro-market   nor   organisational   hierarchy.   Not   to   be   mistaken   with   alternative mechanisms of exchange such as networks, clan forms of client-led supply chain management are readily distinguishable by their highly socialised marketplace, enduring relationships and community of practice. A qualitative research strategy is adopted for this exploration of clan forms of client-led supply chain governance. Data collection uses semi-structured interviews, recorded,  coded  and  analyzed.  Participants  include  senior  industry  figures  from  a  cross-section  of  construction  stakeholder  organisations,  including  client  bodies,  first  tier  service providers  and  construction  contractors.  In  contrast  to  much  of  the  prevailing  work  in construction  supply  chain  management  research,  the  findings  draw  specific  attention  to a hybrid  form  of  organisational  governance  rarely  discussed:  namely  clans.  In  light  of challenging  economic  conditions,  the  recognition  and  potential  contribution  of  clans  as  an alternative  mechanism  of  governance  is  a  timely  and  valuable  contribution  to  the  ongoing construction supply chain management debate.</jats:p>"

Supply chain strategies, ownership form and industry are all determinants of the relationship. However, size, as measured in terms of number of employees, does not seem a significant factor in power relations.

Part of the reason lies in the concerns of each discipline. By treating supply chain concerns as a menu of issues rather than an integrative theory, through case study analysis, a nuanced and explanatory detail can be given. These will need later repetition in quantitative or qualitative forms of research. Ontologically, the paper attempts to draw together the critical research and business school approaches to strategic management concerns. While both approaches provide a wealth of substantive evidence, there is a need to read from both perspectives to be able to catch the nature of work organisation and the management practices that inform them in China.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Most distribution systems were originally designed for a continuous supply mode and are now operated intermittently because of various constraints. In this mode of operation, the piping system is supplied with water for limited periods of time and is not filled with water under pressure continuously as originally provided for in the technical design concept. Periodic filling and draining of the pipe system is associated with numerous negative consequences which ultimately aggravate or prevent sustainable safe water distribution. To overcome this problem, thorough knowledge of intermittent water distribution is required. This paper discusses possible causes and consequences, and their interactions. These considerations are largely limited to the technical side of water distribution and are mainly based on the technical literature in the field.</jats:p>",

This paper attempts to fill this gap by providing a literature review on five dimensions of sustainable operations strategy: external context, competitive dimensions, strategic decisions, operations value chain activities, and organizational learning and knowledge. We provide a framework for sustainable operations strategy, consistent with these five dimensions, and provide research opportunities.</jats:p>"

The Power Quality phenomena affecting traction voltage are many, steady and transient, depending on the converter operations at substations and on-board vehicles. A classification is proposed and a discussion follows of the correct methods for their quantification, with reference to related standards and to the vast background related to ac networks. The characterization of PQ is related on one side to ripple and fluctuation of the pantograph variables for supply purposes, and on the other side to the appearance of specific components relevant for interference to signalling on the track. Considerations and conclusions are based on a large amount of measured waveforms, recorded on the Italian railway networks, and are aimed at contributing to the forthcoming standards on traction supply quality.&lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"

With the traditional belief in mind, the conventional approach to solve ‘chloramine decay’ was aimed at killing or flushing out nitrifiers. We have recently shown that either soluble microbial products (SMPs) released by microbes or changes in natural organic matter (NOM) characteristics under nitrified conditions could be responsible for the acceleration. With this new insight, a new control strategy was attempted by dosing silver at a concentration of 0.1 mg-Ag/L to the nitrified bulk waters obtained in a laboratory scale system. Accelerated chemical and microbial chloramine losses were significantly reduced after the addition of silver. These results are very promising for future applications.</jats:p>",

Building on the IPAT equation from industrial ecology, this note proposes that technological capacity is the main channel for environmental performance improvement emerging from corporations. The analysis reveals that generally, technological capacity is linked with aggregate performance indicators and more particularly with higher degree of eco-efficiency. However, it appears that when looking at the absolute value of ecological stress, technological capacity is detrimental.</jats:p>"

In order to understand this phenomenon, a series of experimental aeration studies was conducted. Aeration tests were performed under different operating conditions of seawater temperature, flow rate of the air and depth of the water in the aeration tank. The experimental results show that the overall mass transfer coefficient increases by increasing air flow rate. A measured increase in the overall mass transfer coefficient was observed with elevation of the temperature from 24 to 38 °C. The estimated value of activation energy of oxygen absorption in seawater is 42.5 kJ/mol. The value of the overall mass transfer coefficient is found to be affected by diffuser type and stirrer speed as these parameters influence the bubble size and the surface area available for mass transfer of oxygen from air bubbles to seawater.</jats:p>",

This paper presents the application of a commercial CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software as a numerical approach to calculate the flow around a supply boat considering current, wind loads and fluid resistance determination. Since, owing to many practical situations, free surface effects can be neglected, the above and underwater problems can be uncoupled and independently evaluated, although for higher Froude number cases in the resistance determination the interfacial effects have to be considered. Throughout this paper, the assumptions adopted and the boundary conditions applied are discussed. All meshes were developed on ICEM CFD® and appropriate mesh density studies indicate that meshes with approximately 2 million nodes can represent the experiments accurately. The simulations were conducted using the ANSYS CFX® solver, using Perl scripting for automatic evaluation of multiple run settings and simulation execution at Petrobras Research Center Clusters. The results for each case are compared with either towing tank or wind tunnel experimental data, both harvested at IPT (Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnológicas). The comparison between simulation results and experiments allows the analysis of the present CFD models benefits and limitations, providing guidelines for future similar studies. The overall match between laboratory and virtual tests results supports the expansion of this procedure to other vessels and offshore floating units.</jats:p>",

Less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking industry has been steadily expanding the market share in the past decades, due to its operational flexibility and high efficiency. In order to provide flexible and robust service schedule for LTL carriers, stochasticity is explicitly taken into account when formulating the SND problem. Service schedules derived from the stochastic model show structural difference with its deterministic counterparts. This research project develops a simulation model of an LTL network, in order to evaluate the system performance of LTL network with the stochastic schedule. A set of experiments shows that the stochastic solution performs very well when it is confronted with random customer demands. Furthermore, the stochastic schedule is much better than the deterministic one in terms of the proportion of undelivered commodities.</p>",

It describes the water supply circumstances in Aqaba, summarizes previous NRW-reduction programs and their historical impacts, outlines the process of application for an NRW financial optimization model, and then presents the results, focusing on Aqaba City in particular. Currently, Aqaba Governorate's water is supplied from non-renewable groundwater drawn from the Disi Aquifer. With growing water demand, Aqaba will face a severe constraint – the limited capacity of wells and of the pipeline from Disi to Aqaba. As of 2010, the actual NRW was 361 L/customer/day, while the optimal amount was found to be about 89 L/customer/day. Sensitivity analysis shows that the reliability of the optimal NRW model result is plus or minus 10%. Depending on the effort expended, AW could reach optimal NRW by 2014–2017. Approximate projections show that NRW reduction can be a ‘source’ of water supply for the near future by delaying the date when Aqaba reaches full capacity of its current source of supply. However, a major new source of water will be needed for the long term. The paper concludes with a discussion of observations, conclusions and future work.</jats:p>",

The concentrations were compared with the drinking water standards set by NOM-127-SSA1–1994, USEPA (United States Environment Protection Agency) and the World Health Organization (WHO) for pesticides and NOM-127-SSA1–1994 for biphenyls. The concentrations of the majority of organochlorine pesticides were within drinking water standards (0.01 μg L−1) except for β-HCH in BDW samples 3, 5 and 6 with values of 0.121, 0.136 and 0.192 μg L−1, respectively. The total PCBs concentration in BDW did not represent any hazard to human health, according to Mexican regulations, which establish a maximum permissible level of 0.50 μg L−1. A BDW quality monitoring program is recommended and further research on ways of reducing the presence of organochlorine contaminants to prevent bioaccumulation and toxicological effects over population with emphasis in those that with constant consumption.</jats:p>",

In contrast to pipe materials, the materials used beyond the consumer's tap are considered to be in contact with food and need to comply with the European Regulation for food contact materials; this, however, does not contain specific requirements about the enhancement of microbial growth. The aims of this study were to estimate microbial growth on PVCp tubes which were used to transport water to the types of machines noted above and to compare two methods of evaluating their net microbial growth potential. Four PVCp brands were tested for enhancement of microbial growth using a tube immersion test (the original Biomass Production Potential test) and a new tube filling test. Under field operating conditions, significant amounts of active biofilm accumulated on the PVCp-I tubes thereby impacting on water quality. In the laboratory test, the amount of biofilms on PVCp tubes and bacterial regrowth in the water depended on brand and were influenced by the surface-to-volume (S/V) contact ratio. To protect consumers' health, the microbial growth promoting potential of PVCp tubes should be taken into consideration when these products are in contact with drinking water.</jats:p>",

For comparative purposes, and given the usual structure that CSR Codes tend to follow, the analysis has been developed around the three most emphasized issues - namely, labor and human rights, environment and socio-economic issues - which in turn have been divided into common subcategories of CSR Codes. One can argue that if CSR Codes are actually based on the new international sustainable development law, which may be used to verify CSR Codes' compliance and enforcement, CSR Codes can be seen as a «global commons» understanding framework to improve sustainable development operations in emerging markets such as Brazil.</jats:p>"

This research draws upon production literature and exchange governance theory to simulate the interaction of supply and demand environment factors on the growth and development of supply chain relationships. Experiments were conducted to study the effects of different rates of product change, different demand environments, and different economies of scale on the level of integration between firms at different levels in the supply chain. It synthesizes the interrelationships of the simulation variables in order to extend TCA theory into a dynamic network environment by using the CAS paradigm. The study reveals definite patterns of evolution under conditions of differing product-market conditions, it confirms the importance of the balancing transaction and production costs, and it highlights the asymmetries of transactional and production costs in relationships.</p>",

Respondents were familiar with both systems, and most had traded at least organic cocoa for some period. However, most individuals said that they were seeking better product differentiation and marketing than has been achieved under the organic and Fairtrade systems. Many suggested that more direct recognition of individual growers and the unique value of their cocoa throughout the production chain would be more helpful than certification for small companies in the cocoa supply chain. These findings suggest new marketing techniques that convey an integration of meaning into the cocoa and chocolate supply chain as a differentiation strategy. This involves integration of the story of producers’ commitment and dedication; shared producer and consumer values of social and environmental responsibility; and personal relationships between producers and consumers. This marketing approach could enhance the ability of smaller companies to successfully vie with their larger competitors and to produce cocoa in a more environmentally and socially acceptable manner.</jats:p>"

Among them, biofilms are a major factor in accelerating chloramine decay as they provide a habitat for the microbes. Thus, this study investigates the effect of biofilms in terms of chloramine decay in the distribution system. Biofilms were grown under various chloramine residuals and different ages of biofilms were investigated by subjecting them to batch tests. Experimental results repeatedly showed that chloramine decay due to biofilms is independent of its growth condition, particularly for different chloramine residuals.</jats:p>",

The aim of applying PAC-UF hybrid processes is to improve the rejection capacity and the performance of membrane processes. In this work the influence of PAC-addition on membrane flux decline and fouling formation was studied with a submerged module using different water matrices. The PACs used were characterized by measurements of the surface area, the particle size distribution and the surface charge to get a better understanding of the observed effects. Results showed that the membrane flux decline was dependent on the applied type of activated carbon. When adding Picachem 8P, the transmembrane pressure (TMP) increased very quickly and the membrane performance was even worse than that without PAC. However, when adding Norit SA-UF under identical filtration conditions, the TMP was stable and the membrane performance was better than that without PAC. The fouling layers of the two PACs applied showed entirely different structures. Therefore the selection of a suitable PAC is a main factor for the overall performance of PAC-UF hybrid systems with submerged membranes.</jats:p>",

According to our results it can be stated that contrarily to the control treatment the application of different nutrient-levels has resulted a significant yield increment (2 000–5 800 kg ha-1).Based upon the results of this experiment we have drawn the conclusion that the nutrient level of 120 kg N+PK was the optimal for the investigated hybrids. The highest yield (14 475 kg ha-1–15 963 kg ha-1) of the hybrids with different genotypes has been produced in case of this fertilizer treatment. With the comparison of the control and the optimum-fertilizer treatments the yield-increasing effect of mineral fertilization and the different reaction of hybrids towards increasing fertilizer dosages have been proven. In case of the control treatments the best-yielding hybrids were NK Thermo (11 917 kg ha-1) and NX 47279 (11 617 kg ha-1). Contrarily on the optimal nutrient supply level the hybrids SY Brillio (15 876 kg ha-1) and NX 47279 (15 963 kg ha-1) have produced the highest yields. Summarizing, we can state that the hybrid NX 47279 has resulted stable and high yields in the fertilized treatments. Analysing the yield-increasing effect of 1 kg fertilizer active substance it was proven, that the hybrids SY Flovita (45.43 kg ha-1), SY Brillio (44.47 kg ha-1) and NX 47279 (42.33 kg ha-1) had a good reaction towards even lower nutrient supply levels as well. In case of the control treatment the average water utilization coefficient of the hybrids was significantly lower (35.2 kg mm-1), than in case of the optimal nutrient supply level (N120+PK) treatments (48.9 kg mm-1).Therefore the hybrid specific difference between the water utilization of genotypes could be revealed.</jats:p>"

This problem has been tackled in a number of ways, including auctions, negotiations, and argumentation‐based approaches. In this paper we show how this problem can be cast as an optimization of a pairwise cost function. Optimizing this class of energy functions is NP‐hard but efficient approximations to the global minimum can be obtained using loopy belief propagation (LBP). Here we detail a max‐sum LBP‐based approach to the supply chain formation problem, involving decentralized message‐passing between supply chain participants. Our approach is evaluated against a well‐known decentralized double‐auction method and an optimal centralized technique, showing several improvements on the auction method: it obtains better solutions for most network instances which allow for competitive equilibrium (Competitive equilibrium in Walsh and Wellman is a set of producer costs which permits a Pareto optimal state in which agents in the allocation receive non‐negative surplus and agents not in the allocation would acquire non‐positive surplus by participating in the supply chain) while also optimally solving problems where no competitive equilibrium exists, for which the double‐auction method frequently produces inefficient solutions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today PT. Jakarta Pertamina Unit Produksi Pelumas Jakarta (UPPJ) has some problems with inbound supply of raw materials. Deficiency dock may pose risks to the process of loading raw material base oil, resulting in delay in supply of raw materials. This delay could have an impact on other processes, such as delays to produce, and iddle of existing production facilities at the plant; it would be very detrimental to the company if the obstacle is often the case. Supply chain management is always influenced by three factors, namely how to reduce costs, reduce time and improve quality. If at first study on supply chain management is only classified in three categories, namely the field of operations, design and strategy, then this can be added to the four categories, namely the field of risk, which is commonly referred to as supply chain risk Management (SCRM). Based on the problems that occurred the first stage done is to identify risks in each process and then determine the influence of the effect in terms of cost, time and quality of the results of the determination of the influence. the next step is to determine the weights based on the severity of the bottleneck (severity), the possibility of resistance (Occurrence) and the possible causes of the barriers can be detected (Detection). The last step is to calculate the Risk priority Number (RPN) is obtained from the product of severity, Occurrence and Detection then obtained the highest priority for 144 the factors that most influence the leak rate of the production process.</jats:p>"

Recently, a new law, the Water Sector Law (Miljøministeriet 2009), was implemented. Its purpose is to privatise the water supply sector (although, as hitherto, into not-for-profit corporations), and statutory duties are separated from operations in order to make the supply of drinking water to consumers as efficient as possible. An important element of the Water Sector Law is the introduction of a new regulatory body, the Utility Secretariat. The role of this new institution under the Danish Competition and Consumer Authority is to enforce price ceilings on drinking water, based on a selection of benchmark parameters.</jats:p>"

To address these limitations the paper reports on the conception and development of an integrated modelling methodology designed to underpin the analytical design of complex supply chains. The methodology is based upon a systematic deployment of EM, CLD, and SM techniques; the integration of which is achieved via common modelling concepts and decomposition principles. Thereby the methodology facilitates: (i) graphical representation and description of key “processing”, “resourcing” and “work flow” properties of supply chain configurations; (ii) behavioural exploration of currently configured supply chains, to facilitate reasoning about uncertain demand impacts on supply, make, delivery, and return processes; (iii) predictive quantification about relative performances of alternative complex supply chain configurations, including risk assessments. Guidelines for the application of each step of the methodology are described. Also described are recommended data collection methods and expected modelling outcomes for each step. The methodology is being extensively case tested to quantify potential benefits &amp; costs relative to current best industry practice. The paper reflects on preliminary benefits gained during industry based case study modelling and identifies areas of potential improvement.</jats:p>",

While child welfare workers and law enforcement claim that parental meth use contributes to foster care growth, the evidence for a causal effect has not been determined. This paper presents the first evidence of a causal effect of meth on foster care admissions using two exogenous supply‐side interventions in meth markets from the late 1990s for identification. First, we find that restrictions on meth precursor distribution caused meth use (proxied by white meth self‐referred treatment cases) to decline 4.1%. Second, using two‐stage least squares, we estimate a positive elasticity of foster care cases with respect to meth use of 1.54. We also estimate elasticities of 1.03 and 1.49 for cases of child neglect and parental abuse, respectively. These results suggest that child welfare policies should be designed specifically for the children of meth‐using parents.</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>JEL</jats:italic> I12, J13, K42)</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Water flowing from forested catchments, both unmanaged and managed, is highly valued in terms of both quantity and quality. Increasing energy production using wood feedstocks produces varying degrees of impacts and thereby raises concerns about environmental impacts on the highly valued water supply resources of forest ecosystems. The term water supply encompasses both key components of water quantity and water quality. Water quantity considers the amount of increases or decreases, timing, consistency, and relative magnitude of water yields. Plant nutrients (anions and cations), fertilizers, herbicides, ash additions, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, bacteria, and sediment comprise water quality. Within the life cycle of forest bioenergy, operational activities during stand establishment, midrotation silviculture, harvesting, product transportation, wood storage, energy production, and ash recycling create variable levels of impacts. Disturbance levels associated with bioenergy operations depend on their type, intensity, frequency, duration, timing, area of extent, and the level of best management practices (BMPs) employed for mitigating of soil disturbances. Feedstock growing, stand tending, harvesting, and wood transportation are considered nonpoint source disturbances since they occur over larger landscapes than energy production activities, which are usually localized at power plants. Water‐quantity effects of forest bioenergy production are normally associated with vegetation management and related soil disturbances. Water‐quality effects mostly occur as a result of soil disturbances during harvesting, the use of intra‐rotation silvicultural chemicals (ash, fertilizers, and herbicides), and inter‐rotation site preparation for forest regeneration. Using existing practices designed for environmental protection (BMPs), forest bioenergy programs are completely compatible with maintaining high‐quality water supplies in forested catchments.</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:<jats:list list-type=\"explicit-label\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>Bioenergy &gt; Climate and Environment</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Energy Policy and Planning &gt; Climate and Environment</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Energy and Development &gt; Climate and Environment</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p>",

The author’s numerical findings show that both SLIF (Static Least Inventory First) routing and DLIF (Dynamic Least Inventory First) routing outperform static routing significantly. In addition, DLIF routing provides more savings compared to SLIF routing.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effectiveness of bentonite using chitosan as a coagulant for raw water treatment was assessed in this study. The possible link between Alzheimer's disease with conventional aluminium based coagulants, has become an issue in water treatment. A method for treating water, using a natural approach as an alternate to achieve enhanced coagulation, might help to reduce risk to health, and be more environmentally friendly. One method for removing turbidity from raw water is by the adding of a primary coagulant (e.g., a natural polymer of chitosan) and a coagulant aid (e.g., natural clay of bentonite) to the raw water. A series of batch coagulation tests were conducted by jar test to obtain the optimum dosage, pH, ratio of coagulant aid and primary coagulant, and the efficiency time for the jar test, by evaluating the standard parameters, such as turbidity, pH, colour, aluminium, and chlorine. In terms of these parameters, chitosan:bentonite showed the best result, with a ratio of 30:70 in an optimal concentration of 1,000 mg/l with 0.15 g chitosan plus 0.35 g bentonite. The coagulants performed with an optimal pH of 5, with 30 min of mixing time during flocculation. However, the optimal pH condition during the jar test showed an improvement in the water alkalinity results, from pH 5 to 6.8. Coagulation with bentonite-chitosan successfully removed the turbidity with a highest efficiency of 98%. After water treatment in the optimal condition, results showed a great water quality standard, with 1.38 NTU, 10 TCU, 0.01 mg/l amount of chlorine and aluminium, and a pH of 6.8. However, data only showed slight differences of efficiency, between natural and conventional coagulants. In terms of the sludge volume index (SVI), the ratio of alum to bentonite-chitosan was found to be 3:1 which indicated that less sludge was produced by the natural coagulant. In a cost comparison between these coagulants, based on a rough estimation, bentonite-chitosan is nearly 10 times more expensive than the alum coagulant. However, with mass production and commercial availability, in the long run the price of chitosan could be reduced tremendously.</jats:p>",

The results indicated that the environmental coercive and mimetic pressures and organizational characteristics have a positive effect on the top management’s perception and support of Web-based SCM adoption and usage. Furthermore, the study revealed that the Web-based SCM applications represent the pool that reflects the degree of response to institutional pressures. This study was the first to empirically explain why organizations adopt Web-based SCM from an institutional perspective, adding new contribution to the developing literature on Web-based SCM. Understanding the external pressures and the effect of organizational factors will provide the practitioners with better knowledge on how to manage the adoption of Web-based SCM applications.</p>",

The animals were anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium @ 20 mg / kg body weight IM and bled to death by giving incision on the right common carotid artery. Whole vascular system was flashed with 0.85% physiological saline solution and then 10% formalin was injected through the same route for well preservation. After preservation, the animals were injected with latex coloured with red carmine again through the right common carotid artery. Then the animals were dissected to study the arterial supply of the perineum of Black Bengal doe. The study revealed that the perineum was supplied by the urogenital and internal pudendal arteries. The urogenital artery was originated from the internal iliac artery near the ischiatic spine and after a short course to the lateral surface of the vagina it was divided into cranial and caudal branches. The cranial branch after supplying branch of the urethra, urinary bladder and ureter anastomosed with the uterine artery. The caudal branch coursed along the dorsolateral surface of the vagina and gave branches of the rectum, anus, vagina, vestibule, vestibular -land, vulva and a branch to the mammary gland. The internal pudendal artery was the termination of the internal iliac artery which after giving muscular branches to the levator ani, and coccygeus muscles coursed lateral to these muscles and gave vestibular branches and finally continued on the ventral aspect of clitoris.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an emerging technology for supply chain management suitable for the retail industry. Large distributing companies such as Wal-Mart, Tesco, and Target have adopted RFID for real-time tracking and efficient order assortment of fast moving products. An agriculture-based developing country with a huge population and strong internal consumption, Thailand has a big grocery retailing industry that provides ample opportunities for the application of RFID technology. Through a questionnaire survey, this study investigated the current status of RFID adoption in the grocery industry of Thailand. The findings reveal that the industry is aware of the potential benefits that RFID may bring but also concerned with the various challenges in implementation. Although companies surveyed are planning to adopt the technology, none have fully implemented an RFID system. This reveals that RFID adoption is still in its infancy in the grocery retailing industry of the country. The major concerns of the firms include high implementation cost and low return on investment, different system designs and multiple standards, and the lack of technical expertise and management experience to ensure success in adopting the technology.</p>",

Specifically, it aims at empirically examining the impact of stakeholder pressures on sustainable supply chain practices as well as the impact of these practices on sustainable performance including environmental, economic, and social dimensions. By means of regression analysis of data collected from 112 firms in a developing country context, the results indicate that pressures by organizational champions and customers are positively related to supply chain sustainability. However, the relationship between government pressures and supply chain sustainability is insignificant. Moreover, the findings provide evidence that the impact of supply chain sustainability on sustainable performance is significantly positive. The paper has important implications for managers, practitioners, and researchers to improve sustainable supply initiatives and sustainable performance in organizations.</p>",

Two types of changes can be distinguished. The first is changes from one period to the next in demand consistent with the existing pattern, e.g. due to changing weather or changes in the population size. The second type is inconsistent changes which may be due to increased leakage. The method is successfully applied to drinking water distribution systems of different sizes and characteristics. Being data driven, it is independent of model assumptions and therefore insensitive to uncertainties therein which may hinder some other leakage determination methods. Because it is simple to implement and apply but nevertheless powerful in distinguishing between consistent and inconsistent changes in water demand, the method provides water companies with a way to constantly monitor their networks for possible changes in customer demand and the possible occurrence of new leakages and also check archived data for similar changes. This could render additional information about customer behavior and the evolving condition of the network from data which is usually readily available at water companies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. In this pilot study water was extracted from samples of two Holocene stalagmites from Socotra Island, Yemen, and one Eemian stalagmite from southern continental Yemen. The amount of water extracted per unit mass of stalagmite rock, termed \"water yield\" hereafter, serves as a measure for its total water content. The stalagmites' water yield records vary systematically with the corresponding oxygen isotopic compositions of the calcite (δ18Ocalcite). Low δ18Ocalcite values are thereby accompanied by low water yields and vice versa. Based on the paleoclimatic interpretation of the δ18Ocalcite records, water yields can be linked to drip water supply. High drip water supply caused by high precipitation rates supports homogeneous deposition of calcite with low porosity and therefore a small fraction of water-filled inclusions, resulting in low water yields of the respective samples. A reduction of drip water supply fosters irregular growth of calcite with higher porosity, leading to an increase of the fraction of water-filled inclusions and thus higher water yields. The results are consistent with the literature on stalagmite growth and supported by optical inspection of thin sections of our samples. We propose that for a stalagmite from a tropical or subtropical area, its water yield record represents a novel paleoclimate proxy recording changes in drip water supply, which can in turn be interpreted in terms of associated precipitation rates.\n                        </jats:p>"

In addition to Nord Stream, the major import pipeline projects, Nabucco and South Stream, have been announced to provide further gas supplies to Europe. This raises the question concerning whether and how these projects contribute to the European Union’s focus on security of supply. Applying the natural gas infrastructure model TIGER, this paper investigates the impact of these pipeline projects on southeastern Europe’s gas supply. Gas flows and marginal cost prices are evaluated in general and considering the possibility of supply disruptions via Ukraine for the year 2020. The model results show a positive impact of these pipelines on security of supply despite few consumer cut-offs that result from intra-European bottlenecks. South Stream is only highly utilized in case of a Ukraine crisis, supporting the idea that its main purpose is to bypass Ukraine. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Improvements in information technologies provide new opportunities to control and improve business processes based on real‐time performance data. A class of data we call individualized trace data (ITD) identifies the real‐time status of individual entities as they move through execution processes, such as an individual product passing through a supply chain or a uniquely identified mortgage application going through an approval process. We develop a mathematical framework which we call the State‐Identity‐Time (SIT) Framework to represent and manipulate ITD at multiple levels of aggregation for different managerial purposes. Using this framework, we design a pair of generic quality measures—timeliness and correctness—for the progress of entities through a supply chain. The timeliness and correctness metrics provide behavioral visibility that can help managers to grasp the dynamics of supply chain behavior that is distinct from asset visibility such as inventory. We develop special quality control methods using this framework to address the issue of overreaction that is common among managers faced with a large volume of fast‐changing data. The SIT structure and its associated methods inform managers on if, when, and where to react. We illustrate our approach using simulations based on real RFID data from a Walmart RFID pilot project. </jats:p>",

The main problem of the region is that the water demand of its population exceeds the local natural resources. The rainfall in the project region is extremely variable (50–990 mm per year), evaporation rates are high, perennial rivers do not exist, and groundwater aquifers are saline due to low soil permeability and high evaporation. The project's activities were prepared and accompanied by stakeholder participation and capacity development. The village community chose the techniques and pilot sites in several participatory workshops. Three roof catchment systems with differing tank designs (polyethylene, ferrocement, and concrete bricks) for individual households and a concrete-lined ground catchment facility for six households were built. The collected water is supposed to be used for horticulture. Hence, gardening plots and drip irrigation systems were created. Selected trainees were trained to build, operate and maintain the RWH systems and gardens. Finally, the pilot plants were monitored and evaluated to examine their social and technological feasibility.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to determine the diversity and characteristics of yeasts from water sources in the North West Province. Yeasts were isolated from four rivers and an inland lake. Various parameters were measured to determine the physico-chemical quality of the water. Isolation was done on yeast-malt-extract (YM) agar and identified using biological methods. Physico-chemical parameters were within a target water quality range for various water uses. Yeasts were detected at 22 of the 23 sampling sites. Levels ranged from 3 to 8,680 cfu/L and were broadly divided into pigmented and non-pigmented yeasts. Pigmented yeasts could potentially be an indication of pollution, while non-pigmented yeasts could potentially be pathogenic species. Levels of yeasts could be statistically associated with some physico-chemical parameters. A large percentage of isolated yeasts could grow at temperatures ranging from 4 to 40 °C. Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., Rhodotorula spp. and Zygosaccharomyces spp. were identified.

How do the optimum price and extended warranty length vary under different scenarios? We find that, depending on the parameters, either party may provide better extended warranty policies and generate more system profit. We also compare these two decentralized models with a centralized system where a single party manufactures the product, sells it to the consumer, and offers the extended warranty. We also consider an extension of our basic model where either the manufacturer or the retailer resells the extended warranty policies of a third party (e.g., an independent insurance company), instead of offering its own policy. </jats:p>",

The deaeration system consists of water ring vaccum pump, deaeration tank, booster pump, circulating tank, etc. First softened water processed by softener would flow through 80 mesh stainless steel screen filter. Then in high vacuum deaeration tank, the water will be ejected in a spray due to the eddying flow of the nozzles and size of the droplet can reach 30 micrometer. Oxygen partial pressure in the tank is in a minimal level so that dissolved oxygen in the water-drops can be released. The steam and released oxygen will be sent to circulating tank for recycling. Deoxidation rate of the process can be above 95% and residual dissolved oxygen can be removed by chemicals. So the boiler supply water can meet technical requirements. The deaeration system has a good application in boiler supply water deaeration in S oil-field. Practical application shows the deaeration system has characteristics of stable performance, mainly maintenance-free, and good adaptability to some poor-quality water. So the deaeration system has a good promotion value.</jats:p>"

The most common in-situ test is pumping test performed on well, which involves measurement of the fall and rise of water level with respect to time.

Simultaneously 26 groundwater samples were collected separately in 2 steps of the pumping phases from each well and then chemically analyzed. This study indicates that the recommended yields varied from 3600 to 12000 lph. The wells could be used in safely with recommended yield of 5000 lph and pumped for 1 to 2 hrs in 4 to 8 hrs intervals per day. Groundwater is of nearly neutral to mildly acidic and alkaline nature in the pumping stresses. The total dissolved solids (TDS) varied from 142-1050 mg/l, but its values changed from –67 to 240 mg/l during the pumping phases. The concentrations of chloride and sulphate changed from –20 to 30 mg/l and –2 to 8 mg/l, respectively, but about 39% groundwater samples are of constant Cl-concentration. In these pumping phases groundwater is hydrochemically within permissible limit for drinking water supply.

Under such a contract, a company agrees to achieve a certain service level and to pay a financial penalty if it misses it. The service level used in our study refers to the fraction of a manufacturer's demand filled by the supplier. We analyze two types of service level‐based supply contracts that are designed by a manufacturer and offered to a supplier. The first type of contract is a flat penalty contract, under which the supplier pays a fixed penalty to the manufacturer in each period in which the contract service level is not achieved. The second type of contract is a unit penalty contract, under which a penalty is due for each unit delivered fewer than specified by the parameters of the contract. We show how the supplier responds to the contracts and how the contract parameters can be chosen, such that the supply chain is coordinated. We also derive structural results about optimal values of the contract parameters, provide numerical results, and connect our service level measures to traditional service level measures. The results of our analyses can be used by decision makers to design optimal service level contracts and to provide them with a solid foundation for contract negotiations. </jats:p>",

The methodology aims at finding the optimal capacities of these power sources to meet the required system supply reliability, with the lowest value of the levelized cost of energy. As the first step in capacity planning, mathematical models for characterizing PV panels, wind turbines, and batteries are proposed. The second step is to optimize the capacities of the power sources according to the Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCE) concepts. The configurations which meet the required LPSP with the lowest LCE, give the optimal choices. The surveyed meteorological data and energy demand data of an apartment in Kanto area are used in the capacity planning. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper, a 1 year water quality survey was conducted around the lake and statistical analysis tools were used to characterize the variations of organic pollutants. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) confirm the seasonal and spatial variations of surface water quality in Lake Taihu. Surface water quality is better during the wet season and worse downstream during the dry season. The dissolved organic matter was further analyzed using a parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model with three-dimensional excitation-emission fluorescence matrices. Four components were extracted from the fluorescence data, namely, two autochthonous biodegradation products (C1: amino acids, C4: protein-like materials) and two humic-like substances (C2: from microbial processing, C3: terrestrial). C1 and C4 were dominant in the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorophores; this result is similar to those of other inland water bodies in China. The CDOM fluorophores showed similar seasonal and spatial variations with common water quality indices, with the exception of the seasonal responses of C2 in winter. Bivariance correlations between the organic and nutrient concentrations and the fluorescence intensities of the CDOM fluorophores imply possible common sources of the different contaminants. This paper exemplifies advanced statistical methods as a useful tool in understanding the behavior of contaminants in inland fresh water systems.</jats:p>",

There are several types of power supplies that can be applied depend on the requirement and functions. One example is the use of power supply for sonar systems. Sonar system is a device which can be used to detect a target under water. The sonar system is an electronic circuit that requires a power supply with specific characteristics when the sonar functions as a transmitter and a receiver in the specific span time (when on) and the specific lag time (when off). This paper discusses the design of power supply for high-powered sonar systems with discrete methods in which high power supply is only applied when the acoustic waves radiated under water. Charge pump was used to get the appropriate output voltage from lower input voltage. Charge pump utilized a combination of series and parallel connections of capacitors. The working mode of this power supply used the lag time as the calculation of time to charge charge pump capacitors in parallel while the span time was used for the calculation of discharging the charge pump capacitors in series.</jats:p>"

Experimental results revealed that all three test organisms in their dormant recalcitrant state required extended levels of pulsing to achieve significant reductions in numbers compared to other similarly PUV-treated Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 that is a non-spore forming indicator of faecal pollution in water. 120 pulses at 900 V or 16.2 J per pulse (equivalent to a UV dose of 8.39 μJ cm−2) were required to achieve ca. 2 log C. perfringens spore numbers, whereas a similar level of PUV irradiation reduced both C. parvum oocysts and B. cereus endospores by ca. 5 log orders. A comparative ca. 5 log reduction of E. coli cell numbers was achieved after only 25 pulses at 900 V (equivalent to a UV dose of 1.74 μJ cm−2). A clear trend emerged where the order of resistance to PUV-irradiation observed was C. perfringens endospores &amp;gt; C. parvum oocysts, B. cereus endospores &amp;gt; E. coli cells. This study suggests disinfection kinetic data for the more resistant C. perfringens endospores can be used as a measure of estimating disinfection efficacy of PUV treatments for C. parvum oocysts in water, avoiding the need to use complex animal or cell culture infectivity models that are only available in specialised laboratories with highly trained technicians. This study will inform future studies exploring scale-up of PUV at waste-water treatment plants.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A study was done to determine the macro- and micronutrient requirements of young northern highbush blueberry plants (<jats:italic>Vaccinium corymbosum</jats:italic> L. ‘Bluecrop’) during the first 2 years of establishment and to examine how these requirements were affected by the amount of nitrogen (N) fertilizer applied. The plants were spaced 1.2 × 3.0 m apart and fertilized with 0, 50, or 100 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of N, 35 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of phosphorus (P), and 66 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of potassium (K) each spring. A light fruit crop was harvested during the second year after planting. Plants were excavated and parts sampled for complete nutrient analysis at six key stages of development, from leaf budbreak after planting to fruit harvest the next year. The concentration of several nutrients in the leaves, including N, P, calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), and manganese (Mn), increased with N fertilizer application, whereas leaf boron (B) concentration decreased. In most cases, the concentration of nutrients was within or above the range considered normal for mature blueberry plants, although leaf N was below normal in plants grown without fertilizer in Year 1, and leaf B was below normal in plants fertilized with 50 or 100 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N in Year 2. Plants fertilized with 50 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N were largest, producing 22% to 32% more dry weight (DW) the first season and 78% to 90% more DW the second season than unfertilized plants or plants fertilized with 100 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N. Most DW accumulated in new shoots, leaves, and roots in both years as well as in fruit the second year. New shoot and leaf DW was much greater each year when plants were fertilized with 50 or 100 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N, whereas root DW was only greater at fruit harvest and only when 50 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N was applied. Application of 50 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N also increased DW of woody stems by fruit harvest, but neither 50 nor 100 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N had a significant effect on crown, flower, or fruit DW. Depending on treatment, plants lost 16% to 29% of total biomass at leaf abscission, 3% to 16% when pruned in winter, and 13% to 32% at fruit harvest. The content of most nutrients in the plant followed the same patterns of accumulation and loss as plant DW. However, unlike DW, magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) content in new shoots and leaves was similar among N treatments the first year, and N fertilizer increased N and S content in woody stems much earlier than it increased biomass of the stems. Likewise, N, P, S, and Zn content in the crown were greater at times when N fertilizer was applied, whereas K and Ca content were sometimes lower. Overall, plants fertilized with 50 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N produced the most growth and, from planting to first fruit harvest, required 34.8 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N, 2.3 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> P, 12.5 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> K, 8.4 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> Ca, 3.8 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> Mg, 5.9 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> S, 295 g·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> Fe, 40 g·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> B, 23 g·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> copper (Cu), 1273 g·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> Mn, and 65 g·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> Zn. Thus, of the total amount of fertilizer applied over 2 years, only 21% of the N, 3% of the P, and 9% of the K were used by plants during establishment.</jats:p>",

The leverage of value by the focal original equipment manufacturer (OEM)‐company to the supply chain has caused the focal OEM‐company to transform into a large‐scale system integrator (LSSI). The LSSI was defined according to the Petrick's definition. Indicators that measure the value‐leverage by these LSSI companies have not been found in literature. The purpose of this paper is to describe indicators that measure value‐leverage and illustrates that LSSI companies in the aerospace industry have a value‐leverage capability, using these indicators.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The authors' main research question is: “How to measure value‐leverage by LSSIs in the aerospace industry?”. As value‐leverage indicators have not been studied before, a literature study was carried out to develop a set of indicators which were tested in a quantitative analysis, using secondary data from 41 aerospace companies. Second, the value‐leverage indicators were applied to the aircraft LSSIs. The industry samples consisted of the global companies in the aircraft OEM industry and the relevant financial and company data were collected from the companies' public financial data, spanning a time frame of 14 years (1996 to 2009). A case study was performed on large‐scale aircraft system integrators, as a sample of the aerospace OEM industry, to demonstrate the effects of value‐leverage by aircraft LSSI companies.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>With the new indicators, this research shows value leverage of aerospace OEMs and aircraft LSSIs as a sub group of the sample. The related indicators showed a change in leverage over time, indicating the leverage capability of aerospace OEMs. More in‐depth analysis on aircraft LSSI companies showed that aircraft LSSI with high correlation on the value‐leverage variables are more in value balance compared with aircraft LSSI companies scoring lower on the variables.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>This research has been limited to the aerospace OEMs. Data from secondary (public) sources were used, such as financial reports over a period of 14 years.

This is the reason effective Supply Chain Management (SCM) has become a potentially valuable way of securing Competitive Edge and improving organisational performance since competition is no longer between organisations, but among supply chains.

Whether erythrocytes play a significant role in regulating O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply in the complex environment of diffusional O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> exchange among capillaries, arterioles, and venules, depends on the efficiency with which erythrocytes signal the vascular endothelium. If one assumes that the distribution of purinergic receptors is uniform throughout the microvasculature, then the most efficient site for signaling should occur in capillaries, where the erythrocyte membrane is in close proximity to the endothelium. ATP released from erythrocytes would diffuse a short distance to P<jats:sub>2y</jats:sub> receptors inducing an increase in blood flow, possibly the result of endothelial hyperpolarization. We hypothesize that this hyperpolarization varies across the capillary bed depending upon erythrocyte supply rate and the flux of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> from these erythrocytes to support O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> metabolism. This would suggest that the capillary bed would be the most effective site for erythrocytes to communicate tissue oxygen needs. Electrically coupled endothelial cells conduct the integrated signal upstream where arterioles adjust vascular resistance, thus enabling ATP released from erythrocytes to regulate the magnitude and distribution of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply to individual capillary networks.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This two year study (2007-2008) was conducted at 62 sites in Quebec (Eastern Canada) to assess the effect of crop rotations [soybean-corn, soybean-wheat (&lt;em&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/em&gt; L.,)-corn and corn-corn] on corn yield, N uptake, N fertilizer efficiency (NFE), and the economic optimum N rate (EONR). Plots within each crop rotation received N fertilizer rates from 0 to 250 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to assess the N contribution from the preceding soybean crop. Corn grain yields ranged from 8.4 to 10.8 Mg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and were lower in continuous corn than in the crop rotations. Corn N uptake and NFE varied from 89 to 164 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and from 45 to 80 kg grain per kg N fertilizer, respectively. A significant interaction of crop rotation and year on corn N uptake and NFE was obtained implying that annual variations influenced soil N supply. The EONR for corn was lower under crop rotations than continuous corn in 2008 only. No difference in corn yield, NFE and EONR was observed for soybean-corn and soybean-wheat-corn crop sequences. In conclusion, crop rotations including soybean increased soil N availability and reduced EONR from 32 to 45 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for corn grown in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Here, we examine <jats:sup>137</jats:sup>Cs activity concentrations to determine the erosion processes supplying sediment in seven water supply catchments in South‐east Queensland. First, we test some of the underlying assumptions in the method using concentrations of <jats:sup>137</jats:sup>Cs and <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb<jats:sub>ex</jats:sub> in composite samples collected from 109 surface‐soil sites and 39 channel‐bank sites. Paired composite samples, each consisting of 20 subsamples, from five sites are used to demonstrate that this sampling approach was sufficient to average out any local variations in surface‐soil <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb<jats:sub>ex</jats:sub> and <jats:sup>137</jats:sup>Cs concentrations across the 300 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> sampled.

We use the probability distributions for <jats:sup>137</jats:sup>Cs, which provides the greatest discrimination between sources, to show that the <jats:sup>137</jats:sup>Cs concentrations on the river sediment samples are consistent with channel erosion being the dominant source. Conservation works aimed at reducing the supply of sediments in these catchments should therefore focus on rehabilitation of the channel network and decreasing the runoff to the channel network. These findings are consistent with other similar studies on tropical Australian rivers. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Information on nitrogen (N) uptake, distribution, and use efficiency (NUE) in oat is limited. A greenhouse study using a <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N‐labeling technique was conducted to determine the responses of two contrasting oat genotypes to timing and level of N deficiency. Hulled oat cv. Prescott and hulless cv. AC Gehl were grown in soil‐mix pot culture with five N treatments applied through modified Hoagland solutions. Differences in <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N accumulation, <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N distribution, plant N originating from the labeled source, and NUE between the contrasting cultivars, were examined for each N strategy. Level of N deficiency and timing of N supply of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>15</jats:sup>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> greatly affected <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N distribution, the origins of plant N, and the amount of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N recovered in the plant. When N was supplied from seedling emergence to maturity (T<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>), AC Gehl accumulated 61% more <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N in the shoots, but 46% less <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N in the grain than Prescott (0.43 <jats:italic>vs.</jats:italic> 0.80 mg plant<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>), indicating that AC Gehl was less effective in producing grain yield than Prescott as AC Gehl produced greater total dry matter (DM). Withholding N supply until flag‐leaf stage (FL) increased <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N in the grain of both cultivars by 29.6%, resulting in the highest NUE. In most cases, there were larger portions of plant N derived from the labeled source for AC Gehl than for Prescott. Our results suggest that greater NUE in the newly released AC Gehl was associated with N accumulation in the vegetative tissues. It is concluded that genotype improvement of hulless oat should be focused on enhancing N‐translocation efficiency.</jats:p>",

Two different ways of oocyte membrane transfer to spermatozoa have been described: trogocytosis and exosomes. We here report an analysis of<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>exchanges between the membranes of unfertilised oocytes and capacitated spermatozoa. We showed that optimum conditions are fulfilled when unfertilised oocytes interact with acrosome-reacted spermatozoa, a scenario mimicking the events occurring when the fertilising spermatozoon is inside the perivitelline space. Although CD9 tetraspanin is an essential molecule for fertilisation, exosome and trogocytosis transfer persists in<jats:italic>Cd9</jats:italic>-null oocytes in spite of their dramatic fusion failure. These exchanges are CD9 tetraspanin independent. We also confirm that mice sperm express CD9 tetraspanin and that when C<jats:italic>d9</jats:italic>-null oocytes were inseminated with sperm covered with oocyte membrane materials, including CD9 tetraspanin, no rescue of the oocytes' fertilisability could be obtained. Thus, the existence of two ways of exchange between gametes during fertilisation suggests that these events could be of a physiological importance in this process.</jats:p>",

Alliancing connotes integration but in real practice, it  fails  to  create  a  true  alliance  environment  since  only  part  of  the  value  chain  (owner, designer,  main  contractor)  is  considered  for  integration.  Consequently  subcontractors  are very  often  left  out  of  the  key  alliance.  Therefore  this  study  identifies  improvement  areas  to current  alliance  practice  and  suggests  changes  that  will  permit  critical  sub-contracting processes  to  be  integrated  into  a  project’s  main  alliance.  To  achieve  this  objective  the research follows a comparative study approach. Information obtained from relevant literature is  used  to  identify  current  subcontractor  management  practices  and  best  practices  for subcontractor integration in alliances. A case study of an alliance project is used to identify improvement areas in subcontractor management practices in an alliance environment. From these findings, the study proposes a revised alliance framework that integrates subcontractors from the early stages in alliance contracts, thus enabling the realisation of benefits accruable to projects through early contractor involvement.</jats:p>"

We measured soil respiration (R<jats:sub>soil</jats:sub>) in summer and autumn of 2009 in combination with microbial biomass and nutrient availability during autumn freeze‐in at a dry, open heath in Zackenberg, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NE</jats:styled-content> Greenland. This tundra site has been subject to fully factorial manipulation consisting of increased soil water supply for 14 years, and occasional nitrogen (N) addition in pulses. Summer watering enhanced R<jats:sub>soil</jats:sub> during summer, but decreased R<jats:sub>soil</jats:sub> in the following autumn. We speculate that this is due to intensified depletion of recently fixed plant carbon by soil organisms. Hence, autumn soil microbial activity seems tightly linked to growing season plant production through plant‐associated carbon pools. Nitrogen addition alone consistently increased R<jats:sub>soil</jats:sub>, but when water and nitrogen were added in combination, autumn R<jats:sub>soil</jats:sub> declined similarly to when water was added alone. Despite several freeze‐thaw events, the microbial biomass carbon (C) remained constant until finally being reduced by ~60% in late September. In spite of significantly reduced microbial biomass C and phosphorus (P), microbial N did not change. This suggests N released from dead microbes was quickly assimilated by surviving microbes. We observed no change in soil organic matter content after 14 years of environmental manipulations, suggesting high ecosystem resistance to environmental changes.</jats:p>",
