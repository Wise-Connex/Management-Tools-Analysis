      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter is the outcome of our consolidated learning on “Supply Chain Risk Management” and “Action Learning in Supply Chains” over a period from 2006 to 2010. We have also published several papers in this domain; please refer to the bibliography section. Although there is a substantial volume of literature on the topic of Supply Chain Management and no lack of coverage today on Risk Management, our motivation was guided by our desire to put into context, both from an academic and Industry perspective, a practical methodology for supply chain risk mitigation based on a proven theory of learning. This methodology will enable industry practitioners of supply chain management to comprehend and act upon risk i.e. identification, assessment, response, monitoring and evaluation. Risk Management in Supply Chain is not a “one-off” transaction but rather an ongoing practice of problem solving and organizational learning i.e. a continuous methodology for sustainable improvement. The methodology provides a means to structure past problems as knowledge to be used by the organization and increase preparedness for facing new challenges. In a global competitive market, successful management of risk in supply chain can be the difference between corporate success and failure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain performance is highly influenced by the coordination level between its members, which needs information sharing. In this paper we consider a three-echelon direct sell supply chain model and focus on the problem of coordinated decision-making between its members. Our contribution is a first approach that measures the impact of the degree of coordination between the members. Demand behavior is modeled using a geometric Brownian process. Simulation models are run in order to analyze various cooperation scenarios. Our results show a direct relation between the degree of coordination within the supply chain and the total system cost. Although this result is intuitive, our simulations allowed us to quantify such a relation and in which measure these costs are whether or not associated to imperfect coordination.</jats:p>"

In the studied situation, one company, or supplier, supplies one product to the other company, who is a retailer. The companies are going to coordinate by two types of decisions: economic (concerning prices fixed on a contract), and physical exchange (concerning the inventory to be held). Two types of contracts will be presented: one contract with a simple pricing scheme and two contracts with inventory holding cost shared among the companies of the supply chain. The objective is to show that contracts with inventory holding cost share allow the two companies to efficiently coordinate the chain they form.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, simulation optimization has attracted a great deal of attention because simulation can model the real systems in fidelity and capture complex dynamics. Among numerous simulation optimization algorithms, Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm is an attractive approach because of its simplicity and efficiency. Although SPSA has been applied in several problems, it does not converge for some. This research proposes Augmented Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ASPSA) algorithm in which SPSA is augmented to include presearch, ordinal optimization, non-uniform gain, and line search. Performances of ASPSA are tested on complex discrete supply chain inventory optimization problems. The tests results show that ASPSA not only achieves speed up, but also improves solution quality and converges faster than SPSA. Experiments also show that ASPSA is comparable to Genetic Algorithms in solution quality (6% to 15% worse) but is much more efficient computationally (over 12x faster).</jats:p>"

Given the open and dynamic nature of a supply chain network, information risk management is challenging and various factors must be considered. This article introduces a trust-based approach to facilitate supply chain participants to perform effective risk management. The major components of the proposed framework include supply chain member trust evaluation, data classification, and trust-based decision making. The major purpose of the framework is to control and mitigate information risks that a participant faces in a supply chain network (e.g., risks to information confidentiality, privacy, and integrity). We apply the principle of transitive trust for trust evaluation and use several decision tools for risk analysis and mitigation.</jats:p>"

From a tactical viewpoint of response-based supply chains, the processing time for each stage is assumed to be a random variable since different practices exist in the selection pool of each stage under a specific lead-time requirement. The decision-maker must select suitable practices of operations for each stage to ensure that the lead-time meets a desired requirement. The relationship and the trade-off between the operating costs for the selected practices and the inventory holding cost of safety stock that is in turn affected by the lead-time are discussed. A mathematical model for planning the operations from a manufacturer viewpoint is proposed. The variation in practical situation for the proposed model is also addressed. A hypothetic example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. With reference to the computational results, the effect of several parameters on the model’s optimal solutions was discussed.</jats:p>"

While these exchanges have largely been viewed as a positive method of achieving operational cohesion, some supply chains appear to benefit more from increased levels of information sharing than others. To assist in explaining the performance differences experienced by supply chains engaged in information-sharing activities, a new perspective of information sharing within supply chains based on organizational information processing theory (Galbraith, 1973) is introduced. More specifically, it is posited that individual supply chains may be examined as single information processors and that their characteristics can induce complexities in the shared information—ultimately an issue that affects how supply chains process this information. Furthermore, the degree to which supply-chain members’ information systems are compatible with each other is posited to also play a significant role in information-processing capabilities.</jats:p>"

We assume that the supplier and the retailer only know the distribution of the disrupted amount after the demand disruption and they share the quantity deviation costs. We find that an all-unit wholesale quantity discount-subsidy mechanism can coordinate the supply chain. We give the coordination mechanism of the supply chain after the demand disruption and find that the demand disruption remarkably influences the price-service level decisions of the centralized supply chain and the coordination mechanism of the decentralized supply chain. In particular, the expected quantity differs from the planned quantity although the penalty costs prevent from this deviation.</jats:p>"

The complexity of SCM systems creates a multifaceted issue when selecting the right software, particularly in light of the speed at which technology evolves. In this chapter, we use the approach of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine which SCM software best meets the needs of a company.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents a probabilistic security model for supply chain management systems (SCM) in which the basic goals of security (including confidentiality, integrity, availability and accountability, CIAA) are modeled and analyzed. Consequently, the weak points in system security are identified. A stochastic model using measurable values to describe the information system security of a SCM is introduced. Information security is a crucial and integral part of the network of supply chains. Each chain or driver requires a different security level according to the services it contributes to the overall SCM system. Different probabilistic weights are assigned to the four goals CIAA of security depending on the SCM driver’s mission. A Semi-Markov chain model is used to describe the probabilistic nature of different security levels for each driver in the system. A comparison of the steady-state security for a multi-driver model with different levels of attack is performed, and the results analyzed. Enhanced supply chain security could be achieved by identifying the effects of attacks on the security goals of an organization. The use of this model helps to identify weak points in supply chain system security, and offers hints on how to strengthen them. The model is tested by considering intrusion scenarios representing different levels of attack on the SCM system. An analysis of the results is performed using an interactive application.

In examining the connections, which are different from transaction-based connections, this study measures the effects of face-to-face communication, trust, involvement, job title, and sales volume on performance. The hypothesized relationships are mostly supported and provide nuanced insights into relational attributes that affect supply-chain relationships and performance. These attributes are the basis for creating relationship intensity, magnitude, and history, described as collaborative facilitators that can enhance performance. All levels of management have a role to play in how the relational attributes are applied and managed. Senior leadership such as CEOs may need to play a larger role in trust development and involvement maintenance, while mid-level and line managers may need to engage in more face-to-face communication in maintaining trust and collaboration intensity.</p>",

An important change management dimension of the primary research was to clearly explain the purpose of the audit at the beginning of each interview. A total of 16 interviews were conducted. The data collected were analysed using standard techniques including: process mapping, Ishikawa cause and effect diagrams, why‐why‐why and Pareto analysis. The accuracy of the company's existing forecasting was measured using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The uncertainty circle diagram was used to provide a higher level of analysis, categorising the causes of uncertainty into: supply side, process side, demand side and control side.

We consider such a channel relationship that the transaction quantity between the two members is sensitive to the supplier’s inventory level and that the supplier’s unit inventory holding cost has a linear stepwise structure. We devise a coordinated revenue-sharing contract with bargaining so that each party’s respective profit is better than that resulted from the simple sequential optimization mechanism. The key contract parameters, namely the supplier’s inventory level and the retailer’s revenue-sharing fraction, are obtained and analyzed. Numerical illustrations of the contracts are given and shed lights on how the supply chain should coordinate in order to gain better performance.</jats:p>"

The characteristics of bulk iron ore transport flow are analysed against traditional criteria and an appraisal of the transport infrastructure in north east China is made, considering both road and rail options, and various possible combinations for transport being evaluated.

The research initially confirms that sea and rail transport combinations are the most appropriate for the movement of iron ore. However, where rail transport corridors are congested, provided that the transport distances are not too great, road haulage appears to be an effective substitute and the most competitive multimodal transport route, at least in the short to medium term, is found to be a rail‐sea‐road combination via Port Bayuquan in China.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The research focuses on the delivery of iron ore to one major steel manufacturer in northeast China; so findings may not be transferable to other companies or circumstances.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The paper first demonstrates that, for heavy, high volume cargoes concentration of flows on to one corridor, perhaps under the control of one service provider, maximises scale economies, but works against competition and route/mode choice.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In many multi-stage manufacturing supply chains, transportation related costs are a significant portion of final product costs. It is often crucial for successful decision making approaches in multi-stage manufacturing supply chains to explicitly account for non-linear transportation costs. In this article, we have explored this problem by considering a Two-Stage Production-Transportation (TSPT). A two-stage supply chain that faces a deterministic stream of external demands for a single product is considered. A finite supply of raw materials, and finite production at stage one has been assumed. Items are manufactured at stage one and transported to stage two, where the storage capacity of the warehouses is limited. Packaging is completed at stage two (that is, value is added to each item, but no new items are created), and the finished goods inventories are stored which is used to meet the final demand of customers. During each period, the optimized production levels in stage one, as well as transportation levels between stage one and stage two and routing structure from the production plant to warehouses and then to customers, must be determined. The authors consider “different cost structures,” for both manufacturing and transportation. This TSPT model with capacity constraint at both stages is optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and the results obtained are compared with the results of other optimization techniques of complete enumeration, LINDO, and CPLEX.</jats:p>"

They have had important effects on resource mobilization, public-interest services and grant incubation. This study affirms non-public funding foundations’ role as “public-interest suppliers”. After an analysis of the entire supplier – that is, non-public funding foundation – industry’s development, a typology of non-public funding foundations as public-interest providers is presented and the concept of “agent foundations” introduced. Then, five foundation supply methods are discussed, including direct supply of funds, direct supply of services, indirect supply of funds, indirect supply of services and supply by foundation agents. The last type, in particular, is characterized by a unique principal-agent relationship. Then, from the angles of transaction costs, field effectiveness and optimal scales, it analyzes issues related to non-public funding foundations’ optimal supply decisions, including optimal methods, fields and scales of supply. Lastly, it identifies two major challenges from the demand side that non-public funding foundations face as they vigorously develop – homogeneous competition and insufficient effective demand – and offers policy responses.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

It is also important to identify the level of existing integration between parties, as this has been associated with supply chain performance. This paper seeks to address this issue.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Elements gathered from the literature reviewed are used to present a set of measures that can be applied for auditing purposes in: the forward supply chain; product returns and reverse logistics; flows of materials and information and integration between supply chain tiers. To illustrate the use of the proposed set of measures for auditing purposes a case study involving a major European mobile phone network operator was analysed using the operator's own brand of handsets characterised for having a closed‐loop supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The proposed set of measures for auditing purposes provide an overall picture of the performance of a closed‐loop supply chain by revealing high levels of stock for the products analysed, consequence of the difficulty to generate accurate forecasts and the accumulation of high quantities of product prior to launch. Also the methodology presented in this paper identifies links between product returns (faulty and non‐faulty) to operations in the forward component of the supply chain (design, sourcing, manufacturing and forecasting) and also indicates how performance is affected because of integration.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The proposed set of measures for auditing purposes is relevant to closed‐loop supply chains which are related to products with short life cycles and during their lifetime can experience faulty and non‐faulty returns. The scope of the study presented may look limited; however, the application of the performance measures presented in this research can become a fundamental component of larger audit exercises. Further research should be carried out with supply chains on products with lifetime cycles that span long periods of time.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>For industry sectors with closed‐loop supply chains, the availability of a set of measures that address the forward and reverse components plus integration can provide a detailed picture of the performance of value streams over traditional approaches to measurement that focus on only one component of the supply chain. The set of measures has the potential to be used to achieve better customer service and reduction in costs involving shipping, warehousing, labour and call centres.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The contribution of this research on closed‐loop supply chains is a methodology that defines performance measures for auditing purposes of the forward and reverse components of supply chains and assists in assessing the importance of integration between different tiers of supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

While firms are able to achieve integration, they find it hard to sustain integration. In this paper, the authors argue that to sustain integration partner firms must establish a formal system to evaluate supply chain-wide performance. The authors draw on theories from a number of management disciplines to map the critical links between supply chain evaluation capability and supply chain integration sustainability. The authors develop and test the research model by conducting an empirical study involving 102 firms. The results of the study show that supply chains can sustain integration by establishing a supply chain wide evaluation system.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Over many years, researchers from social science and management have argued that to develop sufficient trust between potential supply chain partners, a useful starting point is to develop strategies for encouraging perceptions of trustworthiness. Conversely, marketing theorists and practitioners have called for strategies by industry that aims to reduce risk perceptions for successful relationships. However, it is not clear in the literature which perception is more significant; trust or risk and from which perspective. Identification of such factors plays an important role in supply chain design and operation to decide whether the supply chain members should strive to develop trust perceptions or reduce risk perceptions in relationship. This paper has identified the common perspectives of trust and risk perception to address the issue of which perception is more significant from each perspective. Results of a survey of supply chain member’s trust and risk perceptions of the printing and packaging industry in the United Arab Emirates are presented.</p>",

However, when the underlying demand depends on the retail price, it has been known that channel coordination cannot be achieved if only one of these mechanisms is deployed. In this article, we show that a policy that combines the use of wholesale price, channel rebate, and returns can coordinate a channel with both additive and multiplicative price‐dependent demands. In addition to determining the sufficient conditions for the contract parameters associated with the equilibrium policy, we show that multiple equilibrium policies for channel coordination exist. We further explore how the equilibrium policy can be adjusted to achieve Pareto improvement. Other issues such as the maximum amount of expected profit that the manufacturer can share under the coordinated channel, the structural properties of the contracts under both the additive and multiplicative price‐dependent demand functions are also discussed. </jats:p>",

In this chapter, we try to overcome this limitation and a generalized model is proposed, in which a logistics chain network problem is formulated into a 0-1 mixed integer linear programming model and the decisions for the function of manufactures, distribution centers, and dismantlers will be suggested with minimum cost.

      "abstract": "<p>The supply-side approach to understanding religious participation is perhaps one of the more influential ideas of the religious economies model. The term “supply side” was first applied by R. Stephen Warner to Roger Finke and Rodney Stark's analyses found in the <italic>Churching of America</italic> (1992). In that book, Finke and Stark suggest that most previous historical and sociological explanations of changing religious participation rates over time and across national and geographic settings had been based on notions of changing levels of demand for religion, theories which have since been labeled demand-side theories. This article describes some of the data limitations that make it difficult to distinguish the separate influences of supply and demand in real life analyses of religious participation rates. It then presents a method which, when applied to common geographically based data sets, can be used to construct measures of demand that are independent of measures of the supply of religion. The article summarizes the results of the 2000 Religious Congregations and Church Membership Study (RCMS) and presents U.S. county-level census data from 2000.</p>",

A supply chain is coordinated if all supply chain members adopt the actions that optimize the entire system's performance. However, in most cases, supply chain firms are independent, self‐interested entities that may deviate from the system‐optimal actions. This article provides an introductory review on how firms can use various contractual schemes to achieve supply chain coordination. Discussions on additional issues and potential research directions are also provided.</jats:p>",

These governments can be understood as regimes that combined Marxist-Leninist one-party rule with state ownership of the means of production and central planning. They attempted to regulate religious markets by intervening in both the supply of and the demand for religion, pursing policies that can be characterized as combining the strategies of regulation and substitution. Religion was to be substituted with “scientific atheism,” a key feature of communist ideology. Atheist or intentionally secular ceremonies and rituals replaced religious ones both in public and in private life. By regulating the market, the communist regimes sought to control the supply of religion. Ultimately, however, the success of the communist project depended on eliminating people's demand for religion. This article examines religion under communism, focusing on state regulation, scientific atheism, and the dynamics of supply and demand.</p>",

Unconventional gas (coal bed methane, tight gas and shale gas) is present in large volumes throughout the world—it offers the potential to continue to reshape global gas dynamics. Many expect the North America experience of sharp unconventional gas growth to be repeated elsewhere and are forecasting the perpetuation of a global gas surplus. Is this likely? We consider the impact of its development, identify some of the issues that will constrain its growth and address some of the implications for upstream suppliers, resource holders, buyers and policy makers.\nNo post-Conference paper or slides are available for this presentation.\n</jats:p>"

These price increases created plausibly exogenous shifts in demand for construction, farm, and mining machinery. This paper uses these demand shifts to estimate the elasticity of machinery supply. Graphical evidence, OLS, and IV estimates all indicate that the quantity of machinery supplied increased rapidly during the booms, with only modest increases in prices. Pooled sample estimates of the supply elasticity are around 5, much larger than the estimate of 1 from Goolsbee (1998). Results thus suggest that public policies that stimulate investment demand will have only modest effects on the prices of investment goods.</jats:p>"

Job creation and clean energy benefits arise from new nuclear builds, and the development of the Small Modular Reactor (SMR) supply chain is critical to realizing these positive attributes of nuclear energy. Opportunities exist for the U.S. nuclear industry to build its SMR supply chain capabilities in order to take advantage of expanded nuclear energy utilization. This presentation will provide, first, a brief overview of the challenges which exist for the development of the domestic SMR supply chain, such as expanding industrial capacity, promoting workforce development, ensuring American competitiveness in the global energy market, resolving licensing issues, and securing financing. Secondly, the presentation will discuss why the United States and, in particular, the nuclear industry should respond to these challenges. This is important in helping to shape the future political debates and form recommendations that will help promote the SMR supply chain industry and its role in expanding the demand and infrastructure for nuclear energy. Finally, the presentation will look at NIC recommendations in the supply chain area to support SMRs and other nuclear power plant deployments.</jats:p>",

This article summarizes the research documenting the problem of IRI within retail supply chains and reviews several potential solutions to IRI offered by operations management researchers. In addition, this article explores how execution problems within retail distribution centers (DCs) contribute to store‐level IRI. Through direct observations and interviews with retail employees, we identify numerous errors that occur within the retail DC and how such errors create a mismatch between actual and recorded store inventory. We argue that it is critical to detect, determine the root cause of, and correct such errors in an effort to prevent them from cascading from one stage of the distribution process to the next. We claim error prevention in distribution, similar to quality improvement in manufacturing, requires improving workforce practices, fool‐proofing operational processes, and appropriate incentive design. We conclude with our recommendations for further study on this topic.</jats:p>",

To benefit both the business and the environmental bottom line, the supply chain management of an organization needs to be analyzed, planned and optimized for sourcing and deliveries and in an environmentally-conscious manner. Such analysis includes suppliers, customers, regulatory authorities and employees at all levels on an organization. Undoubtedly, electronic (Internet-based) systems deliver enterprises with a competitive advantage by opening up opportunities to streamline processes, reduce costs, increase customer patronage and enable straight thorough processing capabilities. These same characteristics of good SCM can be converted to handle environmental issues related to supply chain operation and processing. This chapter proposes a fundamental framework for creating and analyzing GISCM solutions.</jats:p>"

We begin by differentiating between logistics and supply chain management; and then discuss a process framework for managing supply chains, useful for organizing and categorizing IT initiatives. Within the framework, we discuss the various IT applications designed to support the planning and execution of work in each process. Finally, we make some comments on the future evolution of IT applications in supply chain management, fully recognizing that unanticipated technologies will almost certainly arise to offer new opportunities for more effectively managing supply chains.</jats:p>",

Energy efficiency that can only be sustainably achieved as a result of using ICT creatively is outlined in this chapter. The authors consider the optimization of supply chain as a crucial enabler of the overall effort of an organization to improve its environmental credentials. Therefore, undertaking the audits of an organization’s supply chains, and ensuring that the end result improves its efficiency is one way of limiting the carbon generated during its activities.</jats:p>"

The coordination and collaboration is achieved through a carefully designed replenishment policy. The near-optimal order quantities for each of the supply chain agents are calculated with a mathematical model in which the integrality constraints are relaxed. A number of instances were generated and tested. The results show the validity of the proposed approach.</jats:p>"

Such problems can originate from either the demand or the supply side. Where capacity is time‐sensitive, these problems need to be resolved in tandem with other operational issues such as scheduling. This article discusses capacity allocation decisions that are modeled as cooperative or noncooperative games within research on supply chain scheduling. For cooperative game models, we focus on the existence of fair allocations of savings and/or capacity that ensure the cooperation of all the players. For noncooperative game models, we discuss the efficiency of capacity allocation mechanisms, and describe incentive schemes that attempt to resolve the problem of strategic ordering whereby players introduce false information in order to gain an advantage. We also describe several topics for future research.</jats:p>",

Continuing research over the last decades has established concrete knowledge of the basic facts about the results of interactive processes in the Earth system,which determine climate and climate change. It has particularly shown the anthropogenic influences on these processes. There is no doubt that human activities are the critical cause of the changes in the climate that Earth is experiencing since the Industrial Revolution in the mid-18th century, i.e. since the time that a period of rapid industrial growth with far reaching social and economic consequences begun in Britain and spread to Europe and other countries all over the world. The industrial revolution marked the beginning of a dramatic increase in the use of fossil fuels, which is the main cause of climate change.</jats:p>"

Creating value in the ISC involves gathering, organizing, selecting, synthesizing, and distributing information. In so doing, ISCs should provide secure, confidential, reliable, and real time access to heterogeneous information, while ensuring that the right information is delivered to the intended recipients at the right time. In other words, security, information quality, and information lead-time delays are critical performance determinants in ISCs. Recent disaster events such as Hurricane Katrina have highlighted the need for and value of ISCs by exposing the vulnerability of supply chains to demand surges and supply disruptions. Mitigating supply chain vulnerabilities requires a mechanism that allows for continuously sensing the environment, detecting existing or anticipated vulnerabilities, and responding to these vulnerabilities in real time through information sharing and collaboration. This chapter describes how the autonomic computing paradigm can be used to build resilient information supply chains by restructuring the associated relationships, chains, and networks.</jats:p>"

The subject matter is organized in chronological order by decade. The 1950s were primarily a decade of transportation. During the 1960s the study of transportation evolved into the study of physical distribution. During the early 1970s more attention was given to physical supply, the inbound side of logistics systems. Later in the 1970s, universities began to offer more courses in transportation, physical distribution, and logistics. The term physical distribution was phased out in the 1980s, and the term business logistics emphasized. During the 1990s, business logistics again was the emphasis, as many cost-oriented businesses became aware of the opportunities for cost savings through negotiations with carriers and implementation of the systems approach and the total cost concept. The first decade of the 21st century has been characterized by a slow evolution from logistics to supply chain management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The bulk chemical industry primarily relies upon truck transportation. Truck transportation, although costly, has a high percentage of on-time deliveries. Cheaper alternative transportation modes are less preferred due to a lack of supply chain information. Traditionally, the lack of information about in-transit products leads to higher safety stock and inventory levels, which results in higher costs. Process mapping and activity-based cost analysis are used to identify cost drivers and highlight the areas of opportunity for improving bulk chemical supply chain management. The activity-based cost information was used to develop a logistics cost model specifically tailored to the bulk chemical industry. The activity-based logistics cost model was used to assess potential cost savings from integrating centralized supply chain management software (visibility solutions), into the bulk chemical supply chain. The results of our analysis support integrating visibility solution software into multi-modal transportation to improve bulk chemical supply chain management. Integration of visibility solutions enables suppliers to improve their ability to monitor and control their inventory throughout the supply chain, increase overall asset utilization, and reduce global supply chain costs.</jats:p>"

Based on the system dynamics simulation model, the authors got a priori assumption that production lots have in multiproduct environment better explanation power. Our empirical findings give support for this – number of production lots explain in production environment manufacturing lead time much better than production order size. Further support is gained from supply chain phases, which are analyzed similarly, but as surprise explanation power of production lots decreases, and seems to be significantly lower in more distant markets. It is interesting to note that currently used IT applications of analyzed global case company do not give real time snapshot regarding to the development of overall supply chain lead time.</jats:p>"

This article explores the subject empirically through the study of how employees work with information and knowledge around a core business function—in this case a supply chain process. In order to do this, the organization needs to be viewed from a network perspective as it relates to specific business processes. Viewing the organization in this way enabled the author to see how employees’ preferred knowledge and information transfer mechanisms varied across the core process. In some cases, the identified transfer mechanisms where at odds with the prescribed organization wide mechanisms. However, when the organization considered the employees’ preferred transfer mechanisms as part of an overall process improvement, the E2E supply chain performance was seen to improve significantly.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the previous chapters 5 and 6 the issues of adaptation and mitigation regarding climate change were introduced. Key concepts were defined, several questions were addressed and potential responses and policies were summarized, based on the findings of scientific research, including valuable sources such as (IPCC, 2007) and (Stern Review, 2006). It is particularly interesting to explore how businesses have perceived these issues and, even more important, how they have actually responded to the challenges of climate change. The issue of global warming, with its pervasive impacts on the society and economy, is not only an issue of public policy and, of course, it is not just an academic issue to be discussed among researchers. The extent and ways that businesses participate in world’s efforts to stabilize oncentrations is of vital importance, as businesses in different sectors of the economy produce large quantities of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and thus have a significant share of the responsibility for the problem. On the other hand, big corporations possess the organizational, technological, and financial resources to cope with environmental problems, including global warming. Indeed, big corporations’ involvement is a critical factor in the policy deliberations relating to climate change, as they are main suppliers of consumers with goods and services as well as main developers and disseminators of new technology. In addition, they implement and finance a substantial part of governments’ climate change policies.</jats:p>"

The same is true in the case of the global warming impacts presented in chapter 3. On the other hand, it is obvious that such uncertainties, coupled with other uncertainties stemming from sources related to society and economy, imply that any policy to adapt to and/ or mitigate the impacts of global warming is accompanied with some degree of risk, and the outcome of such a policy will be, to a bigger or lesser degree, uncertain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Integrating environmental considerations into supply-chain management has become an increasingly important issue for industry, government and academic researchers. Supply chain managers are being required to respond to the challenges of new legislation, standards and regulations; changing customer demands; drivers for efficiency, cost effectiveness and return on investment; while simultaneously being ‘green’. The fundamental tension between business and environmental drivers is difficult, but critical to understanding how to effectively re-engineer and re-design existing supply chains in a manner that is sustainable both financially and environmentally. Information systems have a significant role to play in supporting corporate responses to environmental management and the development of holistic green logistic solutions. This chapter examines contemporary discussions on the current state of sustainable supply-chain management and green logistics. It presents a case study from the Fujitsu Corporation in Japan and explores models of information systems and RFID use in green logistics. Combining insights from the case and existing models the chapter explores an example of how a combined model can be used to explore the potential of a specific emerging technology (RFIDs) in ‘greening’ supply chains.</jats:p>"

This article summarizes the research documenting the problem of IRI within retail supply chains and reviews several potential solutions to IRI offered by operations management researchers. In addition, this article explores how execution problems within retail distribution centers contribute to store‐level IRI. Through direct observations and interviews with retail employees, we identify numerous errors that occur within the retail distribution center and how such errors create a mismatch between actual and recorded store inventory. We argue that it is critical to detect, determine the root cause of, and correct such errors in an effort to prevent them from cascading from one stage of the distribution process to the next. We claim error prevention in distribution, similar to quality improvement in manufacturing, requires improving workforce practices, fool proofing operational processes, and appropriate incentive design. We conclude with our recommendations for further study on this topic.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Optimization of water supply looped networks has attracted a great deal of attention from researchers for more than 30 years. As the classical water supply looped network optimization problem is mathematically non-convex and multimodal, the resulting solution of most approaches is uncertain in the sense of how close it is to the “best” solution. In many cases, this “best” or “global” solution is invoked and pursued only intuitively without a clear understanding of its meaning. This paper discusses what is involved in “global” solutions and the role that pipe flow distribution can play to deal with non-convexity and multimodality in a new context. The author has introduced this new context recently after formulating a new objective function capable of finding a looped network that can be economically more attractive than its related branched one. Therefore, the convenience of an approach dealing with flows and heads, as relevant decision variables, is encouraged in this paper and its advantages enumerated under the new concepts. The entropy approach is studied critically and an example is provided for comparison with the proposed approach.</jats:p>",

This simple setup, although proven to be effective in many other applications, fails to cover potential effects of tactical and operational issues on the strategic design decisions in supply chain settings. For example, inventory sharing and delivery vehicle consolidation lead to economies of scale in the operations of the facilities and thus affect the optimal distribution network configuration. Recently, researchers began to study integrated supply chain design models that take into account important tactical and operational issues when making strategic decisions on facility location and network design. In this article, we review some recent work that belongs to this new research stream. We discuss various modeling issues and the potential benefits of using integrated models over using traditional location models.</jats:p>",

The rapid growth of technologies motivates enterprises to invest more and more in this domain with the adoption of the cooperative e-business applications. Consequently, we propose in this paper an approach that permits enterprises to enhance their cooperative activities. This approach is based on the agent and Web services paradigms. It is organized in the form of cooperative application groups representing the different parts of a company. Agent coordinators orchestrate the cooperative work of these groups. The most requested functionalities inside the enterprise and those offered to the external world can be exported as Web Services. We describe the Web Services with DAML-based Web Service ontology (OWL-S). The search, invocation and exploration of these Web services can be offered by an intermediate agent called Web Service Finder Agent. The proposed approach provides a new vision of the cooperation context where the companies and their partners share knowledge and offer functionalities as agents and Web Services.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reverse logistics has been brought to the forefront of corporate agenda not only due to environmental concerns and the recent environmental regulations, but also because of its profound financial ramifications. Depending on the specific strategy that each enterprise follows, reverse logistics may constitute a profit center. The importance of reverse logistics to the overall profitability of manufacturers and brand owners is steadily increasing as companies learn how to better decrease returns and extract value from returned parts. Closed-loop supply-chain channels are distribution systems that include activities supporting both the forward flow of goods from the manufacturer to the consumer as well as the reverse flow from the consumer to the manufacturer. In this paper, we identify the reverse logistics supply-chain channels, identify problems that companies face when they handle product returns along these channels and present the critical role that information technology and collaboration can play to mitigate many of the problems and deficiencies. It is imperative that firms operating in the reverse supply-chain channels collaborate to integrate and share information in a timely fashion. In this paper we discussed on the benefits, issues of reverse supply chain management and also focus on the impact of IT on reverse supply chain management.</jats:p>",

Consequently, there is little or no finished product inventory, and production and finished product delivery must be scheduled in a coordinated way in order to achieve a desired level of delivery performance at minimum total cost. Research on coordinated production and delivery scheduling models is relatively recent, but is growing rapidly due to an increasing number of applications in practice. In this article, major application examples that can be modeled as a coordinated production and delivery scheduling problem are reviewed, an overview of existing coordinated production and delivery scheduling models is given, and solution techniques that have been studied in the literature are discussed along with several directions for future research.</jats:p>",

Climate change used to be considered, even until quite recently, as something not much more than mere scientific hypothesis. But the situation has radically changed. The planet is now almost universally recognized as being in a state of emergency because of global warming and its impacts on the environment, economy and human societies. Enterprises are increasingly faced with the climate change challenge and with having to take measures to adapt. Countries and the whole international community are taking urgent measures to mitigate the causes of climate change and hopefully, in a rather distant future, reverse the catastrophic trend.</jats:p>"

Darcy model was applied to represent the air flow through the compost and the oxygen concentration was solved by SIMPLE based algorithm, coupled with the fermentation process that occurs in the compost. The following five effects on the oxygen supply enhancement in the compost: 1.permeability through the compost, 2.rate constant of the exothermic reaction in the fermentation process, 3.size of the compost, 4.interval of the magnets and 5.location of the magnets were investigated. As a result, the maximum inlet air velocity reaches 6.4 mm/s when the air permeability is 3.82×10−4 m2. The permanent magnets enhance the air flow and oxygen supply.</jats:p>",

To benefit both the business and the environmental bottom line, the supply chain management of an organization needs to be analyzed, planned and optimized for sourcing and deliveries and in an environmentally-conscious manner. Such analysis includes suppliers, customers, regulatory authorities and employees at all levels on an organization. Undoubtedly, electronic (Internet-based) systems deliver enterprises with a competitive advantage by opening up opportunities to streamline processes, reduce costs, increase customer patronage and enable straight thorough processing capabilities. These same characteristics of good SCM can be converted to handle environmental issues related to supply chain operation and processing. This chapter proposes a fundamental framework for creating and analyzing GISCM solutions.</jats:p>"

It is imperative therefore to examine different factors that influence demand for improved water services and the resultant welfare changes. Using cross-sectional household survey data collected through structured questionnaire from ten administrative units in Mekelle City, we estimate household willingness to pay models and identify major determinant factors of demand for improved water service. In order to help us do this, we considered selection issues and estimated models using the Heckman Two-Step Estimator. Our results show that the amount of bid (amount of money households would be willing to pay) that households (already connected to private taps) would be willing to pay is positively associated with household income, ownership of the house, price of vended water and the practice of water purification. For households who are not connected to private taps, the amount they would be willing to pay for (improved) private tap connection is positively associated with formal education, housing status and gender. We also investigate the welfare gains and losses as a result of improved water service. Analytical results show that, as the number of households who subscribe to improved water service increases, there is a gain in surplus for households and revenue (producer surplus) for the municipality.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Competitiveness is one of the factors successful organizations excel in, and they will do anything necessary to gain an edge over their competitors. The system dynamics approach to simulation modelling is being considered as one of the methods to increase competitiveness. System dynamics is essentially a methodology suited to studying and managing complex feedback systems and provides a means for understanding the causes of industry behaviour. This research builds a complete system dynamics model for internal supply chain events (from order to ship-out) from the perspectives of a semiconductor company. System dynamics models are simulation-based models that allow the investigation and identification of discrepancies between the business policy and the actual practice of key events as well as provide a better visibility of the company’s system. With the understanding of the internal workings of the supply chain system, experiments with the simulation model could provide alternative configurations to achieve better performance. This research utilizes system dynamics to better understand the supply chain system and with it, to find better solutions through experimentations with a few key variables in the supply chain system. The result of this research reveals that the company could achieve 25% reduction in inventory cost should the recommendations be followed.  </jats:p>"

Energy efficiency that can only be sustainably achieved as a result of using ICT creatively is outlined in this chapter. The authors consider the optimization of supply chain as a crucial enabler of the overall effort of an organization to improve its environmental credentials. Therefore, undertaking the audits of an organization’s supply chains, and ensuring that the end result improves its efficiency is one way of limiting the carbon generated during its activities.</jats:p>"

However, many organizations deploy technology without due consideration for how their employees access, create and share information and knowledge. This chapter explores the subject empirically through the study of how employees work with information and knowledge around a core business function – in this case a supply chain process. In order to do this the organization needs to be viewed for a network perspective as it relates to specific business processes. Viewing the organization in this way enabled the author to see how employee’s preferred knowledge and information transfer mechanisms varied across the core process. In some cases the identified transfer mechanisms where at odds with the prescribed organization wide mechanisms. However, when the organization considered the employee’s preferred transfer mechanisms as part of an overall process improvement, the E2E supply chain performance was seen to improve significantly.</jats:p>"

If the dyadic exporter-producer relationships are still weak, they impede the emergence of a high performance supply chain within an export market. This paper develops a conceptual framework for understanding how exporter-producer relationships include not only the relationship system but also network and transaction systems; and thus introduces a more integrated way of looking at supply chain management based on information sharing as a key process between exporters and producers. To achieve this aim, supply chain relationships are reviewed from the perspectives of relationship marketing theory, network theory and transaction cost theory. Findings from previous research are discussed to provide a better understanding of how these relationships have evolved. A conceptual framework is built by offering a central proposition that specific dimensions of relationships, networks and transactions are the key antecedents of information sharing, which in turn influences export performance in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Supply chain tracking systems can provide visibility, traceability, and associated information across different stages of a supply chain, which enables competitive advantages. The efficiency and effectiveness of a tracking system are mainly supported by identification, communication, and information technologies in the supply chain. A better understanding of the various tracking technologies is important due to the fact that there is no single technology that completely covers the entire spectrum of needs and operations in the supply chain. However, there are various relevant technologies available in the market for information registration, capturing, and exchange; and in addition, some technologies have different standards to fit into specific industry sector and operation environments. These technologies complement each other in many ways; for example, some are suitable for outer environments while others work seamlessly inside facilities; and some identify objects while others capture information. It is the intent of this article to understand the main characteristics of different technologies, which play a key role in implementing the tracking system in an effective way. We introduce concepts of tracking system architecture and review most relevant identification, communication, and information technologies. Ultimately, we want to provide an overview of tracking technologies in order to assist decision makers in the processes of evaluation and selection of adequate technology for a design of a tracking system.</jats:p>",

Nach Röpke ist die Marktwirtschaft ein „Nettomoralverzehrer“. Wenn die Moral nicht immer wieder aus einer separaten Quelle wie der Religion gespeist wird, verschwindet sie - und damit auch die Basis der Marktwirtschaft. Doch wie sinnvoll ist es, eine solche grundsätzliche Front zwischen dem Markt und der Moral aufzumachen? Im Individuum überlappen sich beide Sphären. Abgesehen von seinem institutionellen Charakter ist der Markt schließlich nichts weiter als eine Chiffre der gesellschaftlichen Interaktion von Menschen. In einem Prozess der Reziprozität herstellenden Rückkopplungen entsteht sowohl der wirtschaftliche Wohlstand der Nation als auch der moralische - jenes evolvierende Sozialkapital an Werten, gemeinsamen, auch religiösen Überzeugungen, Moral und Traditionen, das eine Gesellschaft trägt.</jats:p>",

Data from 125 North American manufacturing firms are used and business environment uncertainty is employed to measure task uncertainty. Sourcing practice and delivery practice measure the creation of lateral relationships, while Information quality measures the investment in information systems. Also, just-in-time production and human resource management measure the creation of self-contained tasks. Regression analysis shows that business environment uncertainty has significant positive influence on sourcing practice, delivery practice, information quality, just-in-time production, and human resource management. While the information processing theory was proposed more than thirty years ago, this study empirically extends the relevance of information processing theory to today’s supply chain environment.</p>",

This chapter focuses on the usage of IT tools for Supply Chain Management (SCM). It also highlights the contribution of IT in helping restructure the entire distribution set-up to achieve higher service levels, lower inventory, and lower supply chain costs. An overview and tangible benefits of the existing IT tools, which are widely deployed, is provided with focus on existing configuration considerations, available applications, and deployments in India. The role of existing communication technologies in making IT an enabler of SCM, is highlighted by addressing a range of different point and enterprise solutions in a variety of supply chain settings. Critical IT demonstrations and implementations in SCM are discussed. Fundamental changes have occurred in today’s global economy. These changes alter the relationship that we have with our customers, our suppliers, our business partners, and our colleagues. Reflection on the evolving and emerging IT trends like software agents, RFID, web services, virtual supply chains, electronic commerce, and decision support systems, further highlights the importance of IT in the context of increasingly global competition. The rapid adoption of the Internet for communication with all stakeholders, seems to reflect the potential of the new-age communication media. It has also been observed that several progressive Indian companies are extensively using emerging tools like virtual supply chains, web services, RFID, and electronic commerce to shore up their supply chain operations. However, adoption of tools like software agents and decision support systems for supply chain integration by Indian companies, is limited.</jats:p>"

Considering supply chain management, the authors believe that it is important to distinguish between a quality of product (also service) offered by producers and service providers and a quality of service which is achieved between any supplier and customer, not only a consumer, along a supply chain. Quality of product represents producer’s/service provider’s commitment and is subject of various quality certificates issued by inspection authorities. This research examines the quality of service, which is provided by a supplier to its customer along the supply chain, between any pair of chain elements fulfilling this relation, including the common retailer-consumer relation. The authors introduce measurement points into a consumer-centric supply chain model for the defined criteria and defined the method of their monitoring and overall supply chain quality of service evaluation. Finally, the authors assess the envisaged impact of the results of their measurements on supply chain excellence, providing management with an opportunity to identify weak spots.</p>",

This paper presents a new idea that uses RFID technology to monitor real-timely the abnormal logistics events which occur at each work space in the internal material supply chain and proposes its construction method in details.

It is obvious that the long-term inflation impacting human, productive and financial resources can in no way be justified by extremely short-term benefits to a country’s budget or to monopolistic structures. Analysis of the literature clarifies and confirms the fact that in order for inflation to occur and significantly accelerate, the growth of demand factors must exceed that of supply factors during several years. The research shows that the policy of encouraging the demand, and thus a significant and long-lived inflation, is possible only in non-competitive oligopolistic economies marked by corruption and provoking emigration. On the other hand, adjustment of demand instruments to changes in supply is rather a result of fair competition. Interest rate change as an independent factor is shown to be important for the inflation process, especially for deflation, and therefore for the economy. Moreover, it is not completely clear whether delayed is the cause of inflation or its result, but it is obvious that the negative impact of delayed demand, as delayed human and social well-being, results in weaker supply and thereby also in higher poverty and inflation, all of them encouraging a more thorough examination of this problem. Analysis of the phenomenon of inflation over a historic period provides a realistic picture of this problem and shows the ways how to solve it.</jats:p>"

It is important to design the supply chain tracking system in such a way that it can achieve the desired benefits and minimize the costs at the same time. However, there are various challenges to gain this cost effectiveness with regard to technologies, standards, operations, and strategies. Moreover, there are no complete design principles available at this moment. It is the intent of this paper to provide a framework for designing a cost‐effective supply chain tracking system. We will explain the main considerations for a tracking system design and articulate how to coordinate various considerations to reach the optimal design in an economical way. Ultimately, we want to provide some feasible and practical guidelines to support and simplify the decision making process for building supply chain tracking systems.</jats:p>",

However, the coordination of operational decisions is often important, especially for time‐sensitive, customized, and made‐to‐order products. The topic of this article, supply chain scheduling, is the study of the coordination of operational decisions, including scheduling, among supply chain partners with conflicting objectives. Supply chain scheduling uses short planning horizons with reliable data, optimization of decisions, and the exact evaluation of coordination issues. This article discusses the origins of supply chain scheduling, and their relationship to other modern extensions of classical scheduling theory, including multicriteria scheduling, integrated scheduling and sequencing games. Specific examples of supply chain scheduling are discussed for the coordination of scheduling, batching, and lot‐sizing decisions. Various methodologies within supply chain scheduling evaluate both the conflict between supply chain partners and also the benefit to overall supply chain performance from cooperation. The design of incentives and game theory solutions that promote cooperation is an important prescriptive feature of this rapidly evolving research area.</jats:p>",

However, this problem arises in a variety of industries including the sales of fashion garments, flight seats and hotel rooms. In this article, we deal with an inventory system in which sales cycle is divided into an advance sales period and a spot sales period. We consider order cancellation effect which depends on the waiting time of the customer orders. The goal is to determine the optimal order quantity and optimal prices in order to maximize the profit. We also show the concavity of the profit function using mathematical lemmas and theorem. Besides we develop a solution procedure which computes optimal policy effectively. Finally we present the results of numerical study for linear and exponential demand functions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most petrochemical companies are undergoing radical changes. The markets being served have expanded globally, customer service expectations have increased, and demand has become much more volatile and hence less predictable. The resulting product supply chains evolve/develop over time, with integrating decision-making processes and advanced planning practices becoming more prominent. A proactive approach with longer time horizons becomes the norm for excellence. Refinery expansion and highly integrated/sophisticated manufacturing technology have also contributed to increased interdependency within and between supply chains (upstream to feed sources, downstream to end consumer, and between logistics networks). These developments resulted in what is termed advance supply chain planning. Notwithstanding its unique differences, the petrochemical industry still has a lot of ground to cover before it can reach some of the advance supply chain planning benefits reported in other industries. This article presents what is believed to be an appropriate supply chain planning approach/framework for decision making in large-scale, integrated petrochemical companies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Organizations are often facing the problem of determining the degree of investment in building information links with their suppliers and buyers to reduce costs, lead times, and quality problems, improve timely customized delivery, increase asset utilization, and improve corporate profitability. One of the critical enablers for an efficient and effective supply chain is timely planning and information processing across the entire value-added chain. This paper presents an analytical model for selecting the right mix of analytical software and hardware alternatives at various planning and execution levels of an organization to remain competitive in a supply chain. Factors such as quality, reliability, flexibility, timeliness and organizational compatibility have been quantified into cost components that form the weighted cost function. The weights of the various cost components of software and hardware are derived from pair-wise comparison. These weights account for the relative importance of alternative supply chain strategies for an organization. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework and exhibit the efficacy of the procedures and algorithms.</p>",

The use of new software based direct PWM strategy (DPWM) in the inverter circuit has resulted in to produce a very near sine-wave, most suitable for various home loads. Simulated results of proposed PWM output wave form and computation of its harmonics content in terms of THD value (upto 5% or even less) using MATLAB software has been reflected in the proposed scheme. The features like an intelligent control action to prevent battery from overcharge or undercharge, higher efficiency (&gt; 90%), generation of grid quality green electricity, sustainability of solar renewable energy sources, cost effective hardware realization with FPGA based VLSI embedded system, shows the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional power supply systems.</jats:p>",

A cross-sectional sample of parents from Victoria, Australia, completed an online survey. Parents’ plans to supply alcohol in the next 6 months was significantly associated with their reports of supplying alcohol in the previous 3 months (β = 0.51, P &lt; 0.01), perceptions that their adolescent drinks (β = 0.34, P &lt; 0.01), reports of not practising religion (β = 0.13, P &lt; 0.01), and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test scores (β = 0.09, P = 0.04). The total variance explained by the model was 57.4% F (9, 242) = 36.2, P &lt; 0.01. Parents’ plans to supply their adolescent with alcohol might be a reflection of the normalisation of alcohol use in Australia. There is a need to support Australian parents to review their own alcohol use, clarify their views on alcohol use by their adolescent and confidently restrict their child’s access to alcohol, irrespective of their own drinking patterns.</jats:p>"

However, few studies have been done on the impact of such collaboration strategies at one of the lower short-term decision levels: production scheduling. This paper is devoted to the study of information sharing between the members of a supply chain in a dynamic context. We consider a typical make-to-order direct sell supply chain without finished products inventory, similar to the one implemented by Internet PC sellers. We compare various scheduling algorithms implemented to study different scenarios of information sharing among the members of the chain. We have considered scenarios where no information is shared and scenarios where some or all information is shared. A simulation study is developed in order to get some insights about the impact of information sharing on the performance of the chain. Our results suggest improvement in the performance that shows the importance of collaboration and information sharing between the members of the chain.</jats:p>"

Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) was commissioned the work of developing the transport package for tritium by ITER Organization and the first stage of the development has been just finished. The developed package was designed to carry 70 g of tritium and classified as a type B(U) package, which should comply with the requirements stipulated in IAEA Safety Standard Series [2]. The package is composed of a storage vessel, a containment vessel, an overpack and an aluminum liner which is a unique feature of the package. The aluminum liner between the storage vessel and the containment vessel is for containment control under the repetitive use of the package. The package has enough pressure resistance for 5 year in-site storage and the structural and thermal integrity under the hypothetical accident conditions has been demonstrated through a series of analyses.</jats:p>",

This method integrates fuzzy control technology into the controller of power supply, thereby optimizing dynamic characteristics of power supply. The SIMULINK simulation technology is also used. To compare steady-state precision, robustness, response speed and other control indexes between fuzzy control and conventional PI control, the comparative simulation experiments were made respectively under constant non-disturbance steady-state condition, aperiodic load disturbance condition, and periodic load disturbance condition. The simulation results show that power supply with fuzzy controller has perfect steady robustness, fast system response and strong harmonic suppression ability. The simulation model is accurate and reliable, and it can be an efficient tool for further studying mechanism and algorithm optimization of plasma cutting power supply.</jats:p>"

Recent studies have shown that significant shifts in urban geographies are increasing consumers’ expectations of online retail provision. However, at the same time there is also growing evidence that the collaborative practice in online grocery provision within the urban supply chains is resisted. That these trends are found despite growing demand of online provision highlights both the difficulty of bringing geographically dispersed supply partners together and the problems associated with operating within and across ambiguous environments. Drawing upon twenty-nine in-depth interviews with a range of institutional actors, including retail, logistics, and urban planning experts within an urban metropolis in an emerging market, we detail the different ways that collaboration is resisted in online retail provision. Several different patterns of resistance were identified in (non-) collaboration notably, ideological, functional, regulatory and spatial.</jats:p>"

People affected by disasters should be moved from impacted areas, and staff and disaster relief supplies need to be moved to affected destinations in a timely manner. Disaster relief supply chains facilitate the transportation of personnel and supplies that directly affect the humanitarian aid performance. Utilizing appropriate transportation modes in the relief chain is critical to maintain effective relief operations. The main objective of this study is to identify the role of intermodal transportation and related decision making in disaster relief transportation. This objective will be achieved through the following specific aims: identify and assess the current response operations; determine how, if at all, and why humanitarian organizations utilize different modes of transportation to move goods and personnel effectively and efficiently when responding to and recovering from disasters; and identify factors that will potentially enhance the attractiveness of using intermodal transportation. To achieve these aims, two rounds of interviews were conducted first, and second, a large-scale online survey was distributed. Data analysis found that intermodal transportation is not frequently used in disaster relief operations. Decision makers in disaster relief agencies consider multiple factors when choosing transportation modes, but among the factors identified by participants, travel distance was the transportation mode considered most often, regardless of whether supplies or people were being transported. Finally, the organizations that cover larger areas and preposition supplies in their relief operations tend to use intermodal transportation more frequently.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A key paradigm shift resulting from the intersection of the information technology (IT) and utility sectors is the availability of real-time data regarding energy use across different industries. Historically, ascertaining the energy costs across the value chain of a given product or service was a laborious and expensive task, requiring many months of data collection; several proxies or approximations for cases where measured data might not be cost-effectively available; and even then, the resulting energy footprint could have significant uncertainty based on time-of-measurement, geographic diversity of manufacturing sites, etc. As dynamic energy pricing begins to take hold and environmental externalities begin to be priced into existing cost structures, the ability to optimize a given value chain for minimal energy use becomes increasingly attractive. In this paper, we discuss an approach for leveraging dynamically available data alongside historical n-tier supply chain models to avail the ability for such optimization. The approach is illustrated for the case study of a computer manufacturer, where we find that metering electricity use at a small subset of sites can allow for a reasonable estimate of the total energy use across the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The United States uses approximately 5% of its primary energy and 6% of its electricity to pump, convey, treat, distribute, heat, and recondition water in the US public water supply. Allocating this energy towards water has contributed to a national public water distribution system that is considered among the best in the world, providing its users with a clean and reliable water supply. This water supply, treated to stringent water standards defined by the Environmental Protection Agency’s Safe Drinking Water Act, has been critical to the health and livelihood of United States’ citizens. However, this energy-expenditure comes at an environmental cost, since the majority of water-related energy is derived from burning fossil fuels. Fossil-fuel combustion emits carbon-dioxide, a greenhouse gas that has become of concern in recent years because of its connection to anthropogenic climate change. The amount of carbon-dioxide that is emitted from fossil-fuel combustion is principally a function of the quantity and type of fuel that is burned for energy. This first-order analysis quantifying national water-related carbon dioxide emissions is the second in a series of several analyses by the authors, quantifying the energy and greenhouse emissions embedded in the US public water supply. Results indicate that water withdrawal, conveyance, treatment, distribution, end-use preparation, and wastewater treatment produces approximately 301 million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. This quantity is 5.1% of total US CO2 emissions in 2009, which is approximately equal to emissions from the gasoline consumed by one-quarter of the US passenger fleet in the same year. Considering that the emissions associated with water for industrial, municipal and self-supplied sectors (such as agriculture) were not included in this analysis, the actual quantity of carbon emissions released as a result of water-related activities is likely to be higher. Consequently, identifying efficiency measures and conservation schemes to reduce the amount of water-related energy consumed in the US might be significant in achieving future greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.</jats:p>",

Although such strategies have tremendous abilities to improve the efficiencies but simultaneously they make the firms vulnerable to market uncertainties, dependencies and disruptions. Moreover, natural calamities and manmade crises have also put negative impact on strategic, operational and tactical performance of supply chains. These factors have triggered the interest of academia and industry to consider the risk issues as prime concerns. To capture the more fine-grained elements of diversified risk issues related to the supply chain we employ a multi-layered top town taxonomy to classify and codify the literature and put forward the probable dimensions for future research. We further study the pool of SCRM literature focusing on coordination, decision making and sector-wise SCRM implementation issues and derive relevant propositions.</jats:p>"

In fact, the transportation sector is the second largest contributor to direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States, following electricity generation. To address these concerns and consider environmental issues more holistically during the development of products, Design for X (X: manufacturing, environment, etc.) methods, such as environmentally benign manufacturing (EBM) and life cycle assessment (LCA) continue to be advanced through research. In spite of improving environmental performance through design, supply chain related impacts are not well understood and can be impacted by decisions made during product design. Thus, the aim of this research is to explore how changes to the design of a product affect manufacturing supply chain configurations and, in turn, influence product environmental sustainability. The environmental impacts for producing several three-ring binder design variations are predicted by assuming a given set of suppliers that provide materials and components to the manufacturer. Supply chain transportation impacts are also accounted for in the analysis. Transportation impacts are found to be minor compared to materials and manufacturing impacts.</jats:p>",

Quarterly Chilean data from 1973: I to 2006: III is used. We find empirical evidence that the variables establish a long-run steady state relationship in the presence of two regime shifts. The elasticity of price level with regard to money supply is close to unity during the first period (prior to 1978: II). The elasticity is reduced during the second period (1978: III-1986: I) and it is also reduced for the remaining period but the reduction is smaller. We also conducted bootstrap causality tests that reveal the following: in the first sub-period there is bidirectional causality between the underlying variables. In the last two sub-periods money supply causes the price level only. This implies that money supply is weakly exogenous concerning the price level and that the monetary authority had enough independence to execute an active monetary policy in Chile. &lt;span style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

One of the suppliers is a big company for whom the manufacturer's business constitutes a small part of his business. The other supplier is a small company for whom the manufacturer's business constitutes a large portion of his business. We analyze the problem from the perspective of the big supplier and address the following questions: What is the optimal contracting strategy that the big supplier should follow? How does the information about the small supplier's production cost affect the profits and contracting decision? How does the existence of the small supplier affect profits? By studying various information scenarios regarding the small supplier's and the manufacturer's production cost, we show, for example, that the big supplier benefits when the small supplier keeps its production cost private. We quantify the value of information for the big supplier and the manufacturer. We also quantify the cost (value) of the alternative‐sourcing option for the big supplier (the manufacturer). We determine when an alternative‐sourcing option has more impact on profits than information. We conclude with extensions and numerical examples to shed light on how system parameters affect this supply chain. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid growth of urban population in cities and metropoles, the increasing demands in living comfort and thereby a rising amount of fully tempered buildings cause a tremendously increasing energy demand for building tempering. Therefore economically efficient and technically reliable energy sources are needed. The geothermal use of subsoil can be a solution, since it reduces the use of fossil fuels tremendously, which are limited in their availability, and thereby also sustains the reduction of CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases. Geothermal Energy is absolutely renewable and sustainable. Various technical solutions for the thermal use of subsoil as a reliable and sustainable energy source for building heating such as ground source heat pumps, borehole heat exchangers, energy piles and others are available. These geothermal facilities require a well-engineered dimensioning and design accounting for the complex influencing quantities and basic conditions in order archive efficient and economic systems. Generally, the use of geothermal energy gives rise to legal questions as the thermal influence of a geothermal system on the surrounding subsoil could affect neighboring premises. Comprehensive simulations can give investors the desired reliability and legal certainty. The authors conducted various studies on the heat transport and transient heat distribution in subsoil and on the thermal interaction of geothermal heat exchangers. Numerical investigations on the thermal subsoil behaviour and the authors' experiences with complex coupled simulations of various large urban geothermic projects are presented.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Price stability is critical for South Africa’s economic development strategy, and, based on previous studies, to effectively achieve this, requires a good understanding of the relationship between inflation and selected macroeconomic variables of broad money supply, interest rate, exchange rate and oil price. Monthly data are employed from January, 1999 through September, 2010. To determine this relationship, the independent variables were tested for multicollinearity, and thereafter a multiple regression model was developed. The findings from the study show that approximately 97% of the consumer price index movement is explained by the four macroeconomic variables. The study confirms that money supply and exchange rates have a strong positive relationship with inflation and have to be managed. Interest rates and oil price, on the other hand, have a significant negative relationship with inflation and should be part of a macroeconomic policy framework. This requires managing the delicate balance between a desirable level of inflation in support of economic growth and development and an unacceptable level of inflation that leads to price instability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global economic pressures have influenced industries to reduce budgets and look for innovative solutions. New product development procedures, especially in automotive, aerospace, industries today deploy increasingly sophisticated solutions to streamline and speed up product development as well as to improve overall product quality. With new digital factory layout tools and improved 3-D visualizations, manufacturers can digitally design and validate full factories in up to half the time previously required to do the job. Virtual product design procedures involving simulation of complex systems allows designers to develop system without finalizing the hardware. The simulation procedure can be as “what if” scenario when the hardware doesn’t exist. There are two critical issues to consider: speed and complexity. Trade-offs between simulation speed and the level of accuracy is necessary because of system resources available. As the simulation becomes faster with faster processors but the use of multicore systems help simulation. The interactive modeling is crucial to the design process, and it can occur in a mixed environment where real and virtual objects are combined. The key aspect of the virtual environments is that the visual representation of system partitioning and interaction lends itself to mechatronic applications. They also reduce system complexity from a developer’s standpoint, allowing concentration on the application details. Virtual simulations enable everyone to work on development before the first prototype is completed. Engineers can validate the entire operating cycle for the machine by driving the simulation with control system logic and timing. With industries leading all-digital design, validation, and commissioning of factory automation devices, virtual commissioning of factory-floor layout is becoming important. This paper will examine in detail the capability can offer manufacturers the ability to digitally design and layout either new factories or assembly lines much more quickly without putting any physical equipment into place, a method that can cut the time needed for such tasks. The paper discusses a strategy to take that virtual world into the physical world, but also being able to tie it back, so that information that would come from the shop floor could make it back to design.</jats:p>",

They are therefore are very promising for applications in advanced heat pipes and vapor chambers. The present study characterizes the liquid supply and heat transfer performance of monolayers of sintered Cu powders. Three sets of monolayer samples are prepared by sintering Cu powders with different diameters (29, 59, 71 um). The measured heat transfer performance is relatively insensitive to the powder diameter in the low flux regime. At relatively high heat fluxes (&gt; 20 W/cm2) monolayers with the two large diameter powders show similar liquid supply and heat transfer performance while the sample with the smallest powder size shows significantly degraded heat transfer performance due to local dryouts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we examine the suggested link between product architecture (i.e., the extent to which a product is modular vs. integral) and supply chain configuration (i.e., whether the product development is done internally by the manufacturer in an integrated supply chain or in collaboration with a supplier in a decentralized supply chain). Our model suggests that the choice of product architecture depends on firm, market, and product characteristics in addition to supply chain structure. In contrast to other studies, we find that the optimal mapping from architecture to supply chain structure is not always one‐to‐one. A decentralized supply chain may be associated with a more integral product when the technical collaboration penalty is not excessive and suppliers have significantly superior product development capabilities. Furthermore, in a decentralized supply chain, the nature of the relationship between the original equipment manufacturer and its supplier (adversarial or collaborative) plays a role in the choice of product architecture: modular architectures are more likely when the parties have adversarial relationships, while long‐term trust‐based relationships facilitate more integral product architectures. </jats:p>",

The focus is on joint evaluation of inventory replenishment and shipment consolidation effects. A time‐based dispatching and shipment consolidation policy is used at the warehouse in conjunction with real‐time point‐of‐sale data and centralized inventory information. This represents a common situation, for example, in various types of vendor managed inventory systems. The main contribution is the derivation of an exact recursive procedure for determining the expected inventory holding and backorder costs for the system, under the assumption of Poisson demand. Two heuristics for determining near optimal shipment intervals are also presented. The results are applicable both for single‐item and multiitem systems. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Excessive roll motions and relative motions at the stern were studied for two loading conditions for ship speeds ranging from zero to the design speed. A linear frequency-domain seakeeping analysis was followed by nonlinear time-domain simulations of ship motions in waves. Based on results from these methods, critical scenarios were selected and simulated using finite-volume solvers of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations to understand the phenomena related to dynamically unstable ship motions as well as to confirm the results of the simpler analysis methods. Results revealed the possibility of excessive roll motions and water run-up on deck; counter measures such as a ship-specific operational guidance are discussed.</jats:p>",

In external supply system, three aspects of cost, quality and time are used to evaluate the coordination of supply logistics in JIT environment. From the internal aspect, reliability, flexibility, responsiveness, customer service and system suitability are selected for the performance evaluation. The eight indexes construct an index system and each performance index is described and analyzed. Finally, Analytic Hierarchy Process is used to evaluate the coordinated performance of supply logistics in JIT environment.

Its reactor power is 50MWt and the reactor outlet temperature is 750°C. It is a first-of-kind of the commercial plant or a demonstration plant of a small-sized HTGR system for steam supply to the industries and the district heating, and electricity generation using a steam turbine. The design philosophy of the HTR50S is to upgrade the performance from the Japanese first HTGR (HTTR) and to reduce the cost for the commercialization by utilizing the knowledge obtained by the HTTR operation and the design of an advanced commercial plant of 600 MWt-class Very High Temperature Reactor (GTHTR300 series). The major specifications of the HTR50S were determined based on its design philosophy. And the targets of the technology demonstration using the HTR50S for the future commercial small-sized HTGR were identified. The system design of HTR50S was performed to offer the capability of electricity generation, cogeneration of electricity and steam for a district heating and industries. The market potential for the small-sized HTGR in the developing countries was evaluated for the application of the electricity, process heat, district heating and pure water production. It was confirmed that there is enough market potential for the small-sized HTGR in the developing countries. This paper described the major specification and system design of the HTR50S and the market potential for the small-sized HTGR in the developing countries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Formally adopted in 1996 by the International Organization of Standardization, ISO 14001 represents a voluntary international environmental standard, which will likely be adopted by a vast majority of corporations. Its major focus is on the structure, implementation and maintenance of a formal environmental management system. Despite its international acceptance, ISO 14001 is surrounded by controversy and criticism. The literature is clearly divided in its assessment of ISO 14001, which is viewed as a variant of total quality environmental management or a paper‐driven process of limited value. In this study, case‐based research is used to address the competing views of the standard to show that ISO 14001 registration can be leveraged across the supply chain into a competitive advantage. By looking at ISO 14001 registered firms, we compare different amounts of integration and sustainability in the supply chain. We then posit several research propositions to provide an empirical framework for the impacts of ISO 14001 on supply chain design and how it will evolve in the future.

The ever-changing information and communication technology infrastructure of organizations’ is opening new vista, which has not only bundles of opportunities to encash but also tremendous obstacles as survival threats. The concern about organizational competitiveness and development is closely linked to notions of the information sensitive society and global knowledge based economies. The business organizations under global knowledge economy can emerge and grow rapidly by formulating and adopting the innovative business practices. Information’s impact is easily seen—it substitutes for inventory, speeds product design and delivery, drives process reengineering, and acts as a coordinating mechanism, helping different members of the supply chain work together effectively. While the potential of information sharing is widely promoted, relatively few companies have fully harnessed its capability to enhance competitive performance. The chapter tries to provide insight into how information and communication technology can be leveraged for supply chain value creation and make it possible to achieve synergy with customer relationship management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The adoption of a full supply chain approach in the chemical industry is still relatively slow compared to other industries. Although the awareness has been kindled, very few petrochemical companies have advanced to a point where supply chain considerations and influences are proactively taken into account and incorporated in the formulation of corporate- and unit-specific business strategies/tactics, and formally structured and applied. Conventional supply chain integration concepts focus primarily on the internal and external integration of individual supply chains. Due to the highly integrated nature of petrochemical value chains, the related supply chains should also be integrated by taking account of enterprise/industry-wide synergies and interdependencies. Since not much research has been done to indicate the level of advancement in terms of supply chain planning in large-scale, South African-based petrochemical companies, this empirical research is the first of its kind. This research provides useful information regarding an understanding of the petrochemical industry, appropriate supply chain planning practices and the level of advancement in a number of related planning dimensions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper reports a new method to estimate energy used in water supply and return phases of the water cycle. An example is a composite case for energy used in water systems of the United States (U.S.) using data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The new method is innovatively simple: it avoids complexities of data-intensive, bottom-up models, often used to map water networks. This method helps to prioritize how to improve energy efficiency in water systems. The method uses a top-down approach requiring limited system data, and relying on a transparent computation of energy. The method applies to standalone or composite systems. It applies to small-scale, single-user systems, to large water supply/return networks, or to summations of data for classes of systems whether simple or complex, and whether interconnected or not. The reported example shows transport could account for about 95 percent of U.S. water systems’ energy use. Energy use for transport among different water-sectors ranged from roughly 80 percent to nearly 100 percent of total sectoral energy demand. Contrasting that generalization, specific data for standalone systems would show when energy demand depends, for example, more on treatment needed to meet quality standards.</jats:p>",

Following them, this paper develops a mathematical model for the simultaneous decision problem of module commonalization strategies under the given product architecture and supply chain configuration through selection of manufacturing sites for module production, assembly and final distribution as an instance of the problems. This paper demonstrates some numerical case studies for ascertaining the validity and promise of the developed mathematical model with an optimization method configured with a genetic algorithm and a simplex method. Finally, it concludes with some discussion on future works.</jats:p>",

A cost-benefit methodology particularly suitable for the peri-urban areas has been developed for the city of Kolkata, India. The costs are estimated based on a neural network estimate. The water quality of the area is estimated from samples and a water quality index has been prepared. A questionnaire survey in the area has been conducted for relevant information like income, awareness and willingness to pay for safe drinking water. A factor analysis has been conducted for distinguishing the important factors of the survey and subsequent multiple regressions have been conducted for finding the relationships for the willingness to pay. A system dynamics model has been conducted to estimate the trend of increase of willingness to pay with the urbanizations in the peri-urban areas. A cost benefit analysis with the impact of time value of money has been executed. The risk and uncertainty of the project is investigated by Monte Carlos simulation and tornado diagrams. It has been found that the projects that are normally rejected in standard cost benefit analysis would be accepted if the impacts of urbanizations in the peri-urban areas are considered.</jats:p>"

Great Skua numbers had fallen by 23% overall since the previous census in 2000. However, the decline was not uniform across Orkney, the major colony on Hoy declining by 32% but with many smaller colonies actually increasing. Possible reasons for this difference are discussed. Arctic Skua numbers fell by 47% in the same time period and by 64% from their peak in 1992. We found evidence of intra-specific negative density dependence in trends of both skua species, suggesting that declines may have been driven by low food availability. In addition, we found a negative relationship between Arctic Skua trends between 2000 and 2010 and the numbers of Great Skuas present in each colony in 2000. These findings suggest that whilst scarcity of food may have contributed to Arctic Skua declines, predation by Great Skuas is likely to have played an additional role. Predation on Arctic Skuas, both adults and young, is also likely to be ultimately attributable to a scarcity of alternative fish prey for Great Skuas.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Maui Island in the State of Hawaii faces land use and freshwater allocation challenges associated with a growing population and a changing economic base as plantation agriculture has declined. Debate about whether water should be restored to environmental flows, allocated to new urban development for residents and tourists, or be used to irrigate food or fuel crops has highlighted Maui’s opportunity to make integrated resource decisions that consider land, water, and energy in particular. One major potential water demand on Maui is for irrigation for biofuels crops, such as sugarcane for ethanol. While Maui’s energy system is currently low in water intensity, using irrigated biofuels could increase the need for local water investment in energy systems. This paper aims to characterize surface water supply on Maui in order to draw conclusions about supply adequacy for biofuel irrigation. Narrow-scope empirical equations linking streamflow and precipitation tend to produce more accurate estimates for individual streams: for example, equations based only on northeast Maui streams tend to predict northeast Maui stream flows better than equations based on all of Maui’s streams. However, specific equations do not exist for most regions of Maui. This paper finds that general and specific empirical equations for northeast Maui predict nearly identical aggregate streamflows. Irrigation ditch flow comprises aggregate streamflow from a given region, so it is likely that existing, general equations can predict irrigation ditch flows with acceptable accuracy.</jats:p>",

Effective use of N for biomass production under N limitation may be considered to be a result of a trade-off between the use of N to maintain high levels of specific leaf nitrogen (SLN the amount of N per unit leaf area) for high photosynthetic rate versus using N to maintain leaf area development (leaf area index – LAI). The objective here is to compare the effects of N supply on the dynamics of LAI and SLN for two crops, maize (Zea mays L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) that contrast in the structure and development of their canopy. Three irrigated experiments imposed different levels of N and plant density. While LAI in both maize and sunflower was reduced under N limitation, leaf area development was more responsive to N supply in sunflower than maize. Observations near anthesis showed that sunflower tended to maintain SLN and adjust leaf area under reduced N supply, whereas maize tended to maintain leaf area and adjust SLN first, and, when this was not sufficient, SLN was also reduced. The two species responded differently to variation in N supply, and the implication of these different strategies for crop adaptation and management is discussed.</jats:p>"

We monitored vegetation, seed rain, seed bank, and physical conditions at three restored and one reference tidal marsh to evaluate the seed rain's ability to revegetate restored sites, and the relative role of seed dispersal in revegetation patterns. The vegetation at the reference site is significantly more species‐rich than the restored sites, while the composition of their seed rain is similar. Species absent from the vegetation at restored sites are missing from the seed rain at all sites, suggesting that these species are dispersal limited. This does not preclude recruitment limitations for these species, however, as several key physical conditions differ between restored sites and the reference site, which experiences less time inundated and higher summer soil salinity. Although a large amount of the seed rain is washed out of the marsh before becoming incorporated into the seed bank, total seed input is high at restored sites, suggesting that the natural seed supply is adequate to fully revegetate restored marshes, although with lower species richness than reference sites. The strongest influences on a species abundance in the seed rain are its frequency in the vegetation and seed production, suggesting that fecund species that colonize a site early will continue to dominate the seed rain and vegetation development in restored sites.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",

This study applies statistical significance to a hypothesis about cost effectiveness of patients’ total charges by health insurance providers for different heart conditions. A retrospective, observational analysis of data is collected from an urban hospital in the Southeastern United States. Using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) database, diagnoses are selected for further analysis based on their prevalence in the general population. The numbers of procedures as well as the patient’s length of stay in the hospital are significantly higher among the Medicare population. However, results indicate that although Medicaid and Medicare have significantly higher ordinary average total charges than the private counterparts, the difference is negligible when comparing means adjusted to remove covariate influence. One implication is that if private insurers were to insure the same types of high risk patients as Medicare and Medicaid the average total charges of a visit would be comparable between providers. These results also suggest that to enhance cost saving measures in government funded insurance programs, the clinical pathways need to be adapted to reduce length of stay and number of procedures per visit.</p>",

Among the controversies, perhaps the most fundamental one is whether or not GPOs reduce purchasing costs for their members. However, the fiercest controversy is around the “contract administration fees (CAFs)” that GPOs charge to manufacturers. We examine these and other controversies using a Hotelling duopoly model. Among our conclusions: GPOs increase competition between manufacturers and lower prices for healthcare providers. However, GPOs reduce manufacturers' incentives to introduce innovations to existing products. We also demonstrate that the existence of lower off‐contract prices is not, per se, evidence of anticompetitive behavior on the part of GPOs. Indeed, we demonstrate that, under certain circumstances, the presence of a GPO lowers off‐contract prices. We also examine the consequences of eliminating the “safe harbor” provisions that permit healthcare GPOs to charge CAFs to manufacturers, and conclude that it would not affect any party's profits or costs. </jats:p>",

It is shown that the proposal that northern Pennine mines were the principal source of the silver in the late twelfth‐century English currency is untenable. Welsh mines supplied limited amounts of silver to local mints around 1200. Devon silver made a significant but not predominant contribution to mint output at times of bullion scarcity in the 1290s and the mid‐fifteenth century. Imported silver was usually a greater source of the metal in the English currency than locally mined silver, and gold coins constituted most of England's money supply from the mid‐fourteenth century onwards.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>This paper introduces a concept called ‘demand‐induced supply’ that reflects the excess supply of services due to an increase in demand initiated by patients. We examine its association with the proportion of information‐savvy patients in physicians' practice. Using data from a national representative physician survey, we apply latent class models to analyze this association. Our analyses categorize physicians into three ‘types’ according to the frequency with which they provided additional medical services at their patients' requests: frequent, occasional, and rare. The proportion of information‐savvy patients is significantly and positively correlated with demand‐induced supply for the frequent or occasional type, but not among physicians in the rare type. Efforts to contain healthcare costs through utilization control need to recognize the pattern of responses from physicians who treat an increasing number of information‐savvy patients.

Estimating the volume of wood byproducts derived from treatments can assist with agency planning of multiyear thinning contracts that sustain existing and attract new wood product businesses. Agency, local government, industry, and environmental representatives were engaged to assess the level of agreement on restoration treatments in northern Arizona. Participants unanimously agreed on appropriate management across two-thirds of the 2.4 million ac analysis area and defined desired posttreatment conditions using forest structure information derived from remotely sensed data. Results indicate that an estimated 850 million ft3 of stem volume and 8.0 million green tn of tree crown biomass could be generated from tree thinning to reestablish fire-adapted conditions and stimulate new economic opportunities while meeting social and environmental criteria. Wood supply defined by stakeholders exceeded current utilization levels by 88% when extrapolated over the next 10 years.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Third party logistics (3PL) service providers play a growing responsibility in the management of supply chain. The global and competitive business environment of 3PLs has recognized the significance of a speedy and proficient service towards the customers in the past few decades. Particularly in warehousing, distribution, and transportation services, a number of customers anticipate 3PLs to improve lead times, fill rates, inventory levels, etc. Therefore, the 3PLs are under demands to convene a range of service necessities of customers in an active and uncertain business environment. As a consequence of the dynamic environment in which supply chain must operate, 3PLs should sustain an effective distribution system of high performance and must make a sequence of inter-related decisions over time for their distribution networks. Warehouses play an important role in sustaining the continual flow of goods and materials between the manufacturer and customers. The performance of the 3PL supply chain network can be effortlessly enhanced by a balanced allocation of customers to warehouses. In this paper, the authors develop a genetic algorithm and a particle-swarm-optimisation algorithm for solving the balanced allocation problem and the results are encouraging.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Growing concerns for the environment should make every designer more carefully consider product design for the life cycle (DFLC). Although modularity is recognized for its potential to incorporate life cycle considerations into product architecture design, most modular design methods in the literature concentrate on generating highly-modular product architectures but lack the capability for assessing life cycle consequences of these modules in a supply chain. This paper proposes a methodology to find a robust modular architecture with minimal life cycle costs and environmental impacts at the design configuration stage. The objective of the proposed methodology is not to maximize modularity, but to adopt life cycle costing and life cycle assessment of a product in a closed-loop supply chain to identify the most beneficial modular structure. Further, capacity influence of the existing processing facilities in the supply chain on life cycle costs and environmental impacts is evaluated and discussed in this paper.</jats:p>",

The genesis of lunatomalacia requires some vascular risk and mechanical predisposition. The findings were correlated with the cause of Kienböck's disease. The vascular foramina were more than two in 91.33% of the lunate. The lunate had consistent dorsal and palmar branches from radial artery. The additional branches from anterior interosseous artery in 72.22% and a branch of palmar inter carpal arch in 69.44% cases contributed in arterial anastomosis on palmar aspect of lunate. The dorsal blood supply was found by anterior interosseous artery in 85.71% of specimens and dorsal branch from dorsal intercarpal arch in 50% of specimens. The blood supply of lunate comes along with various ligaments which may be disrupted due to trauma or strain leading to avascular necrosis. The present observations are suggestive of rich blood supply of lunate in comparison of other investigations. Therefore Kienböck's disease is less common in northern India.</jats:p>",

These studies focus on how supply management integrates environmental, social and economic criteria allowing a network of interlinked organizations to achieve long-term economic viability. The objective of this research is to explore the paradigm shift that buyers must undergo when adopting a sustainable development approach. This new vision extends and surpasses the traditional dyadic buyer-supplier relationship that has historically dominated the field leading to a new global supply chain dynamic. The case of the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris is used to question the ability of a hub firm to ensure component traceability from first-tier and second-tier suppliers and thus consolidate their corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. Indeed, second-tier supplier failure to comply with CSR requirements, even if the first-tier suppliers meet these requirements, may damage customer perception of the hub firm's strategic positioning. This research mobilizes the agency theory conceptual framework to illustrate that hub firms tend to trust first-tier suppliers with verifying CSR requirements in the upstream supply chain to reduce direct agency costs (monitoring and bonding expenditures). If this approach becomes widespread, it is highly likely that CSR expansion along the global supply chain will be ineffective.</jats:p>",

In a glasshouse column experiment, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) were subjected to 50 mg P/kg at 7–10 cm depth (hotspot P) or 5 mg P/kg in the whole profile (uniform P), with both treatments receiving the same amount of P. Measurements were made of plant growth, gas exchange, P uptake, and root distribution. Plants with hotspot P supply had more biomass and P content than those with uniform P supply. The ratios of hotspot to uniform P supply for shoot parameters, but not for root parameters, were lower in L. albus than wheat, indicating that L. albus was better able than wheat to acquire and utilise P from low-P soil. Cluster roots in L. albus were enhanced by low shoot P concentration but suppressed by high shoot P concentration. Soil P supply decreased root thickness and the root-to-shoot ratio in wheat but had little effect on L. albus. The formation of cluster roots in low-P soil and greater proliferation and surface area of roots in the localised, P-enriched zone in L. albus than in wheat would increase plant P use in heterogeneous soils. L. albus also used proportionally less assimilated carbon than wheat for root growth in response to soil P deficiency. The comparative advantage of each strategy by wheat and L. albus for P-use efficiency under heterogeneous P supply may depend on the levels of P in the enriched v. low-P portions of the root-zone and other soil constraints such as water, nitrogen, or potassium supply.</jats:p>"

Internally, this leads to an increased complexity, both at the product and at the supply chain level, which are mutually connected. The existing approaches and methods of complexity management only focus on one of the observed levels and do not consider the mutual connectivity. Modularity and platform strategy are the most common approaches to reduce the complexity at the level of product design. At the level of supply chain processes, the most common strategies are postponement and process commonality. These approaches do not support selecting the optimal complexity management strategy as for example the proper level of modularization or the optimal depth of added value (postponement). Therefore, this paper presents an approach to detect the capabilities to postpone, which accomplishes more transparency about the supply chain processes and the opportunities and capabilities of the individual supply chain stations. This transparency supports the supply chain management as well as the product development in the reduction of internal complexity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Morpho-structural and physiological traits of Sangiovese and Montepulciano varieties (Vitis vinifera L. – two red grapes widely cultivated in Italy), grown outside under non-limiting water supply conditions were evaluated in 2007 and 2008 and results were correlated with yield components and grape composition. The 2-year analysis showed intraspecific differences in canopy characteristics, leaf and shoot properties, photosynthetic ability, water use efficiency, vine yield and grape composition. Compared with Sangiovese, Montepulciano was able to assure a higher whole-canopy seasonal net CO2 exchange rate during the season (+38% in mid morning and +49% in mid afternoon). It also had higher water use efficiency (especially early in the morning and in late afternoon) and a higher vine yield (+16%). Furthermore, total soluble solids (+1.7 °Brix), anthocyanins (+0.44 mg cm–2 berry skin) and phenolic compounds (+0.88 mg cm–2 berry skin) were higher in the grapes. To ensure this performance, Montepulciano vines have to support higher costs of growth and maintenance processes, made possible because of the increased respiration activity of the canopy during the night. We confirmed that vine yield and grape composition is strictly dependent on the seasonal photosynthetic capacity of the canopy. Therefore, Montepulciano should be put in a position to fully realise this substantial photosynthetic potential, by avoiding or reducing environmental stress. Sangiovese is structurally and morpho-physiologically better able to withstand any stress during the summer than Montepulciano. Sangiovese xylem tissue had larger mean vessel density and smaller mean vessel diameter and hydraulic conductance than Montepulciano, holding the hypothesis of less susceptibility to conduit damage.</jats:p>"

We conducted a retrospective cohort study and a molecular investigation in order to identify the source of the outbreak. Residents living in households connected to the public water network were at an increased risk of developing disease (relative risk 4·80, 95% confidence interval 1·68–13·73) compared to those with no connection to the public network. Norovirus genotype GI.3 was identified in stool samples from six patients and in a sample from the public water network. Contamination of one of the wells supplying the public water network was thought to be the source of the outbreak. This is a description of a norovirus outbreak linked to a municipal drinking-water supply in Sweden. Information from epidemiological and molecular investigations is of utmost importance to guide outbreak control measures and to prevent future outbreaks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Developing new perennial pasture legumes for low-P soils is a priority for Australian Mediterranean agro-ecosystems, where soil P availability is naturally low. As legumes tend to require higher P inputs than non-legumes, the ability of these plants to fix N2 under varying soil P levels must be determined. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of soil P supply on plant N status and nodule formation in 11 perennial legumes, including some novel pasture species. We investigated the effect of applying soil P, ranging from 0 to 384 μg P/g dry soil, on plant N status and nodulation in a glasshouse. Without exogenous P supply, shoot N concentration and N : P ratio were higher than at 6 μg P/g soil. Shoot N concentration and N : P ratio then changed little with further increase in P supply. There was a close positive correlation between the number of nodules and shoot P concentration in 7 of the 11 species. Total nodule dry weight and the percentage of plant dry weight that consisted of nodules increased when P supply increased from 6 to 48 μg P/g. Without exogenous P addition, N : P ratios partitioned into a two-group distribution, with species having a N : P ratio of either &gt;70 or &lt;50 g/g. We suggest that plants with a high N : P ratio may take up N from the soil constitutively, while those with a low N : P ratio may regulate their N uptake in relation to internal P concentration. The flexibility of the novel pasture legumes in this study to adjust their leaf N concentrations under different levels of soil P supplements other published evidence of good growth and high P uptake and P-use efficiency under low soil P supply and suggests their potential as pasture plants in low-P soils in Australian Mediterranean agro-ecosystems warrants further attention.</jats:p>"

The same traits make it a candidate for bioenergy feedstock. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) elevated atmospheric [CO2] and nutrient supply enhance photosynthetic carbon acquisition of this fructan-accumulating grass with little or no photosynthetic downregulation; (2) elevated [CO2] promotes carbon allocation to growth when nutrients are sufficient and to fructan storage in rhizomes when nutrients are low. Plants were grown at ambient or elevated (+320 μmol mol–1) [CO2], and fertilised using full or one-eighth strength modified Hoagland solution. We investigated leaf photosynthesis, whole-plant water use, biomass allocation, and nitrogen and carbon storage in rhizomes. Elevated [CO2] enhanced light-saturated net CO2 assimilation by 61%. It doubled whole-plant, stem and root biomass in summer. Plants grown in elevated [CO2] had a greater rate of CO2 assimilation at higher [CO2], indicating a shift in photosynthetic apparatus for enhanced carbon gain under elevated [CO2]. The majority of belowground biomass was allocated to rhizomes for storage rather than to roots in both seasons. In autumn, elevated [CO2] increased fructan concentration in rhizomes from 8.1 to 11.7% of biomass when nutrients were low (P = 0.023). Our results suggest that elevated [CO2] combined with sufficient nutrients is likely to enhance carbon gain and growth of P. arundinacea, and to increase its productivity and competitiveness in summer. Elevated [CO2] is likely to enhance long-term fructan storage in rhizomes, which may benefit overwintering and vegetative spread.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The benefit of integrating product design decisions and supply chain design decisions has been noticed by researchers. This integration can provide better communication between design teams and operations groups. Accordingly, potential supply chain risks can be highlighted before the launch of a new product. Modularization is one of the most critical product design and supply chain design decisions because it will determine the assembly sequence and potential suppliers of the product in the supply chain execution. However, the impact of modularity level on supply chain performance is still unclear. The objective of this study is to tackle this issue. The proposed method covers product design functions and supply chain design functions, hence the product design decisions and supply chain design decisions can be considered simultaneously. The supply chain performance of all design concepts is comprehensively investigated so as to analyze the impact of modularity on supply chain performance regarding lead-time and cost. The results show that increased modularity is advantageous for the time-based performance of supply chain network whereas decreased modularity demonstrates superiority on cost performance.</jats:p>",

A microvascular injection and modified Spalteholz bone clearing technique were used to characterize and quantify the intramedullary arterial supply of the tibia. Statistical comparisons were made between cats and dogs for the percentage of intramedullary arterial supply (arterial density) and the diameter of the nutrient artery.</jats:p><jats:p>Results: No significant difference was observed in the intramedullary arterial density between dog and cat tibiae. The feline nutrient artery diameter (0.55 ± 0.1 mm) was significantly greater than the canine nutrient artery (0.30 ± 0.04 mm) in the distal section of bone. Dogs subjectively had a greater number of branching vessels in the distal and mid-diaphyseal sections of bone when compared to cats.</jats:p><jats:p>Clinical significance: Delayed fracture healing in the feline tibia does not appear to be associated with a lack of intramedullary arterial supply. A lack of diffuse arborization of the arterial supply to the middle and distal feline tibia may explain, at least in part, why feline tibial delayed or nonunions may be more common than in canine tibial fractures.</jats:p>"

Previous studies have pointed out that early supplier involvement can contribute to the success of the product development and enhance the competitive advantage of the enterprise. However, most of the studies coordinating supplier selection and supply chain configuration make these decisions during the detail design stage, which is the last phase of product design. This research aims to investigate the supply chain scenarios for their relevant performance at the conceptual design stage. The performance of different supply chain scenarios, centralized and decentralized, are compared and discussed.

Electricity supply technologies used in the entire PV production chain are found to be most influential. Emissions associated with only the electricity‐input in the production of PV vary as much as 0–200 g CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐eq per kWh electricity generated by PV. This wide range results because of specific supply technologies one may assume to provide the electricity‐input in PV production, i.e., whether coal‐, gas‐, wind‐, or PV‐power facilities in the “background” provide the electricity supply for powering the entire PV production chain. The heat input in the entire PV production chain, for which mainly the combustion of natural gas is assumed, adds another ∼16 CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐eq/kWh. The GHG emissions directly attributed to c‐Si PV technology alone constitute only ∼1–2 g CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐eq/kWh. The difference in scale indicates the relevance of reporting “indirect” emissions due to energy input in PV production separately from “direct” emissions particular to PV technology. In this article, we also demonstrate the utilization of “direct” and “indirect” shares of emissions for the calculation of GHG emissions in simplified world electricity‐ and PV‐market development scenarios. Results underscore very large GHG mitigation realized by solar PV toward increasingly significant PV market shares. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Several factors should cause commuter rail properties to assess their traction power investment needs: aging generation, transmission, and distribution systems; new cars with improved amenities and higher acceleration rates; and the addition of train starts. The traction power on all North America's electric commuter railroads and on certain overseas properties where shortfalls have occurred is reviewed. Preventive action may be appropriate on some North American properties to guarantee steady supplies of traction power. Strategies for managing power demand are discussed. Traction power is vitally important for electrified commuter railroads, because any failure to provide all necessary electricity can have serious consequences for speed and reliability. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The problem of water overallocation in many regions of the world involves how to include environmental flow provisions for long-term sustainability of river systems, especially under scarce supply conditions. Market mechanisms have provided pathways for returning water to rivers for environmental use. We argue that it is important to consider how both market mechanisms and initial water allocation models contribute to achieving satisfactory environmental flow outcomes. The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia has had policy processes applied to it for almost twenty years to address these issues, and provides an excellent basis for case-study analysis. Two MDB case studies are used to consider differences in the interpretation and implementation of environmental flow requirements, and the potential for institutional inertia of the systems within which water markets operate. We identify two simplified models from these case studies—one prioritising environmental rights above consumptive extraction and the other prioritising consumptive and environmental rights equally. However, neither of these case-study models provides the full environmental flow spectrum of base in-stream flows to over-bank flush events. Our findings suggest that combining allocation and market-based rights (a third model) offers an effective means to deliver full-spectrum environmental flows. If governments provide prioritised environmental rights for base in-stream ecosystem benefits, together with targeted temporary and permanent water market acquisitions to meet environmental needs associated with over-bank floods and flushes, there will be lower potential for shortfalls relative to targeted environmental flow outcomes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper we experimentally investigate the effect of supply air temperature on rack cooling in a high density raised floor data center facility. A series of experiments are performed on a 42 U (1-U = 4.45 cm) rack populated with 1-U servers. Desired rack heat loads are achieved by managing the distribution of server compute load within the rack. During the present experiments, temperatures at various locations in the hot and cold aisle corresponding to the rack air inlet and outlet are recorded. The temperatures are measured using a grid consisting of 256 thermocouples. The temperature measurements are further complimented with the flow field at the rack inlet. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique is used to capture the flow field at the rack inlet. The temperature maps in concert with the PIV flow field help in quantifying the rack cooling effectiveness. The temperature and flow measurements are measured for various cases by altering the supply air temperatures and perforated tile flow rates. The results are analyzed and compared with the ASHRARE recommended guidelines to arrive at the optimum supply air temperature. A perceptible change in the temperature and flow distribution is observed for the six cases investigated.</jats:p>",

(Decision Sciences35(1) (2004) 1–24) argue that decreasing lead time is the right lever if they want to cut inventories, not reducing lead time variability. According to Chopra et al., reducing the mean lead time, μ, is more important than reducing the lead time variance, σ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, to reduce total inventory cost via a reduced safety stock. This paper is a criticism of Chopra et al., where the optimal z was derived based upon a predetermined Q, instead of solving the optimal z and Q simultaneously in a (z, Q) inventory system. We argue that such an approach is inappropriate because the two decision variables, z and Q, are in general interdependent, and, moreover, reducing reorder point (safety stock), z, does not necessarily decrease the total inventory cost. We demonstrate by means of a truncated lead time (z, Q) model that it is lead time variability, not mean lead time, that affects the inventory policy and total supply chain cost. </jats:p>",

How can companies improve the social and environmental performance within their supply chains, particularly as other competitive pressures, such as cost and quality, continue to escalate? Starting from an efficient versus responsive supply chain framework, we develop an integrative model that blends together elements of supply chain configuration, stakeholder management, and capability development. Specifically, we spotlight the dimensions of control and accountability that collectively determine stakeholder exposure, and show how this new construct affects the linkages between supply chain capabilities, configuration, and performance. In particular, this analysis reveals that the nature of stakeholder exposure determines how social/environmental technical and relational capabilities impact social and environmental outcomes. We conclude with implications for research and practice, discussing how current supply chain theories must be extended to incorporate external stakeholders, to clarify strategies and identify potential pitfalls, and to better predict performance outcomes.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nFeed costs are the major component of the variable costs and a significant component of the total costs of milk production on Australian dairy farms. To improve farm productivity, farmers need to understand how much feed is being consumed and the nutritive characteristics of the diet. This paper reviews an existing simple approach, the ‘Target 10’ approach, which is commonly used by the dairy industry in Victoria to estimate annual forage consumption. An alternative approach – the ‘Feeding Systems’ approach – is then introduced. The ‘Feeding Systems’ approach is compared with estimated forage consumption measured under experimental conditions. An analysis of the sensitivity of both approaches to incremental changes in key variables is presented. The ‘Feeding Standards’ approach was concordant with estimated forage consumption measured under experimental conditions. Sensitivity analysis has highlighted key variables which may have considerable influence over simulated forage consumption using this approach. Given that none of the key variables tested in this analysis can be varied in the ‘Target 10’ approach, we feel confident that the ‘Feeding Standards’ approach provides an improved method of back-calculating annual on-farm forage consumption. Using a robust approach to calculate forage consumption which fully accounts for metabolisable energy requirements is important where farmers are using home-grown forage consumption as an indicator of farm feeding system performance. It is also important to understand the assumptions involved in estimating metabolisable energy supply from either supplements or forage.\n</jats:p>"

The objective is to maximize the whole supply chain′s expected profit and meanwhile make the supply chain participants achieve a Pareto improvement. We treat lead time as a controllable variable, thus the demand forecast is dependent on lead time: the shorter lead time, the better forecast. Moreover, optimal decision‐making models for lead time and order quantity are formulated and compared in the decentralized and centralized cases. Besides, a three‐parameter contract is proposed to coordinate the supply chain and alleviate the double margin in the decentralized scenario. In addition, based on the analysis of the models, we develop an algorithmic procedure to find the optimal ordering decisions. Finally, a numerical example is also presented to illustrate the results.</jats:p>",

The system uses a microdiaphragm pump with a piezoelectric device for microdirect alcohol fuel cells. The diameters of the pump chamber are 31 mm and 23 mm, and the depths of the chamber are 1 mm and 2 mm. When the piezoelectric device actuates for changing pump chamber volume, the valves will be opened/closed, and the ethanol will be delivered into DAFC system due to the pressure variation. The chamber dimensions, vibrating frequencies of the piezoelectric device, and valve thickness are used as important parameters for the performance of the novel ethanol injection system. The experimental results show that the ethanol flow rate can reach 170 mL/min at a vibrating frequency of 75 Hz. In addition, the ethanol flow rate is higher than the water flow rate.</jats:p>"

Therefore, application of a\n   method of detection of bacterial count which will indicate the real status of\n   this parameter, as authentically as possible, is necessary. The bacterial\n   load of water in certain stages of water supply using direct and cultivation\n   methods was investigated. In the cultivation method, the water samples were\n   inoculated on PCA and on R2A medium, and incubated for 7 days at 37 ?C and at\n   room temperature. Direct method included filtration of samples stained with\n   acridine orange and counting of bacteria on the filters under the\n   epifluorescence microscope. Cultivation and direct methods showed the lowest\n   bacterial count in the tank of Bagdala II, 0 cfu/ml and 611 bacteria/ml,\n   respectively, and maximum abundance in raw water, 157 cfu/ml and 1,378,698\n   bacteria/ml, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that significantly\n   higher count of bacteria was recorded on R2A medium compared to PCA, and at\n   room temperature than at 37 ?C. By index TBC/AMB, the native raw water was\n   classified as more polluted water when applying the results obtained at room\n   temperature compared to the results obtained at 37 ?C. The most realistic\n   bacteriological status of all water types was obtained using the direct\n   method of quantification of bacteria. However, for routine monitoring of\n   water in water supply system, as well as for the examination of bacterial\n   regrowth in the distribution network, it is the best to apply the cultivation\n   method which involves inoculation of samples on R2A medium and incubation at\n   room temperature.</jats:p>"

The work aimed at testing the possibility of extending the application of the TTI kinetic model, developed for specific temperature range of isothermal conditions, at low temperatures. The results showed that the TTI presented reproducible responses after being charged and during the discolouration process under different conditions, which revealed the reliability of the indicator. The TTI reflected well the temperature conditions of the studied scenarios, which indicates its potential application to continuously monitor the temperature history of the fresh fish supply chain. The kinetic model gave good fits in non‐abused scenarios at temperatures below 2 °C, presenting the potential for application of the model in determining the right charging level to suit a product’s shelf life at low temperatures.</jats:p>",

Simulations show that in 65 nm technology, for the allowed delay penalties of 5%, 10% and 20%, the proposed methodology saves 27.8%, 40.3% and 56.9% power compared with the case with single supply and single threshold voltages, respectively.

Finally, 35 energy‐exporting countries are selected to test the effectiveness of the model from the perspective of Chinese energy‐supply security. Empirical results account for the relationship between energy geopolitics and energy‐security strategy of China and indicate that it is an effective solution to strengthen energy cooperation with the peripheral energy‐exporting countries besides the Middle East for improving Chinese energy‐supply security. By comparing empirical results with the real situation of international energy geopolitics, we confirmed the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed methodology.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Uremic cardiomyopathy of men and rodents is characterized by lower myocardial capillary supply that in rats could be prevented by central and peripheral blockade of the sympathetic nervous system. The underlying pathomechanisms remain largely unknown. We investigated whether alterations of cardiac vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and protein expression were involved. In our long-term experiment, we analyzed whether VEGF gene and protein expression was altered in the heart of male Sprague-Dawley rats with either sham operation (sham, n = 10) or subtotal nephrectomy (SNX, n = 10). In our short-term experiment (17 sham, 24 SNX), the effect of a putative downregulation of sympathetic nervous activity by surgical renal denervation (interruption of renal afferent pathways) on cardiac gene expression of VEGF, flt-1, and flk-1 and on myocardial capillary supply was analyzed. In the long-term study, cardiac capillary supply and vascular endothelial growth factor gene and protein expression were significantly lower in SNX than in sham. In the short-term experiment, cardiac VEGF mRNA expression was significantly lower in untreated SNX (4,258 ± 2,078 units) than in both sham groups (11,709 ± 4,169 and 8,998 ± 4,823 units); this decrease was significantly prevented by renal denervation (8,190 ± 3,889, P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that cardiac VEGF gene and protein expression is reduced in experimental renal failure, and this may be considered as one potential reason for impaired myocardial adaptation under the situation of cardiac hypertrophy. The beneficial effect of sympathetic downregulation on cardiac structure and function in renal failure may be at least in part explained by increased cardiac VEGF gene expression.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the field of machining difficult-to-cut materials like titanium or nickel-based alloys, the use of a high-pressure lubricoolant supply may result in a significant increase of productivity and process stability. Due to enhanced cooling and lubrication of the cutting zone and thus reduced thermal tool load, tool wear can be decreased which allows higher applicable cutting speeds. Furthermore, the process stability can be increased as a result of effective chip breaking and chip evacuation. The present paper investigates the effect of high-pressure lubricoolant jets, directed into the tool—chip interface, in a longitudinal turning process with cemented carbide tools. For this type of lubricoolant supply the reduction of the contact length between tool and chip is an important detail. In turning of Inconel 718 and Ti6Al4V, the cutting tool temperature, tool wear, and resulting chip forms as well as the ratio of cutting forces and tool—chip contact area were analysed as a function of the lubricoolant supply pressure and flowrate (up to 300 bar, 55 l/min). To study the effect of the high-pressure lubricoolant supply, reference tests were carried out using conventional flood cooling. The results suggest that the tool temperature can be decreased by almost 25 per cent by the use of a high-pressure lubricoolant supply for both machined workpiece materials. However, due to the different tool wear mechanisms of the presented materials and the change in the specific load on the cutting edge during machining, the resulting tool wear was influenced differently. In the best case, tool wear could be reduced in an order of magnitude of 50 per cent, while in other cases tool wear even increased significantly due to the use of a high-pressure lubricoolant supply. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As a solution to the battery issues in EV (Electric Vehicles) introduction to the market, KAIST has introduced the new concept of electric charging technology, an OLEV? (On-Line Electric Vehicle) system. The magnetic resonance phenomena with optimized inductive magnetic shape has been applied to maximize the power transmission efficiency with enough power capacity to drive the traction motors, so that EVs can be charged while the vehicle is in motion or at stationary. Optimized construction of road electrification is required to implement this technology in view of minimizing the road infrastructure investment while maintaining enough charged energy storage for continuous operation of EVs. The design variables for OLEV? applications includes the battery energy capacity, powered track length and traction motor size under given operation conditions of closed operation travel route, vehicle specification, battery specification and traction motor performance etc. In this paper, an algorithm and program development process is presented focused on optimizing the design variables in road electrification as well as the EV specification in closed route application. The optimization process is to minimize the road electrification so that EVs are capable of operating continuously and can have enough instantaneous required power by applying simulation on several standard driving cycles. Considered factors includes required instantaneous power, collected power from on-road power supply, required vehicle performance, battery charge and discharge rates, and battery SOC (State Of Charge). Locations and distances of the powered tracks have been determined in the view of required electric energy and instantaneous required power for a normal vehicle operation in an actual road application and on a standard driving cycle. </jats:p>",
