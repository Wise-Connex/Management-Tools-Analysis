The authors find a consensus in the industry concerning a shift towards through‐life management (TLM), where major equipment platforms are kept in service for several decades. TLM is widely acknowledged as requiring much closer partnerships in the defence supply chain, in which suppliers assume much greater responsibilities in areas such as in‐service support and maintenance. Yet the findings with MoD and suppliers reveal different perceptions of the feasibility and practical implications of the proposed changes.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Product‐service specific capabilities need to be developed especially in areas such as accurate lifecycle costing. The development of integrated supply partnerships requires greater emphasis on openness, risk and reward sharing, trust and long‐term commitment in supplier relationships. There is also a need for early supplier involvement to ensure not only design for manufacture, but design for maintainability and logistics, instigated and managed by the customer (i.e. MoD).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The analysis demonstrates the importance of adopting a through‐life perspective when considering industrial contexts characterised by very long product lifecycles. This study shows that a through‐life perspective creates a blurring of the boundary between customers and suppliers, and increases long‐term supplier responsibility. This gives rise to new considerations, such as sophisticated risk and rewards sharing mechanisms, design for maintainability, and technology insertion.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A sampling program was conducted in a residential community in Cairo, Egypt in order to determine the presence of chlorine disinfection by-products (DBPs) in treated water and to observe the impact of the distribution system on DBP levels. Five campaigns were conducted over a 15-month period during 2005–2006. Trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) exceeded local and international limits depending upon the season. Tap water concentrations of THMs were considerably higher in summer than during the rest of the year. In the Summer 2005 event, the average for the 20 tap water locations was 158 μg/l Total-THMs, well in excess of the U.S. EPA limit of 80 μg/L and the current Egyptian standard of 100 μg/l; all 20 locations exceeded the 100 μg/l limit. For the following event in late Fall 2005, the average dropped to 84 μg/l with 11 and 6 sites exceeding the U.S. EPA and Egyptian limits, respectively. HAA levels tended to be complementary to Total-THM values in that they were lower in summer but higher during fall and spring. The U.S. EPA limit on a select set of 5 HAAs (HAA5) is 60 μg/l (Egypt does not currently regulate HAAs). The average for HAA5 in the Summer 2005 event was 52 μg/l with 8 of the 20 tap samples equalling or exceeding the 60 μg/l standard. By contrast, in Fall 2005, the HAA5 average increased to 89 μg/l, with 15 of 20 sites exceeding the limit. THM and HAA concentrations generally increased with distance from the WTP along a targeted distribution main, while chlorine and natural organic matter tended to decrease.</jats:p>",

These twin deficits were rooted in institutions and political choices, not in waterâ€™s availability. Household water requirements represent a tiny fraction of water use, usually less than 5% of the total, but there is tremendous inequality in access to clean water and to sanitation at a household level. In high-income areas of cities in Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa people enjoy access to several hundred litres of water a day delivered into their homes at low prices by public utilities. Meanwhile, slum dwellers and poor households in rural areas of the same countries have access to much less than the 20 litres of water a day per person required to meet the most basic human needs. Women and young girls carry a double burden of disadvantage, since they are the ones who sacrifice their time and their education to collect water.</jats:p>"

This chapter responds to Chapter 12 arguing that manipulations of the coinage, in particular metallurgical manipulation and changes in the volume of coin emission until the mid-3rd century, were as much a consequence of overall economic growth as individual political and economic events. From the standpoint of metallurgical manipulation, it further suggests that increases or decreases in metal extraction for minting purposes may have been closely timed to perceptions of inflationary or deflationary forces, the former requiring increased production of copper, the latter leading to increased demand for new silver and gold. It also contends that state loans, tax remissions, debt cancellations may have functioned as devices to stimulate local economic development.</jats:p>",

Our goal is to learn the course of each vessel and the major region it supplies. Fluoroscopic cerebral arteriography and non-invasive imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), give us excellent views of arterial circulation and bolster our knowledge of vascular territories. From these technologies, and a long history of pathologic studies, we know that the central nervous system vascular territories are highly variable. Therefore, when we review an MRI of a stroke (aka infarct), we should look at the central area of injury to determine the infarcted vessel and avoid temptation to determine the vessel territory by reviewing its borders. In this chapter, we will specifically focus on the central region each vessel supplies and try to neglect the vessel borders.</jats:p>",

A growing army of bloggers and amateur citizen journalists now delivers—but rarely edits—content for all media platforms, while new media technologies, combined with the changing structure of global news industries, are changing radically the ways in which newspapers and media business functions and struggles for profitability. Our research sought to answer the question of how the Internet is impacting on different value activities in the newspaper industry supply chain. To answer these questions, 15 semi‐structured in‐depth interviews were conducted at three regional newspapers in the Manchester area. The findings showed that in spite of initial fear and rejection, the Internet is now firmly embedded in newspaper industry supply chain operations. Firms are now using the Internet as an operant resource and working proactively with consumers to develop various forms of relationship value. We highlight the role of consumers in the creation of news (editorial) content and consumer‐driven moves toward a merged media platform of distribution (including television, online, mobile and printed forms). Newspapers will probably survive if they supply an ‘elite’ service to a leadership news audience. This will be in the form of ‘hybrid’ content: analysis, interpretation and investigative reporting in a print product that appears less than daily combined with constant updating and reader interaction on the Web.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examined how ozone and permanganate preoxidation affect coagulation of green algae (Chodatella sp.) and diatom (Navicula sp.) by alum and/or polymer. The results show that algae species exhibit noticeable responses to various combinations of preoxidation and coagulation processes. Preoxidation can improve green algae coagulation with either alum or cationic polymer as coagulant. For diatom, alum is more effective on cell coagulation than cationic polymer. Ozone preoxidation has detrimental effect on diatom coagulation removal, while permanganate preoxidation has only minor effect. These probably are due to the difference in interaction modes between the preoxidants, cell surface, and coagulants. It is, therefore, suggested that the strategy for algae removal from source water should be based on the dominant algae species.</jats:p>",

Acute copper toxicity can result in a number of pathologies and, in severe cases, death. Drinking tea habitually may be helpful in reducing copper toxicity.

The objective of this study was to better understand the formation of DBPs in Nile River source water with a view toward optimizing conventional treatment, focusing on enhanced coagulation, to achieve reduction in DBP formation potential (FP) in a cost-effective scheme. To this end, characterisation of natural organic matter (NOM) in Nile raw water and after treatment by fractionating according to hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties was included in the analysis. Seasonal variations in raw water quality were found to be important for achieving optimum reduction of turbidity and DBP formation. In summer, alkalinity is lower; therefore, enhanced coagulation with 30 mg/L alum can be done at pH 6 without excessive additions of acid, and satisfactory reductions in turbidity and DBPs attained. During the remainder of the year, high alkalinity results in enhanced coagulation at about pH 6.5 and notably lower reduction of NOM, THMFP, and HAAs versus summer conditions. Supplementing enhanced coagulation with 10 mg/L PAC is highly recommended for these conditions as it improves removal of all DBP indicators. The transphilic fraction was the main contributor to DBP formation and the primary fraction removed by enhanced coagulation for achieving gains in THMFP reduction.</jats:p>",

The objective is to measure the sensitivity of the call center's performance to potential modifications of critical variables. The bibliography related to the application of such tool in call centers is reviewed, and the way by which the problem is treated nowadays is described in detail. The methodology used to achieve this article objective involved a simulation model in the Arena Contact Center software, which worked as base case upon where the scenario and sensitivity analyses could be performed. This paper comes to the conclusion that Simulation is a tool perfectly adequate to its purpose as long as it could be able to show, for the studied call center, mainly that: (i) it is possible to reduce the operator contingent; (ii) fair variations on the demand pattern can impact too much the performance indicators; and (iii) it is possible to improve the service level if an aggregated handling format is adopted.</jats:p>"

Flow networks concept is proposes as a coordination mechanism for supply chains with multiple members, multiple stages and multi-products, where each product is composed of several basic components. A supply chain optimizer (SCO), actually an e-hub, gathers supply chain state information. After necessary computations, it informs members of the supply chain of optimal decisions for their orders.

The authors ask whether tourism development could provide these particular conditions. An important distinction is made between the perception of management of the market being in surplus or abundance. If the downward-sloping supply curve is the case, then the distress selling of labour that it implies would have implications for the quality of tourism products and for the capacity of tourism to alleviate poverty. </jats:p>",

Although managers continue to pursue efficiency and effectiveness within the firm, increasingly improvements are obtained across the value chain: through reconfiguring firm boundaries, relocating resources, reengineering processes, and re-evaluating product and service offerings in relation to customer requirements. In this first paper in a two-part series on strategic cost management in supply chains, we review structural cost management. Structural cost management employs tools of organizational design, product design, and process design to create a supply chain cost structure that is coherent with firm strategy. In the second part of the series we will consider executional cost management, which employs measurement and analysis tools (e.g., variance analysis, cost driver analysis, supplier scorecards) to evaluate supply chain performance. Using selected studies in accounting, operations management, and business strategy, we provide an overview of strategic cost management in supply chains, highlight contemporary developments, and suggest directions for future research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The decision-making process that results in carrying out R&amp;D activities in the internal, non-internal or combined way involves a series of variables and deserves a more detailed analysis due to its specificities. This need stems from the relevance of R&amp;D activities in the organizational universe, verified more in the last decades, due to the possibility for the formation of the competitive edge. The R&amp;D area represents the organizational unit responsible for converting the body of knowledge that permeates the fabric of the organization into innovation of products and processes aiming to achieve the sustainability of the organization. The change in the profile of the R&amp;D area in recent years, allowed to observe repositioning of this highly technical area, through converting it into a more integrated unit in the organizational world, by more intense interaction with other organizational units, filtering information used in the innovation process. Following the logic of rationality in the theory of transaction costs, evidenced by the dilemma \"make or buy?\", the R&amp;D activities are analyzed in the possibility to be carried out internally or externally. In many cases outsourcing may occur even across national borders. This paper was created with the aim of examining the case of three multinational companies that have outsourced their R&amp;D activities to Brazil based on a strategic perspective, in order to understand the contextual framework that led to different configurations of the R&amp;D activity in these three subsidiaries, providing new possibilities of design for international management of operations. The results highlight the importance of relations of trust, based on local expertise, regardless of pre-existing or developed, as background for the decision of multinational firms in order to transfer more complex activities such as research and development to the subsidiaries in Brazil. The authors hope to contribute to the debate on the advantages and benefits of the process of the outsourcing of these activities.</jats:p>"

System assessment can be done at increasing level of detail, requiring more site specific information as the level of detail increases. Four case studies are presented with increasing level of detail, showing the type of information that is required for each of these levels and how each level informs risk management. The first case study shows how a system assessment can be performed without other site specific information than the type of source water and the type of treatment processes. The required data for the system assessment are collected from the large body of literature available. The second case study uses site specific microbial indicator data. The third study uses pathogen data and the fourth case study combines data on pathogens, microbial indicators and process parameters. The case studies show that the level of detail required largely depends on the risk management question.</jats:p>",

Sufficient biomass, mainly agricultural and mill residues, will be available at prices of around $50/ton to meet the advanced biofuel mandates of the US Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The estimates of agricultural residue supply are very sensitive to the assumed fraction of residues that can be sustainably removed from the field, and the potential of municipal solid waste as a feedstock depends on which components can be economically converted into liquid biofuels.</jats:p>"

The Water Supply Act of 1958 authorizes the COE to partner with state and local entities to provide a water supply source in connection with its primary responsibilities of construction, operation, and modification of federal navigation projects as well as flood damage reduction. Water shortages in recent years have increased the demand for water from COE reservoirs, pushing the COE's secondary role of water supplier to the forefront. The author examines the Georgia‐Florida‐ Alabama conflict over the COE's water allocation, and how the effects of water supply decisions can range beyond the local, or even regional, planning level. The author concludes that by becoming more aware of the scope of the COE's authority, water suppliers can make educated decisions about whether to involve the COE in local water supply planning efforts.</jats:p>",

The dominant model used to study the case of women focuses on the supply of and demand for female aspirants. This article develops a critique of this approach, by drawing on two sets of theoretical tools: institutionalism and feminism. It subsequently elaborates an alternative perspective on candidate selection based on configurations of three kinds of gendered institutions: systemic, practical, and normative. The utility of this approach is then explored through three paired comparisons of cases in which quota policies have been introduced, disrupting some but not necessarily all aspects of gendered institutional configurations. </jats:p>",

Most of the time in original water samples either bacteria are insufficient in numbers or the diversity is not enough to reflect the biodegradable part of DOC. In this study, instead of using the water sample itself as an inoculum as in the original BDOC test, the bacteria originating from the Ömerli reservoir in İstanbul were acclimated in a suspended growth system to remove readily and slowly biodegradable DOC fractions from the reservoir water. This modified BDOC procedure was first tested on standard acetate solutions and later on raw and ozonated waters of the Ömerli reservoir. Additionally, the results of the modified procedure were compared with the original one by also testing the effectiveness of the indigenous seed from the reservoir. In order to determine the most suitable inoculum amount in the modified BDOC procedure, different seeding ratios like 1:100, 1:250 and 1:500 (v/v) were tested. In both raw water and ozonated waters, higher BDOC readings were achieved at a seeding ratio of 1:100 than the original procedure. The results showed that the modified procedure resulted in more accurate results compared to the original one and that using an acclimated culture can bring an improvement in BDOC measurement.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is widely accepted that water resources are vulnerable to socioeconomic development and environment change including climate change/variability. So, analyzing the type and extent of stresses (that render water a vulnerable resource) and the capacity of the system to adapt is necessary for integrated water resources management. This paper departs from the common notion that links vulnerability to water crisis, and analyzes a water resources system in the Bagmati River Basin (BRB) in Nepal from the perspective of both stress and adaptive capacity. The analysis is based on evaluation of eleven indicators, eight parameters, two sub-indices and an index. The situation analysis in basin and sub-watershed scale suggests considerable variation in parameter values and vulnerability index in different geographical (basin and sub-watershed) and spatial (three sub-watersheds) scales within the BRB, revealing the need for differential policy interventions based on scale. The northern sub-watershed in the BRB which has favourable climate for human settlement and cultivation, is more vulnerable than the southern sub-watershed. Relatively higher vulnerability in northern sub-watershed is due to high stress (related mainly to water scarcity) and low adaptive capacity (related mainly to low natural capacity). The comprehensive and easily interpretable finding is expected to help decision makers to reach sound solutions to reduce vulnerability of water resources system in the dynamic environment.</jats:p>",

This paper describes how the management of pressure can help reduce the leakage in the water distribution network. EPANET is used to develop the hydraulic model to analyse the effect of alternative pressure profiles on the leakage in a pilot area within the water distribution system of Bangkok. One of the alternatives is implemented in the field to verify the applicability of the model. Results indicate that the average reduction in pressure by 2.4 m can reduce the leakage by 12.5% of the system inflow without compromising the level of service.</jats:p>",

The results show that a combination of EC and GAC considerably reduces the organic matter content, which is mainly fulvic acid. This type of organic matter is removed with high coagulant dosages which neutralize their high anionic charge. A further reduction of NOM is achieved due the adsorption of NOM by GAC. As a result, the average trihalomethane (THM) concentration was only 14.5±5 μg L−1. Enhanced coagulation alone decreased the NOM concentration by 50%, but the remaining NOM reacted in the chlorination step and a higher average THM concentration was found (38±23 μg L−1). An average THM concentration of 73.8±41.2 μg L−1 was found at the drinking water plant of Boaco when conventional treatment was used.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RH-Fe-MCM-41 adsorption efficiency and capacity were examined with arsenic in lower concentrations in aqueous solution under varying pH values. The adsorption of arsenite (As3 + ) and arsenate (As5 + ) by RH-Fe-MCM-41 at the molar ratio of Si/Fe 10 gave removal efficiencies of 47% and 99% for As3 +  and As5 + , respectively, in the 100–1,000 μg l−1 concentration range. For the adsorption test of arsenic the best conditions were found to be an equilibrium time of 12 h at pH 7 for As3 +  and 2 h at pH 4 for As5 + . The adsorption capacity by the Langmuir constants (Qm) for As3 +  and As5 +  were 416.67 μg g−1 and 277.78 μg g−1, respectively, while the Freundlich constants (KF) were 0.583 μg g−1 for As3 +  and 112.87 μg g−1 for As5 + . The fit for As5 +  was good with both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms by considering the R2 values, which were quite similar (0.916 and 0.912); As3 +  fit well only with the Langmuir isotherm. The impregnation of iron (Fe3 + ) into the RH-Fe-MCM-41 structure increases the adsorption capacity of As3 +  and As5 +  both by oxidizing As3 +  to As5 +  and by co-precipitation with As5 + .</jats:p>",

The mediation took place at the request of the disagreeing parties and the Dutch and Indian governments. The conflict related to corporate social responsibility (CSR) standards followed by the textile companies.In this contribution the effects of campaigning and litigating in issues concerning CSR will be examined. Limiting the analysis to CSR conflicts in the textile industry, the author will reflect on these new types of international conflicts in a globalising world and will share her view on appropriate ways to avoid them or, ultimately, to (re)mediate them if necessary.This contribution informs the reader about the events in India and the Netherlands which led to the escalation of the conflict. It provides an overview of the conflict resolution procedures and elaborates on the outcome of the ‘Lubbers Mediation’. The applicable legal and soft law labour standards are compared as well as the parties’ communication strategies. Lastly, this case is contrasted with other CSR conflicts in the textile industry, revealing a hidden conflict.</jats:p>",

In addition, this study attempts to identify any significant causal relationships between port supply chain orientation and port performance from the view point of shipping companies. In the current study port supply chain orientation was found to have limited effect on customer satisfaction and port competitiveness, which might has been caused by some implemental and practical issues. However, the present study reveals the potential importance of port supply chain management by empirically demonstrating that “closer relationship with shipping lines” and “innovative value added service” could function as critical components for container ports/terminals to improve customer satisfaction and enhance their competitiveness.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explains how indeterminacy in a one-sector model may arise due to externalities in the disutility of labor supply, which is termed as demand-side indeterminacy. This contrasts supply-side indeterminacy that is driven by externalities in the production function as exemplified by Benhabib and Farmer (Journal of Economic Theory, 1994). For the one-sector models considered, I find that indeterminacy arises more easily from the demand than from the supply side. In addition, demand and supply-side indeterminacy generate different cyclical patterns of wages, a feature that is useful for identifying episodes of self-fulfilling prophecies within the two types of indeterminacy. </jats:p>",

Unregulated contaminants (e.g. perchlorate) in drinking water are also of significant concern in Korea. We investigated perchlorate levels in tap water, river water, and sewerage water at 4 major water sources in Korea from June 2006. Tap water samples in the Nakdong River basin contained high perchlorate levels. Of the other sampling sites, one at Daegu showed the highest perchlorate level, 22.3 μg/L. The first 2 investigations of raw water sources for drinking water in the Nakdong River basin, found relatively high perchlorate concentration, 18.7–95.6 μg/L and 4.0–25.6 μg/L. The high perchlorate concentration in the Nakdong River basin was possibly derived from waste water discharged by an LCD (liquid crystal display) manufacturing factory in Gumi. The perchlorate concentration of waste water from the nearby sewerage water treatment plant was 730–1,858 μg/L. We modified the waste water treatment operation system at the LCD factory to reduce the perchlorate emissions from this source. The modified treatment system reduced the perchlorate concentration in the final effluent to 40–70 μg/L. Source reduction was successfully achieved by the modified treatment process and by using a perchlorate-free etching reagent.</jats:p>",

Innovator vaccine firms will be unlikely to participate in the program because the payments in the GO license do not adequately compensate firms for all lost profits. Additionally, the price reductions from competitive entry are unlikely because the vaccine market is already characterized by low, and in some cases unsustainable, prices. I propose a potential adaptation where developing world vaccine manufacturers serve as contract suppliers to innovator firms for a given period of time. Donors could also share in the initial costs of capacity with the developing world manufacturers. Sales of developing world manufactured vaccines would be sold solely to UN procurement agencies under a confidential pricing or rebate system. This would increase overall product availability, maintain market separation, and decrease costs to UN agencies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Success of services businesses depend on how well the workforce is managed. Having the right size of workforce and the right skill set of the workforce at the right time under dynamic demand environments are challenges that many service businesses face. Demand disturbances in services businesses are typically managed by adjusting the resource levels such as acquiring additional resources from larger pool (borrowing resources from the corporate levels for departmental level needs), and releasing resources back to the larger pool for transferring and cross training of the workforce. However, the resource adjustments for changing the level of workforce are not as easy as acquiring or scraping materials as in manufacturing supply chain. Ineffective policies of the resource adjustment can produce undesirable effects such as oscillation between acquisition and release of workforce, and amplified oscillation through the stages of the service processes. In this work, we attempt to apply control theoretic principles in managing resources to see how various feedback control schemes can improve costs, utilization and stability of workforce. Our study indicates that effective combination of multiple feedback control schemes can produce desirable policies of workforce resource management. </jats:p><jats:p> [Service Science, ISSN 2164-3962 (print), ISSN 2164-3970 (online), was published by Services Science Global (SSG) from 2009 to 2011 as issues under ISBN 978-1-4276-2090-3.] </jats:p>",

These tariffs have effectively blocked over-quota imports and are likely to continue to prevent imports on most supply-managed products following the successful completion of the Doha Development Round trade negotiations. However, we argue that tariff cuts in the post-Doha Round period will severely limit Canada’s ability to restrict imports, and it is important to use this opportunity to better position supply-managed industries to compete.

The most commonly requested drugs were infliximab (n = 22), mycophenolate (n = 13), rituximab (n = 10) and cyclosporin (n = 7). These drugs were initiated for treatment of a heterogeneous group of serious medical disorders. 10 hospital departments initiated the requests. The cost of new approvals was $458 301, accounting for 61% of the total cost of $749 236 for off‐label immunomodulatory drugs within the study period. The most expensive drugs were rituximab, infliximab and mycophenolate. Efficacy reports were available for 64% of approvals and a favourable therapeutic response was observed in 74% of cases. 4 deaths occurred and significant treatment‐related adverse events were noted in 24% of cases. High‐level evidence supported the use of immunomodulatory drugs for 41 individual patient use approvals.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>Off‐label use of immunomodulatory drugs was diverse and supported by good evidence in over 50% of cases.

This ozone flotation system was evaluated on the basis of the efficiency of ozone transfer into water and the removal efficiency of turbidity and TOC in the Nakdong river water. The DAF pump system found to be more efficient than the conventional DAF system injecting ozone directly from a ozone generator. The ozone through the DAF pump process was dissolved in water much faster than through the general ozone generator due to the higher mixing efficiency through a pump impeller and high pressure inside the DAF pump. Also, the kinetics of ozone decay injected by the DAF pump was slower than injected by an ozone generator. The DAF pump flotation system shows that 30% difference of removal efficiencies is attained as the ozone dose increases from 1.2 mg/L to 8.2 mg/L. And the turbidity removal was increased with increasing ozone dose. Therefore it can be concluded that ozone in this flotation system facilitates improved removal of organic matter and turbidity due to enhanced destabilization of those.</jats:p>",

This study contributes to an understanding of a suboptimal use of environmental information, which is critical for all collaborative efforts aiming at sustainable competitive advantage. The aim of this article is to describe the use of environmental information at different stages of the Swedish food supply chain. The results from this case study of the Swedish food supply chain indicate that environmental information is perceived and used differently by purchasers in the supply chain depending on where (in the supply chain) they are situated in relation to other chain actors. The main contribution of this study is the suggestion of a stage‐dependent connection between perceived environmental cost and perceived environmentally informed consumer demand, which are barriers to GSCM practice discussed in recent GSCM literature. The missing link between information sharing and (environmental) performance of supply chains is explained as distance to end‐consumer in terms of supply chain stages. Implications for GSCM practice and theory are discussed. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.</jats:p>",

The previous research is inconsistent in its findings about the relationship between SCI and performance. We attribute this inconsistency to incomplete definitions of SCI, in particular, the tendency to focus on customer and supplier integration only, excluding the important central link of internal integration. We study the relationship between three dimensions of SCI, operational and business performance, from both a contingency and a configuration perspective. In applying the contingency approach, hierarchical regression was used to determine the impact of individual SCI dimensions (customer, supplier and internal integration) and their interactions on performance. In the configuration approach, cluster analysis was used to develop patterns of SCI, which were analyzed in terms of SCI strength and balance. Analysis of variance was used to examine the relationship between SCI pattern and performance. The findings of both the contingency and configuration approach indicated that SCI was related to both operational and business performance. Furthermore, the results indicated that internal and customer integration were more strongly related to improving performance than supplier integration.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Within the literature adopting this approach, however, there are two potentially important issues that so far have not been given the attention they might deserve. A first issue concerns the procedure by which the discrete alternatives are selected to enter the choice set. Most authors choose (not probabilistically) a set of fixed points identical for every individual. Some authors adopt instead a sampling procedure and also assume that the choice set may differ across households. A second issue concerns the availability of the alternatives. Most authors assume all the values of hours of work within some range are equally available. At the other extreme, some authors assume only two or three alternatives (for example, nonparticipation, part‐time and full‐time) are available for everyone. Some studies account instead for the fact that not all the hour opportunities are equally available to everyone specifying a probability density function of opportunities for each individual. In this paper we explore by simulation the implications of (i) the procedure used to build the choice set (fixed alternatives versus sampled alternatives); (ii) accounting or not accounting for a different availability of alternatives. The results of the evaluation performed in this paper show that the way the choice set is represented has little impact on the fitting of observed values, but a more significant and important impact on the out‐of‐sample prediction performance. Thus, the treatment of the choice sets might have a crucial effect on the result of policy evaluations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An influenza pandemic will place an enormous strain on the world’s vaccine production, distribution and administration systems. Following a pandemic declaration, industry’s priority will be to deliver as much vaccine in as short a timeframe as possible. In respect to this challenge, manufacturers have successfully developed antigen‐sparing strategies and significantly increased production capacity, with further growth planned assuming ongoing rising demand for seasonal vaccines. The combination of these factors has the potential to closer meet global needs for vaccine supply than ever before through increased availability of pandemic and pre‐pandemic vaccines. The demonstration of cross‐clade reactivity with H5N1 viruses makes the concept of pre‐pandemic stockpiling and vaccination a reality for this subtype. Ensuring these vaccines are made available in a timely fashion to those who need them will present significant challenges. For local authorities, national governments and international organisations this means defining vaccine allocation and procurement processes as well as strengthening, and where necessary establishing, the critical health systems and infrastructure required for vaccine deployment. For vaccine producers this means addressing the technical and logistical issues associated with supply. This includes working with regulators to streamline key procedures, including generic labelling and batch release, while establishing flexibility in supply formats, including bulk and finished products, to maximise the speed of delivery. Similarly, the deployment of large quantities of vaccines in an emergency situation requires appropriate transport infrastructure and the distribution of associated medical supplies. As well as addressing these issues, specific consideration must be given to the logistics and storage aspects associated with stockpiling pre‐pandemic vaccines. Finally, mutually agreed contractual arrangements between manufacturers and governments or international institutions represent the best approach toward addressing supply challenges and assisting vaccine producers meet national and international demand. To be effective, these contracts should be based on accurate forecasts, clearly defined vaccination strategies and the capabilities of public health infrastructure.</jats:p>",

To our surprise, the ATPase <jats:italic>N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>nsf</jats:italic>) was identified as an essential gene for maintenance of neuroendocrine transcriptional programs during the embryo-to-larva transition. Despite normal hypothalamic development in <jats:italic>nsf</jats:italic><jats:sup><jats:italic>st</jats:italic> 53</jats:sup>mutants, neuropeptidergic cells exhibited a dramatic loss of cell-specific markers by 5 days post-fertilization that is accompanied by elevated intracellular neuropeptide protein.

Supply Chain Learning (SCL) and Applied Supply Chain Process Knowledge (Applied SCPK) are used as proxies for Knowledge Acquisition and Application. This study aims to test the relationship between Applied SCPK, SCL, and Organization Performance. This study also looks at the effect of Environment Knowledge as a moderating variable. About 1608 questionnaires were distributed to all the manufacturing firms in Malaysia. Path Analysis and ANOVA were used to study the various relationships. Results indicate existence of strong relationships between the variables. The combined effect of SCL and Applied SCPK on Organization Performance is more significant than looking at the effects separately. Furthermore, Environment Knowledge is found to have moderating effect on the relationship between Applied SCPK and Organization Performance. This paper demonstrates the application of KM in SCM and shows the effect on Organization Performance. This may guide supply chain managers to create an environment conducive to acquisition and application of knowledge. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

For more than a decade it has been known that shallow tube wells in Bangladesh are frequently contaminated with arsenic concentrations at a level that is harmful to human health. By now it is clear that a disaster of an unheard magnitude is going on: the World Health Organization has estimated that long-term exposure to arsenic in groundwater, at concentrations over 500 μg L−1, causes death in 1 in 10 adults. Other studies show that problems with arsenic in groundwater/drinking water occur in many more countries worldwide, such as in the USA and China. In Europe the focus on arsenic problems is currently confined to countries with high arsenic levels in their groundwater, such as Serbia, Hungary and Italy. In most other European countries, the naturally occurring arsenic concentrations are mostly lower than the European drinking water standard of 10 μg L−1. However, from the literature review presented in this paper, it is concluded that at this level health risks cannot be excluded. As consumers in European countries expect the drinking water to be of impeccable quality, it is recommended that water supply companies optimize arsenic removal to a level of &lt;1 μg L−1, which is technically feasible.\n                    </jats:p>"

However, it is difficult because the energy cost changes when environment (energy demand, unit prices of fuel or electric power, and so on) changes even if an energy saving measure is not executed. Although the effect has been conventionally evaluated by the difference between the energy costs before and after the energy saving measure, the effect cannot be calculated correctly when there is environmental change. In this paper, we propose the method of estimating the energy saving effect by presuming the energy cost after an energy saving measure, assuming that the measure is not executed, and show the results of its application to the practical power plants. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents the results of a research aiming to evaluate whether retail banking customers' satisfaction level has some impact on the perception of switching costs and on customers' loyalty. Loyalty was measured through behaviors traditionally associated with this construct: intention to repurchase, propensity to recommend service and price sensitivity. The results of the research conducted in May 2007 with 1000 retail banking clients in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo showed that, the higher the customers' satisfaction with banking services, the higher the propensity to adopt classical behavior related to loyalty such as the intention to remain as customers for the next 12 months, to recommend the bank to relatives and friends and to be willing to pay a higher price for the offered services than their bank's competitors. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed on perceptions of bank switching costs as a result of customers' satisfaction level. These results provide financial institution managers with a better understanding of the relation between satisfaction and loyalty behavior on the part of customers. Such understanding is paramount for banks' good performance in the long run. Moreover, attention should be drawn to elements that may not be overlooked in service projects and their operations in order to achieve quality excellence perceived by customers. In this study such perception precedes satisfaction.</jats:p>"

In terms of hydrophobicity no preference of MIEX® Resin for a specific NOM type was seen. The presence of hydrophilic neutral acids in the regenerant solution was unexpected since the removal of only highly charged organic species was expected. Charge density measurements however revealed the presence of functional groups, allowing hydrophilic neutrals to be removed by anion exchange. Comparative coagulation of the raw water and regenerant solution showed that both a residual DOC of similar hydrophobicity in the sub 3 kDa area. Considering that this DOC fraction was present in the regenerant it was concluded that MIEX® Resin removes organics recalcitrant to coagulation from raw water and therefore increases DOC removal when both methods are combined.</jats:p>",

Such competitive environment puts constant pressure on the logistics operations to reduce supply costs and lead time, but the RSM has not been paying much attention to aligning interests of supply chain partners. In 2007, RSM’s effort to build partnership with new 3PLs turned abortive due to their unexpected default on the contract throwing RSM into confusion and disruptions. In this study, the problem was investigated by examining route planning process and incentive scheme of 3PL, and an optimization model was constructed to evaluate the performance of existing 3PL operation. The results indicate that transportation cost can be reduced by relocating consolidation centers, utilizing regional terminal and redesigning routing sequence. However, the research found that the key to successful implementation of the optimized solutions is in designing effective incentive system that induces partners to participate in continuous improvement initiatives.</jats:p>",

The mathematical model enriches the connotation of 4PL and it broadens the thought for 4PL development. Secondly, the proposed mathematical model predicated on transaction costs, is supported by Transaction Cost Theory (TCT) and acts as the theoretical analysis tool of 4PL for coordinating 3-party generic supply chain. Through the model, some trendy conclusions can be drawn to provide theoretical support for 4PL’s practices. Finally, a case illustrates our conclusions.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the N balance in a soil-plant system involving green manures [sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) and velvet bean (Mucuna aterrima Piper &amp; Tracy)], both labeled with 15N. They were incorporated into two soils of contrasting textural classes: a clayey Eutrudox and a sandy-clayey Paleudalf, both cultivated with corn. The research was carried out in a greenhouse, using pots containing 6 kg of air dried soil, to which the equivalent to 13 Mg ha-1 dry matter of above-ground mass plus 2.7 or 2.2 Mg ha-1 of velvet bean and sunn hemp roots were incorporated, respectively, with 15N labeling of either shoots or roots. One hundred days after emergence of the corn, the velvet bean residues provided higher accumulation of N in the soil, higher absorption by corn plants and accumulation in the shoot. The green manure decomposition was more intense in the medium-textured Paleudalf. The highest nitrogen losses were also observed in this soil.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper presents and tests a model designed to provide feedback and continuous improvement during the process of supplier selection in agile supply chains (ASCs). In ASCs suppliers typically need to be changed or added to frequently in response to dynamic market conditions. The model seeks to capitalise on the increased application of the supplier section process by applying principles of continuous improvement and organisational learning. Its aim is to support organisational decision‐makers in their efforts to optimise the performance of the supply chain by ensuring that only the most appropriate suppliers are selected at all times. The model was tested by application within two simulation groups of MBA and masters level international management students who have significant business experience. The results of a questionnaire, used to assess the efficacy of the model, showed that the participants found the model was likely to have significant benefits when used in practice.

In this study, we examined the root growth and P uptake of wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L.), canola (<jats:italic>Brassica napus</jats:italic> L.), and narrow‐leaf lupin (<jats:italic>Lupinus angustifolius</jats:italic> L.) in a split‐root system and in columns with deep (19 cm) or shallow (5 cm) P fertiliser sources in glasshouse conditions. In the split‐root system, plants of all three species grown under heterogeneous soil P conditions absorbed more P and produced greater root and shoot biomass than those under homogeneous P supply. Root plasticity differed between species under heterogeneous soil P supply: canola and wheat allocated relatively more root biomass and root length to the high P zone than narrow‐leaf lupin. In the column experiment, there was no difference in the amount of P accumulated in shoots of any crops grown in the deep <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic> shallow P fertiliser treatments. Root proliferation occurred within the shallow and deep‐P fertiliser bands in all three species; however, root distribution above or below the bands did not differ between deep or shallow P fertiliser treatments in any species. Whilst root plasticity responses to heterogeneous soil P supply differed among species, root architecture (fibrous <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic> taproot) did not confer any advantage or disadvantage to the acquisition of P from deep <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic> shallow P fertiliser bands. Moreover, whilst roots proliferate in the vicinity of P fertiliser bands, root distribution outside of the bands appears to remain unaltered in both fibrous and tap‐rooted crops during early growth.</jats:p>",

There was a progressive increase in the rate of starch synthesis, decrease in the rate of starch degradation, decrease of malate and fumarate, decrease of the protein content and decrease of the relative growth rate. Carbohydrate and amino acids levels at the end of the night did not change. Activities of enzymes involved in photosynthesis, starch and sucrose synthesis and inorganic nitrogen assimilation remained high, whereas five of eight enzymes from glycolysis and organic acid metabolism showed a significant decrease of activity on a protein basis. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity increased. In a 2 h photoperiod, the total protein content and most enzyme activities decreased strongly, starch synthesis was inhibited, and sugars and amino acids levels rose at the end of the night and growth was completely inhibited. The rate of starch degradation correlated with the protein content and the relative growth rate across all the photoperiod treatments. It is discussed how a close coordination of starch turnover, the protein content and growth allows <jats:italic>Arabidopsis</jats:italic> to avoid carbon starvation, even in very short photoperiods.</jats:p>",
