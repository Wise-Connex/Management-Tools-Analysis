This study concentrated on the period 1971 thru 1985, and took a more general look at the period 1986 thru the year 2000. Insofar as possible, this paper will be confined to domestic gas supply and the period 1971 thru 1985.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Although oil supply and gas supply were studied by two separate Task Groups, there was a great deal of cooperation between the two groups. Time will not permit a long discussion of the computer program which was developed for the oil and gas study as a joint program which was developed for the oil and gas study as a joint endeavor of both Task Groups. However, it should be made clear that this program is not an econometric model solving for a price-supply relationship. The program has no internal optimizing price-supply relationship. The program has no internal optimizing logic or mechanisms by which it can relate calculated economic results to investor motivation or incentives. The computer program was developed in order to facilitate the processing of program was developed in order to facilitate the processing of data and for making a large number of repetitive calculations.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The study was performed on a geographic region-by-region basis, taking into account variations in drilling and finding experience and, of course, costs. The regional results were subsequently combined to present total U. S. results. Three different levels of drilling activity were assumed and combined with two levels of success in findings. This led to a great many calculations and made some type of computer program the only feasible method of operation.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Within the computer program, oil supply - including associated-dissolved gas and plant liquids - and related economics were calculated for the lower 48 states plus southern Alaska. Non-associated gas supply, including lease and plant liquids, and related economics were computed for only the lower 48 states. Projections of North Slope oil and gas and southern Alaska Projections of North Slope oil and gas and southern Alaska non-associated gas operations were made independently rather than thru the computer program.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Under the conditions of stepwise changes of the perfusion pressure the following localization of \"autoregulatory\" responses of the cerebral arteries has been found: changes in the inlet pressure of the internal carotid artery produced corresponding changes of its vascular resistance resulting in a relative constancy of the outlet pressure of the artery, i.e., pressure in the circle of Willis; resistance changes in the smaller brain arteries were evident only when the alterations of the perfusion pressure were too big and the major arteries were unable to eliminate the disturbance. The responses of the internal carotid arteries were eliminated when their muscular layer was maintained normal, but deprived of the nervous control (when the arteries were continuously perfused with blood or oxygenated Ringer-Krebs bicarbonate solution shortly after the death of the animal). Thus, evidence was obtained that the vascular responses were brought about by a nervous and not by a purely muscular mechanism, as is usually assumed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Three experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of shading and water supply on growth and nitrogen fixation by young plants of <jats:italic>Lupinus arboreus</jats:italic> (up to 4 months old). Firstly, two light treatments, 20,000 and 6500 lux, were given under controlled environment conditions, and plants sampled weekly for 7 weeks. Secondly, four shading treatments (100%, 37%, 19% and 10% full daylight) were given to plants grown outside and samples taken after 4, 8 and 10 weeks. Thirdly, response to and recovery from moisture stress were investigated under controlled‐environment conditions.</jats:p><jats:p>Results from the two shading experiments showed that <jats:italic>L. arboreus</jats:italic> responds to shade as a typical mesophyte. Growth (measured as dry weight) was proportional to the logarithm of relative irradiance. Roots were affected more than shoots and hence the shoot: root ratio rose with increased shading. Water content varied with age and shading, the responses differing amongst different parts of the plant. Photosynthetic efficiency increased with moderate shading but decreased, as did relative growth rate, at 10% full daylight. The compensation point was estimated to be 7–8% full daylight (approximately 70 J cm<jats:sup>‐2</jats:sup> day<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup>).</jats:p><jats:p>Nodule number and weight were reduced by shading. There was a highly significant linear relationship between root and nodule dry weights, I g root tissue supporting 50 mg nodule tissue. Acetylene‐reducing activity per plant was also proportional to log relative irradiance and this was largely accounted for by the smaller amounts of nodule tissue formed under shade. Activity per milligram fresh weight was only slightly reduced by moderate shading and this probably resulted from increased vacuolation of the infected cells. Only severe shading (10% full daylight) had a marked effect on activity per milligram fresh weight. Nodule senescence was not observed under shade, since the amount of nodule tissue formed was in equilibrium with growth of other parts of the plant. N content was higher in shaded plants after 1 week, but the difference diminished with time until at 5 weeks the N content was the same in shaded and control plants.</jats:p><jats:p>Response to and recovery from moisture stress were similar to those reported for other species. Seedlings were grown on the fine sand taken from forests where <jats:italic>L. arboreus</jats:italic> is planted in New Zealand. In this sand the change from sufficient water to severe deficit occurs over a very small range of water contents (1.0–0.5% DW). Shaded plants responded to similar levels of stress as unshaded plants. Water potentials of leaves measured with a pressure bomb were correlated with acetylene‐reducing activity of nodules.</jats:p>",
