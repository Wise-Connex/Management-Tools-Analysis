In total amount, oilseed protein production is comparable to world production of protein in red meat and in milk. All oilseed and fish meal protein byproducts and some milk protein byproducts find their greatest use in animal and poultry products production. Increased demand for the latter products with concurrent demand for feed protein has shifted the relative values of oil and meal. Increasingly, oilseed production, like meat production, is producing oil as a coproduct, if not a byproduct, of protein production. Although food use of oilseed protein concentrates is increasing, both as fortificants of traditional foods and in newly developed meat analogs, this market appears unlikely to increase demand for protein concentrates as much as the world demand for increase in animal and poultry products.</jats:p>",

Apportioning the available reservoir storage between these interests requires a compromise since their storage requirements are in direct conflict. The lack of a suitable basis for optimizing this apportionment has led to the use of a ‘satisficing’ model in which priority has been given to water supply: rules were then developed to optimize the operation of the reservoirs with respect to the secondary purpose, flood alleviation, provided the primary purpose is fulfilled to a predetermined standard. The resulting control policy is being applied to the River Dee system in Wales, which comprises two multipurpose reservoirs and one direct supply reservoir.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT. New Jersey, together with other states in the northeast, was stricken with drought during 1961‐66. The effect of this drought was most severe in the northern part of the State. The water quality of the Passaic River, which drains the urban, industrialized northeast, perhaps deteriorated the most among the major drainage systems. This river system is used as a raw‐water source by 10 water suppliers. The impact of the drought upon the water supply of the Passaic Valley Water Commission, the most downstream of the basin's suppliers, which supplies an average of about 90 million gallons a day to more than 650,000 persons, is evaluated herein. The drought's impact on the raw‐water quality is appraised by the comparison of before‐and‐after qualities of dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, biochemical‐oxygen demand, turbidity, and hardness. For example, at the worst point during the drought, monthly average dissolved‐solids content in the raw water were about 210 percent, hardness, about 167 percent, and biochemical‐oxygen demand about 270 percent higher than antecedent values. In general, the study concludes that the drought produced a deterioration in both raw and finished water quality, and is estimated to have increased chemical‐treatment costs during the drought by about $650,000.</jats:p>",
