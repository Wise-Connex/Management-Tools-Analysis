Irrigation was applied as a main treatment and nitrogen as nitrochalk was applied either as a top dressing alone or with the subsequent addition of urea as a foliar spray at anthesis. Both high‐lysine barleys and Bomi showed a greater yield response to irrigation than the other varieties but did not differ in their response to nitrogen. On average, the high‐lysine barleys yielded as well as the normal varieties Bomi and Maris Mink but had a higher content of protein in the grain and of lysine in the protein, resulting in substantially higher yields of protein and lysine per hectare.</jats:p>",
