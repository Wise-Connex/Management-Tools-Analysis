All accepted the distinction, that had come down from Adam Smith, between market value and ‘natural’ or normal value, natural value depending on cost of production, market value on supply and demand. Market value would ‘tend’ towards natural value by adjustment of supply. It was accordingly held, for nearly a century after Smith, that natural values were the only values that required attention. The whole of Ricardo's system, to take the most important example, runs in terms of natural values. The chief thing which happened at the ‘marginal revolution’ of Jevons and his contemporaries was a shift of attention to market values. They were determined, it was accepted, by supply and demand. This chapter addresses the question of just how market worked.</jats:p>",

The 206 mines and deposits evaluated in 30 market economy countries (MECs) contain an estimated 35.1 billion tonnes of recoverable phosphate rock (demonstrated resource level). US resources are sufficient to satisfy both the domestic market and an export market for phosphate products well beyond 2000. Resource depletion at current producers, however, means new property development (with higher costs) will be required if US production levels are to be maintained. Existing worldwide capacity can satisfy expected demand through the early 1990s. Expansion at existing mines or low demand growth could mean no new property development is required before the late 1990s. Worldwide, almost $8 billion could be required for the development of new phosphate rock properties between now and 2000, given 3% annual growth in demand. Though profit may not be the principal motivation for development of government‐owned operations, most properties that could develop in the 1990s would require price increases of 20–50% to break even. To earn a 15% rate of return on investment, prices must rise to nearly double the $23–271 tonne US price level of 1988. Current US phosphate rock and phosphoric acid producers appear to be competitive (on a variable cost basis) with many other suppliers in major markets. New US properties will have higher variable costs than current producers; however, they are competitive with most projected new foreign development. The US phosphoric acid industry will most likely face increased competition as more of the foreign phosphate rock producers develop the capacity to process rock into phosphoric acid and other fertilizer products.</jats:p>",

The requirement for dental services was found to be increasing due to population growth and higher per capita demand due to decreased edentulism. The supply of dental services was found to be mildly decreasing due to balanced supplementation and attrition processes and subtle sex ratio and age distribution changes among dentists. The resulting market excess, even after consideration of idle capacity and transfer of services supplied to dental therapists, provides a marked contrast to many, but not all, developed countries. It also offers an opportunity to shape occupational and specialty distribution to the advantage of dental professions and the public.</jats:p>",

This comment extends and corrects some of the issues addressed by Oosterhaven. We derive the characteristics which industry production relations must possess to be consistent with the implied changes in industry inputs and outputs when supply‐side input‐output models are employed for impact analysis. First, it is shown that an implicit assumption is the characteristic of perfect substitutability among all inputs in each industry production function. This is the polar opposite of the Leontief assumption of zero elasticity of factor substitution among all inputs, and is very unrealistic for large changes from the initially observed solution since it implies that all inputs are non‐essential in the production process and that any input can be substituted for all others simultaneously. Second, it is shown that the model may still be reasonable for approximating the effect of small changes since the implied production relation may be interpreted as a cost minimizing choice for a standard constant‐returns‐to‐scale production function linearized around the initial solution under the assumption that relative prices are unchanged. Under this alternative interpretation, the supply‐side model may be expected to provide a reasonable approximation, useful for analyzing changes in the neighborhood of the initial solution, but would appear to be inappropriate for analyzing large changes.</jats:p>",
