      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s business environment, many companies want to become efficient and flexible, but have struggled, in part, because they have not been able to formulate optimal supply chain strategies. Often this is as a result of insufficient knowledge about the costs involved in maintaining supply chains and the impact of the supply chain on their operations. Hence, these companies find it difficult to manufacture at a competitive cost and respond quickly and reliably to market demand. Mismatched strategies are the root cause of the problems that plague supply chains, and supply-chain strategies based on a one-size-fits-all strategy often fail. The purpose of this article is to suggest instruments to determine an optimal supply chain strategy. This article, which is conceptual in nature, provides a review of current supply chain strategies and suggests a framework for determining an optimal strategy.</jats:p>"

However, South African automotive components manufacturers (ACMs) are not internationally competitive and automotive assemblers, also known as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), often import cheaper components from abroad. All parties in the South African automotive supply chains need each other to ensure optimal efficiency and competitiveness. Furthermore, it is vital that good relationships exist between customers and suppliers in the automotive supply chains in South Africa. ACMs are central to automotive supply chains. A survey was conducted among ACMs to determine the nature of relationships that exist between buyers and suppliers in South Africa’s automotive supply chains. The results showed that collaborative relationships do indeed exist between members of the supply chain but that communication, understanding of the parties’ situations and cooperation can improve this relationship and so create total alliance between OEMs and ACMs.</jats:p>"

Titanium’s extensive use in aerospace applications ensures that the aerospace market is the main driver of titanium metal demand. South Africa is the second largest titanium producer in the world after Australia. The abundance of titanium in South Africa together with the growing demand has led it to be identified as a beneficiation priority in a collaborative government initiative, called Titanium Beneficiation Initiative (TBI).

To achieve sustainable competitive advantage, five basic steps in supply chain management i.e. plan, source, make, deliver and return as discussed earlier should be conducted and evaluated carefully and continuously. SCM should take into consideration the choice of strategic partnerships not only based on the most efficient and effective cost structure but also the legal aspect of the supplier to avoid the company being shut down by the government.

The demand for variety\nmay soon become unmanageable, and several companies are addressing this trend by adopting a system\nof mass customization. One project, Knit on Demand, has been conducted by the Swedish School of Textiles in\nclose collaboration with a knitting company and a retailer of tailored fashion in Stockholm. Production and sales\nof customized products pose logistical challenges for the companies involved, including the one-piece flow through\nalmost the entire supply chain and the demand for short lead times in an otherwise slow environment, adding\nto the cost of manufacturing mass customized garments. Customization has logistical benefits such as minimised\ninventory; hence, high inventory turnover and the possibility of fast response to meet customer demand. The Knit\non Demand concept can be considered as leagile because it comprises both lean and agile components. It is lean\nin the manufacturing stage upstream and agile downstream to better respond to customer demand on the market.</jats:italic>\n\t\t\t\t</jats:p>",

The primary motivation for this research is to help ensure that Canadian mineral producers will achieve reduced production costs through improvements in the efficiency with which they consume energy resources. Heat has not yet been considered for the mining sector in an integrated manner, which makes polygeneration of great interest. The methodology that optimizes configuration of polygeneration systems for mine sites has not been reported before. The variety of mining circumstances, temporal variations in energy prices, institutional inertia, and conservatism in design for mines are some of the reasons for this. This paper reviews some aspects of precedent energy management practice in mineral operations, which highlights energy challenges characteristic of the sector and sets out the initial formulation of optimal mine site energy supply. The review indicates the additional benefits of energy supply systems for mine sites that concurrently meet all utilities.</jats:p>"

In order to achieve the optimised level of integration of the whole supply chain, the industry has responded in various forms. This paper will discuss different initiatives by the researchers,construction industry,and the UK government in order to achieve optimal level of supply chain integration. This paper will discuss the concept of aggregation,and also look at other supply chain integration related concepts including client-led supply chain, knowledge about the whole supply chain, effects of procurement on integration of supply chain, etc. The paper will give a brief overview and initial findings of a project undertaken by the authors, and also include examples from the UK construction industry on bundling of the supply and demand.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this paper  is to examine existing research in an effort to understand the potential effects of transaction costs on the vertical  coordination of a supply chain. The paper arrives at many insights into how supply chains are organized under  different governance structures. These insights can certainly be shared via the development and introduction of  related propositions. The conceptual typology of contractual relations developed herein can help researchers  better understand the scope of both the problems and the opportunities associated with supply management. It  will be of value, therefore, not only to researchers who desire to expand their research into this area, but also to  those who have already investigated this topic in isolation or with limited scope. </jats:p>",

Individuals who are not economically challenged consume above the annual per capita of 40 kg in contrast to a poor individuals living in rural areas, who consume less than the per capita vegetables. The study sought to describe the performance of vegetable vegetables supply chain in Swaziland. A descriptive research design was used in the study and data were collected using personal interviews from 100 randomly selected vegetable farmers. Data were analysed using market margins and marketing channel analysis to identify existing marketing channels used by vegetable farmers. The revealed marketing channels that producers used to obtain attractive prices and a higher share of the consumer price. The largest producer’s share was obtained through direct sale to consumers. Channels that included restaurants had high total gross margins and low producer’s share of the consumer price. The concern for issues on post-harvest and marketing should form an integral part of policy development and research programmes and also the public and private sectors should facilitate contractual arrangements for vegetables farmers. Commercialising vegetable production should not be overemphasised because it encourages farmers to be market oriented as opposed to production oriented. Farmers need to form cooperatives in order to assist in bargaining of prices within the vegetable supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Shifts in the relative importance of these can tell us much about the changing supply options open to grocery retailers, but much more is revealed by a detailed examination of the business networks through which individual shopkeepers connected into these wider systems of supply. Drawing on network theory and new institutional economics, the chapter assesses the nature and durability of business relationships, and the role played by reputation and trust in establishing and maintaining such links. This provides a clearer insight the ability of established systems of supply to match growing demand with increasingly global networks of trade.</jats:p>",

Approaches to this challenge are necessarily synthetic, spanning wide ranges in spatial and temporal scales. Here a conventional sediment transport theory used by engineers and sedimentologists at reach and channel scales is applied at the basin scale. Specifically, a straightforward expression proposed by Bagnold and modified accordingly predicts the observed importance of combined wetness and steepness of a source basin as a control of sediment supply to the sea. The reasonable, key assumption underlying the application of sediment transport theory in this context is that the river‐mouth sites for which suspended‐sediment loads are reported are alluviated, and thus characterized by transport‐limited flux of sediment. This analysis also indicates the potential significance of additional, as yet poorly documented factors constraining sediment supply to the sea. These factors, some of which appear to covary systematically with climate, include river‐profile concavity, river‐mouth channel width and friction, and the characteristic size of sediment in transport.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The goal of this research is the derivation of the method for evaluation of efficiency improvement potential for public water supply systems with a focus on centrifugal network pumps. The efficiency of proportional pressure control usage has been analyzed for variable speed pumps. It has been done if proportional pressure control is used in comparison with constant pressure control mode. For this reason, energy calculation analyses have been realized for variable speed centrifugal pumps, and the theoretical tool of estimation of the efficiency improvement potential for public water supply systems has been derived. The conclusions are as follows: (1) it has been found that 1110 MWh of annually consumed electrical energy can be saved up, if the control mode of variable speed network pumps will be changed from constant pressure to proportional pressure control mode with the deviation of 20% from head value of duty point at zero flow; (2) about 13 MWh of annually consumed electrical energy can be saved up, if the proportional pressure control mode with the deviation of 15% will be changed to the deviation of 20%; (3) totally about 1123 MWh or 1.12 GWh (14% of the annually consumed electrical energy by variable speed network pumps) can be saved up in small public water supply systems in Latvia.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most air handling units (AHUs) in commercial buildings have an air economizer cycle for free cooling under certain outside air conditions. During the economizer cycle, the outside air and return air dampers are modulated to seek supply air temperature at its setpoint. The supply air temperature is typically set at 13 °C (55 °F) to control humidity in the space. However, dehumidification is not necessary when the outside air is dry. Meanwhile, the space may have less cooling load due to envelope heat loss and/or occupant schedule changes. These facts provide an opportunity to use higher supply air temperature to reduce or eliminate mechanical cooling and terminal box reheat. On the other hand, a higher supply air temperature requires increased air flow as well as fan power. Therefore, an optimization question was formed, through which an optimal supply air temperature is identified to minimize total energy consumption. In our previous studies, through simulation, 90% of energy savings were concluded and a universal control sequence was also proposed for implementing the optimal control strategy. In this paper, experiments were conducted to validate the previously documented theory concerning the optimal supply air temperature reset. The previously recommended universal control sequence is implemented into the building automation system for an air-handling unit control to make the program ready for the next step of verifying energy savings previously simulated. This paper presents optimization control system setup and experimental results showing the program tuning procedures, through which the program is ready for the next step.</jats:p>",

It promotes aims which are, arguably, secondary to the primary aim of procurement. For the exploration, a conceptual analytical approach was employed and some of the key guiding pillars of public procurement in South Africa divulged. The challenges restraining effective and efficient implementation of public procurement are also revealed. The article concludes by recommending the development of competency through customised (separate) training materials and programmes, the involvement of stakeholders in the bidding process and the employment of good strategic sourcing practices.</jats:p>"

Responses indicate the development of an awareness of the importance of values and vision in order to establish effective leadership practices through the leadership development programme. Research confirmed the importance of vision as a key driver in operational leadership in this context. Further skill development is required on how to align personal values and vision with that of the organisation (department) within which operational employees function.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although fisheries production and seafood trade are global in scope, with billions of dollars in exports, the rebuilding of collapsed fisheries often focus on national fisheries policy and management measures, with little attention to global supply chains and international consumer markets. Even with two moratoria and two decades of policy changes since the Northern Gulf cod fisheries collapsed in eastern Canada, rebuilding has stalled and the fishing industry and coastal communities continue to undergo challenges with economic viability and resource sustainability. This paper examines and analyzes the global supply chain and marketing dimension of Northern Gulf cod fisheries. Drawing upon fisheries bioeconomics and governance theory, a pre- and post-collapse analysis is undertaken to understand key drivers and institutional mechanisms along global fish supply chains for an effective and successful rebuilding. Findings indicate that the collapse of the cod fishery has cascading effects that go beyond ecosystem changes to new harvesting activities, industry restructuring, supply chain reorganization, new global markets and consumer preference for certified seafood. This suggests that a holistic rebuilding approach is necessary, one that integrates institutional and behavioral changes for both producers and consumers at various scales of fisheries production, political economy issues, as well as cross-scale policies on marine conservation and regional economic development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>South Africa has had a policy of competitive tendering for the provision of public transport services (subsidised commuter bus services) since the mid-1980s. Although this policy approach was conceptualised by the previous government, prior to the transfer of political power in 1994, it was reaffirmed in a 1996 White Paper on National Transport Policy. Despite the nearly 25 years that have passed since the intention to tender services, only about 32% of the subsidy budget is currently spent on some form of contracting. The majority of services are still operated on authorisations (interim contracts) which formalised services that operators were operating pre-1994. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the reasons why public transport contracting policy progress has been so slow in South Africa. The paper relies on an extensive study that was conducted regarding policy implementation obstacles in general, as well as a questionnaire survey among the subsidised commuter bus operators to solicit their views on the reasons for the delay in the implementation of the contracting system in the country. The findings of the survey indicate that the major issues hindering the implementation of the contracting system are to be found in a lack of funding, lack of capacity to implement policy and major operational issues in the permit offices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>La logistica č importante sia per la sua incidenza diretta sul Pil nazionale sia, in modo indiretto, nel consentire una maggiore o minore competitivitŕ del sistema-paese. La complessiva debolezza del sistema logistico italiano, documentata da varie fonti interne e internazionali, ha numerose cause: inadeguatezze nelle infrastrutture di trasporto a lungo raggio, ma anche dei raccordi di \"ultimo miglio\"; frammentazione e scarsa integrazione tra gli operatori; inefficienze localizzate nelle singole modalitŕ di trasporto; problemi nei raccordi tra i vettori di diverso tipo (ossia nell'intermodalitŕ); carenze programmatorie e normative. Il presente lavoro approfondisce queste tematiche mediante un'indagine condotta presso un campione di spedizionieri italiani. Per quanto attiene alle infrastrutture, gli operatori riterrebbero utile il completamento degli assi ferroviari in grado di connettere il paese alle principali direttrici di traffico europee, nonché di assicurare un efficace collegamento fra il Nord e il Sud del paese, ma anche un potenziamento dei raccordi locali con altri tipi di vettori, specie quello marittimo. Altri problemi risiedono negli allacci delle aree portuali alla viabilitŕ ordinaria e nell'insoddisfacente funzionamento dei nessi intermodali tra le diverse forme di trasporto. I centri logistici vengono ritenuti nel complesso sufficienti, anche se si riscontrano problemi circa l'eccessiva frammentazione e la distribuzione sul territorio. Tariffe del trasporto, durata e prevedibilitŕ dei tempi, efficienza e affidabilitŕ degli operatori sarebbero nel complesso sufficienti, a eccezione del comparto ferroviario. L'organizzazione della catena logistica risente di una scarsa programmazione delle attivitŕ, dell'insufficiente integrazione tra gli operatori e della loro eccessiva frammentazione. Le dotazioni informatiche degli operatori e il ricorso all'ICT vengono giudicate nel complesso sufficienti, ma č carente l'integrazione dei sistemi tra i diversi operatori, con conseguenze negative sul trattamento complessivo del ciclo della merce e sulla tracciabilitŕ delle spedizioni. Dall'indagine sono emerse anche diverse indicazioni di policy. In primo luogo, gli operatori chiedono di razionalizzare il quadro normativo, di rilanciare liberalizzazioni e concorrenza e di concentrare le risorse su un contenuto novero di obiettivi infrastrutturali realizzabili. In secondo luogo, gli operatori stessi potrebbero contribuire alla concentrazione e razionalizzazione dell'offerta. Infine, le Associazioni di categoria nazionali e locali dovrebbero stimolare l'integrazione dei diversi sistemi di ICT e promuovere il rispetto di standard minimi di servizio.</jats:p>",

Six cost elements are included as externality cost items, namely, costs related to accidents, emissions, roadway land availability, policing, noise and congestion. Inputs in the calculations were a gravity-oriented freight flow model, a road transport cost model, actual transport costs for other modes, a warehousing cost survey, an inventory delay calculation and various national sources of information such as accident statistics and government budgets. Estimation techniques resulted in advances for externality cost measurement in South Africa. The quantification of the cost elements will be used to update the South African Freight Demand Model. The results show that the cost of transportation would have been 20% more if external factors were taken into account. The marginal rates of externalities can be used to develop scenarios based on alternative choices for South Africa's freight transport infrastructure configuration.</jats:p>"

Professionals from executive offices, HSE, procurement, logistics, operations, and risk management need to take four major steps to ensure a safe supply chain: 1) Establish governance &amp; organization to ensure organizational accountability for governance and management of supply chain risk, by appointing a supply chain czar and engaging crossfunctional stakeholders; 2) Adopt an internationally accepted top-level supply chain risk management framework and articulate first-level principles, including a policy on single sourcing; 3) Universally adopt formal \"reinforcing\" metrics and measurement systems, including measurement of supply chain risk, Total Cost methodologies, and quantification of the cost of supplier non-compliance; and 4) Extend supply chain strategy and policies to suppliers by scanning for suppliers that excel in HSE, setting supplier expectations and targets, training suppliers, and establishing mechanisms to hold them accountable including periodic audits.</jats:p>",

Traditional engineering and operations management modeling approaches have primarily focused on technical issues and are not well suited to effectively capture the many complex structural and behavioral aspects of supply chain systems (SCSs). There is growing recognition by the supply chain community of the significant benefits a network analytic lens can provide to understand, design, and manage SCSs. We systematically review and analyze the relevant literature and, drawing on a multidisciplinary theoretical foundation, develop an integrative framework. Our framework identifies three distinct, but interdependent themes that characterize the study of SCSs: SCS network structure (i.e., system architecture), SCS network dynamics (i.e., system behavior), and SCS network strategy (i.e., system policy and control). We elaborate on these themes, review key findings, identify the current limitations and knowledge gaps, and discuss the fundamental benefits derived from adopting an integrated SCSs perspective. We conclude with future research directions for network analysis in SCS design and management, in particular, and complex enterprise systems, in general. ©2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper, we attempt to reconcile both findings. We show that happiness and work hours exhibit an inverse U‐shaped relation – working longer raises the level of happiness, as long as the total working time is not too long. Hence, working can be beneficial for happiness and, at the same time, it can exert a disutility at the margin.</jats:p>",

Based on Nash bargaining game, the pricing strategy of production wastes under the condition of limited capacity is proposed to realize the optimal interrelated supply chain system.

Out of these samples, 600 digesters using energy crops only and 80 digesters using waste substrates were selected to compare the chemical composition as a result of different substrate feeding. High variations in element concentrations were found in both groups. In 60 plants with low micronutrient levels, trace elements were added and process changes were observed. A significant decrease of volatile fatty acids and an increase in digester performance were measured after trace element application. Furthermore, an increase of bacterial biomass could be detected.</jats:p>",

Modular designs of tree-shaped water supply piping system, such as 2 by N array include water cisterns of water closet in public toilets, washbasin taps in schools are commonly found in building complexes. Potable water demands in water systems serving built environment are unsteady, random and intermittent. However, the existing statistical Hunter-based probabilistic approaches to pipe sizing, however, do not consider the minimization of pumping energy for water distribution through proper selection of pipe radii.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper demonstrates a pipe sizing method with probabilistic demands for optimizing pipe friction energy loss constrained by the fixed pipeline volume. A mathematical model for pumping energy optimization in infinite tree-shape water supply piping networks for probabilistic demands is proposed. Compared with the Hunter’s based probabilistic approach in sizing an 8-section tree-shape water supply network for demand of probabilities 0.1 and 0.2, the proposed method offers reduction potentials of pipe friction energy loss of 12% and 43% respectively. With piping systems of pipe radius ratios, the optimal tree-shape networks are also determined.</jats:p>",

We hypothesized that other genes in the dNTP supply system would compensate for such p53R2 losses and looked for this in our own data and in data of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We found that the de novo dNTP supply system compensates for p53R2 losses with increases in RNR subunit R1, R2, or both. We also found compensatory increases in cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) and in mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), all of the salvage dNTP supply system; in contrast, the remaining mitochondrial salvage enzyme thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) decreased with p53 loss. Thus, TK2 may be more dedicated to meeting mitochondrial dNTP demands than dGK which may be more obligated to assist cytosolic dNTP supply in meeting nuclear DNA dNTP demands.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this paper is to examine the causal linkages between operational routines and L&amp;SC competencies of Chinese logistics service providers (LSPs).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>A conceptual model on the relationships between operational routines and L&amp;SC competencies was developed based on RBV. In total, 76 valid responses from a survey of Chinese LSPs provided the empirical data for the testing of the formulated hypotheses. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to develop the constructs for the model and hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to test the hypothesized relationships.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Not all operational routines were drivers of L&amp;SC competencies in the Chinese logistics market. Processes for increasing responsiveness are most important in contributing to building positioning, distribution support and agility competencies. Processes for increasing flexibility are only effective in developing positioning competency, while performance benchmarking has little contribution to competency building in the Chinese market. ICT support strengthens the relationship between performance benchmarking and distribution support, but weakens that between processes for increasing flexibility and distribution support as well as that between processes for increasing responsiveness and agility.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>This study raises more questions than it attempts to answer, opening up a number of horizons for further research into the logistics market of China.

Powerful scheduling techniques are the key support for supply chains’ agility. Based on the discontinuous schedulable periods of suppliers, an agile supply chain static scheduling under schedulable periods (ASCSSSP) of multiple optional suppliers for each part is studied. According to the final product’s supplying BOM, this paper sets up a structural framework model for agile supply chains firstly, then analyzes and builds a mathematic model for the task assignment and schedule optimization of ASCSSSP with the supply-demand time and quantity constraints, and especially designs a novel heuristic algorithm of Task Adjusted by Cost (TAC) to solve the model. Finally, by some numerical experiments, the efficiency and practicability of the model and algorithm is verified by contrasting analysis.</jats:p>"

The objective of this paper is to explore the framework required to design a controller that regulates server CPU temperatures by specifying the supply air temperature of the CRAC. The controller will be an addition to the existing controller used by the CRAC to regulate supply air temperatures. In the discrete-time domain, implementation and the performance of the modified integral action controller is analyzed and other important parameters are compared. As a preliminary attempt, the controller will be designed for a standard 44U cabinet with 42 “1U” servers, where the machines will execute a prescribed compute load variation: (1) step increase in all compute loads and (2) scaled down representation for a rack of servers using utilization trends from one of Google’s data centers. Ultimately, the development of this controller is motivated by the growing interest in Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) where the IT level and facility level information are both used to intelligently plan and manage resources of a data center.</jats:p>",

From micro‐data on self‐reported customer and supplier data of firms in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, we measure the distances between firm pairs, that is, the distance to the main supplier and the distance to the main customer for the surveyed firms. The distances to suppliers and customers are shorter for indigenous firms in these Southeast Asian countries; but the arm's length differs across countries. The distance between firm pairs differs widely across firms within narrowly defined industries and countries. We find that both firm‐level transaction costs and capabilities affect the distances between customers and suppliers. The distance to suppliers is longer for firms that have accepted guest engineers from the main supplier to maintain production processes. Further, we find that the distances to suppliers and customers are longer for firms that have undertaken organisational change or improved marketing practices.</jats:p>",

Then send a precise control quantity into the PID regulator to control output frequency of the frequency converter after a series of fuzzy arithmetic and solution of fuzzy arithmetic, so as to achieve the purpose of pump speed and consumed power controlling. The operating principle of variable frequency and constant pressure water supply system and the design procedures of software programming are elaborated. Practical application shows that the variable frequency and constant pressure water supply system based on fuzzy control has good effect on energy saving and obvious economic benefits and is worth popularizing and applying.</jats:p>"

We explored dynamic trajectories of daily fecundity, egg size, and egg fertility in three size classes of Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville produced by varying larval access to food, eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller. Adult pairs were held with ad libitum food and eggs were collected daily, counted, and a subsample measured. Egg fertility declined steeply over 25 clutches in small females, gradually in large females, but remained relatively stable in medium females. In small females, egg size and daily fecundity declined in a linear manner. There was no clear indication of an egg size-number tradeoff. In medium females, both egg size and daily fecundity peaked around the 16th day of oviposition, after which both declined. Large females began oviposition earlier and achieved peak egg size about day 7, and peak fecundity around day 12. Large females thus expressed a larger proportion of their reproductive effort early in adult life, a strategy inferred to be adaptive in the context of aphidophagy; a larger proportion of progeny would develop early in the exponential growth phase of the prey population when food is most abundant. Increases in egg size during this period may improve the survival of later-developing progeny; prey become scarce as aphid outbreaks decline and competition intensifies, favoring offspring with a larger body size at eclosion. Larval diet restriction appeared to constrain these presumably adaptive changes in egg size and daily fecundity, largely through effects on maternal body size.</jats:p>",

This article argues that the emphasis of these programs varies significantly depending on stakeholder involvement and issue areas under examination. Corporate-influenced programs are more likely to emphasize detection of violations of minimal standards in the areas of wages, hours, and occupational safety and health because focusing on these issues provides corporations with legitimacy and reduces the risks of uncertainty created by activist campaigns. In contrast, these programs are less likely to emphasize workers’ rights to form democratic and independent unions, bargain, and strike because these rights are perceived as lessening managerial control without providing firms with significant reputational value. This argument is explored by coding 805 factory audits of the Fair Labor Association between 2002 and 2010, followed by case studies of Russell Athletic in Honduras, Apple in China, and worker rights monitoring in Vietnam. </jats:p>",

A container market segmentation approach is used to project growth for container volumes over a 30-year period for all origin and destination pairings on a geographical district level in an identified catchment area. The segmentation guides the decision on what type of facility is necessary to fulfil capacity requirements in the catchment area and will be used to determine the maximum space requirements for a future IICT. Alternative sites are ranked from most suitable to least suitable using multi-criteria analysis, and preferred locations are identified. Currently, South Africa’s freight movement is dominated by the road sector. Heavy road congestion is thus prevalent at the Cape Town Container Terminal (CTCT). The paper proposes three possible alternative sites for an IICT that will focus on a hub-and-spoke system of transporting freight.</jats:p>"

At the landscape level, the implications for China of the regulation of plant genetic resources through various international treaties and conventions are reviewed in the light of the evolution of the global seed industry. At the regime level, the transition in the Chinese context to market-based seed supply and the development of commercial and public seed sectors are examined. The study then analyses trends in seed supply at the niche level, with reference to participatory maize (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.) breeding in three provinces in southwest China where high rural poverty persists. This work offers radical novelty in variety development and seed provision on behalf of smallholder farmers. However, a series of technical, organizational and market ‘mismatches’ are demonstrated within the existing seed regime. The participatory work emphasizes breeding for diverse cultivars adapted to specific ecosystems but these are prevented from reaching commercial markets by existing varietal testing procedures. Participatory breeding has potential to address farmers’ varietal needs as agriculture modernises and to support the public function of research institutes, but within mainstream intellectual property regimes the public value of participatory breeding cannot be accommodated adequately. Yet, when coupled to institutional innovations for recognising intellectual property and sharing benefit among all those who contribute, participatory breeding may initiate a powerful dynamics for change within seed regimes and a <jats:italic>sui generis</jats:italic> seed system suited to the Chinese context.</jats:p>",

Structured questionnaires and past literature were used as sources of data. The primary data included road networks, number of trips per day by operators, operating speed, and purpose of travel, passengers' security, tricycle speed, and waiting time. The study was conducted by using two questionnaires: one for the operators and the other for tricycle users. The total number of completed questionnaires for the survey was 100 for operators and 229 for users. The sampling technique used was random sampling from several zones of the study area. Data were analysed using percentage and Chi-square statistical techniques for testing the hypotheses with the Minitab 11.0 version package. The study found that 92% of operators reported a high level of road network deterioration, and 61% reported making 9-12 trips per day. The hypothesis test was used to study people's feelings about the attributes of the service provided for paratransit users, such as affordability, regularity, comfort and safety. It was found that there is no significant difference at the 5% level between the various categories of these respondents.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, high level of medium volume for consumption of abundant nutrient is needed for maximum mycelia growth. For EPS, a high agitation is needed to promote a good mass transfer for achieving high product concentrations recovery. The appropriate medium volume was found to be 150.4 mL for aiding to produce a secondary metabolite by promoting the mass transfer of substrates.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n\t\t\t\t<jats:p>The increase in natural gas consumption by the general public and industry development, in particular the petrochemical and chemical industries, has made increasing the world interest in using gas replacement for natural gas, both as mixtures of flammable gases and gas mixtures as LPG with air (SNG - Synthetic Natural Gas). Economic analysis in many cases prove that to ensure interchangeability of gas would cost less than the increase in pipeline capacity to deliver the same quantity of natural gas. In addition, SNG systems and installations, could be considered as investments to improve security and flexibility of gas supply. Known existing methods for determining the interchangeability of gases in gas gear based on Wobbe index, which determines the heat input and the burning rate tide, which in turn is related to flame stability. Exceeding the Wobbe index of a value increases the amount of carbon monoxide in the exhaust than the permissible concentration. Methods of determining the interchangeability of gases is characterized by a gas in relation to the above-described phenomena by means of quantitative indicators, or using diagrams interchangeability, where the gas is characterized by the position of a point in a coordinate system. The best known method for determining the interchangeability of gases is Delbourg method, in which the gas is characterized by the revised (expanded) Wobbe Index (<jats:italic>Wr</jats:italic>), the combustion potential, rate of soot formation (<jats:italic>Ich</jats:italic>) and the ratio of the formation of yellow ends (<jats:italic>Ij</jats:italic>). Universal way to determine the interchangeability of gas is also Weaver accounting method. It does not require determination of the reference gas. It is designed for utensils for household gas and gas pressure <jats:italic>p </jats:italic>= 1.25 kPa.</jats:p>\n\t\t\t\t<jats:p>The criteria and definition of gas interchangeability volatility in practice to the combustion in a gas gear. In the case of gas exchange in industrial furnaces, interchangeability criteria are usually not very useful because of other conditions of combustion and heat exchange. In industrial reheating furnace gas is combusted in a sealed combustion chambers. Air supply is regulated. The exhaust gases are discharged into canals and the chimney to the atmosphere. The temperature difference between load (fuel gas) and the flame is much less than in the case of gas household appliances. In the furnace heat exchange takes place mainly by radiation in 85% to 95%. The value of heat flux flowing from the gas to a heated charge is not proportional to the heat load burners. Interchangeability of gas is linked by adding to natural gas, a certain amount of gas that is a substitute for natural gas in meeting the criteria for substitution in order to ensure certainty of supply of natural gas to customers. Gases that can be used in the processes of blending and used as replacement gases are mainly a mixture of propane and propane - butane (LPG - Liquid Petroleum Gas), landfill gas or biogas (LFG - Landfill Gas) and dimethyl ether (DME). One of the more well-known gas mixtures used in many countries around the world to compensate for peak demands is a mixture containing about 75% of natural gas and approximately 25% propane / air (LPG / air). Also in Poland is prepared to amend the provisions in this regard (at this moment - oxygen in the gas network can not exceed 0.2%).</jats:p>\n\t\t\t\t<jats:p> In this paper, the calculations of interchangeability of gas mixtures LFG - LPG and LPG - air (SNG) for natural gas was made. It was determined whether the analyzed mixtures have similar stable flame zones regardless of the quality of LFG fuel and whether they may in whole or in part replace CH4, without any modification of equipment suction air for combustion. The obtained results will determine whether the fuel can be used as a replacement for natural gas used in such household appliances and, possibly, industrial burners. In connection with the possibility of changes in the quality of LFG, depending on such factors as storage time, as pre-treatment, will be determined the degree of interchangeability of LFG as a fuel mixed with regard to its quality.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Oxygen-deficient waters in the ocean, generally referred to as oxygen minimum zones (OMZ), are expected to expand as a consequence of global climate change. Poor oxygenation is promoting microbial loss of inorganic nitrogen (N) and increasing release of sediment-bound phosphate (P) into the water column. These intermediate water masses, nutrient-loaded but with an N deficit relative to the canonical N:P Redfield ratio of 16:1, are transported via coastal upwelling into the euphotic zone. To test the impact of nutrient supply and nutrient stoichiometry on production, partitioning and elemental composition of dissolved (DOC, DON, DOP) and particulate (POC, PON, POP) organic matter, three nutrient enrichment experiments were conducted with natural microbial communities in shipboard mesocosms, during research cruises in the tropical waters of the southeast Pacific and the northeast Atlantic. Maximum accumulation of POC and PON was observed under high N supply conditions, indicating that primary production was controlled by N availability. The stoichiometry of microbial biomass was unaffected by nutrient N:P supply during exponential growth under nutrient saturation, while it was highly variable under conditions of nutrient limitation and closely correlated to the N:P supply ratio, although PON:POP of accumulated biomass generally exceeded the supply ratio. Microbial N:P composition was constrained by a general lower limit of 5:1. Channelling of assimilated P into DOP appears to be the mechanism responsible for the consistent offset of cellular stoichiometry relative to inorganic nutrient supply and nutrient drawdown, as DOP build-up was observed to intensify under decreasing N:P supply. Low nutrient N:P conditions in coastal upwelling areas overlying O2-deficient waters seem to represent a net source for DOP, which may stimulate growth of diazotrophic phytoplankton. These results demonstrate that microbial nutrient assimilation and partitioning of organic matter between the particulate and the dissolved phase are controlled by the N:P ratio of upwelled nutrients, implying substantial consequences for nutrient cycling and organic matter pools in the course of decreasing nutrient N:P stoichiometry.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines the predictive relationships between tourism supply factors and tourism demand. Based on data from 154 countries, partial least squares path modeling (PLSPM) was used to test a predictive model that examines causal relationships among the environment, economy, infrastructure,\n and tourism demand at the aggregate country level. The results suggest that the latent economy variable (operationalized in this study as a formative, rather than a reflective, construct) has a positive, indirect effect on tourism demand. This relationship is mediated by the infrastructure\n and the environment, which in turn have a positive, direct effect on tourism demand, respectively. Results from this study support the operationlization of the \"economy\" construct as a formative construct where consumer price index (CPI), purchasing power parity (PPP), foreign direct investment\n (FDI), trade (TRA), and industry value added (IVA) all \"form\" the latent economy variable. Tourism demand, however, is a \"reflective\" latent construct represented by international tourist arrivals (TA) and international tourist receipts (TEXP). Thus, this predictive model presents a number\n of theoretical and practical contributions. First, this research expands existing theories on tourism demand by presenting a more accurate predictive model that examines the casual relationships among the economy, infrastructure, environment, and tourism. Second, understanding these complex\n relationships provides destination managers with an analytical framework on how certain factors can strengthen tourism demand for the destination.</jats:p>",

The model will be informed by and linked to the South African surface Freight Demand Model (FDM) given these dimensions. By analysing and collating available datasets and developing a freight flow model, a better understanding of freight movements between countries can be obtained and then used for long-term planning efforts. A simple methodology is envisaged that will entail a high-level corridor classification that links a major district in the country with a similar district in another country. Existing trade data will be used to corroborate new base-year economic demand and supply volumetric data that will be generated from social accounting matrices for each country. The trade data will also provide initial flow dynamics between countries that will be refined according to the new volumes. The model can then generate commodity-level corridor flows between SSA countries, and between SSA countries and the rest of the world, as well as intra-country rural and metropolitan flows, using a gravity-based modelling approach. This article outlines efforts to harmonise trade data between the 17 countries identified, as well as between these countries and the rest of the world as a first step towards developing a freight demand model for sub-Saharan Africa.</jats:p>"

The focus of management has shifted from a domestic one to a more complex understanding of how to compete effectively in the global marketplace. One element that has accentuated the need for managers to develop a global mindset is in the area of global supply‐chain management. The need to modify and update the type of manager needed to manage global interorganizational relationships effectively has arrived. This theoretical research examines the growing importance of having the appropriate human resource management (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HRM</jats:styled-content>) processes to select, train, and retain competent global supply‐chain managers. In addressing the human resource dimensions of successful global supply‐chain management the growing importance of HRM in the management of supply chains is presented as a combination of resource‐based (e.g. internal), market‐based (e.g. external) and dynamic capabilities perspectives. In addition, selection, training and assessing the new ‘breed’ of global supply‐chain managers is explored.</jats:p>",

Most of these predictions, however, are unnecessarily alarmist and are based on over-simplistic analysis of mineral reserve and consumption data. In fact, despite rapidly increasing demand, continued scientific and technological innovations have ensured that economic development has never been constrained by lack of mineral resources. However, ‘critical metals’, so-called because of their growing importance in new and green technologies and the high risk of supply shortage, present a particular problem because our knowledge of them is limited and many are by-products of major industrial metals. There is now an urgent need for research on all aspects of the lifecycles of these metals to ensure their future availability. </jats:p>",

Such information is not always readily available. Urban metabolism analysis for any given time period can be challenging due to the lack of metropolitan‐ or city‐level data, and reconstructing a time series of urban energy or material flows is seldom attempted. For the case of Melbourne, Australia, we demonstrate how time series operational energy demand and supply data can be reconstructed from original sources. Primary energy consumption is calculated based on direct and upstream energy use in common with “scope 2” standards for emissions reporting. This extends the usual treatment of energy in urban metabolism studies by (1) providing time series data and (2) attributing upstream primary energy consumption to sectors based on their direct secondary energy usage. Results indicate that the transport, commercial, manufacturing, and residential sectors have contributed most to the doubling of Melbourne's energy consumption over four decades. We discuss recent urban development history and its relation to energy consumption and briefly examine potential scenarios of and responses to future change.</jats:p>",

However the demand for blood are rising every day, due to increases in the number and complexity of procedures that require transfusions The greatest challenge of the hemotherapy service is to provide the blood supply needed “assuring” the safety of them. To meet the potential needs for adequate blood supplies, it is beneficial to increase the number of blood donors and the blood donation rate, without enhancing the risk of blood transmitted diseases. Many strategies have been used to achieve this goal, but most of than concluded that the results of blood donors satisfaction surveys have poor correlation with blood donation process performance. This problem is present in many other fields of the economy, such as hotels, air transportation and day-to-day industrial needs. In the beggining of the last decade developed a strategy called “Net Promoter Score”, that had the intention to establish a direct correlation between customers loyalty and enterprise/process performance. This methodology was based in several researches that could link the customers consuming behavior and the retaining issues. The survey were made with only one question, that was “Would you recommend this company/service for your family or friends” (The Ultimate Question). The customers could answer in a numeric scale from 0 to 10, where 0 was “No, I wouldn't” and 10 was “Yes, I would”. From that score the clients were stratified in three groups: 0–6 were called “Detractors”, the ones that would be the bad marketing of the company; 7–8 were called “Passive”, the ones that do not have a strong experience neither good or bad; and those 9–10, that were called “Promoters”, that were the ones that would be the marketing department of the company, and in our case, the ones that would recruit and retain more donors. To calculate the so called “NET Promoter Score” (NPS), the percentage of detractors were subtracted from the promoters. This score were than used prospectively to follow the enterprise performance, and to be the main guide to adjust customer services. When the NPS were used as the “core” of the strategy, and all the others management tools were taken together with it, we could call it the “Net Promoter System”. In this way the score is a tool that can be used to develop the system. Nowadays this methodology is widely used in the industry, commerce and other fields, and since its publication there were many economy activities that no company could optimize its performance without improving its score. There is no published research looking for its use in the Hemotherapy practice, and specifically in blood donor recruitment and retention. The objective of this study was to establish the feasibility of the utilization of the Net Promoter Score in the blood donation area.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methodology:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The satisfaction survey were offered to the customers at the end of the blood donation process. The candidates to blood donation were analyzed and divided in the described groups according to the so called ultimate question (Detractor, Passive or Promoter) and the blood donations behavior (Clinical unfit for blood donation, First time donor and Repetition donor). These data were pulled together and were used as a guide to adapt customer relations strategy and blood supply optimization.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>From may of 2011 until july of 2012, there were six thousand nine hundred and eight one researches available for analysis derived from seven thousand three hundred and thirty candidates for blood donation (95,23%). From those 11,9% were from unfit patients that were unable to donate, 44,2% of first time donors and 43,8% of repetition donors. The groups were analyzed according to the score, and the NPS were than calculated as follow: 97,66% ±1,30 (SD) for First time Donors; 98,66% ± 0,84 (SD) for Repetition donors and 90,80% ±4,42 (SD) for unfit candidates.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The development of a tool to optimize the blood management is an on course task. Several methodologies have been trying to establish a strong link between donor satisfactions and blood donation behavior. In this study we concluded that NPS is an effective tool, with high feasibility and great potential impact in process performance. The efficacy of the score, the development of the NET Promoter System and the correlation between its methodology with blood donor recruitment and retention must be study in a prospective trial.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Early studies of mid‐ocean ridge discontinuities, such as transform faults and overlapping spreading centers, suggested a lower magma supply compared to ridge segment centers. This is reflected in bathymetrically deeper ridge axes, decreased hydrothermal activity, and the eruption of more evolved lava compositions. While many signatures of lower magma supply are observed at the 9°N overlapping spreading center on the East Pacific Rise, geophysical studies indicate extensive sub‐surface melt in the region, suggesting that the present magmatic system is not diminished. Here major and trace element concentrations of erupted lavas are used to better understand magma supply at a large second‐order ridge discontinuity. We show that the wide range of lava compositions erupted at the 9°N overlapping spreading center is generally consistent with early petrologic models of ridge propagation and require variable degrees of fractional crystallization, extensive magma mixing, and in some instances crustal assimilation. Moderately evolved ferrobasalts and FeTi basalts erupted at the OSC indicate that crustal residence times are long enough for significant crystallization of all magmas within the region, but the presence of dacitic lavas reflects periods of even lower magma supply, where melt replenishment is subordinate to cooling and crystallization. The geophysical observations of extensive melt within the shallow crust are reconciled with the geochemistry of the lavas, if melts are supplied intermittently to the propagating ridge over relatively short timescales.</jats:p>",

We included patients with severe refractory cardiogenic shock and/or resuscitation if locally available therapies failed and a safe transport to a heart centre was not possible. Without immediate mechanical support the patients are considered to die. Logistic optimization was achieved by 1) use of a miniaturized ECLS device (Life Box, Sorin), which is 24-hours instantly ready for use, 2) provision of a passenger car with flash lights for going, 3) placement of stickers with the 24 hours emergency numbers on prominent places, 4) training of cardiologists in insertion of femoral ECLS cannulae.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Results: Seven cath-labs joined the supply network.

All patients received on-site femoral veno-arterial ECLS. Duration of support: 1 to 28 days (mean:8.3). Further treatment include: implantation of a ventricular assist device, cardiac transplantation, coronary artery bypass grafting, left ventricular thrombectomie, PTCA, mitral- and aortic valve replacement. 30-day survival without significant neurological deficits was 44% for men, 50% for women.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Conclusion: Mobile ECLS therapy, using recent technology, offers new options for patients, who are otherwise likely to die.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Current‐oriented operational amplifier (OpAmp) design has been common for its orderly current‐to‐speed tradeoff. However, for high‐precision or high‐linearity applications, increasing the current does not help much, as the supply voltage (<jats:italic>V</jats:italic><jats:sub>DD</jats:sub>) and intrinsic gain of the MOSFETs in ultra‐scaled CMOS technologies are very limited. This paper introduces voltage‐oriented circuit techniques to address such limitations. Specifically, a 2x<jats:italic>V</jats:italic><jats:sub>DD</jats:sub>‐enabled recycling folded cascade (RFC) OpAmp is proposed. It features: (1) <jats:italic>current recycling</jats:italic> to enhance the effective trans conductance by 4x with no extra power; (2) <jats:italic>transistor stacking</jats:italic> to boost the output resistance by one to two orders of magnitude; and (3) <jats:italic>V<jats:sub>DD</jats:sub> elevating</jats:italic> to enlarge the linear output swing by 4x. Comparing with its 1x<jats:italic>V</jats:italic><jats:sub>DD</jats:sub> RFC and FC counterparts, the proposed solution achieves 20‐dB higher DC gain (i.e. 72.8 dB) in open loop and 20‐dB lower IM3 (i.e., –76.5 dB) in closed loop, under the same power budget of 0.6 mW in a 1‐V General Purpose 65‐nm CMOS process. In many applications, these joint improvements in a single stage are already adequate, being more power efficient (i.e. less current paths), stable (i.e. more phase margin), and compact (i.e. no frequency compensation) than multi‐stage OpAmps. Voltage‐conscious biasing and node‐voltage trajectory check ensure the device reliability in both transient and steady states. No specialized high‐voltage device is necessary.

Ruxolitinib (rux), a potent oral JAK1 &amp; 2 inhibitor, demonstrated rapid and durable reductions in splenomegaly and improved MF-related symptoms and quality of life in 2 phase 3 studies (COMFORT-I and -II). Due to unmet medical need, rux has been made available through an individual patient supply program (IPSP) outside the US.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Patients (pts) with PMF, PPV-MF, or PET-MF requiring treatment (as determined by their physician) and classified as high-, intermediate (int)-2–, or int-1–risk with an enlarged spleen were evaluated for eligibility on an individual basis by the sponsor, irrespective of JAK2 mutation status. The starting dose of rux was determined on the basis of baseline platelet count (15 or 20 mg twice daily for pts with platelet counts of 100–200 × 109/L and &gt; 200 × 109/L, respectively) and can be adjusted for efficacy and safety. Dose changes during treatment, adverse events (AEs), and serious AEs (SAEs) are registered throughout the program.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>To date, 1339 requests have been received from &gt; 800 physicians in 48 countries, including locations in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. The baseline characteristics are shown in the Table for pts whose requests for access were approved (n = 1240). Drug resupply requests are received every ≈ 3 months. Follow-up information, based on the first resupply request, was available for 381/639 (60%) of the pts who were enrolled in the program prior to February 2012; 303 (80%) remain on rux therapy, 37 (10%) have discontinued, 11 (3%) died, and 30 (8%) did not initiate therapy. Spleen response was available for 247 pts (decreased, n = 201; unchanged, n = 39; increased, n = 7). Changes in constitutional symptoms were available for 203 pts (decreased, n = 151; unchanged, n = 49; increased, n = 3). In pts enrolled in the IPSP undergoing rux treatment, most pts who had a decrease in spleen length also had a decrease in symptoms. Dose-modification information was available for 259 pts, of whom 44 had dose increases and 89 had dose decreases. Reasons for dose modifications included efficacy (n = 28), safety (n = 69), and other reasons (n = 36). Safety information was available for 266 pts; 75 reported significant AEs or SAEs as determined by investigators. Enrolled pt characteristics are generally similar to those expected in the overall MF pt population. Thus far, the proportion of pts enrolled in the IPSP with the JAK2 V617F mutation (73%) is higher than that for the general MF population (50%-60%). This may reflect a misconception that JAK inhibition is primarily effective in pts who have the JAK2 V617F mutation, when in fact rux has demonstrated similar efficacy in both pt types in the phase 1/2 251 study and the two phase 3 COMFORT trials. This may also be reflected in the higher proportion of PPV-MF pts in the IPSP than in the general MF population (28% vs 10%-15%), of whom 95% are JAK2 V617 F–positive.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Considerable requests for access to rux have been received through the IPSP, highlighting the need for an effective treatment in pts with a range of IPSS risk-assessment scores. The demographics of the IPSP pts are similar to those expected in the overall MF population. Responses and safety patterns observed in the IPSP appear to be comparable to those from the COMFORT trials.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Off Label Use: Jakafi™ (ruxolitinib) is indicated in the United States for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, including primary myelofibrosis, post–polycythemia vera myelofibrosis and post–essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis. In Canada, JAKAVI ® is indicated for the treatment of splenomegaly and/or its associated symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis.
