Plants were grown originally in a complete nutrient solution. After decapitation one set of plants was transferred to a nutrient solution without potassium and another set to a solution with potassium, all other nutrients remaining the same for both treatments.</jats:p><jats:p>During an experimental period of 3 days the plants supplied with potassium showed exudation rates which were more than twice as high as plants in the nutrient medium without potassium. The potassium supply affected the potassium and nitrate contents of the exudation sap. Both were lower in the treatment without potassium. The calcium and magnesium contents of the exudation sap were not significantly influenced by the potassium treatment, whereas the phosphate content was higher in the treatment without potassium. At the beginning of the exudation period the potassium supply did not affect the content of amino acids in the exudate, but later the plants supplied with potassium showed higher contents of amino acids in the exudation sap.</jats:p><jats:p>As the absence of potassium reduced the exudation rate considerably the acropetal transport of all exudation sap constituents analysed in this experiment was markedly reduced.</jats:p>",
