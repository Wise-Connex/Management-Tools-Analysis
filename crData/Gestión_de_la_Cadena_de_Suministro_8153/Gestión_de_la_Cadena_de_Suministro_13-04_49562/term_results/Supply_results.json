This paper examines these issues from an internalization theory perspective by summarizing the contribution of internalization theory to supply chain analysis; considering how a division of labor is coordinated and comparing coordination by management with coordination by the market; and discussing the formal models of supply chains developed by economists. Supply chain researchers possessing an interest in economic principles and good mathematical skills can make an important contribution to internalization theory, and it is hoped that this paper will encourage them to do so.</jats:p>",

However, findings from these studies have found positive and negative associations, leaving practitioners perplexed as to what actions would be beneficial to pursue. With hypotheses grounded in the natural resource–based view of the firm, the current study examines over 20 years of research on environmental supply chain practices using a meta‐analysis to determine whether the overall effect of these specific practices on firm performance is, in fact, positive. The results show that the link between environmental supply chain practices and market‐based, operational‐based and accounting‐based forms of firm performance is positive and significant, providing support for the business case that sustainable supply chain management results in increased firm performance. Different operationalizations of supply chain practices — upstream, design, production and downstream — along with industry, sample region, firm size and time are examined as moderators of this relationship with nuanced results that help to extend the discipline's understanding of the relationship between environmentally sustainable supply chain management and firm performance.</jats:p>",

The task of supply chain management researchers with regard to this phenomenon should be to clarify what it is; to explore whether it is really a new phenomenon; and, paraphrasing (Simon, 1967; <jats:bold>p</jats:bold>. 1), to conduct research into the reshoring phenomenon so as to contribute not only to the science but also to the practice of reshoring. This essay is a starting point for our efforts in that direction. We make a number of informed assertions about reshoring—assertions that are juxtaposed in relevant literature and that aim to (a) define what reshoring is and is not; (b) explain why the reshoring phenomenon should not be examined in isolation but rather as a reversion of a prior offshoring decision; (c) describe how the reshoring phenomenon might evolve as societies, worldwide, place increasing emphasis on the environmental impact of business decisions; and (d) articulate a plausible scenario in which reshoring eventually hampers employment in Western nations. We hope these assertions will, in turn, jumpstart an intellectual discourse, through scientific research, into the what, how, when, where, and why of the reshoring phenomenon.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research uses data from a survey to explore the factors that affect organizations' manufacturing location decisions. Manufacturing location, more specifically the possibility of firms' nearshoring or reshoring, has received a great deal of recent attention, especially in the United States. This paper applies the location aspect of internalization theory to provide an understanding of what factors affect organizations' perceptions of the attractiveness of various regions as locations for owned manufacturing facilities. An exploratory factor analysis is used to develop factors that drive manufacturing location decisions. Multiple regression analysis is used to test the relationship between the drivers of manufacturing location decisions and movement of manufacturing into or out of a region, and overall perceived risk of a region. Findings indicate that various drivers have differential effects across regions. For example, while North America is viewed favorably for its trade policies over the next 3 years, the trade policies are also viewed as an increasing source of risk, possibly reflecting bipartisan conflicts. Three theoretical propositions are developed to advance the understanding of the current state of manufacturing location decisions from an internalization perspective. It appears that organizations are beginning to look at their manufacturing location decisions through a broader lens, giving more weight to supply chain issues as well as strategic factors.</jats:p>",

They also hypothesize the positive link between the professional service supply chain performance and the overall organisational firm performance. Employing survey method, data was collected from 93 accounting firms at two time points. In May 2010 (Time 1), a survey including questions on HPWS, team formation and utilization and professional service supply chain performance were sent out to the managing partners and HR directors in accounting firms based in Ireland. Around one year later (Time 2), another survey measuring firm performance was sent out. This data allowed the authors to establish causal pattern in their results.

      "abstract": "<p>Several analytical models have been developed to solve the integrated production distribution problems in Supply Chain Management (SCM). In certain multi-stage service supply chain like blood banks, the term ‘production’ is referred as collection. It is often crucial to consider the inventory and distribution costs for successful decision making in multi-stage service supply chain. In this paper, the authors have explored this problem by considering a Two - Stage Collection - Distribution (TSCD) Model for blood collection and distribution that faces a deterministic stream of external demands for blood product. A finite supply and collection of blood at stage one Central Blood Bank (CBB) has been assumed. Blood is collected at stage one CBB and distributed to stage two Regional Blood Bank (RBB), where the storage capacity of the RBB is limited. Packaging is completed at stage two (that is, value is added to each item, but no new items are created), and the packed blood bags are stored which is used to meet the final demand of customer zone. During each period, the optimal collection rate at CBB, distribution rate between CBB and RBB and routing structure from the CBB to RBB and then to customer zone, must be determined. This TSCD model with capacity constraints at both stages is optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and compared with the standard operations research software LINDO for small problems.</p>",

A win–win negotiation strategy attempts to maximize mutual gain while a win–lose strategy focuses on obtaining a disproportionate share of benefits. This study investigates the relational costs of adopting a negotiation strategy in terms of adverse effects on knowledge sharing intentions in interdependent buyer–supplier relationships. A between‐subjects scenario‐based experiment is used to test hypotheses developed from applicable literature and social exchange theory. Results of the experiment indicate that employing a win–lose negotiation strategy may decrease future intentions toward information exchange, communication quality and operational knowledge transfer between buyers and suppliers. The findings inform managerial aspects of supply chain relationship management, extend the negotiation literature to consider longer‐term effects of common negotiation strategies and provide insights into social exchange theory.</jats:p>",

For the first time, this includes the number of used firearms resold via federally licensed retailers. For 2010, for example, total unit sales are estimated at 9.8 million pistols, revolvers, rifles, and shotguns, about 1.5 million of which were used weapons. The total number of military and nonmilitary firearms that entered commerce between 1986 and 2010 is estimated at about 150 million units. Allowing for pre-1986 production and imports, this lends credence to the notion that the total stock of firearms in the U.S. averages about one firearm per person. The article further shows rising firearms imports. In 2010, these amounted to about one-third of the total market. In addition to imports, foreign brands also produce at U.S. locations and, in 2010, captured well over 20 percent of the U.S. commercial pistol market.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and demonstrates that shocks to consumption tastes (taste shocks) are an effective explanation for the equity home bias puzzle. In the model, home assets provide insurance for home agents to hedge against domestic taste fluctuations, whereas such insurance cannot be offered by foreign assets. The empirical evidence shows that, in explaining equity home bias, hedging against consumption taste risks is more relevant than hedging against labor income risks or real exchange rate risks.</jats:p>",

Exclusively vehicle routing problem (VRP) plays a central role in the optimization of distribution networks. The routing of service vehicles has a major impact on the quality of the service provided. In distribution of goods and services, it is time and again required to determine a combination of least cost vehicle routes through a set of geographically scattered customers, subject to side constraints. The case most commonly studied is where all vehicles are identical. Due to the complexity involved in solving the VRP, most researchers concentrate on using meta-heuristics for solving real-life problems. In this paper, heuristic methods based on Ant Colony Optimization and Simulated Annealing algorithms are developed and search strategies are investigated. Computational results are reported on randomly generated problems. These methods significantly improve in minimizing the total distances travelled by the vehicles.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Supply chains today amass huge amounts of data. To remain competitive in a global economy, organizations need to constantly derive meaningful information from this plethora of data to make critical business decisions. The process of gaining meaningful and actionable knowledge from supply chain related data is referred to as Supply Chain Analytics (SCA). As a result of demonstrated benefits from SCA, organizations are spending considerable amount of resources to develop these analytical capabilities. However, due to complexities of such undertakings, many SCA projects fail to achieve the desired results. It is argued that a major reason for such failures is lack of organizational readiness to embrace analytics. This paper presents an index for measuring the readiness of organizations to successfully implement SCA. The Supply Chain Analytics Index, henceforth referred to SCAX, was developed by surveying 112 SCA professionals from 7 countries and from various industries and professional backgrounds. Using this index, organizations can tangibly assess their readiness to take full advantage of the power of SCA.</p>",

This study extends prior research on manufacturing practices by exploring the dimension level and item level relationships between modularity based manufacturing practices and supply chain responsiveness. A large scale web-based survey yielded 294 responses from industry professionals in the manufacturing and supply chain area. The proposed relationship was first tested using structural equation modeling using AMOS, followed by regression analyses for exploring dimension and item level relationships. The study indicates that firms with high levels of modularity based manufacturing practices have high levels of supply chain responsiveness. Key modularity based manufacturing practices that improve various aspects of supply chain responsiveness are identified and discussed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"

However, this practice also exposes the firm to increased levels of risk stemming from supply chain disruptions which can be quite costly relative to both short- and long-term performance. In response, companies need to build and maintain resilience to combat these disruptive events. Yet managers struggle with how to build resilience and where to focus resiliency enhancements. This article proposes a versatile optimization approach, READI—Resiliency Enhancement Analysis via Deletion (of key supply chain node, flow, or activity) and Insertion (of mitigation strategy), and demonstrates this approach on the supply chain of a major consumer products company. READI can be enlightening relative to both descriptive insights, such as the criticality of supply chain nodes and current levels of network resilience, and prescriptive insights, such as where to implement resiliency enhancements.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Selection of appropriate forecasting models with their optimized parameters for a given business scenario is a challenging task and requires reasonable expert knowledge and experience. The problem of selecting the best forecasting model becomes computationally complex when the business needs forecasts on thousands of time series at a given time period. Many a times business users are interested in adapting the best parameter settings of proven forecasting models of the past and use them for further predictions. This approach facilitates the users to identify the forecasting model with a parameter value which minimizes the average of forecast errors across all the time series. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm based solution approach which simultaneously suggests the suitable forecasting model and its best parameter(s) value which minimizes the average mean absolute percentage error of all the time series. This approach is tested on randomly generated data sets and the results are compared with few randomly selected samples. For a fair comparison the samples are tested in SAS 9.1 and the results are compared with sample results which used GA suggested forecasting model and parameter values.</p>",

Significantly, factors such as the competition of markets in the globe, limitation of energy, raw and virgin materials, environmental protection crisis and increasing of global population dramatically are causing unprecedented issues for the worldwide supply chains for providing goods and services to customers efficiently and effectively. The sustainability approach for Supply Chain Management (SCM) considers the 6Rs principles in four main stages of the supply chains: Pre-manufacture, Manufacture, Use and Post-use. The use of Multi-Agent System (MAS) prepares the most important requirements of an effective sustainable supply chain. At the same time, this agent-based approach provides reliable and agile systems, which will enable enterprises to accommodate ever changing needs of their customers in the future. In this article, the use of MAS for optimal Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) is reviewed and the integrated functioning of certain agents resulting in information sharing is also demonstrated. With this idea, an attempt is made to provide a MAS model for the SSCM. In the proposed model, each agent performs a specific function of the organization and shares information with other agents. In order to describe this multi-agent based approach, a simple case study is given to illustrate the sustainable supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

With various characteristics such as offering flexibility, cost reductions, platform independence and on-demand service, cloud approach opens up tremendous opportunities from Supply Chain (SC) perspective. However, extant literature reveals that adoption and assimilation of the technology is not mature in SC domain and cloud-based modelling initiatives are only recent. To fill this gap, this study discusses the opportunities of cloud computing from SC perspective and proposes a generic representation based on cloud philosophy. The proposed representation is conceptual, flexible and customizable, utilizing and highlighting the cloud benefits in a multi-partner setting. Therefore, this article is an answer to the research questions: “what are the opportunities of cloud philosophy for SC domain?” and “how can supply chains be represented generically based on cloud technology in multi-actor environment?”. Contribution of this study lies in comprehensive treatment of cloud computing and supply chain intersection as well as the generic representation.</p>",

The empirical test results show that both demand and supply shocks do affect US hospitality index returns and that the significant effects of both shocks vary across sectors. This paper identifies the critical role of changes in the corporate tax rate (demand shock and fiscal policy variable), the oil price growth rate (supply shock) and the labour wage growth rate (supply shock) in affecting hospitality index returns. Consistent with previous studies, the author finds that monetary policy (demand shock) still has a strong influence on hospitality index returns. However, hospitality index returns are not significantly related to the fiscal policy variable of changes in budget deficits. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results and their managerial implications for the guidance of hospitality business managers and investors interested in hospitality sectors. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The energy and carbon pictures in China have changed dramatically since launching its open‐door policy and economic reforms in late 1978. China is already the world's largest energy consumer and carbon emitter. Its energy use and carbon emissions continue to be on the climbing trajectories beyond 2030 as it is approaching to be the largest economy. Clearly, meeting China's increasing energy needs to fuel its rapid economic growth presents an enormous challenge, not simply for China but for the entire world. This paper focuses on assessing those crucial issues on energy demand and supply in China. Given the inevitable rising trend of China's energy demand and continuous coal dominance in China's energy and power generation mix over the next two decades and beyond, the paper discusses China's efforts toward energy conservation and how China can generate electricity with coal more efficiently and environmentally friendly to limit its impacts. This is followed by examining a variety of policies that China has taken to address its growing dependence on imported oil. The paper also discusses the evolving of China's nuclear power policy, and indicates that the expansion of nuclear power is inevitable in China to cope with its daunting energy security and environmental challenges. The Fukushima accident will have no effect on China's stance on nuclear power, although it, at most, will slightly affect the pace of its development. From a long‐term perspective, widespread use of renewable energy is a real solution. Therefore, the paper discusses in great detail China's dramatic efforts to meet its ambitious renewable targets, focusing on wind power that is identified as a priority for diversifying China's energy mix. All taken together and integrated well, these policies help China to transit to a low‐carbon economy.</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:\n<jats:list list-type=\"explicit-label\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Energy Policy and Planning &gt; Systems and Infrastructure</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p>",

Delivery commitments impact the customer in deciding for the service. Computing the delivery commitments in stochastic service systems is a real challenge. Delivery commitment forms a key parameter in formulating the service level agreements in B2B markets. In our current work we propose a queuing theoretic approach for computing the delivery commitments. The authors employ basic Probability theory to propose two bounds on delivery commitment time. Further, we investigate the effect of learning in service networks. They believe that their work can provide a simple and easy framework for quality analysis in stochastic service networks.</p>",

The PMSG is connected to a three phase resistive load through a switch mode rectifier and a voltage source inverter. Control of the generator side converter is used to achieve maximum power extraction from the available wind power. Control of the DC-DC bidirectional buck-boost converter, which is connected between batteries bank and DC-link voltage, is used to maintain the DC-link voltage at a constant value. It is also used to make the batteries bank stores the surplus of wind energy and supplies this energy to the load during a wind power shortage. The load side voltage source inverter uses a relatively complex vector control scheme to control the output load voltage in terms of amplitude and frequency. The control strategy works under wind speed variation as well as with variable load. Extensive simulation results have been performed using MATLAB/SIMULINK.</jats:p>"

A framework was developed for supply side risk by starting with a structured literature review complemented with theoretical underpinnings from the principles of Resource Based Value, Transaction Cost Economies and the Relational Capital Theory. The study validated the framework through a survey of 164 purchasing and supply chain managers in India. The study used confirmatory factor analysis to develop the measurement model. Structural equation modeling was deployed for testing the proposed structural relationships and hypotheses. The findings clearly indicated that factors such as supplier concentration, supplier dependence, sourcing strategies and trust towards customers enhanced the supply side risk situation for the organization. In contrast to this, trust towards suppliers and high level of information sharing among the supply chain partners created undesired risk.</p>",

Thus, we recorded the listing of added sweeteners in every packaged food item in two locations of a national supermarket chain in RI. Ingredient lists were read for High Fructose Corn Syrup(HFCS), other caloric sweeteners, non‐caloric sweeteners, and no added sweetener. Frequencies of each added sweetener classification were calculated for each of 25 main food groupings. Of note, ‘snack cakes’ had 33.9% of the items containing HFCS and 66.1% containing other caloric sweeteners, whereas ‘cookies’ had 62.1% of the items containing HFCS and 37.9% containing another caloric sweetener. These two food groups, which seem similar in nature, in reality have inverse sugar profiles. In the ‘Soda’ group, 40% contained HFCS, 17% other added sweeteners, 37% non caloric sweeteners, and 6% no added sweetener. Sports drinks where very low in HFCS with only 1.6%, and an even split between caloric sweeteners and noncaloric sweeteners at 44.3%, while 9.8% had no added sweeteners. The ‘condiments’ group had 48.4% containing HFCS, 30.3% other caloric sweeteners, 0.8% noncaloric sweeteners, and 20.5% no added sugars. The pronounced presence of sugars and sweeteners in the packaged food supply demonstrates the high degree of permeation that has occurred in the American food market.</jats:p>",

We use the Energy-Stability-Area model of interest system density to assess how these changes – along with changes in the productivity of different economic sectors in terms of generating organized interests – have influenced the size and composition of state interest communities from 1997 to 2007. We find that all three sources of economic change have uniquely contributed, and to a significant degree, to demographic change in state communities of organized interests.</jats:p>",

We present a principal-agent model for managing long-term supplier relationships using a unique form of measurement and incentive scheme. We measure a supplier's overall performance with a rating equivalent to its continuation utility (the expected total discounted utility of its future payoffs), and incentivize supplier effort with larger allocations of future business. We obtain the vector of the two suppliers' ratings as the state of a Markov decision process, and we solve an infinite horizon contracting problem in which the manufacturer allocates business volume between the two suppliers and updates their ratings dynamically based on their current ratings and the current performance outcome. </jats:p><jats:p> Our contributions are both theoretical and managerial: we propose a repeated principal-agent model with a novel incentive scheme to tackle a common, but challenging, incentive problem in a multiperiod supply chain setting. Assuming binary effort choices and performance outcomes by the suppliers, we characterize the structure of the optimal contract through a novel fixed-point analysis. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for the emergence of “business-as-usual” (low effort) trapping states and tournament competition (high effort) recurrent states as the long-run incentive drivers for motivating critical suppliers. </jats:p>",

To provide a glimpse into the ARV procurement and supply chain, the following pages provide an overview of the primary stakeholders, principal operating models, and policies and regulations involved in ARV procurement. Also presented are key challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that the supply chain is not a barrier to the goal of universal coverage. This article will cover the steps necessary to order and distribute ARVs, including different models of delivery, key stakeholders involved, strategic considerations that vary depending on context and policies affecting them. The single drug examples given illustrate the complications inherent in fragmented supply and demand-driven models of procurement and supply chain management, and suggest tools for navigating these hurdles that will ultimately result in more secure and reliable ARV provision. Understanding the dynamics of ARV supply chain is important for the global health community, both to ensure full and efficient treatment of persons living with HIV as well as to inform the supply chain decisions for other public health products. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we focus on coordination of a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a price-setting retailer, which operates for a single product. Customer demand is influenced by retailer's instantaneous inventory level and selling price. The integrated system and the decentralized scenario, by considering manufacturer as the Stackelberg leader, are discussed. It is shown that conventional revenue sharing contract cannot coordinate the system but revenue and cost sharing (RCS) contract is able to coordinate the system and leads to a win–win outcome. The key contract parameters — cost sharing fraction, along with revenue sharing fraction and wholesale price are determined under explicit and implicit information of retailer's cost structure. Finally, it is shown that range of cost sharing fraction that leads to win–win situation is independent of the format of cost structure of retailer. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the development of the model. </jats:p>",

Stochastic programming models are developed for both the transshipment and allocation structures. We study the impact of cost parameters and demand coefficient of variation on both system structures. Our results show an increasing convex relationship between average costs and demand coefficient of variation, and furthermore that this increase is more pronounced for the allocation structure. We employ simulation and nonlinear search techniques to computationally compare the cost performance of allocation and transshipment structures under a wide range of system parameters such as demand uncertainty and correlation; lead times from the external warehouse to retailers, from warehouse to central depot, and from depot to retailers; and transshipment, holding, and penalty costs. The transshipment approach is found to outperform allocation for a broad range of parameter inputs including many situations for which transshipment is not an economically sound decision for a single period. The insights provided enable the manager to choose whether to invest in reducing lead times or demand uncertainty and assist in the selection of investments across identical and nonidentical retailers.</jats:p>",

Continuity of business during an animal disease outbreak aims to mitigate these agriculture-related losses by facilitating normal business operations through the managed movement of non-infected animals and non-contaminated animal products. During a foreign animal disease outbreak, there are competing objectives of trying to control and contain the outbreak while allowing non-infected premises to continue normal business operations to the greatest extent possible. Using a logic model approach, this article discusses the importance of continuity of business planning during an animal disease outbreak, providing a detailed and transparent theoretical framework for continuity of business planning for animal agriculture stakeholders. The logic model provides a basis for continuity of business planning, which is rapidly gaining focus and interest in the animal emergency management community. This unique logic model offers a framework for effective planning and subsequent evaluation of continuity of business plans and processes, by identifying explicit stakeholders, inputs, and activities, alongside the desired outputs and outcomes of such planning.</jats:p>"

A fit/gap analysis assesses the measures and their potential to solve the supply chain challenges in a systematic manner. The model is built upon existing supply chain management frameworks and defines a set of specific optimization measures for the problem at hand.

Inventory level and lead time are the two performance measures at the bottom level of the hierarchy, implying higher driving power. Operational costs, business wastage, environmental costs, delivery time and customer satisfaction are identified as autonomous measures. This means that they are relatively disconnected from the other suggested performance measures. It is also observed that the cash‐to‐cash cycle is a weak driver but strongly dependent on the other performance measures.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The proposed approach gives managers a better understanding of the performance measures that have most influence on others (driving performance measures) and those measures which are most influenced by others (dependent performance measures).

Financial resources are crucial to improve existing urban drinking water supply in developing countries typically characterized by low cost recovery rates and high and rapidly growing demand for more reliable services. This study examines the willingness to pay for improved urban drinking water supply employing a choice model (CM) in an urban context in Ethiopia, Hawassa, with a household survey of 170 respondents. The design of the choice model allows the estimation of the values of two attributes of urban drinking water service (extra day water delivery per week and safer water). The findings indicate that households are willing to pay up to 60% extra for improved levels of water supply over and above their current water bill. Especially those households living in the poorest part of the city with the lowest service levels demonstrate that they are willing to pay more despite significant income constraints they are facing. Women value the improvement of water quality most, while a significant effect is found for averting behavior and expenditures. The estimated economic values can be used in policy appraisals of investment decisions.</jats:p>"

The paper presents a governance approach for managing multi-actor, multi-discipline, and total lifecycle data, informed by a wide industry consultation conducted in the UK between March and September 2011. The study identifies a number of barriers in engaging with Building Information Modelling (BIM) efforts with a view of facilitating collaboration around a common and integrated project specification. A governance model is proposed that addresses the identified adoption blockers underpinned by a “mixed approach”, that factors in various modes of information delivery, ranging from paper-based documents to object-based information conveyed by IFC (Industry Foundation Classes). A demonstrator system is developed and used to validate our BIM governance concepts. Our governance model is discussed in the context of the recent UK government BIM industry consultation document supported by a research and development (R&amp;D) roadmap taking into account current industry structure and its various levels of stakeholders’ maturity, capability and readiness.</jats:p>",

It is also found that women enter entrepreneurship majorly due to necessity than opportunity orientation. If that is the case does entrepreneurial impression management differ for both the gender? How does the necessity based entrepreneur face the increased competitive approaches of opportunity based entrepreneurs? This study attempts to find out the difference between impression management techniques and different social competencies employed by women and male entrepreneurs. Data was collected by means of questionnaire to new ventures and a total of hundred and seventeen observations were collected, from fifty seven females and sixty male entrepreneurs. It was observed that impression management techniques employed by women are different from that of males. In contrast to the sex role typing of females it was seen that women use assertion oriented techniques than compared to males. The results provide evidence that the potential for developing social competence and impression management techniques and promoting the abilities needed for a free and self-determined career has not been exhausted by any means.</p>",

In this paper, an optimisation model to determine the supply parameters oriented to different requirements is established. Because the proposed model takes the quantitative relationship between an air parameter in an arbitrary location and various boundary conditions into account, once the required parameters are specified, the supply parameters can be determined instantaneously. The model is then applied in five cases. The proposed model was shown to have an acceptable accuracy in solving supply parameters by comparing the resulting gas concentrations with the required values. Also, the differences between the required parameters are within the capacity of the ventilation system in maintaining parameter differences; therefore, all the requirements can be satisfied even if the number of locations outnumbers the inlets. The proposed model may play an important role in the practical design and control of ventilation systems in providing non-uniform environments. </jats:p>",

The scale and complexity of this planning problem make developing robust supply chain optimization tools a challenge. Pure optimization methods are computationally infeasible, and fast heuristic methods alone generate poor results. Consequently, we developed a method that decomposes the problem by dividing the bills of materials product structure horizontally and vertically into complex and simple portions that are based on the major stages in semiconductor manufacturing and the choices of supply chain paths for building parts. The method then solves the complex portions with a mixed-integer program and the simple portions with fast heuristics that contain small embedded linear programs. A unique pegging algorithm, an explosion heuristic, and an implosion linear program enable coordination among these portions. The result is a unified production, shipping, and distribution plan with no evidence of the original decomposition. This method has helped IBM to improve its asset utilization, customer service, and inventory levels. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Transfer pricing refers to the pricing of an intermediate product or service within a firm. This product or service is transferred between two divisions of the firm. Thus, transfer pricing is closely related to the allocation of profits in a supply chain. Motivated by the significant impact of transfer pricing methods for tax purposes on operational decisions and the corresponding profits of a supply chain, in this article, we study a decentralized supply chain of a multinational firm consisting of two divisions: a manufacturing division and a retail division. These two divisions are located in different countries under demand uncertainty. The retail division orders an intermediate product from the upstream manufacturing division and sets the retail price under random customer demand. The manufacturing division accepts or rejects the retail division's order. We specifically consider two commonly used transfer pricing methods for tax purposes: the cost‐plus method and the resale‐price method. We compare the supply chain profits under these two methods. Based on the newsvendor framework, our analysis shows that the cost‐plus method tends to allocate a higher percentage of profit to the retail division, whereas the resale‐price method tends to achieve a higher firm‐wide profit. However, as the variability of demand increases, our numerical study suggests that the firm‐wide and divisional profits tend to be higher under the cost‐plus method than they are under the resale‐price method. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To generate the global supply chain plan, we first formulate a GSCP model. Then, we need to generate several scenarios which can represent various demand uncertainties. Lastly, a planning procedure for considering those defined scenarios is applied. Unlike the past related researches, we adopt the fuzzy set theory to represent the demand scenarios. Also, a scenario voting process is added to calculate a probability (possibility) of each scenario. An illustrative example based on a real world case is presented to show the feasibility of the proposed planning process.</jats:p>",

Human health risks that may be exacerbated by nutrient enrichment stem from increases in disinfection by‐products, cyanotoxins, and arsenic. New York state is developing numeric nutrient criteria for the protection of water supply lakes and reservoirs by establishing relationships between nutrients, algal abundance, dissolved organic carbon, and trihalomethanes, and then targeting established regulatory endpoints to set appropriate numeric nutrient criteria thresholds. This approach represents a much‐needed bridge between the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act by defining source water protection goals. Findings to date from the investigation of 21 systems indicate that a mean chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> threshold of 4–6 μg/L would likely be protective of potable water supply lakes and reservoirs.</jats:p>",

This paper investigates the comparison of the results obtained in a small supply of water that historically presented THM contents out of the Spanish normative, versus the results there obtained when the treatment was modified with the inclusion of a nanofiltration system. So, the conventional treatment first applied was that of pre-oxidation with chlorine and/or KMnO4, followed by coagulation with aluminum salts directly on closed sand filter, and disinfection final by chlorination: with this system, THM levels lower than 0.100 mg/L were not always secured. Thus, to improve the water quality, a full system of nanofiltration was implemented, after the above treatment, consisting in: pre-filtration through cartridges, filtration over activated carbon, post-filtration for retaining impurities, and finally, nanofiltration and chlorination of water after nanofiltration. In this order, the new treatment scheme has usually produced water with maximum THM levels of 0.058 mg/L, and average values of 0.013 mg/L, 0.30 mg/L for organic matter concentrations, and water always microbiologically pure. Also, the contents of Fe, Mn and Al in the treated water were significantly reduced with respect to the previous situation without nanofiltration.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As today's firms increasingly outsource their noncore activities, they not only have to manage their own resources and capabilities, but they are ever more dependent on the resources and capabilities of supplying firms to respond to customer needs. This paper explicitly examines whether and how firms and suppliers, who are both oriented to the same customer market, enable innovativeness in their supply chains and deliver value to their joint customer. We will call this customer of the focal firm the “end user.” The authors take a resource‐dependence perspective to hypothesize how suppliers' end‐user orientation and innovativeness influence downstream activities at the focal firm and end‐user satisfaction. The resource dependence theory looks typically beyond the boundaries of an individual firm for explaining firm success: firms need to satisfy customer demands to survive and depend on other parties such as their suppliers to achieve customer satisfaction. Accordingly, the research design focuses on three parties along a supply chain: the focal firm, a supplier, and a customer of the focal firm (end user). The results drawn from a survey of 88 matched chains suggest the following. First, customer satisfaction is driven by focal firms' innovativeness. A focal firm's innovativeness depends, on the one hand, on a focal firm's market orientation and, on the other hand, on its suppliers’ innovativeness. Second, no relationship could be established between a focal firm's market orientation and a supplier's end‐user orientation. Market orientation typically has within‐firm effects, while innovativeness has impact beyond the boundaries of the firm. These results suggest that firms create value for their customer through internal market orientation efforts and external suppliers' innovativeness.</jats:p>",

Following extreme storms, however, these reservoirs periodically experience high levels of turbidity that may require alum addition before the water enters the city's distribution system. A study was conducted to evaluate measures to control turbidity and reduce the need for alum treatment. The study involved development and application of a linked water supply–water quality modeling platform to simulate performance of structural and nonstructural turbidity control alternatives under realistic operations and over a broad array of hydrologic conditions. Results indicated that modest improvements to the existing infrastructure and modified system operations could control turbidity and reduce the need for costly capital improvements.

A <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GIS</jats:styled-content>‐enabled biomass supply chain optimization model (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BioScope</jats:styled-content>) was developed to minimize annual biomass‐ethanol production costs by selecting the optimal numbers, locations, and capacities of farms, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CSPs</jats:styled-content>, and biorefineries as well as identifying the optimal biomass flow pattern from farms to biorefineries. The model was implemented to study the Miscanthus‐ethanol supply chain in Illinois. The results of the baseline case, assuming 2% of cropland is allocated for Miscanthus production, showed that unit Miscanthus‐ethanol production costs were $220.6 Mg<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>, or $0.74 L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. Biorefinery‐related costs are the largest cost component, accounting for 48% of the total costs, followed by biomass procurement, transportation, and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CSP</jats:styled-content> related costs. The unit Miscanthus‐ethanol production costs could be reduced to $198 Mg<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> using 20% of cropland, primarily due to savings in transportation costs. Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal supply chain configurations, including the numbers and locations of supply sites, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CSP</jats:styled-content> facilities, and biorefineries, changed significantly for different cropland usage rates, biomass demands, transportation means, and pre‐processing technologies. A supply chain composed of large biorefineries with the support of distributed <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CSP</jats:styled-content> facilities was recommended to reduce biofuels production costs.

Though no cause for the disease has been found, recent studies speculate that copper consumption through diet is implicated in the cognitive decline of the aging population and of those suffering from Alzheimer's disease. According to standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Lead and Copper Rule, if more than 10 percent of tap water samples exceed the copper action level of 1.3 mg/L or 1.3 ppm, additional steps must be taken to reduce that value through corrosion control and public awareness. Despite the EPA's claim that it is not possible to see copper in water supply, a batch of freezer‐made ice cubes presented a green tinge. It was hypothesized that this was due to an insoluble copper salt since a green solid precipitate was observed when the ice was dissolved. The purpose of this investigation is to determine which compounds were present in the “green ice” samples and to quantify their content. Through qualitative methods, the presence of a copper salt was confirmed. Further tests revealed the salt to be copper carbonate, or CuCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. Through absorption spectroscopy, the amount of free copper in solution was quantified and found to exceed the EPA Maximum Contaminant Level Goal.

Three hundred and forty one surveys were considered eligible for analysis. Breastfeeding initiation (defined as ever offering the breast) was high (95.3%). However, 54.2% of mothers reported experiencing PIM, with 43.9% of these mothers reporting PIM occurring within 2 days postpartum. Primary maternal indicators of PIM were not feeling the presence of milk in the breast (36.9%), perceived lack of infant satiation after feeding (33.5%), and perceived post‐nursing infant fussiness (27.8%). Over one third of mothers reported not knowing what caused PIM (34.4%), 21.1% believed PIM to be caused by poor maternal appetite, and 13.1% believed a lack of maternal liquid intake to be the cause. PIM appears to be common among Chinese mothers, especially in the early post‐partum period, and it appears that mothers are using subjective indicators to reach this conclusion. Prenatal and early post‐partum interventions, assisting mothers to correctly assess milk supply, may result in improved exclusive breastfeeding rates in China.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold><jats:italic>Grant Funding Source</jats:italic></jats:bold><jats:italic>: The University of Tennessee, Department of Nutrition, the Office of the Dean, and the Office of Research (SARIF Award)</jats:italic></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The caravan park sector of the Australian leisure accommodation industry currently provides 50% of total domestic bed capacity. Recent decades have seen a gradual decline in caravan park establishments and despite its continuing market dominance in terms of bed capacity, the industry today is only a mere shadow of its former glory days in the mid 1970s. A current resurgence in caravanning, as a subset of drive tourism, has seen an increase in registrations of new campervans and motor homes of over 19% in the last 5 years alone. This inverse relationship between downward-trending park capacity and upward-trending recreational vehicle<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> registrations raises significant capacity issues for leisure accommodation. This article examines supply-side elements of caravanning – elements largely overlooked in the demand-side focused literature – through a case study of caravan parks of the Tweed Shire in northern New South Wales (NSW), Australia. It innovatively adapts the theoretical framework of Butler’s ( Canadian Geographer 1980; 24: 5–12) tourist area life cycle (TALC) to an industry subsector, caravan parks, to examine time-series trends in park-based site-mix options and capacity. The study found that traditional site infrastructure, geared towards mobile accommodation forms of caravans and tents, is giving way to fixed forms of relocatable homes and ensuite cabins. In an environment of increasing demand for the caravanning experience but decreasing parks, and thus decreasing total site capacity, the contrasting trends are predicted to create a serious accommodation facilities shortage for the caravanning sector of the tourism industry. It concludes that the broad pattern of caravan park development, through site-mix analysis, is in alignment with the six stages of the TALC, as proposed by Butler ( Canadian Geographer 1980; 24: 5–12). Market forces have, to date, propelled caravan parks to their current stage of the TALC. However, the path to a sustainable future for Australian caravan parks will now predominately be determined through their own proactive management intervention. </jats:p>",

A logistic regression analysis was used to investigate potential correlations between TC contamination and chemical parameters (e.g. NO3−, turbidity), as well as homeowner-provided survey data describing system characteristics and perceived water quality. Of the 538 samples collected, 41% (n = 221) were positive for TCs and 10% (n = 53) for E. coli. Chemical parameters were not statistically predictive of microbial contamination. Well depth, water treatment, and farm location proximate to the water supply were factors in a regression model that predicted presence/absence of TCs with 74% accuracy. Microbial and chemical source tracking techniques (Bacteroides gene Bac32F and HF183 detection via polymerase chain reaction and optical brightener detection via fluorometry) identified four samples as likely contaminated with human wastewater.</jats:p>",

This study proposes two improved double line voltage synthesis (DLVS) strategies for matrix converters. Both strategies apply the dynamic input current modulation methods to DLVS aiming at improving input and output waveforms at the same time. Besides, simplicity is another advantage of the methods proposed in this study. Phase detection of input current modulation vector is eliminated, which reduces the calculation time of control algorithm. Numerical simulations and experiments with a 10 kW prototype are carried out. The results are given to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>E-supply chains (e-SCs), which are Internet-enabled supply chains, are progressively being implemented by companies to improve their operational and financial performance. Several studies exist where the association between the development of an e-supply chain and the performance of a firm have been investigated. However, there is a paucity of literature that describes how information technology (IT) resources interact with other complementary resources to e-supply chains that positively impact a firm’s performance. This paper seeks to adopt a resource-based view of the firm (RBVF) and empirically tests a framework that identifies and validates the relationships among IT resources, complementary resources to e-supply chains, and performance of a firm. This study utilizes secondary data from two sources – data collected by the South Korean Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE) and financial data from the Korea Exchange. The data from a total of 170 firms representing 10 industries in South Korea was analyzed using a partial least-squares technique (PLS). The results of the analysis confirm that IT resources do not directly influence supply chain performance. However, when associated with a complementary resource, IT resources positively affect both supply chain operations and a firm’s financial performance. The findings of this research support the current existing literature on the RBVF approach with regard to the domain of supply chain management, and can provide additional insights to industry practitioners on how to effectively utilize complementary resources in developing e-SCs to deliver improved performance.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Albania is a Mediterranean country where fruitsand vegetables occupy an important placein the cropping systems practiced by theAlbanian farms but also in the foodconsumption of the population. Today, the fruits and vegetables growers in Albania havelow production capacity and difficulties inselling their products on national and regionalmarket. These poor producers face problems ofhow to produce safe food (World Bank2007), be recognized as producing safe food, identify cost-effective technologies forreducing risk, and be competitive with larger producers with advantage of economies ofscale in compliance with food safety requirements. In enabling the smallholders to remaincompetitive in such a system, new institutional arrangements are required. The new andemerging food system (dominated by domestic urban market and export markets,regional competitiveness, globalization, etc.) with high demands for compliance with foodsafety and traceability disfavor the smallholders due tohigh coordination costs. Theproblem is exacerbated by geographic dispersion, low education, and poor access tocapital and information (Poulton 2005; Humphrey 2005; Rich and Narrod 2005). Themain idea of this paper is that the public-private partnerships can play a key role increating farm to fork linkages that can satisfy the market demands for food safety whileretaining smallholders in the supply chain. Our big question is “how this can be possiblein Albania and which are the rightpolicies to forward this idea?</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The design of global supply networks has evolved from traditional lowest landed cost analysis to include more strategic concepts such as how particular network configurations might support strategic and operational capabilities. An established approach to assessing operational capabilities is the maturity model methodology where the emphasis is on notions of evolution and levels of process formality. More recently, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainable supply networks, driving industrial practitioners to also address energy and resource efficiencies and waste minimisation. However, quantitative measurement approaches such as carbon footprinting beyond the firm boundary are complex and resource intensive and present significant validation challenges. This article proposes a process maturity model-based alternative to supply network carbon measurement approaches, namely, the systematic review of organisational routines and practices relevant to sustainable manufacturing. Furthermore, the incorporation of sustainability dimensions within an established supply chain maturity model architecture provides a basis for potential trade-offs. Application of the maturity model framework in 12 case studies of international manufacturing multinationals is presented, demonstrating feasibility and utility of the approach and identifying potential drivers for manufacturing sustainability linked to the industrial supply network position, including the regulatory context, and consumer sentiment. </jats:p>",

The hydrostatic rotary table supplied with constant flow rate pump is not often used due to its high cost; meanwhile, the system with constant pressure pump suffers from a relatively lower stiffness problem. In this study, an alternative type of rotary table supplied by a constant flow pump and a constant pressure one is proposed to satisfy the requirements. The mathematical model is presented on the basis of hydrostatic theory to predict the axial static performance of the table. A comparison of the performances between constant pressure supply table, constant flow supply table and constant flow and constant pressure supply table has been conducted; the results show that constant flow and constant pressure supply table is the best in static behavior. A multicriteria optimization technique based on the weighted ideal point method is better than the single criteria optimization in achieving the comprehensive property of the table. A variation rate method is used to calculate the weighted factors. The optimization problem is formulated with the maximum stiffness, the minimum power dissipation and the minimum supply pressure. </jats:p>",

These human activities have already altered the terrestrial chemical cycles and land‐ocean flux of major elements, although the extent remains difficult to quantify. When deployed on a grand scale, Enhanced Weathering (a form of mineral fertilization), the application of finely ground minerals over the land surface, could be used to remove CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> from the atmosphere. The release of cations during the dissolution of such silicate minerals would convert dissolved CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> to bicarbonate, increasing the alkalinity and pH of natural waters. Some products of mineral dissolution would precipitate in soils or be taken up by ecosystems, but a significant portion would be transported to the coastal zone and the open ocean, where the increase in alkalinity would partially counteract “ocean acidification” associated with the current marked increase in atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Other elements released during this mineral dissolution, like Si, P, or K, could stimulate biological productivity, further helping to remove CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> from the atmosphere. On land, the terrestrial carbon pool would likely increase in response to Enhanced Weathering in areas where ecosystem growth rates are currently limited by one of the nutrients that would be released during mineral dissolution. In the ocean, the biological carbon pumps (which export organic matter and CaCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> to the deep ocean) may be altered by the resulting influx of nutrients and alkalinity to the ocean. This review merges current interdisciplinary knowledge about Enhanced Weathering, the processes involved, and the applicability as well as some of the consequences and risks of applying the method.</jats:p>",

The ratio of the diastolic over the systolic pressure time integral (DPTI:SPTI) has been proposed to reflect an estimate of myocardial oxygen supply versus demand and the propensity for myocardial ischemia. We have now evaluated the potential of this ratio to predict PAR-associated cardiovascular mortality after TAVI, retrospectively analyzing data from 167 consecutive TAVI patients. PAR was graded angiographically, and the myocardial supply-demand ratio was estimated from the planimetric integration of the diastolic and systolic pressure-time area (DPTI and SPTI), respectively. PAR was observed in 113 patients (67%) and angiographically graded as mild in 89 (78.8%), moderate in 21 (18.6%) or moderate to severe in 3 (2.7%) cases. The DPTI:SPTI ratio decreased with increasing Sellers grade of PAR ( P &lt; 0.001). A DPTI:SPTI of ≤0.7 predicted cardiovascular mortality (area under the curve = 0.96). Cardiovascular mortality at 30 days and 1 yr was increased in patients with DPTI:SPTI ≤ 0.7 over those with DPTI:SPTI &gt; 0.7 (42 vs. 2% and 63 vs. 3%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, DPTI:SPTI provides an excellent cutoff value of ≤0.7 for the prediction of PAR-associated mortality.</jats:p>",

The level of discrimination of the two typing methods did not differ substantially: RFLP typing yielded 2,733 distinct patterns compared to 2,607 in VNTR typing. The global concordance, defined as isolates labeled unique or identically distributed in clusters by both methods, amounted to 78.5% (\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            = 3,123).

A cluster investigation was performed for 87% (\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            = 1,462) of the cases clustered by RFLP.

Both aspects make VNTR typing a suitable method for tuberculosis surveillance systems.\n          </jats:p>",
