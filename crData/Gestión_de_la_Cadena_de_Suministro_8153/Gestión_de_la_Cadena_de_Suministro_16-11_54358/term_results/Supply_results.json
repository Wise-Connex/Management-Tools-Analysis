      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability is an important topic in supply chain management research and practice. For buying firms, one of the most pressing challenges associated with sustainable supply chain management is that they frequently do not possess sufficient information on what is occurring in their complex supply chains, as demonstrated by numerous incidents lacking sustainability. Using eight in‐depth case studies across four industries and elaborating on information processing theory, we identify three forms of sustainability‐related uncertainty that each firm is facing in its supply chain. We refer to them as task uncertainty, source uncertainty, and supply chain uncertainty. The study shows that the extent to which these uncertainties translate into information processing needs depends on a newly identified boundary condition labeled uncertainty intolerance. With respect to the management of such information processing needs, prior research has pointed primarily at matching information processing needs with fitting information processing capacity and secondly at mitigating information processing needs with corrective measures. This study illuminates how some innovative firms occasionally employ a more radical sustainability‐driven supply chain modification mechanism. In doing so, this research exemplifies how sustainable supply chain management may eventually turn from an amendment to a firm's daily business to a decisive factor for shaping future supply chains. In addition, the study constitutes a nascent step to elevate information processing theory to the supply chain level.</jats:p>",

In addition, there is an opportunity to explicitly consider firm performance as both individual performance and relational performance.

This research investigates external pressures, internal strategic choices, and institutional imprinting influences on supply chain outsourcing and operational performance. Results of primary and secondary data from a sample of 769 firms in Russia demonstrate that industry competitor growth and decentralized outsourcing decision making encourage firms to outsource more supply chain activities. Interestingly, however, these influences are directly and indirectly thwarted within firms that have a strong imprint from the former Soviet centrally planned economy. Further, the positive impact on operational performance resulting from decentralized decision making and outsourcing becomes negative when firms have a strong Soviet imprint. This research underscores the significance of founding institutional imprints of emerging economies when considering supply chain decentralization and outsourcing decisions.</jats:p>",

An empirical research was conducted among supply chain practitioners in the municipalities based on the purposive sampling technique and the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The findings revealed that the municipalities have adopted and implemented supply chain management practices. However, supply chain management objectives are not always appropriately aligned with government policies, and the municipalities face serious supply chain issues such as leadership, lack of proper accountability and good governance. From the findings, it is evident that the lack of proper implementation of supply chain management in municipalities is the root cause of problems in service delivery in South Africa. It is recommended that municipal supply chain officials be empowered with supply chain skills for proper supply chain management execution.\nKeywords: supply chain, municipalities, practices, West Rand district.

It compares outcomes of adults without health insurance versus their insured counterparts, before and after policy implementation. The study finds that the policy reduced both the likelihood of suffering illnesses with associated lost work days and the number of lost days due to illnesses by 28.6 percent and 34 percent, respectively. Consistent with the absence of \"employment lock\", no effects are found on employment at the extensive margin. However, consistent with a reduced number of days lost due to illnesses, there is a positive effect of 2.15 additional weekly labor hours. This is primarily a labor supply effect as the study shows that both reported and imputed hourly wages decreased by 0.15 and 0.06 log-points respectively. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the policy added a yearly average of US$PPP 26.6 million worth of net real production to the economy during the period 2008-12.</jats:p>"

This trend is expected to continue as companies strive to be more competitive on a global scale. Service-oriented firms are not the only ones to benefit from supply chain flexibility strategies. Apple and Dell are both wildly successful and are considered highly flexible firms. One general complaint from all virtual workers is connectivity issues. This is inherent with the position. Locations in third world countries are more susceptible to online issues. If a constant source of electricity or internet availability is an issue, it goes without saying that workers’ productivity will be affected. So far, this potential downfall has not proven a major problem for companies. Will other companies follow the leader and begin using more remote access positions within their firms? If they value the knowledge from benchmarking, then yes.

      "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Introduction</jats:title><jats:p>There exist several barriers to maternal health service utilization in developing<jats:bold />countries. Most of the previous studies conducted in India have focused on demand-side barriers, while only a few have touched upon supply-side barriers. None of the previous studies in India have investigated the factors that affect maternal health care utilization at health sub-centers (HSCs) in India, despite the fact that these institutions, which are the geographically closest available public health care facilities in rural areas, play a significant role in providing affordable maternal health care. Therefore, this study aims to examine the supply-side determinants of maternal service utilization at HSCs in rural India.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Data and Methods</jats:title><jats:p>This study uses health facility data from the nationally representative<jats:bold />District-Level Household Survey, which was administered in 2007–2008 to examine the effect of supply-side variables on the utilization of maternal health care services across HSCs in rural India. Since the dependent variables (the number of antenatal registrations, in-facility deliveries, and postnatal care services) are count variables and exhibit considerable variability, the data were analyzed using negative binomial regression instead of Poisson regression.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>The results show that those HSCs run by a contractual auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) are likely to offer a lower volume of services when compared to those run by a permanent ANM. The availability of obstetric drugs, weighing scales, and blood pressure equipment is associated with the increased utilization of antenatal and postnatal services. The unavailability of a labor/examination table and bed screen is associated with a reduction in the number of deliveries and postnatal services. The utilization of services is expected to increase if essential facilities, such as water, telephones, toilets, and electricity, are available at the HSCs. Monitoring of ANM’s work by Village Health and Sanitation Committee (VHSC) and providing in-service training to ANM appear to have positive impacts on service utilization. The distance of ANM’s actual residence from the sub-center village where she works is negatively associated with the utilization of delivery and postnatal services. These findings are robust to the inclusion of several demand-side factors.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>To improve maternal health care utilization at HSCs, the government should<jats:bold />ensure the availability of basic infrastructure, drugs, and equipment at all locations. Monitoring of the ANMs’ work by VHSCs could play an important role in improving health care utilization at the HSCs; therefore, it is important to establish VHSCs in each sub-center village. The relatively low utilization of maternity services in those HSCs that are run solely by contractual ANMs requires further investigation.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Flexibility can be achieved by adapting the energy supply processes and integrating new components, e.g. energy storages. Another way to increase flexibility is to optimize the plant operation to exploit the full potential of the industrial plant. This paper presents a concept for optimal plant control for more flexible operation, using a two-stage optimization approach, combining a quadratic and a nonlinear optimization problem formulation. The optimization concept is demonstrated by means of a simple model plant. The input parameters are energy prices and production schedules respectively heat demands to be satisfied by the plant’s energy supply system. The output is the optimal control trajectory for the considered plant components. Four different scenarios, with varying plant configurations, are simulated and the results are discussed in terms of the optimization approach and the impact of different plant configurations.</jats:p>",

It was identified two ways on which biodiesel companies acquire methanol: a) via long-term contracts or b) in the spot market. If the first option means supply safety, the second one means more competitive prices. This qualitative study was built from two different data collection steps: a) participant observation and b) semi-structured interviews.</jats:p>"

More specifically, the Inspection Test Plan (ITP) budgets are being increasingly subjected to cost reductions pressure that is often based on inconsistent methodologies across the oil and gas industry and sometimes within the same company.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>DNV GL developed a consistent risk based methodology (Next generation inspection, NGI) that combines: criticality of equipment and/or material, • criticality of suppliers, equipment and supplier historical data; and enables the reduction of the overall ITP budget in a consistent and controlled manner while using data smart concepts.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the procurement phase, NGI introduces a tool to measure a manufacturer's ability to control the process and product quality by using a rating assessment methodology and quantitatively documenting the operation's \"capability level\" measured against the project's or asset's specific criteria. This would recognize and prevent potential complications and improve manufacturing processes during production or in pre-contract phase in connection with new projects.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Assessed vendor's ratings along with equipment/material design criticality are then used to develop a matrix with \"inspection criticality\" output. Inspection interventions in the ITP can then be marked based on the inspection criticality which streamlines the process into an optimized plan culminating in lesser inspections with more reliable and higher added value on the output.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The data smart platform provides information that is known about an item or equipment historically and conversely identifies where there is a lack of information about a supplier capability or equipment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>It is recognized in the industry that CAPEX related inspection costs could be further reduced by inspection of equipment based on their criticality.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Despite the availability of equipment inspection data, learning from past events and historical data is not being consistently used in determining this criticality due to the lack of an overall data mining and analysis capability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Furthermore, the anomalies in the supply of products by unqualified vendors/suppliers to oil and gas projects are causing significant shortfalls in the quality of the goods delivered. This has led to a major impact on delivery schedules and spiraling costs resulting in the loss of revenue on these projects. Again vendor/manufacturer historical data exists but are randomly used.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This methodology involves a combination of traditional inspection methods and the development of a practical risk-based strategy capable of minimizing the inspection costs while maintaining and improving the effectiveness of the work carried out on a data smart platform.</jats:p>",

Biochar can offer a range of environmental services, such as reclamation of degraded land, improvement of soil fertility and carbon sequestration. However, it also raises questions, regarding sustainable feedstock provision, biomass pyrolysis, and soil amendment. These questions, among various others, are addressed in this state-of-the-art compendium. Covering a broad geographical range, with regional assessments from North America, Europe, the Near East, and Southeast Asia, this interdisciplinary volume focuses on the entire biochar supply chain, from the availability and economics of biomass resources, to pyrolysis, and ultimately to the impacts on soil properties. The combination of theory with practical examples makes this a valuable book for researchers, policymakers, and graduate students alike, in fields such as soil science, sustainable development, climate change mitigation, biomass and bioenergy, forestry, and environmental engineering.</jats:p>",

Numerical approaches to modeling pollution transmission in rivers are useful tools for managing the water quality. The advection-dispersion equation is the governing equation in the transport of pollution in rivers. Recently, due to advances in fractional calculus in engineering modeling, the simulation of pollution transmission in rivers has been improved using the fractional derivative approach. In this study, by solving the fractional advection-dispersion equation (FRADE), a numerical model was developed for the simulation of pollution transmission in rivers with stagnant zones. To this purpose, both terms of the FRADE equation (advection and fractional dispersion) were discretized separately and the results were connected using a time-splitting technique. The analytical solution of a modified advection-dispersion equation (MADE) model and observed data from the Severn River in the UK were used to demonstrate the model capabilities. Results indicated that there is a good agreement between observed data, the analytical solution of the MADE model, and the results of the developed numerical model. The developed numerical model can accurately simulate the long-tailed dispersion processes in a natural river.</jats:p>",

The SPSS statistical analysis software was used on these experimental data to construct multivariate prediction models on the permeability-reducing effects of cement infiltration into sandy soils. The results indicate that it is possible to predict permeability-reducing effects using transfer functions. Relatively satisfactory predictions were achieved by inputting the postponed time of water supply, soil dry density, quantity of added cement, water pressure head of cement infiltration, physical clay-silt particle content of soil, and other factors as independent variables. A comparison between the multivariate linear and non-linear models showed that the two models had similar accuracy. The multivariate linear model is relatively simple, and hence can be used to predict permeability-reducing effects. The development of the models has scientific implications for soil modification by altering soil permeability through cement infiltration. It also has practical significance in predictive research on reducing the migration of ground surface pollutants into groundwater.</jats:p>",

Most TSC studies, to date, assumed the market demand to be influenced only by tour price under price competitive environment, not considering the effect of advertising investment. In order to address this problem, two models are established considering decentralized channels: tour operator Stackelberg (TS) and local operator Stackelberg (LS). We analytically show TS model to provide better results than LS model and advertising to strongly influence the channel members’ pricing strategies and profit. Then we generalized the solution considering multiple operators under price competition. We studied two coordination mechanisms, cooperative advertising and two-part tariff, and found the two-part tariff provides better mechanism for improving the profit in LS model compared to cooperative advertisement. </jats:p>",

This paper seeks to attain a more differentiated understanding of how uncertainties concerning the energy transition play out and are dealt with in policymaking and planning “on the ground.” To do so, the paper combines conceptual reflections with an explorative empirical study on local heat supply policy in Switzerland. In conceptual regards, it proposes some distinctions of types of uncertainties related to energy transitions, and a typology of strategic decision options for dealing with uncertainty. On this basis, the paper reveals similarities and differences regarding the perception of uncertainties and ways of dealing with them in a number of Swiss cities. These insights evoke further questions about the causes and effects of different sensitivities to uncertainty and ways of dealing with them.</jats:p>"

With the set pair analysis method, the uncertainty properties of runoff series with different multi-time scales are expressed. Meanwhile, cointegration theory is introduced to indicate the long-term equilibrium relationships between runoff series, and then the runoff prediction model is proposed based on the error correction model (ECM). The results show that the runoff series of Heihe River in northwest China exhibit complex relations with different periodic fluctuations and changing laws. The identity degree is the main relation between two runoff series, especially in the short period.

A green supply chain performance measurement (GSPM) model was developed from the combination of various concepts including an SCM logistics scorecard, a supply chain operations reference model, a balance scorecard, and green supply chain management. The GSPM has been designed for use as a self-evaluation tool focusing on five decisive areas, or factors, and 28 sub-factors. A factor analysis was conducted using the survey results of the GSPM in order to identify significant factors that represent the green supply chain operation performance. Grouped as three major factors, namely green procurement, green transportation, and green manufacturing; reverse logistics and eco-design; and reuse and recycle of manufacturing, their significance and impact on the auto parts industry in Thailand were highlighted. Specifically, the factor of green procurement, green transportation, and green manufacturing, as major factor 1, in relation with the factor of reverse logistics and eco-design, as major factor 2, were found to have a strong positive relationship with the asset turnover ratio.</jats:p>"

The aqueduct once transported water from the Jadro River spring, situated approximately 3 km east of the city. Even though it was built for a city of 15 ha in size, two centuries later it succeeded in managing the supply and demand of water for a city of 73 ha. In the 7th century Salona was destroyed by the Avars and Slavs, and consequently, the aqueduct ceased to function. Due to intensive exploitation of marlstone and uncontrolled 20th century urbanization, some of the aqueduct's sections have been destroyed. Research on Salona and its aqueduct started as early as the mid-19th century, however, the aqueduct and its route have never been systematically explored until 2014–2015. This paper provides the results and findings of the latest research including the following: the route of the aqueduct, its longitudinal profile, capacity and typical cross-sections, and the method of construction in different terrain conditions. The channel was built in the usual manner in accordance with the practice of Roman builders, using local materials.</jats:p>",

Here we ask how low supply of dietary carbon affects somatic growth, reproduction, and survival of &lt;em&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/em&gt; and test effects of higher water temperature (+3 °C relative to ambient) and brownification (3X higher than natural water color; both predicted effects of climate change) during fall cooling. We predicted that even at very low carbon supply (~5µg C L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), higher water temperature and brownification will allow &lt;em&gt;D. magna&lt;/em&gt; to increase its fitness. Neonates (&amp;lt;24 h old) were incubated with lake seston for 4 weeks (October-November 2013) in experimental bottles submerged in outdoor mesocosms to explore effects of warmer and darker water. Higher temperature and brownification did not significantly affect food quality, as assessed by its fatty acid composition. &lt;em&gt;Daphnia&lt;/em&gt; exposed to both increased temperature and brownification had highest somatic growth and were the only that reproduced, and higher temperature caused the highest &lt;em&gt;Daphnia&lt;/em&gt; survival success. These results suggest that even under low temperature and thus lower physiological activity, low food quantity is more important than its quality for &lt;em&gt;D. magna&lt;/em&gt; fitness.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;This research has examined the issue of supply chain disruptions and how they affect price volatility in the commodities marketplace. Specifically, this point was discussed and examined in relation to the rice imports undertaken by Saudi Arabia with respect to how supply chain disruptions in the rice supply channel contributes to price volatility. The supply chain was first identified to consist of various nodes along which market participants work to move the commodity from one point to another. The observation was confirmed that any disruptions up the supply chain tended to manifest themselves in downstream effects such as the bullwhip effect in which increased inventory levels or decreasing inventory levels are felt successively further down the supply chain. These and factors relating to supply as well as demand in other markets also were identified to contribute to price volatility for Saudi Arabia and its rice imports. The analysis demonstrated that every major global economic disturbance over the past 50 years corresponded to fluctuations in the price of food commodities. Saudi Arabia was shown to receive the vast majority of rice supplies from a single market which is India. India supplies Saudi Arabia with some 72% of its rice imports which ensures that any transportation or customs issue encountered by any supply channel participant prior to the Kingdom’s receipt of its rice will alter the price profile of these rice commodities. Saudi Arabia was shown to already have experienced substantial price volatility of its rice imports with much of this volatility originating in India due to suppliers in India responding to competing demand for its Basmati varieties of rice. This volatility was manifested during 2012 and 2013 when rice prices per metric ton increased some 40% overall. Finally, this report also undertook regression analysis of the rice import data that found positive correlations between variables such as time between harvest and distribution, milling facility ownership and road/shipping lane conditions and the price structure of rice. The conclusion is that supply chain disruptions can and periodically do result in price volatility for rice in Saudi Arabia. Hence, this report finds that certain factors such as information access, the establishment of long-term contracts as well as trade group membership can be effective at reducing the transaction costs in the Kingdom’s rice market. Essentially, these factors can work to place downward pressure on rice prices by the metric ton which would flatten out some of the price volatility in Saudi Arabia’s rice imports.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Gas and power networks are tightly coupled and interact with each other due to physically interconnected facilities. In an integrated gas and power network, a contingency observed in one system may cause iterative cascading failures, resulting in network wide disruptions. Therefore, understanding the impacts of the interactions in both systems is crucial for governments, system operators, regulators and operational planners, particularly, to ensure security of supply for the overall energy system. Although simulation has been widely used in the assessment of gas systems as well as power systems, there is a significant gap in simulation models that are able to address the coupling of both systems. In this paper, a simulation framework that models and simulates the gas and power network in an integrated manner is proposed. The framework consist of a transient model for the gas system and a steady state model for the power system based on AC-Optimal Power Flow. The gas and power system model are coupled through an interface which uses the coupling equations to establish the data exchange and coordination between the individual models. The bidirectional interlink between both systems considered in this studies are the fuel gas offtake of gas fired power plants for power generation and the power supply to LNG terminals and electric drivers installed in gas compressor stations and underground gas storage facilities. The simulation framework is implemented into an innovative simulation tool named SAInt (Scenario Analysis Interface for Energy Systems) and the capabilities of the tool are demonstrated by performing a contingency analysis for a real world example. Results indicate how a disruption triggered in one system propagates to the other system and affects the operation of critical facilities. In addition, the studies show the importance of using transient gas models for security of supply studies instead of successions of steady state models, where the time evolution of the line pack is not captured correctly.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we present a model-based framework to assess the value of ICESs for the local communities. The distributed energy resources-consumer adoption model (DER-CAM) based ICES model is used to assess the value of an ICES in the Netherlands. For the considered community size and local conditions, grid-connected ICESs are already beneficial to the alternative of solely being supplied from the grid both in terms of total energy costs and CO2 emissions, whereas grid-defected systems, although performing very well in terms of CO2 emission reduction, are still rather expensive.</jats:p>"

In Finland, the increasing concentration of the distribution sector and processing industry has raised concern over the existence and gradual growth of buyer power in these sectors. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possible existence of buyer power in the Finnish food supply chain. More specifically, we follow an approach used by Lloyd et al. (2009) to measure oligopsony power among the Finnish food industry and retailers against farmers. The results suggest that the spread between producer and retailer prices in Finland is not consistent with perfectly competitive behaviour, and might thus be caused, at least as a candidate amongst other factors, by the existence of oligopsony power in the Finnish food supply chain.</jats:p>"

Using the fact that in traditional, patriarchal societies, sons are generally preferred to daughters, we isolate exogenous variation in the number of children born to a mother and relate it to the agricultural labor supply and production in Uganda, which has a dominant agricultural sector and high fertility. We find that fertility has a sizable negative effect on household labor allocation to subsistence agriculture. Households with lower fertility devote significantly more time to land preparation and weeding; larger households grow less matooke and sweet potatoes. We find no significant effect on agricultural productivity in terms of yield per land area.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a hybrid evaluation model based on rough set theory and a matter-element model was used to evaluate the value of eight NOM removal processes. The counting process of the weighting factor did not include any subjective information which avoided the artificial factor deviation and made the evaluation more objective. The result indicated that in addition to the MIEX + coagulation + sedimentation + filtration (MCSF) treatment process, the rest of the NOM treatment processes had a certain value; the coagulation + sedimentation + filtration + adsorption (CSFA) and coagulation + sedimentation + filtration + membrane (CSFM) treatment processes had the highest values which meant that these treatment processes could remove the NOM in drinking water effectively. It also illustrated that the coagulation + sedimentation + adsorption + membrane (CSAM) treatment process had high feasibility, which has important significance for guaranteeing the safety of drinking water.</jats:p>",

Experimental results revealed that nitrogen (N) and P cell quotas significantly increased with increasing P concentration. However, despite the wide range of N:P ratios in the medium, &lt;em&gt;Cryptomonas&lt;/em&gt; N:P ratios were highly stable at higher P-level treatments, indicating a highly conservative behavior and suggesting strict elemental homeostasis when nutrients are at saturating levels. The strictly homeostatic N:P ratio appears to be attributable to their high potential for a fast luxury consumption of both N and P after a brief and intense episode of increased resource availability and to physiological limits on their nutrient storage capacity. Most importantly, the N:P biomass ratio at nutrient saturating levels converged around 11:1, which was the observed ratio of maximum internal cell quotas for N and P (i.e. &lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) under the prevailing experimental conditions. This value is particularly informative for &lt;em&gt;C. pyrenoidifera&lt;/em&gt; because it represents cell storage quotients and may be a taxon-specific evolutionary optimum, providing a reference point to infer the grade of nutrient-limitation. The experimental data give ranges of variation in &lt;em&gt;C. pyrenoidifera &lt;/em&gt;elemental composition permitting, among others, proper parameterization of cryptophyte stoichiometry models.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Delivering water in sufficient quantity and acceptable quality is the main objective of water distribution networks (WDN) and at the same time is the main challenge. Many factors affect the delivery of water through distribution networks. Some of these factors are relevant to water quality, quantity and the condition of the infrastructure itself. The deterioration of water quality in the WDN leads to failure at the water quality level, which can be critical because it is closest to the point of delivery and there are virtually no safety barriers before consumption. Accordingly, developing a powerful monitoring system that takes into consideration water demand distribution, the vulnerability of the distribution system and the sensitivity of the population to the deterioration of water quality can be very beneficial and, more importantly, could save lives if there was any deterioration of water quality due to operational failure or cross-contamination events. In this paper, a framework for a water quality monitoring system that considers water demand distribution, the vulnerability of the system and the sensitivity of the population using fuzzy synthetic evaluation and optimization algorithms is developed. The proposed approach has been applied to develop a monitoring system for a real WDN in Saudi Arabia.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A polyurethane (PU) foam nanocomposite impregnated with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) was developed to remove arsenic (As) from drinking water at ppb concentrations. The effect of synthesis and application parameters such as the size of IONPs, pH levels, weight of adsorbents, and arsenic concentrations on the performance of PU-IONP adsorbents in removing arsenic were studied. The prepared adsorbents were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray microscopy to evaluate the microstructure of PU-IONPs and the surface adsorption of arsenic species, respectively. Atomic absorption spectrometry was conducted to measure the concentration of arsenic in the treated solutions in order to calculate the removal capacity of PU-IONPs. The experimental results revealed that decreasing the size of IONPs from 50–100 nm to 15–20 nm yields a higher removal capacity. Increasing the weight of the used adsorbents and the contact time led to an increase in the removal capacity as well. As the arsenic species (III and V) concentration increased in the solution, the removal capacity of PU-IONPs decreased. In a column study, a long-term cyclic operation mode was found to be very effective in removing arsenic; 100% removal capacity was achieved when 500 ml of As solution (100 ppb) was treated.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we study a newly formed filament located inside the active region NOAA 11762, which was observed by the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory from 16:40:19 UT to 17:07:58 UT on 2013 June 5. As revealed by the H<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> filtergrams, cool material is seen to be injected into the filament spine with a speed of 5–10 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. At the source of the injection, brightenings are identified in the chromosphere, which are accompanied by magnetic cancellation in the photosphere, implying the importance of magnetic reconnection in replenishing the filament with plasmas from the lower atmosphere. Counter-streamings are detected near one endpoint of the filament, with the plane-of-the-sky speed being 7–9 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the H<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> red-wing filtergrams and 9–25 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the blue-wing filtergrams. The observations are indicative that this active region filament is supported by a sheared arcade without magnetic dips, and the counter-streamings are due to unidirectional flows with alternative directions, rather than due to the longitudinal oscillations of filament threads as in many other filaments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Downstream firms increasingly recognize the importance of integrating social and environmental concerns with their businesses. As a consequence, they urge to create incentives for their suppliers to invest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Contracts to provide these incentives are rarely observed in practice. If not totally absent, contracts may be incomplete, in that unforeseen contingencies or some CSR attributes that are difficult to measure may not be included in the contract. We show that incentives for CSR investments can also be provided through the supply chain structure, which consists of the distribution of ownership rights over the firms' assets of production, and involves horizontal and/or vertical alliances among supply chain members. Motivated by examples in agricultural contexts, this study adopts the property rights approach to study the impact of supply chain structures on the adoption of CSR activities. We show that the structure that best incentivizes CSR investments depends on the interaction between CSR vertical synergy, free‐riding, and countervailing power. One of the main findings is that the alliance between suppliers is beneficial only if the revenues generated by a downstream investment are sufficiently high. In fact, only in this case, the suppliers can appropriate a sufficiently large stake of the revenues generated downstream, thanks to their countervailing power. When the upstream investment costs become high, however, the suppliers will invest in CSR only if the downstream distributor is vertically integrated. The resulting structure of a cooperative will best incentivize CSR investments only if the CSR vertical synergy between the two tiers of the supply chain is sufficiently high. </jats:p>",

As a by-product of the phosphate fertilizer industry, it may contain contaminants that are harmful to human health. The aims of this study were to assess the quality control analysis of fluorosilicic acid; to detect the presence of contaminants, such as arsenic, lead, cadmium, aluminum, barium, strontium, cobalt, iron, and sulfur in fluorosilicic acid samples by using inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry; and to collect data for water analysis performed at a water treatment plant. The results show the presence of all contaminants mentioned previously, except for lead, in fluorosilicic acid samples from all sources. No quality control was carried out or required for this product at any time. Although the water analyses indicate the water is potable, there are no minimum safe limits for human consumption regarding carcinogenic elements such as cadmium and arsenic and both were detected and released in the water. Therefore, the purity of fluorosilicic acid used for water fluoridation should be required and monitored by public administrations to avoid long-term public health problems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In automotive and electronics supply chains, sustainability assessment is gaining increasing importance. More stringent regulations and growing customer pressure are driving the change towards more environmentally, socially and economically responsible supply chains. Since this implies a rising use of resources for data collection, monitoring, exchange and assessment, the objective of this paper is to facilitate supply chain sustainability assessment. The present paper first provides a tailored set of 69 supply chain sustainability indicators for the European automotive and electronics industries. These were derived on the basis of a systematic literature review, together with 13 semi-structured interviews and five focus group workshops, all of which involved sustainability and industry experts. Second, the paper provides a case example of software-based supply chain sustainability data exchange. The extent to which sustainability information is currently exchanged in the two industries is also analyzed. The set of indicators is scientifically relevant since it considers all three dimensions of sustainability and is intended to allow for supply chain-wide sustainability assessment in two specific industries. It is also of high practical relevance since it was developed with and validated by industry experts, and also since it considers industrial and technical requirements for supply chain sustainability assessment in order to increase the efficiency of the work processes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The management of remanufacturing inventory system is often challenged by mismatched supply (i.e., returned units, called cores) and demand. Typically, the demand for remanufactured units is high and exceeds the supply early in a product's lifetime, and drops below the supply late in the lifetime. This supply–demand imbalance motivates us to study a switching strategy to facilitate the decision‐making process. This strategy deploys a push mode at the early stage of a product's lifetime, which remanufactures scarce cores to stock to responsively satisfy the high demand, and switches to a pull mode as the product approaches obsolescence to accurately match the low demand with supply. In addition, the strategy further simplifies the decision‐making process by ignoring the impact of leftover cores at the end of each decision period. We show that the optimal policy of the switching strategy possesses a simple, multi‐dimensional base‐stock structure, which aims to remanufacture units from the i best‐quality categories up to the ith state‐independent base‐stock level. An extensive numerical study shows that the switching strategy delivers close‐to‐optimal and robust performance: the strategy only incurs an average profit loss of 1.21% and a maximum of 2.27%, compared with the optimal one. The numerical study also shows when a pure push or pull strategy, a special case of the switching strategy, delivers good performance. The study offers the managerial insight that firms can use simple, easy‐to‐implement strategies to efficiently manage the remanufacturing inventory system. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. In the 21st century, climate change in combination with increasing demand, mainly from population growth, will exert greater pressure on the ecosystems of the Sahel to supply food and feed resources. The balance between supply and demand (annual biomass required for human consumption) serves as a key metric for quantifying basic resource shortfalls over broad regions.  Here we apply an exploratory modelling framework to analyze the variations in the timing and geography of different NPP (net primary production) supply-demand scenarios (with distinct assumptions determining supply and demand) for the 21st century Sahel. We achieve this by coupling a simple NPP supply model (forced with projections from four representative concentration pathways) with a global, reduced-complexity demand model (driven by socio-economic data and assumptions derived from five shared socio-economic pathways).  For the scenario that deviates least from current socio-economic and climate trends, we find that per capita NPP outstrips its supply in the 2070s, while by 2050, half the countries in the Sahel experience NPP shortfalls. We also find that despite variations in the timing of the onset of NPP shortfalls, demand cannot consistently be met across the majority of scenarios. Moreover, large between-country variations are shown across the scenarios where by the year 2050, some countries consistently experience shortage, others surplus while yet others shift from surplus to shortage. At the local level (i.e. grid cell) hotspots of total NPP shortfall consistently occur in the same locations across all scenarios, but vary in size and magnitude. These hotspots are linked to population density and high demand. For all scenarios, total simulated NPP supply doubles by 2050 but is outpaced by increasing demand due to a combination of population growth and adoption of a diets rich in animal products. Finally, variations in the timing of onset and end of supply shortfalls stem from the assumptions that underpin the shared socio-economic pathways rather than the representative concentration pathways.  Our results suggest that the UN sustainable development goals for eradicating hunger are at high risk for failure. This emphasizes the importance of policy interventions such as the implementation of sustainable and healthy diets, family planning, reducing yield gaps, and encouraging transfer of resources to impoverished areas via trade relations.\n                        </jats:p>"

HS were negative and patients with EuHT positive for thyroid peroxidase antibodies and/or thyroglobulin antibodies. Thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels were obtained. The fT4/fT3 ratio was calculated.Results: In the period 1995-1998, 917 HS had significantly lower fT4/fT3 ratio than 644 HS in the period 1999-2002 (2.6±0.6 and 2.9±0.9, respectively, p&lt;0.001) on account of significantly higher fT3 (median 5.7 and 5.2 pmol/L, p&lt;0.001). Similarly, in 1995-1998, 482 patients with EuHT had a lower fT4/fT3 ratio than 846 EuHT in 1999-2002 (2.4±0.6 and 2.8±0.7, respectively, p&lt;0.001) on account of significantly higher fT3 (median 5.8 and 4.9, respectively, p=0.018). HS had a higher fT4/fT3 ratio than patients with EuHT in 1995-1998 but not in 1999-2002 (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.206, respectively).Conclusions: Amelioration of iodine supply is associated with an increase in the fT4/fT3 ratio on account of lower fT3, and with a similar thyroid function in HS and in patients with EuHT.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study verifies the skill and reliability of ensemble water supply forecasts issued by an innovative operational Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service (HEFS) of the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) at eight Sierra Nevada watersheds in the State of California. The factors potentially influencing the forecast skill and reliability are also explored. Retrospective ensemble forecasts of April–July runoff with 60 traces for these watersheds from 1985 to 2010 are generated with the HEFS driven by raw precipitation and temperature reforecasts from operational Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) for the first 15 days and climatology from day 16 up to day 365. Results indicate that the forecast skill is limited when the lead time is long (over three months or before January) but increases through the forecast period. There is generally a negative bias in the most probable forecast (median forecast) for most study watersheds. When the mean forecast is investigated instead, the bias becomes mostly positive and generally smaller in magnitude. The forecasts, particularly the wet forecasts (with less than 10% exceedance probability) are reliable on the average. The low April–July flows (with higher than 90% exceedance probability) are forecast more frequently than their actual occurrence frequency, while the medium April–July flows (90% to 10% exceedance) are forecast to occur less frequently. The forecast skill and reliability tend to be sensitive to extreme conditions. Particularly, the wet extremes show more significant impact than the dry extremes. Using different forcing data, including pure climatology and Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) shows no consistent improvement in the forecast skill and reliability, neither does using a longer (than the study period 1985–2010) period of record. Overall, this study is meaningful in the context of (1) establishing a benchmark for future enhancements (i.e., newer version of HEFS, GEFS and CFSv2) to ensemble water supply forecasting systems and (2) providing critical information (on what skill and reliability to expect at a given lead time, water year type and location) to water resources managers in making uncertainty-informed decisions in maximizing the reliability of the water supply.</jats:p>"

Representative groundwater samples (25 numbers) were collected from five hand-dug wells, and their metal concentrations were assessed as per standard procedures, and deterministic interpolation techniques were used to perform the spatial distribution of heavy metal concentration maps. The ranges of concentrations of these metals in groundwaters were: Pb (0.11–0.34 mg/L &amp;gt; 0.025 mg/L); Cd (0.00–0.08 mg/L &amp;gt; 0.005 mg/L); Cr (0.12–1.33 mg/L &amp;gt; 0.05 mg/L) and Ni (0.11–0.46 mg/L &amp;gt; 0.05 mg/L). Besides, the average metal concentrations in the groundwaters of the sampling sites were in general higher than the prescribed World Health Organization (WHO) norms. The risk assessment indicated that the population concerned are considered unsafe, and are therefore exposed to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects on health. The occurrence of more than permissible levels of heavy metals in the representative groundwaters and their spatial distribution indicate that there is a potential threat from these contaminants to the public health in the Ntem watershed.</jats:p>",

We manufactured filter disks with varied clay, burn-out material, burn-out material sieved with different mesh sizes, and burn-out material to clay ratios and calculated filter characteristics, including porosity, density, shrinkage, and flow rate. Water was run through filters daily for 4 weeks, and flow rate and Escherichia coli reduction, as measured by log reduction value (LRV), were tested twice weekly. Our results suggest: (1) the first and last LRV test results do not correlate strongly (R2 = 0.38, p &amp;lt; 0.010); (2) there is not a strong association between flow rate and first, average, or last LRV results (R2 = 0.17, p = 0.090; R2 = 0.30, p = 0.020; R2 = 0.24, p = 0.040); and (3) first and average LRV are associated with burn-out material (R2 = 0.68, p &amp;lt; 0.001; R2 = 0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and last LRV is associated with burn-out material and mesh size (R2 = 0.54, p &amp;lt; 0.050).

The mean and ranges of heavy metal concentrations were measured in water, sediments, soil profiles and surface soils under four land uses along the Shunde Waterway, a drinking water supply area in China. Hazard quotients (HQs) were estimated for various exposure routes and heavy metal species. Riverbank vegetable plots and private vegetable plots had 95<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> percentiles of total HQs greater than 3 and 1, respectively, indicating high risks of cultivation on the flooded riverbank. Vegetable uptake and leaching to groundwater were the two transfer routes of soil metals causing high health risks. Exposure risks during outdoor recreation, farming and swimming along the Shunde Waterway are theoretically safe. Arsenic and cadmium were identified as the priority pollutants that contribute the most risk among the heavy metals. Sensitivity analysis showed that the exposure route, variations in exposure parameters, mobility of heavy metals in soil, and metal concentrations all influenced the risk estimates.</jats:p>"

In this study, a series of field measurements were therefore carried out to examine the current noise situation. The noise levels were measured in the bathrooms of the upper and lower floors, as well as in habitable rooms. The measurement results for the bathrooms of the lower floor (N = 113) are 47.8 dBA (water closet), 42.7 dBA (basin), and 33.9 dBA (bathtub) for water drainage, while values vary between 33.7 dBA and 37.0 dBA for the water supply. The results suggest that the water drainage noise needs to be controlled first. The system bathroom (42.8 dBA) produced lower noise levels than the wet construction method (48.2 dBA) for all of the sanitary wares. The highest noise levels in the living rooms (N = 11) and bedrooms (N = 8) of the lower floor are 34.3 dBA and 39.1 dBA, respectively. The average noise level in the rooms (N = 19) is 37.8 dBA. The overall result suggests that it is necessary to develop an acoustic guideline to satisfy the higher Class of the 2nd ISO/CD 19488, although the current noise level satisfies Class C (living room) and Class D (bedroom).</jats:p>"

The study investigates this phenomenon only within the basic supply chain structure, constituted by the primary members. Another challenge is to examine if the effects of external risk factors (e.g. natural disasters) may also be transferred to other links in the supply chain structure, and what are the similarities and differences (if any) between the mechanism of propagation and amplification of disruptions elicited by internal and external risk factors. Another future direction of study is to define other ways of identification and measurement of the “snowball effect” in order to make cross-industrial and international comparisons of disruptions amplified in the transmission more standardized and objective. In the current study, the phenomenon of the “snowball effect” is anchored in the subjective opinions of managers who may view the problem from different angles.

The better the managers understand the nature of the “snowball effect” in the transmission of disruptions, the easier it is for them to allocate resources and apply necessary managerial tools to mitigate the negative consequences of risk more effectively. The deliverables of the study also confirm that the interorganizational exchange of information accompanying the supply chain integration enables to mitigate the strength of the “snowball effect” in the transmission of disruptions. Another important implication is the broadening of practical expertise concerning the use of integration not only as a means of obtaining and sustaining supply chain effectiveness and efficiency, but also as the way to mitigate the “snowball effect” in the transmission of disruptions. Therefore, nowadays the supply chain managers are facing another challenging task – namely, how to balance supply chain integration in terms of span and intensity to ensure profits from integration and mitigate the negative risk consequences transmitted among the links in supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper elaborates on the underestimated issue of the “snowball effect” in the transmission of disruptions and its drivers.

However, due to steep terrain and non availability of a groundwater aquifer, water conservation is a challenge. The water received as rainfall drains away through the steep terrain in the deep valleys, thereby creating a water stress after withdrawal of the monsoon. To overcome such a situation, a study was undertaken to design a suitable rain water harvesting system for the state. To design a suitable water harvesting system, we estimated the water demand of the end users, assessed the water availability during the non-rainy period, and designed the volume of storage structure. The study revealed that more than 80% of the respondents experienced water stress during the period from December to March. The average daily water demand of individual households was observed to be around 400 litres. The rainfall pattern indicated that 90% of the rainfall is concentrated during 6 rainy months. On average, 24 consecutive dry days were observed in the state. The volume of storage structure obtained, based on water availability and demand, was 5 m3 per household. It is felt that this volume can take care of the domestic water demand.</jats:p>",

In this study, silicon isotopic signatures (δ30Si) of silicic acid (DSi) and suspended biogenic silica (BSi) were investigated through the whole water column with unprecedented spatial resolution, during the KEOPS-2 experiment (spring 2011). We used δ30Si measurements to track the sources of silicon that fuelled the bloom, and investigated the seasonal evolution of the Si biogeochemical cycle in the iron-fertilized area. We compared the results from stations with various degrees of iron enrichment and bloom conditions to an HNLC reference station. Dissolved and particulate δ30Si signatures were highly variable in the upper 500 m, reflecting the effect of intense silicon utilization in spring, while they were quite homogeneous in deeper waters. The Si isotopic and mass balance identified a unique Winter Water (WW) Si source for the iron-fertilized area that originated from southeast of the Kerguelen Plateau and spread northward. When the WW reached a retroflection of the Polar Front (PF), the δ30Si composition of the silicic acid pool became progressively heavier. This would result from sequential diapycnal and isopycnal mixings between the initial WW and ML water masses, highlighting the strong circulation of surface waters that defined this zone. When comparing the results from the two KEOPS expeditions, the relationship between DSi depletion, BSi production, and their isotopic composition appears decoupled in the iron-fertilized area. This seasonal decoupling could help to explain the low apparent fractionation factor observed in the ML at the end of summer. Taking into account these considerations, we refined the seasonal net BSi production in the ML of the iron-fertilized area to 3.0 ± 0.3 mol Si m−2 yr−1, which was exclusively sustained by surface water phytoplankton populations. These insights confirm that the isotopic composition of dissolved and particulate silicon is a promising tool to improve our understanding of the Si biogeochemical cycle since the isotopic and mass balance allows resolution of processes in the Si cycle (i.e. uptake, dissolution, mixing).\n                    </jats:p>"

In order to improve the performance of the air supply, a small rechargeable lithium‐ion battery is utilized to start up the PEMFC system and provide buffer power supply for the load demand. With energy consumption of the compressor considered, a power coordinating algorithm utilizing a virtual potential field approach is presented to manage the power demand for the PEMFC and the battery while maintaining the battery's state of charge. A nonlinear observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable states of the air supply system and its convergence is proven. A nonlinear MPC method is proposed to control the air flow and ensure the adequate oxygen supply. Simulation results are provided to validate the performance of the power management algorithm and the air supply control method. Compared with the results of the MPC algorithm and the nonlinear MPC method for the PEMFC system without an auxiliary battery, the method designed here has better performance.</jats:p>",

Renewable, clean and cost effective energy sources are preferred but unfortunately no one of the alternative energy sources can meet these demands solely. So, the problem of determining the appropriate energy policy is a multiple criteria decision making problem. In this study, firstly sustainability indicators for energy planning are determined. Then dependencies and feedbacks between indicators and the values of the indicators were investigated and it was seen that Analytic Network Process with benefits, opportunities, costs and risks merits is a suitable method for this complex problem. Both the objective values and group decision of experts were used in the model to cover the quantitative and qualitative judgments. The results indicated that the energy system of Turkey is not sustainable and the sustainable energy scenario of Turkey must increase the share of renewables.

The systematic research review which we used in our study have not grasp or assess by other researchers on this topic. Firstly, based on our methodology Bibliometric analysis began by identifying 1610 publications raised from scientific journals, included literatures from 1994 to March of 2016. Secondly, we applied PageRank algorithm in our data for citation analysis to indicate the significance of a publication. Thirdly, the topological decision variables analysis is done based on Louvain method for network data clustering, for this proposes we used the rigorous tools.Finding: Based on our Network analysis result, the optimization in supply chain management research can be divided into four clusters /modules that introduced fundamental skill, knowledge, theory, application and method.Research limitations/implications: We presented some limitation in our research in some fields which could allow new researchers and practitioners conduct the future research to grow up in different dimensions.Practical implications: Practitioners or policy maker usually are not familiar with these type researches so this is why mush of these survey remain in theatrical and conceptual .Future investigation needs to play in practical application  domain instead stop merely in opinion.   Originality/value: Based on our research, the researchers have more attention to work in conceptual analysis due to other fields but we believe that in facility location problem there many remarkable rooms still exist for future research to development.

The bacterial population was identified with ‘next generation’ DNA sequencing, and specific bacteria were quantified with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. The ‘next generation’ DNA sequencing analysis showed a bacteria population shift from the iron oxidizing species Gallionella spp. in the Fe-filter to manganese and nitrite oxidizing species Pseudomonas spp. and Nitrospira spp., respectively, present in the manganese removal filter. qPCR analysis confirmed the presence of a low concentration of the well-known Mn2+-oxidizing species Ps. putida in the manganese removal filter backwash water. Bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas, isolated from backwash water from a manganese removal filter were cultured and identified with MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Amongst others, P. gessardii, P. grimontii, and P. koreensis were identified. The presence of several manganese oxidizing bacteria species in ripened filter media supports the assumption that a microbial consortium is involved in the oxidation of manganese. Understanding the mechanisms by which manganese coating of filter media commences could endorse the creation of conditions favouring Birnessite formation, and possibly help in reducing typically long ripening periods of manganese removal filters with virgin filter media.</jats:p>",

This omission represents a severe shortcoming because the understanding of what constitutes legitimate behavior may vary substantially between contexts. This conceptual study employs the institutional distance concept to the case of supply chain sustainability risks. It focuses initially on paradoxical situations in which both the buyer and the supplier fully comply with stakeholder expectations within their own legitimacy contexts, yet the buyer's stakeholders still withdraw legitimacy from and harm the buyer. The study analyzes the causal microfoundations of how and why such paradoxical risks manifest, drawing on stakeholder theory and institutional theory. The analysis shows that accounting for the differing legitimacy contexts is necessary for explaining these risks, thereby substantiating our initial claim that institutional distance matters to global supply chains. The study yields important implications for corporate practice in that it highlights an inherent trade‐off in many global supply chains.</jats:p>",

In Switzerland, 46% of all processing potatoes and 53% of all fresh potatoes are lost on their way from field to fork. Our study therefore compares the environmental impacts of losses of fresh potatoes with those of French fries. With the aid of a Life Cycle Assessment, we assessed the impact categories “demand for nonrenewable energy resources”, “global warming potential”, “human toxicity”, “terrestrial ecotoxicity” and “aquatic ecotoxicity”. Our results show that 1 kg of potatoes consumed as French fries causes 3–5 times more environmental impacts than the same quantity of fresh potatoes, but also that the proportion of impacts relating to losses is considerably lower for French fries (5%–10% vs. 23%–39%). The great majority of processing potato losses occur before the resource-intensive, emission-rich frying processes and therefore the environmental “backpack” carried by each lost potato is still relatively small. Nonetheless, appropriate loss treatment can substantially reduce the environmental impact of potato losses. In the case of French fries, the frying processes and frying oil are the main “hot spots” of environmental impacts, accounting for a considerably higher proportion of damage than potato losses; it is therefore also useful to look at these processes.</jats:p>"

However, they are more supportive of open repositories (green road) than of OA journal publishing (gold). The response patterns reveal a gap between generally positive opinions about OA and less supportive behaviours, principally publishing articles with article processing charges (APCs). A small group of senior research managers does not seem to be interested in green or gold OA and reluctant to self-archiving and OA publishing. Similar to other studies, the French survey confirms disciplinary differences, i.e. a stronger support for self-archiving of records and documents in HAL by scientists from Mathematics, Physics and Informatics than from Biology, Earth Sciences and Chemistry; and more experience and positive feelings with OA publishing and payment of APCs in Biology than in Mathematics or in Social Sciences and Humanities. Disciplinary differences and specific French factors are discussed, in particular in the context of the new European policy in favour of Open Science.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>For the first time, a nationwide survey was conducted with the senior research management level from all scientific disciplines.

One-thousand questionnaires were sent to Electrical and Electronics Industries in Taiwan; 180 valid questionnaires were returned using amos 18.0 to analyze the data. The results suggest that institutional pressure is an important factor affecting companies' promotion of GSCM. Companies face the pressure exerted by the institutional environment, which will affect the enterprises executives' cognition and emotion on the institutional environment, thus leading to an environmental commitment. Additionally, the results demonstrate that GSCM improves the enterprises' environmental performance, economic performance, and operating performance, ultimately leading to sustainable development.</jats:p>",

As potential power sources for sensors monitoring physiological signals near the human body, biofuel cells, which generate energy from the biological environment through chemical methods, have attracted much attention. However, the insufficient open-circuit voltage of biofuel cells owing to thermodynamic limitation is a basic issue. Thus, the use of biofuel cells as a power supply for a sensor imposes a strict limitation upon the power budget. In this report, we propose a design methodology for a low-voltage supply-sensing CMOS biosensor using biofuel cells. To explore the design methodology for performance optimization, a SPICE simulation was conducted. The simulated results reveal an optimum energy-efficient point in the biosensor design parameters. A fabricated 250 nm CMOS test chip was used to verify the validity of the design methodology and the measurement results matched the simulated results.</jats:p>",

Malaysia also has proactively taken a lead in halal activities, which is presently considered as the benchmark for a halal framework worldwide. Malaysia also set up the Halal Industry Development Corporation (HDC) which driving a wide range of halal activities since the demand of halal food has increased significantly which is very crucial for a Muslim in ensuring its authenticity and integrity. Even in parallel to this developments, many studies has been conducted because there are many issues still occurs in the food industry. The issue of consumer awareness and understanding the halal principles, mixing of halal and non- halal products, halal certification and logo compliance with Shariah law and lack of regulation and enforcement need the serious attention by all parties along the supply chain. The challenges occur mainly in the halal food segregation and halal traceability of the products. The unit of analysis in this study different halal stakeholders group which are JAKIM, Halal Development Centre (HDC), Raw Material Manufacturers, Retailers and Government Agencies. This paper attempt discusses the issues and challenges occurs in the halal supply chain and faced by the practitioners as well as the relevant parties involved in the industry especially for food products manufacturers. The study would like to give a basic information about the issues and challenges in the contribution of Halal Supply Chain Management (HSCM) as well as for the future studies.</jats:p>",

The emergence and expansion of alternative forms of food supply are influenced by various factors on different scales. Using the food systems approach we aim to study potentials and limitations of regional organic food supply in the Berlin metropolitan region (BMR). Based on the literature, we developed an analytical framework and identified determinants of regional organic food provision along the three major levels of the supply chain: agricultural production, food chain organization, and consumption. Then, we examined a qualitative case study with two different types of alternative food networks (A) organic community supported agriculture (CSA) and (B) organic retail trade. Factors that hinder or promote the provision of regional organic food were identified through qualitative interviews and assessed by regional stakeholders in a workshop. Our findings show that demand for regional organic food is higher than regional supply, which could offer good possibilities for organic farmers. However, actors in these two food chains need to overcome some obstacles, including limited access to land, increasing renting prices, insufficient processing capacities, and unsupportive political environment for organic farming.</jats:p>"

Quasi-stable plasma operation with repetitive sawtooth oscillations can be restored after an energy quench using high auxiliary power Pec &amp;gt; 2–5 Poh. Optimal conditions of the plasma discharge recovery after an energy quench using auxiliary heating are identified. At high auxiliary power, restoration of the plasma discharge can be provided with the location of the EC resonance zone within the whole plasma cross section. The auxiliary power required for discharge restoration is minimal when the power is deposited around the m = 2, n = 1 magnetic island (here m and n poloidal and toroidal wave numbers). The threshold ECRH power increases linearly with plasma current. Prevention of the non-thermal electron beams during density limit disruption is associated with stabilization of bursts of the magnetohydrodynamic modes, creation of the saturated magnetic islands, and heating of the background plasma using ECRH. Plasma discharge recovery after an energy quench in a tokamak reactor using auxiliary heating and controllable reduction of the plasma current is discussed.</jats:p>",

Alterations in the availability of N relative to P can affect plant growth rate and functional traits, as well as resource allocation to above‐ versus belowground biomass (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>A</jats:sub>and<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>B</jats:sub>). Biomass allocation among individual plants is broadly size‐dependent, and this can often be described as an allometric relationship between<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>A</jats:sub>and<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>B</jats:sub>, as represented by the equation<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/ece32587-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:20457758:media:ece32587:ece32587-math-0001\"/>, or log<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>A</jats:sub> = logα + βlog<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>B</jats:sub>. Here, we investigated whether the scaling exponent or regression slope may be affected by the N:P supply ratio. We hypothesized that the regression slope between<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>A</jats:sub>and<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>B</jats:sub>should be steeper under a high N:P supply ratio due to P limitation, and shallower under a low N:P supply ratio due to N limitation. To test these hypotheses, we experimentally altered the levels of N, P, and the N:P supply ratio (from 1.7:1 to 135:1) provided to five alpine species representing two functional groups (grasses and composite forbs) under greenhouse conditions; we then measured the effects of these treatments on plant morphology and tissue content (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SLA</jats:styled-content>, leaf area, and leaf and root N/P concentrations) and on the scaling relationship between<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>A</jats:sub>and<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>B</jats:sub>. Unbalanced N:P supply ratios generally negatively affected plant biomass, leaf area, and tissue nutrient concentration in both grasses and composite forbs. High N:P ratios increased tissue N:P ratios in both functional groups, but more in the two composite forbs than in the grasses. The positive regression slopes between log<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>A</jats:sub>and log<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>B</jats:sub>exhibited by plants raised under a N:P supply ratio of 135:1 were significantly steeper than those observed under the N:P ratio of 1.7:1 and 15:1. Synthesis: Plant biomass allocation is highly plastic in response to variation in the N:P supply ratio. Studies of resource allocation of individual plants should focus on the effects of nutrient ratios as well as the availability of individual elements. The two forb species were more sensitive than grasses to unbalanced N:P supplies. To evaluate the adaptive significance of this plasticity, the effects of unbalanced N:P supply ratio on individual lifetime fitness must be measured.</jats:p>",

As prices fell between 2011 and 2016, rare earths receded from public view, but less visibly, they became a major focus of innovative activity in companies, government laboratories, and universities. Geoscientists worked to better understand the resource base and improve our knowledge about mineral deposits that can be mines in the future. Process engineers carried out research that is making primary production and recycling more efficient. Materials scientists and engineers searched for substitutes that require fewer or no rare earths while providing properties comparable or superior to those of existing materials. As a result, even though global supply chains are not significantly different now than they were before the market disruption, the innovative activity motivated by the disruption will likely have far-reaching, if unpredictable, consequences for supply chains of rare earths in the future. </jats:p>",

This study aims to identify (1) existing sugarcane procurement by the industry, (2) the profitability, in private as well as social prices, of sugarcane farming system as the industry's supplier, and (3) sensitivity analysis on relevant sugar dynamics.The study was conducted on five industry samples spread over Java. The primary data for profitability analysis covered 300 units originated from 185 farmers and 115 industry's plantation units in a proportional spreading.The finding exhibits three alternatives of procurement: (1) partnership with farmers based on minimum return on land, (2) partnership with farmers as the industry provides assistance, and (3) purchasing sugar from free farmers. Using data in 2002, only two samples were financially profitable,-those were east part and west part of Java, while the only region gained social profit was the east part. In spite of that, if social price of sugar using relevant foreign production costs instead of CIE Java has its comparativeadvantage. Sensitivity analysis resulted in Java will achieve financial profit if sugar price rises by 10 percent, or productivity rises by 15 percent, or tariff of 50 percent imposes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> “Gray markets” are unauthorized channels that distribute a branded product without the manufacturer's permission. Since gray markets are not officially sanctioned by the manufacturer, their existence is assumed to hurt the manufacturer. Yet manufacturers sometimes tolerate or even encourage gray market activities. We investigate the incentives of a manufacturer and its authorized retailer to engage in (or tolerate) gray markets. The firms need to consider the trade‐off between the positive effects of a gray market (price discrimination and cost savings) and the negative effects (cannibalization of sales and a loss in consumer valuation). Generally, gray markets can be categorized into two types: (i) a “local gray market,” where a retailer diverts products to unauthorized sellers operating in the same region as the retailer; and, (ii) “bootlegging,” where the retailer diverts products to unauthorized sellers in another market where the manufacturer sells through a direct channel. We characterize the equilibrium in each type of gray market and identify conditions under which the retailer will divert products to the gray market. Incentive problems are more complicated when the retailer bootlegs and, in this case, we show that conflicting incentives may lead to the emergence of a gray market where both the manufacturer's and retailer's profits decrease. </jats:p>",

Surprisingly, limited attention has been directly devoted to the spatiotemporal variation in land supply or the driving factors. This paper applied a centroid model and hotspot analysis, and created a newly increased construction land dependence-degree index (NCD) to present the spatiotemporal variations of China’s construction land supply magnitude and pattern from 2003 to 2014, using land supply data from 339 cities. A two-way fixed effect model was introduced to reveal the influence of the socio-economic driving factors. The results showed that China’s state-owned construction land supply area (CLSA) and newly increased construction land supply area (NCSA) both increased during the period from 2003 to 2014, the geographic centroid of CLSA and NCSA moved northwest. NCD showed an overall increasing trend, and hotspots with high NCD migrated from the east region to the west region and shifted from an “east hot and west cold” pattern in 2003 to an “east cold and west hot” pattern in 2014. The gross domestic product (GDP) has a U-shape effect on CLSA and NCD. The population, average annual wage of workers, and investment in fixed assets (fiv) have positive effects on CLSA, and fiv also has a positive effect on NCD. The increasing ratio of tertiary industry added value to secondary industry added value reduces CLSA and NCD, and the effects of state policies vary from year to year. Different land supply policies should be implemented for cities in different development stages.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global economic growth, wealth and security rely upon the availability of cheap, mostly fossil‐derived energy and chemical compounds. The replacement by sustainable resources is widely discussed. However, the current state of biotechnological processes usually restricts them to be used as a true alternative in terms of economic feasibility and even sustainability. Among the rare examples of bioprocesses applied for the energetic use of biomass are biogas and bioethanol production. Usually, these processes lack in efficiency and they cannot be operated without the support of legislation. Although they represent a first step towards a greater share of bio‐based processes for energy provision, there is no doubt that tremendous improvements in strain and process development, feedstock and process flexibility as well as in the integration of these processes into broader supply and production networks, in this review called smart bioproduction grids, are required to make them economically attractive, robust enough, and wider acceptance by society. All this requires an interdisciplinary approach, which includes the use of residues in closed carbon cycles and issues concerning the process safety. This short review aims to depict some of the promising strategies to achieve an improved process performance as a basis for future application.</jats:p>",

The study sample consisted of 116 upper limbs from adult human cadavers. The articular branches were prepared under the dissection microscope to take measurements using the radial styloid process as point of reference. The articular branch departed from the anterior interosseous nerve at a mean distance of 2.9 cm proximal to the styloid for a radius length of 20.5 cm, and 3.7 cm for a radius length of 26.5 cm, respectively. For the posterior interosseous nerve, the departure point was at a mean distance of 3.1 cm (radius length of 20.5 cm) and at 4.0 cm (radius length of 26.5 cm). Apart from a single branch from the posterior interosseous nerve, all articular branches were located distal to the proximal border of the pronator quadratus. Results indicate that wrist denervation from the volar approach, if performed at the proximal border of the pronator quadratus, or from the dorsal approach at a distance of 4.8 cm (for a radius length of 20.5 cm) or 6.2 cm (for a radius length of 26.5 cm) proximal to the radial styloid process, will eliminate the nerve supply to the distal radio-ulnar joint in the majority of cases. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A ventilation nozzle’s airflow characteristics could have an influence on a passenger’s thermal comfort and dispersion of pollutants in an aircraft cabin, but there is little published research in this area. In this article, the temperature and air velocity from a nozzle jet were measured in a simulated three-row aircraft cabin at more than 220 points for both isothermal and non-isothermal jets. The non-isothermal jets were tested for air supply temperature differences of ± 5 and 10℃, and the isothermal jets for volume flowrates of 1.86 × 10<jats:sup>−7</jats:sup>, 2.67 × 10<jats:sup>−7</jats:sup>, and 4.03 × 10<jats:sup>−7 </jats:sup>m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/h. The results show that both the nozzle jet’s temperature and air velocity distributions are axially symmetrical and that the decay of the jet is rapid. The equation for the air velocity distribution was used to calculate the air velocity at any point in the main jet region for different volume flowrates. The temperature difference was shown to have little effect on the air velocity distribution for the main region of a nozzle jet, whereas the air flowrate was shown to significantly affect the air velocity distribution. This suggests that the effect of nozzle jet on passenger’s thermal comfort is mostly due to its air velocity distribution rather than temperature distribution. </jats:p>",

In the present study, the effects of different methods of exogenous selenium (Se) supply viz. Se seed priming, Se fertigation and Se foliar spray on yield of spring wheat under normal and water deficit conditions were investigated. Two field experiments were conducted using one indigenous drought-tolerant genotype (Kohistan-97) and a sensitive genotype (Pasban-90) to understand the role of Se in improving wheat yield. The experiments were laid out in a split-split plot design with three replications during consecutive years (2011/12 and 2012/13) and the plants were exposed to water stress by withholding irrigation at two different wheat growth stages, viz. tillering and anthesis. It was noted that drought stress significantly affected the yield attributes of wheat; however, exogenous Se supply was observed to be helpful in improving the drought tolerance potential and yield of water-stressed wheat plants through maintenance of plant water status. A significant increase in wheat yield by Se supply was also noted under normal conditions. The normal plants fertigated with Se maintained the highest values for number of productive tillers, spike length, number of grains per spike, thousand-grain weight, biological and grain yield with no significant difference from Se foliar spray at the tillering stage, which was found to be the most effective method of exogenous Se supply for improving wheat yield under water deficit conditions. Moreover, Se fertigation and foliar spray resulted in the maximum accumulation of Se in shoots and gave the highest net return and cost-benefit ratio under drought stress conditions. The present study is one of the few reports on the role of Se in alleviating water stress for obtaining maximum profit in field grown spring wheat.</jats:p>",

Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, de-identified data were collected from the 2013 Saskatchewan College of Physical Therapy membership renewals (n=643), and Saskatchewan population health characteristics data were obtained from the 2009–2012 Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHSs). Age- and sex-adjusted proportions of selected population health characteristics were calculated and stratified by health region and rural–urban location; both were determined, for physiotherapists and CCHS participants, using postal codes. The association between physiotherapy distribution and physiotherapy use was calculated, and geospatial mapping techniques were used to display physiotherapist distribution across the province relative to population health characteristics. Results: Across health regions, a positive correlation (r=0.655, p&lt;0.029) was found between physiotherapist distribution and self-reported physiotherapy use. Mapping population health characteristics according to physiotherapist distribution demonstrated an imbalance between supply and distribution of physiotherapists and population health needs and demands. Conclusion: There is a discrepancy in Saskatchewan among the distribution of physiotherapists, self-reported physiotherapy use, and population health characteristics, especially in rural settings. These findings provide insight into which areas are in need of increased physiotherapy services. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate‐driven shifts in prey phenology may lead to asynchrony with the timing of peak resource requirements of their predators, leading to a reduction in productivity and population declines. Migrant species that cannot adjust their arrival times may be particularly at risk, especially those that breed in seasonal environments and for which a temporarily super‐abundant prey source is important, such as insectivorous passerine birds that take advantage of the seasonal flush of caterpillars to feed their young. We assess whether population declines of the trans‐Saharan migratory Wood Warbler <jats:italic>Phylloscopus sibilatrix</jats:italic> are likely to have been caused by phenological mismatch. We measured seasonal invertebrate biomass and various fitness parameters, including the timing of breeding and breeding success, in two time periods: 1982–1984, prior to the species’ decline in the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content>, and 2009–2011, as the reduction in numbers continued. Although birds bred on average a week earlier in 2009–2011 than in 1982–1984, this was not adequate to track the more rapid advancement of peak caterpillar biomass, which advanced by 12 days and was closely correlated with spring temperatures. Moreover, although caterpillars were the dominant prey fed to nestlings, there was only limited evidence that productivity was positively related to caterpillar biomass in the environment. Considering only successful nests, synchrony with the food peak did not produce heavier nestlings and had only a small positive effect on fledging success, although there was a seasonal decline in productivity when all nests were considered. We conclude that the lack of a marked effect of the observed mismatch is due to Wood Warblers’ generalist diet, enabling them to breed successfully on prey other than caterpillars. Although other studies have demonstrated that climate‐driven asynchrony of predator and prey populations can have impacts on avian demography, this study highlights the importance of investigating the generality of those findings.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, the possible presence of microbiological, chemical, and physical hazards as well as trends in the dairy supply chain that may affect their presence were assessed. A literature review was combined with available data from EFSA, RASFF, and the Dutch monitoring program on chemical hazards as well as expert information. This study revealed that microbiological hazards are encountered more frequently in dairy products than chemical and physical hazards. <jats:italic>Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella</jats:italic>, and human pathogenic <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> were identified as the most important microbiological hazards in dairy products. Soft and semisoft cheeses are most frequently associated with <jats:italic>L. monocytogenes</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> enterotoxins, whereas raw milk is most frequently associated with human pathogenic <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Campylobacter</jats:italic> spp., <jats:italic>Cronobacter</jats:italic> spp., and <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> spp. are the microbiological hazards of most concern in powdered infant formula. Based on literature, monitoring, and RASFF data, the most relevant chemical hazards in dairy products are aflatoxin M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>, dioxins, and dioxin‐like compounds and residues of veterinary drugs. Chemical hazards primarily occur at the dairy farm and may accumulate during further processing. The most relevant physical hazards are metal, glass, and plastic particles introduced during processing. Analysis of trends in the near future revealed that increased milk production is seen as most relevant in relation to food safety. Other trends affecting food safety are climate change and changes at the farm level, which aim to improve animal welfare and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>",

Yet prescribing adaptation policies in the near term is made difficult by the uncertainty in climate projections at relevant spatial scales and the conflating effects of uncertainties in emissions, model error, and internal variability. In this work, a new framework is implemented to explore the vulnerability of reservoir systems in the northeastern U.S. to climate change and attribute vulnerabilities to changes in mean climate, natural variability, or emission scenarios. Analysis of variance is used to explore the contributions of uncertainties to system performance. Diagnosing the relative risks to water supply will help water resource engineers better adapt to uncertain future conditions. The results indicate that uncertainty in water supply system performance can be attributed mostly to uncertainty in internal variability over policy‐relevant planning horizons, and thus, adaptation efforts should focus on managing variability.</jats:p>",

As águas subterrâneas são uma alternativa em regiões áridas e semiáridas como no nordeste brasileiro, para o abastecimento humano, já que as taxas de pluviometria são consideravelmente baixas. A cidade de Mossoró nos últimos anos passa por uma expansão urbana e um crescimento populacional, aumentando a demanda por água de boa qualidade para o abastecimento, por isso a presente pesquisa teve como objetivo a análise da qualidade da água subterrânea distribuída à população da área urbana de Mossoró-RN, já que estudos dessa natureza são bastante escassos na região. As análises das amostras foram realizadas no laboratório da CAERN, companhia responsável pela distribuição de água no estado do Rio Grande do Norte. E depois os dados foram analisados por meio da estatística descritiva e interpolação de cada variável para a elaboração de mapas temáticos. As águas subterrâneas de um modo geral como é de se esperar não apresentam restrições quanto as suas propriedades físicas, principalmente por se tratar de um aquífero poroso e relativamente profundo como o aquífero Açu. Um Sistema de Informações Geográficas - SIG pode melhorar a interpretação das análises do comportamento da qualidade da água dos poços, além de diminuir o tempo gasto e espaço de armazenamento.    A B S T R A C T  Water resources are essential for life and environmental modifiers processes, so the knowledge of the current situation can ensure efficient management aiming at more sustainable use, thus not affecting the current and future generations regarding the availability and water quality. Groundwater is an alternative in arid and semi-arid regions such as in northeastern of Brazil, for human consumption, since the pluviometry rates are considerably lower. The city of Mossoro in recent years goes through an urban expansion and population growth, increasing the demand for good quality water supplies, so this study aimed to analyze the groundwater quality distributed to the population of the urban area of Mossoro-RN, whereas such studies are rather scarce in the region. The analyzes of the samples were performed in the laboratory of CAERN, the water company that is responsible for distributing water in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. And then the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and interpolation of each variable for the elaboration of thematic maps. Groundwater, generally speaking, as is to be expected shows no restrictions about their physical properties, mainly because it is a porous aquifer and relatively deep as the Açu aquifer. A Geographic Information System - GIS can improve the understanding of the analysis of the behavior of the quality of the water from wells, and reduce the time spent and storage space.

From January 2000 to June 2014, 1149 patients underwent LDLT procedures. Thirty patients with LDLT using a right lobe graft with multiple HA stumps and 149 patients with LDLT using a right lobe graft with a single HA stump were enrolled. These patients were divided into 3 groups: single HA (group 1, n = 149), multiple HAs with total reconstruction (group 2, n = 19), and multiple HAs with selective partial reconstruction (group 3, n = 11). Selective partial reconstruction was performed only when pulsatile back‐bleeding was confirmed after larger HA reconstruction and sufficient intrahepatic arterial flow was confirmed by Doppler ultrasound (DUS). In group 2, the donor HAs were smaller (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">P</jats:italic> &lt; .001), and HA reconstruction took longer (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">P</jats:italic> &lt; .001).

In particular, it investigates the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) in the Portuguese light-duty fleet considering different displacement and charging scenarios (vehicle technologies displaced, EV charging time). Coal and natural gas were identified as the marginal  sources, but their contribution to the margin depended on the hour of the day, time of year, and system load, causing marginal emissions from electricity to vary significantly. Results show that for an electricity system with a high share of non-dispatchable renewable power, such as the Portuguese system, marginal emissions are considerably higher than average emissions. Because of the temporal variability in the marginal electricity supply, the time of charging may have a major influence on the GHG emissions of EVs. Off-peak charging leads to higher GHG emissions than peak charging, due to a higher contribution of coal to the margin. Furthermore, compared to an all-conventional fleet, EV introduction causes an increase in overall GHG emissions in most cases. However, EV effects are very dependent on the time of charging and the assumptions about the displaced technology.</jats:p>"

Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to obtain the optimized sliding and hydrolyzing conformations, in which the reducing ends of sugar chains are located on different sites. Hydrogen bonds are investigated to clarify the interactions between protein and substrate in either conformation. Nine hydrogen bonding interactions are identified in the sliding conformation, and six similar interactions are also found correspondingly in the hydrolyzing conformation. In addition, four strong hydrophobic interactions are also determined. The domain cross‐correlation map analysis shows movement correlation of protein including autocorrelation between residues. The root mean square fluctuations analysis represents the various flexibilities of different fragment in the two conformations. Comparing the two conformations reveals the water‐supply mechanism of selective hydrolysis of cellulose in Cel7A. The mechanism can be described as follow. When the reducing end of substrate slides from the unhydrolyzing site (sliding conformation) to the hydrolyzing site (hydrolyzing conformation), His225 is pushed down and rotated, the rotation leads to the movement of Glu209 with the interstrand hydrogen bonding in β‐sheet. It further makes Asp211 close to the hydrolysis center and provides a water molecule bounding on its carboxyl in the previous unhydrolyzing site. After the hydrolysis takes place and the product is excluded from the enzyme, the Asp211 comes back to its initial position. In summary, Asp211 acts as an elevator to transport outer water molecules into the hydrolysis site for every other glycosidic bond.</jats:p>",

Gaining understanding and controlling biomass chemical composition contributes to an efficient biofuel generation. This paper presents a principal component analysis (PCA) that shows the influence and relevance of selected controllable factors over the chemical composition of switchgrass and, therefore, in the generation of biofuels. The study introduces the following factors: (1) storage days; (2) particle size; (3) wrap type; and (4) weight of the bale. Results show that all the aforementioned factors have an influence in the chemical composition. The number of days that bales have been stored was the most significant factor regarding changes in chemical components due to its effect over principal components 1 and 2 (PC1 and PC2, approximately 80% of the total variance). The storage days are followed by the particle size, the weight of the bale and the type of wrap utilized to enclose the bale. An increment in the number of days (from 75–150 days to 225 days) in storage decreases the percentage of carbohydrates by −1.03% while content of ash increases by 6.56%.</jats:p>"

We examined glycogen metabolism in human islets and in the rodent‐derived INS‐1 832/13 β‐cells and found them to express the same isoforms of key enzymes required for glycogen metabolism. Our findings indicate that glycogenesis is insulin‐independent but influenced by extracellular glucose concentrations. Levels of glycogen synthase decrease with increasing glucose concentrations, paralleling accumulation of glycogen. We did not find cAMP‐elicited glycogenolysis and insulin secretion to be causally related. In conclusion, our results reveal regulated glycogen metabolism in human islets and insulin‐secreting cells. Whether glycogen metabolism affects insulin secretion under physiological conditions remains to be determined.</jats:p>",
