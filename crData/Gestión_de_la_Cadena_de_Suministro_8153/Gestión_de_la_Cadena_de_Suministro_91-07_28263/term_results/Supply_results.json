It is assumed that monthly water demands and supplies are random. The total cost, however, is affected by both current month and future water allocation decisions with respect to the operation of facilities. A perfect foresight model using mixed integer programming is developed and applied to 36 years of historical demand and supply data. Using the solutions to this model, several simple operating rules are derived. These rules are applied to the historical data to simulate system operation, and cumulative distribution of net revenue for each rule is derived. Based on first‐ and second‐degree stochastic dominance criteria, the performance of alternative rules are evaluated. The procedure is also repeated with a set of generated data sequences to check the consistency of the solutions. Average reductions of up to 11% in annual net revenues from those of a perfect foresight model are observed, for various operating rules. Using stochastically dominant rules, annual revenues can be increased by 5% on the average from a commonly used rule based on unit cost.</jats:p>",

They included: targeting courses to specific clinical areas; providing separate courses for each segment of the geriatric population; and educating both elders and dentists regarding the appropriateness of dental care for the elderly patient</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

Predictions were made, based on a simulation analysis, that root systems from plants grown in low nutrient conditions and those from plants characteristic of such conditions should have the more herringbone topology (branching principally on main axis) and longer links. Both these predictions were confirmed for the dicots, but data from grasses agreed with the predictions only in terms of geometry (link lengths) and not topology. The ecological character of the species was assessed on the assumption that species of low inherent relative growth rate were characteristic of infertile soils, Taxonomic patterns were also evident, indicating that some variation in root system architecture may be historical rather than adaptive.</jats:p>",

The conceptual background was the serious contamination of the river Elbe with various industrial wastewaters upstream of most of the potable water abstraction sites for the cities and towns of the Elbe valley. Using the National Cancer Register (started in 1952) the incidence of different types of cancer suspected to be at least partially caused by polluted water was checked. About 10 000 cases of cancer from a 17-year period (1968 - 1984) were checked in 3 communities. The results show that Pirna (lying upstream of the main wastewater receiving points in the GDR) has a significantly higher relative risk for 3, Dresden (approximately 30 km downstream) for 4, and Riesa (about 7 0 km downstream) for 5 cancer sites. The cancer risk related to the risk in the country was as high as 145% in Pirna and 160% in Riesa for liver cancer and 170 % in Riesa for kidney cancer. Measures to improve the drinking water quality in the Upper Elbe Valley are urgently needed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One arm of oligotrophic Sproat Lake was fertilized with weekly additions of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen (N:P = 50: 1, by atoms). There was a lag of greater than 1 mo before changes in N:P supply ratio were reflected by \"relative uptake rates\" (RURs) of saturating ammonium and phosphate additions. This supports previous findings that RUR is a sensitive indicator of changes in N:P supply ratio, but suggests that changes in RUR are mediated by changes in composition rather than physiological state of the plankton community. The &lt;3 μm fraction showed a greater demand for phosphate than ammonium compared with larger cells (&gt;3 μm), as indicated by maximum uptake rates for the two nutrients. However, maximum phosphate uptake rates for both size fractions were greater as the result of fertilization. Nonetheless, RURs for both size fractions were consistent with Synechococcus being N limited and diatoms being P limited when the lake was not fertilized. Despite the large increase in nutrient loading, dissolved phosphate turnover times decreased from 10–12 to 5–7 min, indicating increased phosphate demand relative to supply. This study emphasizes that ammonimum and phosphate kinetics data yield valuable information on the nutritional conditions experienced by phytoplankton in lakes.</jats:p>",

Nucleotide synthesis determined by the incorporation of radioactivity from [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup> C] glycine into nucleotides increased simultaneously. The concentration of 5‐phosphoribosyl 1‐pyrophosphate (PRPP) estimated by the incorporation of [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]adenine into nucleotides also increased. These changes were greater and of longer duration in patients with cancer operation than in those with cholecystectomy. In neither case were they affected by the amount of amino acid intake, or increases in energy intake. These results suggest that abdominal surgery stimulates protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis in lymphocytes. Increased RNA synthesis may be ensured by increased synthesis of nucleotides, and increased PRPP concentrations appear to regulate the rate of nucleotide synthesis. The responses are apparently dependent upon the severity of surgery, but unrelated to the amount of amino acid supplied postoperatively.

There were 10 split‐root treatments, incorporating four concentrations of P (0, 18, 105 and 280 μg P g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>soil) ranging from severely deficient for plant growth to luxurious. Increasing the supply of P to plants decreased the percentage of root length infected and the total length of roots infected by<jats:italic>S. calospora.</jats:italic>Applications of 18 and 105 μg P g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>soil to half of the root system of plants reduced the percentage of root length infected in that half of the root system and in the other half of the root system to the same extent. The effects of severely deficient and moderately deficient rates of P on infection by<jats:italic>S. calospora</jats:italic>were therefore mediated through the plant. These effects could be related directly to effects of P supply in decreasing the concentrations of soluble carbohydrates in roots because carbohydrate concentrations in roots did not differ between each half of the root system. In contrast to the concentrations of soluble carbohydrates in roots, the length of roots and the concentrations of P in roots were generally greater in the half of the root system that received the highest application of P. Applications of 280 μg p g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>soil to half of the root system of plants also reduced the percentage of root length infected by<jats:italic>S. calospora</jats:italic>in both halves of the root system but to a greater extent in the half that received 280 μg P g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>soil. This effect was associated with greater length of roots, higher concentrations of P in roots and higher concentrations of P in the soil in the half of the root system that received 280 μg P g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>soil. We concluded that the effects of luxury amounts of P on infection by<jats:italic>S. calospora</jats:italic>could be mediated through the soil.</jats:p>",
