The method presented is based on a sensitivity analysis of the rainfall inputs and resulting streamflow of calibrated rainfall/runoff (R/R) models. The sensitivity approach assumes that knowledge of the variances and sensitivities (partial derivatives) of R/R model input parameters allows one to determine the variance of the output. Monthly rainfall is assumed Markovian. This assumption is used in selection of the input rainfall. The sensitivity approach is applied to the Occoquan watershed in northern Virginia for a period of severe drought. The streamflow variance is within 12% of the value obtained by the current National Weather Service (NWS) technique and required less than 10% of the computer effort required by the NWS technique.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In applying mathematical programing water supply planning models, water supplies and demands must be spatially and temporally aggregated. An assessment is made of the effects of aggregation on the results of a planning model for West Africa. The assessment uses a detailed hydroeconomic simulation model to study the solution set of the planning model when it has been applied to several representative subareas. Comparisons are made between the design reliability intended for the supply system and the actual reliabilities of sources as estimated by the detailed simulation model. Comparisons are also made between the system suggested by the planning model and the estimated least cost reliable system. (The least cost reliable system was found using a trial and error search method and the detailed simulation model.) It was found that the aggregation assumptions primarily affect the modeling of sources that depend directly on the highly variable precipitation (e.g., ephemeral aquifers). These sources should, in general, be excluded from the planning model and analyzed separately. Overall, unless a planner is particularly interested in studying the use of such unreliable sources, the spatial and temporal aggregation assumptions of the planning model do not hinder its use as an effective regional planning tool.</jats:p>",

The survey illustrates the fact that although most models have stressed the significance of the economic variables in the supply function, few attempts have been made to incorporate technology as a variable. Although such an approach can be justified under certain special circumstances, it is considered unsuitable as a supply forecaster in the increasingly numerous marginal fields where operations approach the technology frontier. In this connection, the latter part of the paper discusses the possibility of and problems associated with incorporating technology as a variable in the projection of supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT: </jats:bold> There is considerable misconception about the dangers of opening to a recreating public in great need of additional open areas. A systematic procedure for identifying the factors essential to the selectio, planning, and management of reservoirs for recreation is described. A detailed case study conducted by an interdisciplinary project team is presented to demonstrate the feasibility fo maintaining storage levels in recreation‐conductive high country reseroirs without unduly injuring downstram water users. The idea is to trade water with reservoirs having less recreation potential. The optimal means of doing this is found via a river basin simulation model with quasi‐optimizing capability. Results of the case study show that this strategy is indeed feasible. Applicable to other areas may require analysis of tradeoffs if at least some damage to downstream users is unavoidable.</jats:p>",

The cycle time was maintained constant at 2.0 hr. The basal level of nutrient fed to cultures was also maintained constant but the concentration amplitude was varied over a range from 0.2 to 5.0 g/liter. A lag between the stimulus and organisms response was observed and found to be independent of cycle amplitude over most of the range examined. Increasing the cycle amplitude did not effect the cell yield from glucose or the elemental composition of the organisms. However, large variations in the macromolecular composition of the cells (on a dry weight basis) were found; at 4.0 g/liter amplitude the cells contained some 82% protein. The relevance of this type of reactor operation in large‐scale fermentations is discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The contractile recoverability of isolated portal veins made hypodynamic by removal of glucose from the perfusion medium by diverse exogenous substrates was studied. It was found that glucose, mannose, pyruvate, lactate, acetate, and butyrate readily restored contraction.The effects of anoxia and metabolic inhibitors were also investigated. Both anoxia and dinitrophenol abolished spontaneous activity within 10 min. Fluoroacetate markedly depressed contractility (−60.9 ± 2.8% at 10 min), the reduction being essentially similar in medium with or without glucose. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) in glucose medium reduced contractility only slightly whereas in the absence of glucose it drastically inhibited contraction (−76% at 10 min and −97% at 40 min).Intracellular ATP was significantly reduced by anoxia and fluoroacetate in medium with or without glucose and by 2-DG only in substrate-free medium. However, ATP depletion showed no clear correlation with the extent of contractile depression.These findings indicate a strong dependence for mechanical activity in this vein on aerobic metabolic pathways. But, from the results with 2-DG, it is suggested that an adequate glucose metabolism might be of importance for functional processes other than contraction itself. </jats:p>",
