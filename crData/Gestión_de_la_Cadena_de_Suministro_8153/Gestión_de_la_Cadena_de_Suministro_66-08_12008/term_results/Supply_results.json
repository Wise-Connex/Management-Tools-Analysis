A comparison was made between the inhibitory responses of the isolated atropinized guinea‐pig stomach to stimulation of the vagus and to stimulation of the perivascular nerves.</jats:p><jats:p>2. When low frequencies of stimulation were used, the vagi were more effective than the perivascular nerves in causing relaxation of the stomach.</jats:p><jats:p>3. The responses to vagal stimulation were faster in onset than were the responses to perivascular nerve stimulation.</jats:p><jats:p>4. Responses to perivascular nerve stimulation were abolished by low concentrations of bretylium, whereas responses to vagal stimulation were only slight reduced. Vagal responses were strongly reduced by higher concentrations of bretylium.</jats:p><jats:p>5. Amphetamine relieved the blockade of perivascular nerve responses which was caused by bretylium, but never relieved the reduction of the vagal responses.</jats:p><jats:p>6. It is argued that the vagal inhibitory fibres are not susceptible to ‘adrenergic neurone blockade’, the observed reduction of the responses being due to some other action of bretylium.</jats:p><jats:p>7. These differences between the vagal and perivascular inhibitory innervations of the stomach suggest that the post‐ganglionic fibres in the vagal pathway and the intramural inhibitory nerves described in the guinea‐pig caecum are similar.</jats:p>",

High temperatures hastened all stages of development after inflorescence initiation. Anthesis occurred after 48 days when N was added and after 52 days without N. Anthesis did not occur until after 68 days at the lower temperatures, with or without N.</jats:p><jats:p>Largest yields of leaves, stems and stubble were produced at all growth stages at the lower temperatures with N. This treatment gave the highest crop growth rate, which increased almost linearly with time. The lower temperatures with N gave many more and longer stems and more inflorescences than any other treatment. With N and high temperatures, there was no increase in crop growth rate after inflorescence emergence. Temperature had little effect on growth when no N was provided. With no added N, crop growth rate was retarded and increased very little after inflorescence initiation.</jats:p><jats:p>Herbage produced at high temperatures had the lower percentages of water‐soluble carbohydrates and digestible dry matter, but had the higher percentages of most minerals. N increased the percentage content of most minerals.</jats:p><jats:p>Weights of stubble and of water‐soluble carbohydrates in the stubble, and the numbers of stem bases and tillers, were larger at the lower temperatures, and were usually larger with added N in both temperature regimes. Nitrogen decreased the percentage content of carbohydrates in the stubble. Large haplocorms were produced at the low temperatures, but none developed at the high temperatures, indicating less carbohydrate storage.</jats:p><jats:p>The results partly explain the vigorous growth of timothy in the cool, temperate regions of Europe and North America, and the small dry matter production, lower nutritional value of the herbage, and lack of persistence in the warm southern regions where rainfall is adequate.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The terminal distribution of the hepatic artery of the human liver was examined by arterial injection of india ink and serial sectioning. The branches of the hepatic artery form capillary networks around the bile duct in the portal tract, from which the capillaries (terminal venous branch) arise and connect with sinusoids at the most peripheral zone of the liver lobules. Evidence of direct anastomosis between the hepatic artery and portal vein inside the portal tract or presence of “innere Pfortaderwurzeln” as well as the intralobular arteriole was not demonstrated.</jats:p><jats:p>The authors also studied the hepatic changes caused by interruption of the portal blood supply to the liver lobule. It was demonstrated that the portal tract and its components as well as several layers of liver parenchymal tissue around the portal tract are nourished from blood via the peribiliary capillary plexus and thus remains unaffected by portal obstruction, while other parts of the liver lobule will undergo coagulation necrosis.</jats:p><jats:p>Based on the present investigation, the authors believe that the hepatic artery plays the main role in the nourishment of the bile duct while it has little to do with that of the liver lobule, except for the most peripheral layers of the liver lobules adjacent to the portal areas.</jats:p>",
