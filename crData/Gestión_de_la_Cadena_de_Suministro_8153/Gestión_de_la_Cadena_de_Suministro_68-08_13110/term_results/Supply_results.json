With denser planting, yields decreased if N was not applied, and there was little or no yield increase with 100 or 200 kg/ha N. The optimal plant density was increased by applying 100 kg/ha N but it was not increased further with higher rates of N. Generally, no favourable interaction of N supply and plant density on yield occurred in early liftings. Weights of &gt;35 mm tubers and total dry weights of tubers were generally affected by N and spacing in the same way as total fresh weights.

The Potential Gas Committee (PGC) estimated the undiscovered potential supply of natural gas in the U. S., exclusive of Alaska, to be 690 Tcf as of Dec. 31, 1966. Separate estimates of potential supply were made for the west, central and east supply areas and classified as probable, possible and speculative categories of undiscovered supply.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Potential supply is that undiscovered prospective quantity of natural gas that remains to be found under assumed conditions of adequate, but reasonable prices and normal improvements in technology.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The PGC is sponsored by the Potential Gas Agency (PGA) of the Mineral Resources Institute of the Colorado School of Mines Foundation, Inc. The PGA was selected by the Gas Industry Committee, composed of representatives of American Petroleum Institute (API), Independent Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA), and American Gas Association (AGA).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The PGC makes estimates of potential supply of natural gas in the U. S. These estimates must be related intimately to the rocks in which gas is found, by detailed studies and analyses of geologically significant areas by many qualified individuals. These studies are made by 12 regional work committees designated by the PGC.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The demand for natural gas and crude oil to provide important quantities of energy for consumption in the U. S. can be expected to continue. The economic, political and technological forces prevailing in the future will, as in the past, be the primary determinants of the price of natural gas and of crude oil in the field and in the market place, of how much of the undiscovered supply of natural gas and crude oil will be found by exploration, and of the rate at which each of these sources of energy will be developed and become available to the gas and oil industries.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Any industry must be concerned with all aspects of its operations, not the least important of which is the supply of its particular commodity. This is particularly true for industries, such as the natural gas industry, that rely upon non-renewable resources. More than 38 million ultimate consumers paid nearly $8 billion for services by gas utilities and pipelines during 1966. The gas utility and pipeline industry, with a gross plant investment in excess of $30 billion, has become the sixth largest industry in the nation.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>The Energy Explosion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>To gain a better understanding of the growth of the natural gas industry to its status as the number two source of primary energy consumed in the U. S. today, it is necessary to see the growth of all forms of energy since the end of World War II. The annual consumption of all forms of primary energy increased 73 percent, from 32.9 quadrillion Btu in 1947, to 56.9 quadrillion Btu in 1966 as shown in Fig. 1. The annual consumption of energy from natural gas (dry) increased 284 percent, from 4.5 quadrillion Btu to 17.3 quadrillion Btu during this same 20-year period. Viewing this growth another way, the portion of the total energy-consuming market supplied by natural gas increased from 13.7 percent in 1947 to 30 percent in 1966.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Data shown in Fig. 1 for natural gas are USBM data and are derived as follows: gross production, minus returned to reservoirs, minus wastage, plus imports, minus exports, minus increase in underground storage and minus extraction shrinkage.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The innervation of the extrinsic uterine arterial supply of the guinea pig has been studied using an isolated perfused preparation. The preparation was normally at minimal tone and responded to periarterial stimulation by a vaso-constriction which was mimicked by norepinephrine and abolished by bretylium. Constrictor responses both to stimulation and to norepinephrine were similar in both pregnant and non-pregnant states. In pregnant preparations, raising the tone of the vessels with norepinephrine revealed a powerful dilator response to periarterial stimulation. This response was mimicked by acetylcholine, potentiated by anticholinesterases, reduced by hyoscine, and abolished by-local anesthetic treatment. In contrast, virgin preparations showed only a weak dilator response to stimulation, while the response to acetylcholine even at high concentrations was usually negligible. Histochemical examination of the vessels revealed a dense plexus of fine nerve fibers exhibiting high acetylcholinesterase activity along the main uterine artery. The fibers lay in close apposition to the vascular muscle layer. Nerve fibers exhibited fluorescence for catecholamines were also abundant, but were distributed along the secondary as well as the main arteries. It is concluded that the uterine arterial supply of the guinea pig is innervated by both adrenergic constrictor and cholinergic dilator fibers. The dilator fibers appear to be functional only during pregnancy. The possibility of a noncholinergic dilator innervation is also discussed.</jats:p>",
