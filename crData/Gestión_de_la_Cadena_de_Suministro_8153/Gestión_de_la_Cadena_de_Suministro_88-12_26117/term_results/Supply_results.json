I argue that these estimates substantially understate the true long‐run supply response in agriculture. Because of the lack of international input price data, implicit output/input price ratios are estimated from a production function assuming profit maximization. The estimation of an aggregate supply function utilizing these price ratios yields long run aggregate supply elasticities in the range of 0.90 to 1.19. These figures are substantially larger than those obtained from conventional supply functions fitted to time series data, but correspond closely to estimates reported in an earlier crosscountry study that used different price data for different points in time. The results imply that policies which distort domestic and/or world market prices of agricultural products cause greater output distortions in both the DCs and LDCs than are predicted by the small supply elasticities obtained from conventional supply estimation.</jats:p>",

As a means of setting this assessment work in a world context and to help explain why certain countries were selected for study and the order in which those studies have been carried out, the paper provides background information on world coal supply (4,400 Mt) and hard coal trade (330 Mt) for 1986. </jats:p><jats:p> Since 1983 reports have been published on Colombia, United States, South Africa, Canada and the People's Republic of China; reports are currently in draft form for the Soviet Bloc and Australia; and studies are in progress for the Asia/Pacific Region and for Western Europe. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper goes on to review the evolution of the study work, study methodology and typical report format. Generalised conclusions are drawn on coal supply categories, the economies of scale required to produce and deliver low value coal products, and the principal factors affecting coal pricing. More specific conclusions are then drawn for each country and finally the programme of future work in this field is indicated. </jats:p><jats:p> The overall objective of this assessment work has now been geared towards producing integrated projections of world supply of all the principal coal products that are expected to be traded 15–20 years ahead and for those projections to be kept current and issued as annual reports. </jats:p>",

The suggested alternatives are intended to improve system utilization by combining additional water resources and users. We used the criterion of expected annual return to compare the alternatives and a linear programming model to allocate water for different users according to policy priorities. Based on the results, we used a nonlinear programming model to allocate water for hydroelectric energy production. An annual return of about one million dollars is predicted for the most economical alternative versus a return of one hundred thousand dollars prior to enlargement. However, due to managerial factors and lack of reliable data, only two of the four possible physical enlargements were implemented as recommended, with an expected annual return of $422,000. </jats:p>",

The results indicate that conflicting results reported in the literature, with respect to changes in worker size over the course of colony development, probably can be regarded, at least in part, as the outcome of differences in food supply.</jats:p>",

The same arterial patterns are found in three strains, except that the external pudendal artery arises from the external iliac artery or internal iliac artery in the APG strain, but only from the external iliac artery in the CBN and ACN strains. The deferential and prostatic arteries form the arterial loop on the dorsal surface of the ventrolateral lobe of the prostate. This loop may play some importance parts in the functional interaction between the epididymis and the prostate. The caudal epididymal artery arises more frequently from the spermatic cordai portion of the testicular artery than from the cranial epididymal artery, and it never arises directly from the abdominal part of the testicular artery as reported in the rat, mouse and rabbit. The deferential artery may join with the cranial vesicular artery to form the common trunk (umbilical artery), but sometimes these arteries arise directly from the internal iliac artery.</jats:p>",

Left ventricular, ascending aortic, and right atrial pressures and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded while a Valsalva maneuver was performed during ischemia. Myocardial oxygen demand was assessed from the tension time index (TTI) and cardiac size and potential myocardial oxygen supply were assessed from a diastolic pressure time index (DPTI) and relative changes in supply/demand ratio from DPTI/TTI. During an asymptomatic interval an abrupt but small transient decrease in TTI and cardiac size occurred during phase II (p &lt;0.05) of the Valsalva maneuver. DPTI did not change significantly and DPTI/TTI increased (p&lt;0.05). When Valsalva maneuver was initiated during angina, 16 patients reported prompt and complete relief of angina, and left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure declined following the maneuver. Relief of ischemia occurred uniformly during the latter part of straining (phase II) coincident with the peak reduction in TTI, cardiac size, and increase in DPTI/TTI. These data indicate that a transient increase in intrathoracic pressure results in a decrease in hemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen demand and an increase in the myocardial oxygen supply: Demand ratio.</jats:p>",

It is a simulation model that predicts the economic stock supply of primary products on the basis of estimates of product demands and production costs. Two market levels are considered: one for primary wood products and one for stumpage. The model recognizes quantity and price determinants for roundwood delivered f.o.b. the mill. These determinants include differential harvesting and transportation costs, complementary–competitive relationships between primary products, and landowner response to price. Thus, what is sometimes called \"economic timber supply\" by practitioners is determined. Components of the model are described and an application is presented. </jats:p>",

For wheat, the derived elasticity of export demand had a positive sign. Hypothesis testing validated the dynamic structure of the estimated models in all markets. Stability properties were confirmed in export markets of corn and soybeans, but results were inconclusive for the wheat market. Adjustment coefficients indicate that exports and export prices do not adjust immediately to their equilibrium levels. Multiplier impacts indicate a stable path of convergence for all markets, with minimal impact of exogenous shocks on wheat and corn exports and export prices. Soybean export prices exhibit a significant response to changes in domestic export capacity, but minimal response to other exogenous shocks.</jats:p>",

Questions relating operational losses to forecast period and accuracy are addressed. Some simple available forecasting techniques are assessed for their accuracy and applicability. These issues are addressed through the use of a simulation model of the Cedar and South Fork Tolt Rivers, where the system is modeled as a single purpose reservoir supplying municipal and industrial water to the Seattle metropolitan area. The following conclusions were made for this system: (1) reservoir operation deteriorates markedly with the loss of forecast accuracy; (2) the optimal length of forecasting period is five months; (3) reservoir operation may be improved by as much as 88 percent if perfect predictive abilities are available; (4) the mean of the historic data is not recommended to predict future flows because Markov methods are always superior; and (5) lag‐one autoregressive Markov schemes exhibit about a 9 percent improvement in operation over no forecasting.</jats:p>",
