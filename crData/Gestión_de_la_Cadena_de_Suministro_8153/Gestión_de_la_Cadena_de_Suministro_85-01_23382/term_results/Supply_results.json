Many farmers have border dyked about this proportion of their farms leaving the remainder dryland. In 1978 a farmlet with the whole area prepared for irrigation but still subject to the normal limitations of the rostered water supply was set up at Winchmore. Half of the area is in cash crop. Through a careful selection of crops and sowing dates each crop can be irrigated for maximum yield without exceeding the water allocation. On the remainder of the farmlet half the area is in grass clover pasture and half in lucerne. The water supply permits this to be irrigated at four weekly intervais or more frequently before and after the period of crop irrigation. Crop production on the farmlet has only been average. For instance wheat and barely have generally yielded between 3.5 and 5 tonnes per hectare. Soil moisture monitoring suggests that limitations have not been imposed by the irrigation regime itself but by such factors as late sowing the crop or undersowing with pasture. Over the three year stand life herbage production has averaged over 11000 kg/ha with annual yield of lucerne exceeding that of grass/clover pasture in the first season ex crop. Stocking rates between 13 and 15 ewes/ha measured over the whole farm area or 26-301ha on spring grazing area have been adopted with large variations in production. With recent changes in the relative economics of sheep and cropping it has been decided to increase the emphasis on the crop aspect of the farmlet. The cropping area has been increased to twothirds. The farmlet is still run under the limitations of the rostered water supply but water may now be transferred from the herbage to crop at critical times. At the expense of small losses in herbage production crop yields will be increased substantially by eliminating such practices as late sowing dates and undersowing.

The twin concerns of research librarians and scholars are firstly, the conservation and recognition of the surviving importance of the book, and secondly, that excessive borrowing from research libraries may adversely affect service to scholars and other researchers, particularly in the humanities. However, research libraries are part of the totality of library and information systems and several developments are required to ensure that they can both contribute and benefit from resource sharing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An upper bound for the rate of supply of new nitrate required to maintain the observed primary production on the North West Shelf is estimated to be 0.1 g N m-2 day -1. Nitrate concentrations over the shelf and slope regions are high ( &gt; 100 mg N m-3, in water deeper than - 100 m and usually low (~10 mg N m-3), on the shelf. River flow is weak and carries little nutrient into the shelf waters and so it remains for ocean physical processes to advect and mix the nutrient-rich deep waters onto the shallower shelf regions to meet the nutrient demand. Several mechanisms are reviewed to determine their potential in carrying out the required transport processes. Estimates of the advection of nitrate onto the shelf show that both semi-diurnal tidal flow and low-frequency (periods &gt; 35 h) upwelling events can each contribute approximately half the required demand, providing there is rapid use of nutrients. The upwelling events occur in summer and are associated with reversals of the south-west-flowing Leeuwin Current. Tropical cyclones are also shown to be capable of meeting a small, but significant, portion of the demand through enrichment of the surface layers in the offshelf waters by upwelling and vertical mixing. The enriched water can then be advected onto the shelf. Both tidal and internal tidal motion have the potential to transport nitrate onto the shelf from deeper water through vertical and horizontal mixing processes. However, these processes are difficult to quantify accurately. It is concluded that nitrogen is supplied to this shelf ecosystem by physical processes that are regular throughout the year, as opposed to large sporadic events that occur only once or twice a year.</jats:p>"

Indeterminacy results in family bargaining which needs to be considered by economists. It is argued that family bargaining is a subject requiring sociological treatment.

The eastern moraine is formed by the emergence of coarse angular clasts from a series of short longitudinal debris bands 1 km from the glacier terminus; this debris is derived from rock falls at the glacier head-wall, and follows a low-level transport path through the glacier. The western moraine is formed partly by the direct fall of weathered debris on to the ice surface at a point 2.6 km from the snout, but it receives further increments of sediment from extensive longitudinal englacial debris bands developed from the convergence of two ice streams with lateral englacial debris septa. The medial-lateral moraine complex is formed largely by rock falls from the western valley wall, but is also nourished by a debris layer developed at the base of the small tributary Glacier de la Mitre. This layer crops out at the eastern margin of the re- sultant inset ice stream, and releases more rounded, abraded and comminuted rock fragments to supplement the surface debris cover of supraglacial origin.</jats:p>"

It is possible, however, to adapt a Brooke or a Safar airway for use with oxygen, by attaching a tube with tape near the proximal outlet of the airway. This apparatus has been tried on 4 patients during general anesthesia with thiopentone-succinylcholine-neuroleptics—for appendectomies using controlled ventilation with expired air with oxygen added. Tidal volumes of 350-500 ml of air/oxygen were delivered at a frequency of 6-8 breaths per minute. The nose was closed by a clip. Sellik's maneuver could prevent gastric inflation. The color of blood was normal, arterial pressure and pulse did not change, and skin was dry. No fatigue or other effects were reported by the anesthesiologist-“rescuer”. In outdoor use, where oxygen from a chemical source is used, the problems associated with the exothermic reaction can be limited by cylinder lagging with openings to disperse heat. A flow of O2 6-7 1/min is sufficient to support a critical situation. It allows O2 enrichment for mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-mask, mouth-to-airway, or bag valve ventilation. Modest cost, and low weight allow large numbers to be stored for airport disasters, when resuscitation is performed on a large scale for many victims.</jats:p>"

Since the PC isotherms for the ZrNi–hydrogen system have two different plateau pressures corresponding to the existence of mono- and trihydrides, it is possible for the getter pumps to have two different equilibrium pressures. Because of the rapid decomposition kinetics of ZrNi hydride, these getter pumps are fast and consume little electric energy to supply hydrogen isotopes to high vacuum (HV) systems, e.g., it requires only 3.8 Wh and 150 s from onset of heating to supply 240 Torr liter (200 Torr×1.2 liter) D2 gas. One of the significant features of this getter pump is that, once activated, the gettering action proceeds at room temperature. Using a combination of two ZrNi hydride getter pumps having two different equilibrium pressures, it is possible to recover hydrogen isotopes completely from HV systems, e.g., 10 Torr D2 gas in a 1.2 liter glass HV system, can be pumped to 1×10−4 Torr within 200 s.</jats:p>",
