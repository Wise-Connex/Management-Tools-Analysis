The data are compared with results from 5 other areas in Norway. Emphasis is put on the importance of environmental diversity. Different plant species accumulate Ca, Mg, P, S, Na, K, CI and K to a varying degree but reindeer can meet their nutritional requirements by eating different types of forage. Examples are sodium from aquatic herbs, sulphur and sodium from horsetails etc. Of further importance are variations in soil type, phenological development of plants in relation to differences in time for snowmelting, as well as different levels of nutrients in forage from different geographical.</jats:p>"

However, growth in food production has failed to keep pace with population growth in the majority of countries surveyed, and especially in Africa. Changes in rural infrastructure, agricultural technology, environmental management and government policy will influence food production in the future, while food consumption patterns in developing countries will change as a result of population growth, urbanization and changing lifestyles. Shortfalls are likely to occur, especially in Africa, where the availability of new land for cultivation is declining. The pressures on food production will rise, unless efforts are increased to reduce population growth. </jats:p>",

The production of these messengers can be activated by agonists, and therefore the rate of utilization of PtdIns(4,5)P2 can vary dramatically. Although cells can only meet these large changes in demand for PtdIns(4,5)P2 by increasing its synthesis and/or by continuously cycling it at a rate that exceeds its potential consumption (avoiding the need for a co-ordinated activation mechanism), no satisfactory explanation for how this is achieved in agonist-stimulated cells has yet been provided. We show here that, in streptolysin-O-permeabilized neutrophils, N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), platelet-activating factor (PAF) and non-hydrolysable GTP analogues can cause large activations of PtdIns4P 5-kinase, suggesting that cells can accommodate agonist-activated rates of consumption of PtdIns(4,5)P2 without having to sustain continuous, comparably rapid and energetically expensive ‘futile cycling’ reactions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When an eruption of Kilauea lasts more than 4 months, so that a well‐defined conduit has time to develop, magma moves freely through the volcano from a deep source to the eruptive site at a constant rate of 0.09 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/yr. At other times, the magma supply rate to Kilauea, estimated from geodetic measurements of surface displacements, may be different. For example, after a large withdrawal of magma from the summit reservoir, such as during a rift zone eruption, the magma supply rate is high initially but then lessens and exponentially decays as the reservoir refills. Different episodes of refilling may have different average rates of magma supply. During four year‐long episodes in the 1960s, the annual rate of refilling varied from 0.02 to 0.18 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/yr, bracketing the sustained eruptive rate of 0.09 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/yr. For decade‐long or longer periods, our estimate of magma supply rate is based on long‐term changes in eruptive rate. We use eruptive rate because after a few dozen eruptions the volume of magma that passes through the summit reservoir is much larger than the net change of volume of magma stored within Kilauea. The low eruptive rate of 0.009 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/yr between 1840 and 1950, compared to an average eruptive rate of 0.05 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/yr since 1950, suggests that the magma supply rate was lower between 1840 and 1950 than it has been since 1950. An obvious difference in activity before and since 1950 was the frequency of rift zone eruptions: eight rift zone eruptions occurred between 1840 and 1950, but more than 20 rift zone eruptions have occurred since 1950. The frequency of rift zone eruptions influences magma supply rate by suddenly lowering pressure of the summit magma reservoir, which feeds magma to rift zone eruptions. A temporary drop of reservoir pressure means a larger‐than‐normal pressure difference between the reservoir and a deeper source, so magma is forced to move upward into Kilauea at a faster rate.</jats:p>",

In the cricket, ventilatory contractions are controlled both within each segment, by a bilateral pair of excitatory motoneurones in the abdominal ganglion supplying the left and right halves of the TM independently, and intersegmentally, by peripheral collaterals of homologous motoneurones from adjacent segments. The axons of these motoneurones run in the ipsilateral paramedian nerve. This unique divergence of excitatory motoneurones to different muscles also results in massive convergence of excitatory inputs from different ganglia, especially on the TMs of the middle abdominal segments. TM contraction rates are increased by this intersegmentally divergent and convergent motor supply, especially in the middle abdominal segments.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In bushcrickets, each transverse muscle in segments 3–7 is innervated bilaterally by four pairs of neurones: (i) two pairs of contralateral excitatory motoneurones with axons that diverge, supplying two adacent muscles; (ii) one pair of contralateral excitatory neurones found in the second anterior ganglion and (iii) a pair of median inhibitory neurones in the segmental ganglion. Transverse muscles 2 and 8 receive reduced innervation. The excitatory motoneurones generate slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), which must sum to cause muscle contractions. During ventilation, contralateral paired transverse motoneurones fire at similar frequencies, thus sychronizing the contractions of the left and right halves of the muscle so that the whole muscle acts as a single unit.</jats:p>",

Survey data of volunteers at four hospitals located in Madison, Wisconsin, are used to estimate the importance of a number of factors influencing people's willingness to volunteer at hospitals. We found that job opportunities in the labor market and tax rates affect the supply of volunteers. We also found that volunteers are not indifferent to the type of hospital at which they volunteer; a federal government hospital, a nonprofit state‐owned teaching hospital, and other nonprofit hospitals were not perfect substitutes in the eyes of individual volunteers in our study.</jats:p>",

Experiment I included a control treatment (without fertilizer application) and different supply rates of NH4. Application of other nutrients to the NH4-fertilized pots was constant, while at one supply level the added N included 50% nitrate in order to study effect of N form. High supply rates of ammonium suppressed root length growth, but did not affect shoot growth during one season of application. Root and stem growth was stronger with a mixture of ammonium and nitrate than with pure ammonium as N source. Experiment II examined balanced fertilization, additional to nitrogen, at low and high NH4-N supply during a two-year period. Second year bud break was retarded and shoot growth depressed at high levels of ammonium supply. In August of the second year nearly all trees died that had received a total NH4-N dose of 230 kg/ha. Addition of base cations and P to ammonium application raised P and K needle concentrations, but could not prevent adverse effects of NH4, and even increased acidification of soil. In both experiments presence of a litter layer tended to increase tree growth, and alleviated adverse effects of ammonium in soil and needles. A corresponding fertilizer application in a mature Douglas fir stand on the same soil improved nutrition of P and K as well.</jats:p>"

Higher values of relative growth rate and net assimilation rate were associated with higher values of plant N‐concentration. At all N‐supply rates, elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> resulted in higher values of net assimilation rate, whereas leaf weight ratio was independent of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Specific leaf area (and leaf area ratio) was less at higher CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and at lower rates of N‐supply. Lower values of specific leaf area were partly because of starch accumulation. Nitrogen productivity (growth rate per unit plant nitrogen) was higher at elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. At sub‐optimal N‐supply, the higher net assimilation rate at elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was offset by a lower leaf area ratio. Carbon dioxide did not affect root/shoot ratio, but a higher fraction of plant dry weight was found in roots at lower N‐supply. In the treatment with lowest N‐supply, five times as much root length was produced per amount of plant nitrogen in comparison with optimum plants. The specific fine root length at all N‐supplies was greater at elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>.

An increase in inspired O2 fraction (FIO2) from 0.21 to 1.00 was postulated to have the following effects: 1) increase the leg VO2max by approximately 5–10%, 2) increase the maximal O2 delivery [arterial O2 concentration.flow (CaO2.Q] by approximately 10%, and 3) raise the leg VO2max in proportion to both the femoral venous PO2 and mean leg capillary PO2. To test these hypotheses, 11 men performed cycle exercise to the highest work rates (WRmax) they could achieve while breathing 100% O2 (hyperoxia), 21% O2 (normoxia), and 12% O2 (hypoxia). Leg VO2 was derived from duplicate measurements of femoral venous blood flow and CaO2 and femoral venous blood O2 concentrations (CVO2) at 20, 35, 50, 92, and 100% WRmax in each FIO2. Femoral venous leg Q (Qleg) was measured by the constant-infusion thermodilution technique, and leg O2 uptake (VO2) was determined by the Fick principle [VO2 = Qleg(CaO2-CVO2)]. Leg VO2max was the mean of duplicate values of VO2 at 100% WRmax for each FIO2. Hyperoxia increased leg VO2max by 8.1% (P = 0.016) and maximal O2 delivery by 10.9% (P = 0.05) without changing Qleg. There was a significant increase in femoral venous PO2 (P &lt; 0.001) that was proportionally greater than the increase in leg VO2max. The results support our first and second hypotheses, providing direct evidence that in normal subjects leg VO2max is limited by O2 supply during normoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </jats:p>",

The time course of facial reinnervation and the extent of the new motor nerve supply of the vibrissal muscles that develops after HFA were estimated by counting all motoneurons in the brainstem labeled by injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the whisker pad; muscle innervation by motor endplates was not studied. In untreated animals, HRP injection labels 1,254 ± 54 (mean ± S.D.; n = 6) motoneurons, localized exclusively in the lateral subdivision of the facial nucleus. Immediately following HFA, this number drops to zero. The first HRP‐labeled motoneurons appear in the hypoglossal nucleus at 28 days postoperation (dpo) and at 56 dpo their number reaches 1,096 ± 48. Unexpectedly, the facial nerve, whose proximal stump has been left as blind end during surgery, additionally sends axons to the facial periphery. This resprouting is first detected at 42 dpo with HRP‐marked neurons throughout the facial nucleus lacking somatotopic organiza‐tion. The number of these labeled neurons also rises with time, and at 56 dpo, a total of 1,797 ± 142 facial and hypoglossal motoneurons, that is, 43% more motoneurons than in normal animals, supplies the whisker pad. This hyperinnervation, that is, the projection of more moto‐neurons into the target muscle than under normal conditions‐further increases to 1,978 ± 92 motoneurons at 224 dpo and may provide a new animal model for studying the competitive relationships between motoneurons in their search for peripheral targets. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",
