The authors give a brief history of this development and present the arrangement and profile of atypical supply vessel as well as a complete table of characteristics on a number of vessels.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>It is shown how the demand to carry large quantities of cargo on deck resulted in a somewhat unique hull form. Two particular areas of design are stressed, stability and powering. The question of stability is gone into in detail, including development of the current USCG stability criteria. The difficulty in estimating power requirements for the low speed length ratios associated with supply vessels is brought out. Data for estimating power requirements is presented.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official view of the American Marine Corp. or the USCG.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>INTRODUCTION</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>When the first offshore oil well was drilled in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of World War II, the need for delivery of supplies such as drill pipe casings; drilling mud; cement, etc., brought forward a new type vessel--- offshore supply vessel.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Among the first offshore supply vessels were the war surplus LCT's, primarily because they were readily available. They were adequate for the early offshore drilling sites close to shore. When new vessels were built, they were designed closely to the LCT's with the pilot house aft. Then in 1954, a new type of supply vessel came into being which was to set the pattern for the offshore supply vessels that were to come. These vessels had all of the crew quarters forward leaving a large deck area aft for carriage of deck cargo. Connection between the forward quarters and the engine room aft was through a passage under deck.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>During the last 15 years, because of the rapid worldwide development of offshore oil fields, we have seen not only bigger, faster and more seaworthy supply vessels built, but have also witnessed the use of these vessels in many different roles. Offshore supply vessels have been used as seismographic exploration vessels, oceanographic research ships, tenders for deep diving submarines, telephone cable laying vessels, container ships, anchor handle vessels and seagoing tugs. This paper, however, will limit discussions only to the vessels that carry supplies.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>It is the intention of this paper to provide designers and operators with a better understanding of the stability characteristics of offshore supply vessels, and to contribute some information concerning preliminary design structural design, and powering requirements, all of which have been lacking in this fast growing field.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>ON THE PROPORTIONS AND ARRANGEMENT</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The characteristics of 20 offshore supply vessels are given in Table 1.

Although measurements of the soil P quantity factor were generally the more important, intensity measurements also made a highly significant independent contribution to the P supply. Inorganic P (a quantity measure) combined with the log of P concentration in a saturation water extract (an intensity measure) gave a multiple correlation coefficient of R = 0·954<jats:sup>***</jats:sup> with relative yield, accounting for 91% of its variation.

The transpiration rates of N‐supplied plants were higher than those of N‐deficient plants when soil moisture was relatively high; as soil moisture approached the wilting range, the transpiration rates of N‐supplied plants dropped to below those of N‐deficient plants. In spite of the marked differences in transpiration rates, as influenced by soil moisture and nitrogen supply, the stomata appeared closed. By coating the upper or lower surfaces of the leaves with a vapour‐impervious compound it was shown that stomatal apertures below the limit of microscopic resolution control the rate of transpiration. Under conditions that encourage stomatal opening (covering the plants with transparent plastic bags), the stomata of the N‐deficient plants opened to a lesser degree than those of N‐supplied plants. There was some evidence that when stomata were visibly open, transpiration rates were regulated by the degree of plant hydration rather than by the degree of stomatal opening. It is concluded that N‐deficient plants fail to open their stomata as widely and to close them as tightly as N‐supplied plants.</jats:p>",

When soil moisture was relatively high, the leaves of N‐deficient plants transpired less than those of N‐supplied plants, the transpiration rate being closely associated with the chlorophyll content of the leaves of various ages. In detached leaves which were saturated by floating over distilled water, stomatal width was markedly wider in N‐supplied than in N‐deficient plants. Throughout the available moisture range, the water saturation deficit was higher in N‐supplied leaves. In the dry range of soil moisture, chlorotic leaves transpired more than normal green leaves; N‐deficient plants failed to exhibit a sharp rise in the content of soluble metabolites in the sap, when approaching the wilting range. The content of ‘cell wall materials’ was higher in N‐deficient plants. The relationships between these indices is discussed; it is tentatively concluded that nitrogen deficiency impairs the ability of the plants to adjust their water status to changes in soil moisture by regulation of stomatal transpiration and of sap‐solute concentration.</jats:p>",

Low sodium (25 mM) produced a marked shortening of the action potential duration (APD) associated with a marked increase in the force of contraction but a small change in AP amplitude. A direct relation between extracellular NaCl and cardiac contraction was observed. There was no relation between AP amplitude and cardiac contraction. Low sodium induced shortening of the APD was greater in the absence of glucose than in its presence while the increase in the force contraction induced by low Na was markedly reduced in the absence of glucose. Low sodium was practically ineffective in restoring the contraction of papillary muscle in the absence of CaCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. A calcium concentration dependent increase in the force of contraction was associated with a corresponding shortening of the APD in low sodium. Anoxia markedly reduced the positive inotropic effects of low sodium and enhanced the low sodium induced shortening of the APD in the papillary muscle. Glucose produced a marked lengthening of the APD which was shortened during anoxia but it was effective only slightly in lengthening the APD shortened by low sodium. The effects of ouabain in the muscles in the presence of low sodium were reduced. It is suggested that the changes in the APD accompanied by changes in the contraction in the guinea pig papillary muscle might be associated with NaCl-induced changes in the membrane ATPase. The low sodium induced increase in the force of contraction seems to be dependent upon both calcium and energy supply. </jats:p>",
