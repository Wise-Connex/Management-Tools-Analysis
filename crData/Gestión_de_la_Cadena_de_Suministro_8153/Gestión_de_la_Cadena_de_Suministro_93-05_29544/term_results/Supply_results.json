The principle impact has been in rural communities of developing countries. Unfortunately, a considerable portion of these facilities are abandoned and inoperative. While completely manageable in the rich industrialized countries, water related diseases, e.g. infant mortality, child diarrhoea, and cholera epidemics persist in the poor countries of South America, Africa and Asia. The situation has been exacerbated by explosive population growth in the poor countries of the world.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Despite national and international commitment, water supply and sanitation services are not keeping up with the demand, and many investments have not been sustained. It is clear now that the major constraint, in the less developed countries, has not been the lack of funds or water supply and sanitation technology, but rather an absence of a capacity to develop, utilize and sustain the available resources.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Capacity building in a given country must come from within and it is basically a social-political process. The commitment of a country for capacity building of the water sector should be approached on two levels. On the national level this may entail changes in water related policies, establishment of legal, regulatory, and information systems, and the involvement of citizen groups and national professional organizations. On the local level, it is imperative to strengthen local institutional resources, technical, managerial and financial capabilities, and community involvement. Integration of water supply and sanitation agencies with local irrigation districts is frequently advantageous where water reclamation options are feasible. Examples from Egypt are presented.</jats:p>",

This modeling approach simulates photosynhetic carbon assimilation using seasonal canopy light interception and daily minimum and maximum temperature and solar radiation inputs. Simulation of carbon partitioning and crop growth is based on the hypothesis that plants grow as collections of semi-autonomous, but interacting organs. The plant genotype, triggered by internal and environmental signals, determines current organ specific growth potentials. Daily environmental conditions interact with organ specific growth potentials to determine the conditional growth capacity and maintenance respiration requirement (i.e. the carbon demand) of each organ type. Then the daily carbon available for growth after maintenance requirements are met is partitioned to leaves, fruits, stems, and branches based on their relative conditional growth capacities. Remaining carbohydrate is partitioned to the trunk based on its conditional growth capacity and all residual carbohydrate is partitioned to roots after above-ground demands are met. The methods used to determine organ specific growth potentials and the usefulness of using the supply and demand approach to modeling the carbon economy of deciduous fruit crops will be discussed.</jats:p>",

First, the present state-of-affairs is described and analyzed with respect to production, consumption and coverage.

Nearly full coverage has been achieved already but still more than 50% of the population is served by public standposts. Considerable demand for house connections is apparent. Based on the present trend it is expected that by the year 2000, 75% of the population could be served by private connections, provided sufficient production capacity becomes available.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Secondly, the focus is on organization and finance with special attention to cost recovery. Estimates for present billing efficiency and the Unaccounted For Water (UFW) percentages are provided. With the perceived trend in the growth of house connections and decline of public taps there is ample potential to reduce UFW, provided an efficient billing and fee collection system is introduced and leakage is controlled. With the reduction of UFW by “technical” measures half of the cost recovery target can be achieved. The other half has to come from tariff increases.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Experience is drawn from the Netherlands-supported Fayoum Drinking Water and Sanitation Project (FADWS) which started in 1990.</jats:p>",

The technique involves conventional finite‐difference ground‐water flow modeling and numerical flowpath/travel time calculation coupled with nonlinear mathematical programming. The objective of the technique is to specify pumping rates for wells in a wellfield such that the configuration of capture zones in relation to existing potential sources of contamination minimizes the risk of contamination while maintaining the required total water output from the wellfield. An important feature of the technique is its ability to incorporate realistic boundary conditions, complicated aquifer configurations, and spatially varying aquifer properties to whatever degree site‐specific data are available. Also, the technique is implemented on a personal computer. This approach to ground‐water supply protection enhances conventional wellhead protection area delineation because a greater level of protection can be achieved if potential contaminant sources are not even included in capture zones, rather than attempting to reduce the threat of those sources. The effectiveness of the technique was verified through application to a hypothetical ground‐water system. Practical aspects were demonstrated with an application in Pékin, Illinois. These efforts demonstrate the utility of an innovative modeling technique in ground‐water quality protection.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, empirical observations have revealed that often, after connecting, households do not use their pipe water supply, or augment it with alternative sources. Due to deficiencies in pipe water quality, pressure, or availability, households invest in coping strategies in the form of alternative supplies and storage facilities. Because these strategies have important economic implications, there is a need to develop an understanding of households' water demand that goes beyond connection decisions. This paper presents a model system of household water supply choices. The system accounts for the fact that households may use different supply systems for different uses of water. Moreover, the relation between households' choices of water supply and their connection decisions is explicitly modeled. The approach is illustrated using data from Faisalabad, Pakistan.</jats:p>",

Using data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we found the incidence of hip fracture for the 10 years before the fluoridation of the Rochester, Minn, public water supply was 484 per 100,000, compared with 450 per 100,000 in the following 10 years. When the effects of calendar time and age were controlled for, the relative risk associated with fluoridation was 0.63. These ecologic trend data suggest that the fluoridation of public water supplies is not associated with an immediate increase in rates of hip fracture. Further studies of this association at the individual level are clearly required before public policy decisions can be made. </jats:p>",

Experiments in Rye Lake (New York) directly examined effects of light and phosphorus limitation on the growth of small phytoplankters. Factorial experiments compared growth of phytoplankton collected from 1 and 15 m; microcosms were incubated at both depths and treated with a single P pulse (± 2 μM KH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>). During stratification, picoplankton (0.2–2 μm; ≈Synechococcus spp.) predominated, but surface nanoplankton (especially Cyclotella stelligera and Chlamydomonas gloeocapsa) were stimulated to equivalent biomass levels following the P pulse. No significant P effect was observed at 15 m. Picoplankton biomass was similar in surface and deepwater communities and independent of P treatment. Depletion of [Formula: see text] was greatest in surface-incubated controls. After turnover, phytoplankton biomass in both size fractions was unaffected by P but decreased when transplanted from 1 to 15 m (−30 to −70%) and increased in transplants from 15 to 1 m (+ 55 to + 140%). Results suggest that (1) Synechococcus is a superior competitor only under low-light, low-P conditions, (2) multiple resources interact to affect community size structure, and (3) resultant size shifts significantly alter ecosystem nutrient dynamics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Adenosine may mediate coronary vasodilation during work-related hyperemia and during ischemia. We tested whether adenosine blockade with 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline (PSPT) prevented dobutamine-induced hyperemia or magnified the reductions in flow due to vasopressin. Control (n = 8) and test (n = 7) dogs received paired infusions of dobutamine (70 micrograms/min iv for 5 min). Test dogs received PSPT (10 mg/kg iv) between doses. In both groups, paired infusions elicited comparable increases in oxygen consumption. However, in test dogs, the hyperemia was reduced significantly. Thus adenosine mediates the hyperemia of dobutamine. Separately, control dogs (n = 9) received vasopressin (0.6 microgram ic over 5 min); test dogs (n = 7) received PSPT before vasopressin. Vasopressin maximally increased coronary resistance by 3 min; effects were gone by 10 min. With PSPT, coronary resistance was increased further and remained high beyond 10 min. Thus adenosine-mediated vasodilation moderates the severity and duration of ischemia. These results indicate the importance of adenosine in mediating coronary flow during increased demand and reduced supply. </jats:p>",

Aggression serves the function of nest defence; hatching success of adults breeding in Shetland increased with aggression displayed during incubation, and the correlation between aggression and hatching success was apparent in three separate age classes. Adults displayed higher levels of aggression and greater parental investment in reproduction in years of poor food supply. This was not due to an increase in adults' expectations of future benefits of brood defence with increased investment. since hatching success was unaffected by food supply, and breeding success was lower in years of poor food supply. The observed increase in aggression therefore supports parental investment theory. Aggression increased with body condition index (in terms of mass corrected for body size) for females, but decreased with increasing body condition index for males. This probably reflects size‐specific differences in the relative benefits of weight and manoeuvrability as means of promoting effective brood defence and reducing the risk of injury to parents. Aggression may also reflect adult quality, with body condition reflecting quality in opposite ways in males and females, as a result of their different roles during the breeding season.</jats:p>",
