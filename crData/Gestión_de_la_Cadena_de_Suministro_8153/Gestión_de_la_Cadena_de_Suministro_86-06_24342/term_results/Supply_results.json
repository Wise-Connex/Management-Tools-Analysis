The ratio of the arteriovenous difference of glucose to the arteriovenous difference of oxygen in the cerebral cortex was measured during progressive hypoglycemia in paralyzed, artificially ventilated cats that were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and nitrous oxide. The ratio did not change when blood glucose fell from a mean of 7.68 to ∼2 μmol/ml. Below 2 μmol/ml the ratio decreased, indicating that substrates other than the glucose supplied by the blood were being utilized. In another series of experiments, changes in the redox state of respiratory chain NAD were monitored from the cerebral cortex using microfluorometry during the onset of hypoglycemia and the recovery. Hypoglycemia severe enough to produce isoelectric EEG was accompanied by an oxidation of NADH, demonstrating that the supply of reducing equivalents to the respiratory chain was decreased. Recovery from hypoglycemia, produced by intravenous glucose injections, was accompanied by an increase in blood glucose concentrations, the return of EEG activity, and a decrease in the NAD/NADH ratio. When blood glucose concentration reached 2.23 during the recovery, further increases in blood glucose had no effect on the redox state of NAD. Although alternative substrates appear to be utilized for energy metabolism during severe hypoglycemia, they cannot fully replace glucose as the source of reducing equivalent to the respiratory chain. </jats:p>",

RCD was observed in both Australian and English cultivars of wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L.), and in rape (<jats:italic>Brassica napus</jats:italic> L.), but not in subterranean clover (<jats:italic>Trifolium subterraneum</jats:italic> L.). It occurred most rapidly in wheat plants moderately deficient in phosphorus (i.e. in plants producing approx. 60% of shoot weight with phosphorus not limiting growth) but was delayed both in plants severely deficient in phosphorus and in plants with adequate and luxury supplies of phosphorus compared to those which were moderately deficient. Although inoculation with a vesicular‐arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus did not markedly affect plant growth, it delayed RCD in phosphorus‐deficient plants and accelerated RCD in phosphorus‐adequate plants. The effects of phosphorus supply and mycorrhizal infection on RCD cannot be readily explained by effects of these treatments on plant growth or phosphorus concentrations within plants. Moreover, it is unlikely that effects of these treatments on RCD are related to effects on the availability of assimilates required to maintain the cortex.</jats:p>",
