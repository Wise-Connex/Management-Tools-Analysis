This study attempts to understand to what degree labor patterns are affected by the receipt of remittances. Using nationally representative household income and expenditure data for Mexico, I analyze the effect of remittance income on labor supply decisions. I find that household labor supply in response to remittance income is consistent with findings which measure labor supply behavior in the presence of other forms of unearned income in different settings. That is, remittance receipts are associated with fewer hours of work and income elasticities are estimated in the range of -.006 to -.03. This finding attenuates to some degree the measure of the impact of remittances in the receiving country's aggregate output. </jats:p>",

While this specialization will create opportunities for scale economics in production, management of supply chains becomes increasingly challenging, as one particular manufacturing unit serves a number of different sales locations. The aim of this paper is to identify improvement areas in the new supply chain context of paper production, and possibly give further support for the general discipline development.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Research work is based on two different case studies completed for one major North‐European paper manufacturer, which is mostly serving its customers in Europe and the USA. The first case study (a preliminary one) started when supply chain challenges were recognized at the end of the 1990s, and a manufacturing unit was seeking managerial remedies – this investigation only concerned one manufacturing unit, while not singling cut any particular supply chain in the analysis. During the most recent years a more detailed case‐study was conducted with this paper manufacturer, which concerned lead time performance of four different strategically important supply chains. These supply chains were championed by two different large manufacturing units (the preliminary analysis concerned one of these two paper mills). The objective of this research work is to identify whether general lead time and response studies, mostly completed in the automotive industry, are applicable to paper production.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>According to the analysis North‐European paper manufacturers hold approximately 45 days of distribution inventory.

Therefore, the observations are limited to this company. However, in order to generalize the results further, the authors have analysed North‐European paper producers through macro data and financial reports in any research environment. To cover a mismatch between company level quantitative analysis and macro data, the authors consulted several key persons in the case company concerning the research results. Therefore, triangulation in the empirical data was achieved.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>It is argued that four reasons, namely: scale emphasis in production, IT systems to support supply chains, sea shipment, and outsourced distribution, play a vital role in the forthcoming performance improvement initiatives. At the moment this results in long supply chain lead times, whatever the distance to the actual market.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing on research from the interfirm relationship, marketing channels, operations management, and network theory literature and on the basis of qualitative depth interviews, the authors identify a new phenomenon they call “supply chain contagion.” Supply chain contagion is the propagation of interfirm behaviors from one dyadic relationship to an adjacent dyadic relationship within the supply chain. Contagion can occur inadvertently and with or without the knowledge of the affected parties. Using institutional theory, the authors develop a conceptual model that predicts the conditions under which contagion is likely to occur. Although contagion may take the form of any number of interfirm behaviors, operationally, the authors focus on whether the downstream influence strategies that manufacturers use with their dealers are imitated by these same dealers with end customers. They conduct conclusive research using a sample of 151 vertically linked manufacturer–dealer–customer supply chain triads and explain a large variance (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = .30) in the use of downstream influence strategies in terms of supply chain contagion. Given extensive prior empirical support for alternative antecedents to influence strategy usage, the explanatory power of supply chain contagion is impressive and suggests that how intermediaries treat end customers is explained, to a large degree, as the intermediaries simply imitating how their suppliers treated them. In addition to the identification of a new theoretical concept, the study provides empirical support for the effects of both macro- and microinstitutional factors on interfirm behavior. Specific factors that are positively related to the level of manifest contagion are environmental uncertainty and the perceived similarity and frequency of contact between boundary personnel; dependence asymmetry has a negative effect on manifest contagion. Managers and boundary-spanning personnel who are aware of supply chain contagion effects should be better able to influence strategically the behavior of channel partners and may be better inoculated against their own unintended imitation of other organizations within their supply chain. </jats:p>",

They also note the adoption of a multi-cropping agricultural system as a possible strategy designed to adjust to changing conditions over time. They find that around 3500 BC the volume of water in the rivers increases, and the rivers flood, implying annual soil refreshment and the consequent development of agriculture. By contrast, from around 2100 BC the river flow begins to fall while the winter rains increase. This time-bracket correlates nicely with the brief flourishing of Harappa. The locally derived evidence from Harappa combined with the Beas survey data provide a model for understanding the abandonment of settlements in the Upper Indus and possibly the wider civilisation.</jats:p>",

This paper argues that the growth of large contractors may partially address the power asymmetry between ‘big buyers’ and their suppliers, as well as provide an avenue for the latter to move up into higher value-added activities. The emergence of giant factories may also favor labor militancy, both because of the opportunities they afford for coordinated actions among workers, and because work actions can be more disruptive of global supply chains. </jats:p>",

Since then implementation has been ongoing and currently about 68% of the Icelandic population enjoy drinking water from waterworks with a water safety plan based on HACCP. Preliminary evaluation of the success of HACCP implementation was undertaken in association with some of the waterworks that had implemented HACCP. The evaluation revealed that compliance with drinking water quality standards improved considerably following the implementation of HACCP. In response to their findings, waterworks implemented a large number of corrective actions to improve water safety. The study revealed some limitations for some, but not all, waterworks in relation to inadequate external and internal auditing and a lack of oversight by health authorities. Future studies should entail a more comprehensive study of the experience with the use of HACCP with the purpose of developing tools to promote continuing success.</jats:p>",

We study the potential use of a flexible backup supplier as an emergency response to accurate lead‐time information arriving at (or close after) the beginning of the demand interval and well after an original order with the stochastic lead‐time supplier has been placed. The emergency response decisions involve whether to order and how much from the flexible backup supplier, with the objective of minimizing the cost of meeting demand. We derive the optimal emergency‐response policy and clearly outline its implications on the optimized safety lead time of the original order placement and on the cost of meeting demand. We examine the impact on the use of the flexible backup supplier of factors like the arrival time of accurate lead‐time information and the response lead time of the backup supplier. We further study the potential benefits of the use of the flexible backup supplier in a dual role: as one of the two suppliers in a redundant supply system assigned to originally meet the demand and as an emergency response to later‐arriving lead‐time information. Our numerical studies illustrate the benefits from the use of the flexible backup supplier as an emergency response, but for reasonable purchase premiums and short lead times of flexible backup supply options, their use in a dual (regular and emergency response) role often leads to improved performance over safety lead‐time single and uncertain lead‐time supplier‐replenishment strategies. The benefits of the backup supply options are accentuated the higher the lead‐time uncertainty of the stochastic lead‐time supplier is. </jats:p>",

In the present configuration the available frequency range spans a factor of 2. The actual values of the minimum and maximum frequencies depend on the chosen inductor and the capacitance of the ion guide. Feedback allows for stabilized, computer-adjustable rf amplitudes over the range of 5–500V. The rf power supply was characterized over the range of 350–750kHz and evaluated by driving a quadrupole ion guide in an electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer.</jats:p>",

Here, such constructive interaction is pursued by the introduction of a negotiation mechanism among neighboring sites, and according to revenues/costs directly related to the impact of the bullwhip effect on the performances of each site. The concept is demonstrated for a policy which is quite common in the supply chain literature. The results obtained show the convergence properties of the negotiation for particular disturbance signals, and give indications on how cooperating mechanisms can be devised on the basis of the proposed negotiation.

However, when planning flexibility or alternatives exist because of differing local country tax rates and types and intra‐company transfer pricing options, cost minimization methodologies may inaccurately identify profit‐maximizing global production and distribution plans. Instead, a profit maximization model that explicitly evaluates decisions such as where to incur tax liabilities and how to set intra‐company prices may be required to develop an integrated global manufacturing and distribution plan. In this paper, we discuss and formulate a model that yields profit maximizing global production and distribution plans. We discuss the managerial implications of our results, and the potential applications and benefits of the model.</jats:p>",

Exceller). Plants inoculated or not with Glomus macrocarpum were exposed to Cd (0-20 µmol L-1), at two P levels (5 and 10 mg L-1) in the nutrient solution. The experiment was conducted in a hydroponic system, using a randomized 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. The mycorrhiza-Cd interaction on plant growth, nutrients and Cd accumulation, AMF root colonization and on extra-radical mycelium was investigated. Mycorrhiza promoted plant growth whereas Cd addition reduced plant biomass production. No difference in plant Cd concentrations was found between mycorrhizal (M) and non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants, where Cd accumulated mainly in roots. In general, roots showed a slightly higher Cd concentration in the cell wall than in the cytoplasmic fraction, with M roots presenting 26% more Cd in the cell wall fraction than NM roots. Mycorrhizal plants showed higher P/Cd, N/Cd and S/Cd ratios in shoots and roots compared to NM plants. Mycorrhizal colonization and the length of extra-radical mycelium were diminished by Cd addition, the reduction being more pronounced under high-P supply. Addition of Cd induced guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX) activity in roots; however, M plants, in addition to the higher root protein contents, showed no induction of GPOX activity in the presence of Cd, suggesting higher tolerance to Cd. It is concluded that Cd affected mycorrhizal symbiosis by decreasing root colonization and the development of the extra-radical mycelium. Nevertheless, the higher growth and nutrients/Cd ratios observed in M plants indicate an efficient symbiosis capable of alleviating Cd stress.</jats:p>",

The objectives of this study were to quantify genetic improvement in yield under: (i) assimilate limiting conditions, (ii) under low N fertility, and (iii) when either inorganic N fertilizer or N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation is the main source of N. A randomized complete block experiment was conducted at two locations in 1998 and one in 1999. The main plot factor included no shade or a 63% shade treatment imposed after the R4/R5 developmental stage. The split plot factors were three N treatments: (i) inoculated, (ii) uninoculated with no additional fertilizer, and (iii) uninoculated plus fertilizer N. The split‐split plots were four cultivars, representing a pair of older and a pair of newer cultivars. Shading reduced dry matter (DM) accumulation, and both shading and N limitation reduced N accumulation and seed yield. However, the newer cultivars consistently maintained their yield advantage over the older cultivars under both shading and N limiting conditions as well as when the source of N was soil available N or N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation.

Linking constraints and dependent demand constraints were added to the monolithic Multi-Level, multi-item Capacitated Lot Sizing Problem (MLCLSP) for supply chains. Model MLCLSP was Lagrangian relaxed and decomposed into facility-separable sub-problems based on the separability of it. Genetic Algorithms was incorporated into Lagrangian Relaxation method to update Lagrangian multipliers, which coordinated decentralized decisions of the facilities in supply chains. Production planning of independent partners could be appropriately coordinated and optimized by this framework without intruding their decision authorities and private information. This collaborative planning schema was applied to a large set problem in supply chain production planning. Experimental results show that the proposed coordination mechanism and procedure come close to optimal results as obtained by central coordination in terms of both performance and robustness. </jats:p>",

Field experiments were done to evaluate the effect of light climate on the photosynthetic efficiency. To test for a potential overlap in food niche we studied prokaryote abundance and examined food vacuole contents of the ciliates, using the catalyzed reported deposition‐fluorescence <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> hybridization (CARD‐FISH). <jats:italic>S. araucanus</jats:italic>, a species resistant to ultraviolet radiation, was present in the epilimnion. In contrast, <jats:italic>O. naumanni</jats:italic> preferred the metalimnetic layers and was more abundant in years with deeper thermoclines. Variation in the diffuse extinction coefficient was significantly correlated with <jats:italic>S. araucanus</jats:italic> abundance, suggesting a shading effect of this dark ciliate. The expected extinction coefficient due to <jats:italic>Stentor</jats:italic>, measured by spectrophotometric analyses, did not differ from that observed in nature. <jats:italic>O. naumanni</jats:italic> was found to be photosynthetically efficient at low light intensities and susceptible to photoinhibition at epilimnetic light irradiances. Conversely, <jats:italic>S. araucanus</jats:italic> needed a high light supply to maintain endosymbiotic algal photosynthesis and was favored during years of relatively shallow thermocline and high epilimnetic mean irradiance. CARD‐FISH analysis revealed that O. naumanni fed on <jats:italic>Archea</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Eubacteria</jats:italic>, and picocyanobacteria. In contrast, <jats:italic>S. araucanus</jats:italic> did not feed on prokaryotes. Based on these results, we suggest that light climate, created by temporal or spatial variations in thermocline depth, is a key factor modulating niche partitioning for mixotrophic ciliate species.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to quantify differences between an older and a newer maize hybrid in their response to N availability throughout the life cycle at both the leaf and the whole‐plant level. An older and a newer maize hybrid were grown in a field hydroponic system located near Guelph, ON, in 2005 at a high and a low N level. Leaf carbon exchange rate (CER), chlorophyll index, and the thylakoid electron transport rate (ETR) were measured weekly from 2 wk presilking to 8 wk postsilking. Plant‐component dry matter and N content were determined from 1 wk presilking to maturity. At the leaf level, leaf CER declined during the grain‐filling period, and the decline was greater under low than high N availability. The decline in leaf CER during the grain‐filling period was less in the newer than in the older hybrid under both high and low N availability, and differences in leaf CER were associated most strongly with a reduction in leaf CER per unit absorbed photosynthetic photon flux density. At the whole‐plant level, reduction in grain yield in low vs. high N was greater in the older than in the newer hybrid. The hybrid × N interaction for grain yield was attributable predominantly to a greater decline in the proportion of dry matter allocated to the grain in the older hybrid.</jats:p>",

The highest sand feed rate produced less sand infiltration into the subsurface deposits than the other two runs, which had approximately equivalent amounts of sand infiltration. Experimental data, combined with simple geometric relations and physical principles, are used to derive two relations describing the saturated fine sediment fraction in a gravel deposit and the vertical fine sediment fraction profile resulting from fine sediment infiltration. The vertical fine sediment fraction profile relation suggests that significant sand infiltration occurs only to a depth equivalent to a few median grain diameters of the bed material.</jats:p>",

Inherent in emerging definitions is the notion that SCM encompasses activities traditionally considered aspects of production, logistics, marketing, and operations management. Defining SCM in such a broad scope (i.e., a “within” and “across” functions perspective), while considered by many scholars as the true representation of the essence of SCM, creates confusion regarding the appropriate organizational level within a business that is best suited for managerial decision making regarding the phenomenon. This paper contributes to the emerging SCM dialogue by highlighting the functional spaces (the “within” function perspective), relationships, and conceptual overlaps (the “across” functions perspective) between marketing, logistics, production, operations, and supply chain management. By comparing and contrasting the literature‐based conceptual boundaries of each discipline, a framework is proposed that more clearly captures the essence of the SCM decision making sphere. Managerial insights and future research implications are presented.</jats:p>",

Stand growth and foliar nutrient concentrations were measured for 6 years, and during the third year, a seedling bioassay was conducted with soil collected from the highest fertilization and nonfertilized treatments. Annual stand growth was increased by 14%–27% in the fertilized plots suggesting that the fertilizer regime improved stand productivity. However, results from the seedling bioassay showed that only P fertilization had caused changes in soil nutrient supply. Seedling P contents in the fertilized treatments were 3.6 times larger than those in the nonfertilized treatments.

In this study we aimed to investigate strictly gastrocnemius muscle function non‐invasively, using magnetic resonance techniques in endotoxemic rats. Endotoxemia was induced by injecting animals intraperitoneally at t<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> and t<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> + 24 h with <jats:italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</jats:italic> lipopolysaccharides (at 3 mg kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Investigations were performed at t<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> + 48 h during a transcutaneous electrical stimulation protocol consisting of 5.7 min of repeated isometric contractions at a frequency of 3.3 H<jats:sc>Z</jats:sc>. Endotoxin treatment produced a depletion in basal phosphocreatine content and a pronounced reduction in oxidative adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis capacity, whereas the resting ATP concentration remained unchanged. During the stimulation period, endotoxemia caused a decrease in force‐generating capacity that was fully accounted for by the loss of muscle mass. It further induced an acceleration of glycolytic ATP production and an increased accumulation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP, an important mitochondrial regulator) that allowed a near‐normal rate of oxidative ATP synthesis. Finally, endotoxemia did not affect the total rate of ATP production or the ATP cost of contraction throughout the whole stimulation period. These data demonstrate that, in an acute septic phase, metabolic alterations in resting muscle do not impact energy supply in exercising muscle, likely as a result of adaptive mechanisms.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sand supply is a major controlling factor on parabolic dune form and stratigraphy in inland settings. In this study, aerial photographs, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), and stratigraphic analysis document the morphodynamics of an individual and compound parabolic dune in the Bigstick Sand Hills, southwestern Saskatchewan. Migration rates for the last 60 years are comparable, although the profile morphologies differ, with the individual dune having a more aerodynamic form. Stratigraphic facies are also similar in both dune types, but the overall internal architecture imaged by GPR differs considerably. Configurations of cross-strata parallel to the downwind axis represent dominant foreset development and lee-slope slipface advance of the individual dune, and impeded slipface development of the compound dune. Stratigraphy transverse to the downwind axis represents radial deposition and foreset development at the individual dune, and vertical accumulation at the compound dune. The overall difference in parabolic dune form and stratigraphy is attributed to variations in sand supply, which determine vegetation development and sedimentation processes along the crest and lee slope. Sand supplied from active blowouts upwind of the individual dune inhibits vegetation colonization on the dune, whereas an absence of sand supply upwind of the compound dune leads to high levels of vegetation cover on the dune. Once supply drops below a threshold level, vegetation cover increases, causing sediment deposition and vertical accretion, and ultimately changing dune form. Overall, this study demonstrates that local sand supply and feedback processes are critical to understanding dune development in vegetated, inland settings. </jats:p>",

We examined the in situ use of crop residue as a source of supplemental N for succeeding crops in rice (<jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic>L.)‐based cropping systems at three sites during 3 yr. The experiments included a rice–wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic>L.) rotation at Yixing, Jiangsu Province, China; a rice–wheat rotation at Ludhiana, Punjab, India; and double‐rice cropping at Taojiang, Hunan Province, China. The supply of N from crop residues was assessed in the absence of fertilizer N as the difference in total plant N between plots with and without residue. At Yixing, incorporation of wheat residue before rice significantly increased the N supply to the rice by 14 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>averaged across 3 yr. At Ludhiana, incorporation of rice residue before wheat reduced the N supply by 3 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>to the wheat, but increased the N supply by 5 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>to the rice crop following the wheat. In all cases, the return of crop residues had no net benefit on crop yield when fertilizer N was supplied at rates sufficient to eliminate N deficiency. The incorporation of crop residues did not increase the N supply to the succeeding crop during its vegetative growth phase, but the N supply to the crop at later growth stages was often increased. Adjustments in the timing and rate of fertilizer N are probably necessary to optimally supply N to crops receiving residues.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Mangshan Plateau is located on the south bank of the Huang He (Yellow River) just west of the city of Zhengzhou, well outside the Loess Plateau in central China. Mixing models of the grain‐size data indicate that the loess deposits are mixtures of three loess components. Comparison of the mixing model with existing models established for a series of loess–palaeosol sequences from the Loess Plateau indicates that the Mangshan loess has been supplied from a proximal dust source, the Huang He floodplain, during major dust outbreaks. The high accumulation rates, the composition of the loess components, and especially the high proportions of a sandy loess component support this. Owing to the exceptionally high accumulation rates, the Mangshan grain size, magnetic susceptibility and carbonate records provide a high‐resolution archive of environmental and climate change.
