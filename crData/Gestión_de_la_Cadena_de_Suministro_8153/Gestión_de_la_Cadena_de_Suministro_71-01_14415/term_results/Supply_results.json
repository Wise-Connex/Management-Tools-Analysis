This would be an intolerable and inadmissible increase until John Q. finds himself without heat and services in the middle of a good, hard winter. Can his discomfort be avoided? Will it be avoided?</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Any attempt to forecast trends in the supply-and-demand aspects of natural gas in the U. S. must take into consideration all of the up-and-down cycles in the development of the natural gas industry. Each step must be analyzed, from the early days when the fielding of gas was an unwelcome occurrence that often accompanied the search for oil, through the discovery of the giant Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast gas fields and the post-World War II expansion years, to the current period of restrictive regulation, uneasy supply, and industry cost squeeze. Each step has resulted in a definite action or reaction that has left its imprint on the supply-and-demand relationship of the Industry, a relationship whose development is etched in the memories of the decision-makers in the Industry and that undoubtedly will be of considerable influence in all their future plans and decisions. Many long-time observers and experts in the Industry are amazed at, or even bewildered by, the rapid changes in concepts of supply and demand that are taking place almost daily, not to mention the rapidly changing concepts in gas processing and transportation. Certainly, the proven engineering techniques of extrapolation and proven engineering techniques of extrapolation and probability projection of data must be used with probability projection of data must be used with considerable qualification and caution in predicting future trends of the Industry on the basis of past trends.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Past Supply-and-Demand Relationships Past Supply-and-Demand Relationships and Regulation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Early gas discoveries resulted from the exploration for oil, and except for the small quantities used in the oil fields for fuel and lighting, gas was an unwanted commodity. Vast amounts of gas were flared from the early oil fields, and gas wells that were drilled were capped. Discovery wells were shut in because there were no gas markets, and many large gas fields were to remain undeveloped for a number of years. The first commercial outlet for this early-day gas was for domestic heating and lighting in nearby cities and towns. Generally, the gas fields were located far from any large population centers; and the gas supply was of how low than the local demand, with the result that gas was cheap. In the early days any price, regardless of how low, was considered better than losing it all by flaring the gas from the oil fields, or leaving the gas fields shut in. State regulatory agencies were being formed in the producing states, and they began issuing orders to prevent the flaring of gas in the oil fields. It was truly a lucky town that had a large supply of almost free natural gas nearby. Carbon black plants, ore smelters, brick plants, and other such gas-burning industries began moving in to take advantage of the cheap gas. (Many of the industrial cities of the Southwest and the Gulf Coast based their beginnings on this situation.) Rubber plants, ammonia plants, and other chemical and plastic plants were to follow. The early isolated gas fields in the U. S. can be compared in many ways with some of the newly discovered, remote foreign gas fields.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 41</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The power production in New Zealand in the 1969/70 year in primary energy terms was shared: oil 59%, coal 24% and primary electricity (hydro and geothermal) 17%. However, if the electricity is expressed as the energy input into a thermal station at 25% efficiency the percentages are: oil 39%, coal 16% and electricity 45%.A very small fraction of the oil is produced locally, the rest being imported; coal is all locally produced; gas is manufactured from both coal and oil while about 95% of the electricity is from hydro or geothermal sources. Traditionally each industry has forecast its own future in isolation.Following a National Development Conference in 1968 a Fuel and Power Council was formed. This Council was required to forecast the energy demands of all industries in the sector for ten years and to report on requirements for capital labour and other resources for each industry.One method of forecasting investigated was using the historical relationship between the rate of growth of demand and the rate of growth of the gross national product. Forecasts by this method produced lower results than those obtained by aggregating the individual industry forecasts. For the seventies the forecasts are —coal producing a fairly even level of energy primary; electricity generation, i.e. hydro and geothermal will increase by about 6.2% p.a. with further geothermal unlikely to be developed in the period and hydro development proceeding in one area in the North Island and two areas in the South Island. However, generation is forecast to increase at an average of 8.9% p.a. in the next ten years to more than double present level and thermal stations will produce the remainder of the increase.It had been proposed that the first of these new thermal stations would be coal-fired and the next a nuclear one but the discovery of a gas field off the Taranaki Coast has altered the outlook. It has been decided that the first two stations will be gas and/or oil-fired with the nuclear being deferred. Final decisions depend on negotiations mentioned later.As stated earlier only a fraction of oil used is local from wells in Taranaki which have been producing for many years. However, in 1959, a well at Kapuni was completed producing gas and condensate. The natural gas is being piped to Auckland and Wellington and will service nine existing gas authorities en route who at present use coal and imported oil. The condensate is shipped to a refinery at Marsden Point in North Auckland. The Kapuni field is of only limited size.More recently a much larger field has been proved off the Taranaki Coast. Exploiting this field will be costly and the natural gas market as a premium fuel is insufficient to warrant the expenditure.However, if the first two or even three thermal electric power stations were fired by natural gas the proposition could be viable. At present negotiations are taking place to arrive at conditions of supply and a price for the gas acceptable to both the oil industry and to the Government. The future of the oil and natural gas industry in New Zealand depends on the outcome of these negotiations and on the results of further exploration.</jats:p>"

The amount of oxygen supplied in this way decreased proportionately with rise in oxygen partial pressure at the root surface. Although roots offered a considerable barrier to the passage of oxygen out of them, experiments in which transport from the aerial parts was prevented indicated that the roots could obtain almost all the oxygen they required from the surrounding media provided the oxygen partial pressure at the root surface exceeded the low value of 0.05 atmospheres.</jats:p><jats:p>These results were obtained by means of a new experimental technique which enabled the effect of oxygen partial pressure at the root surfaces on oxygen uptake and root elongation to be studied. It was based on circulating a small volume of nutrient solution around roots in a gas‐free enclosed system sufficiently rapidly for the partial pressure in the solution to be almost the same as at the root surfaces.</jats:p>",

All sheep maintained two journeys daily to water until the distance between food and water reached 4.0 km. At this point Merino sheep drank three times every two days and at 4.8 km once a day. Border Leicesters drank twice daily until the distance reached 5.6 km, when they drank once daily. Food intake declined in both breeds as distance from water increased, but water intake was reduced only at the longer distances. When drinking once daily, water intakes were as much as 7 and 10 litres respectively for Merino and Border Leicester sheep. Walking distances reached a maximum of 13.6 and 17.6 km/day respectively for the Merinos and Border Leicesters. The average walking speed of the Merinos (2.51 km/hr) was greater than that of the Border Leicesters (2.06 km/hr). The implications for management of saltbush pastoral areas are discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With increasing knowledge about the major and micro nutrients, and their role in the life history of a plant and crop production, fertilizer application has become a part of cultural operation in a scientific way. Eventually the economic attributes such as the height of the plant, productive tillers, nutritive straw, and the high grain yield have to be taken into account. The amount of N utilised at different growth phases of the rice plant varies from variety to variety. We have sufficient evidence to show that N supply increase in tillering, shoot growth, root development and other factors which have been amply demonstrated. N starved rice plant showed reduced shoot growth and poor tiller production. (Tanaka et al, 1964). Bhattacharya and Sircar (1963), Baba (1961), however, noticed that beyond certain limit, N no doubt increased productive tillers but decreased ripening percentage. Srinivasalu and Pawar (1963) observed a progressive increase in the shoot/root ratio corresponding to increase in N supply. The grain yield of rice naturally depends upon yield components and determinants, such as, number of panicles per plant, their length, number of spikelets, filled grain percentage and mean grain weight. Comparing japonica and indica varieties, Tanaka et al. (1958 a) observed that maximum number of filled grain was seen at 20 ppm level in indica varieties whereas in japonica varieties at 150 ppm level of N. They have also clearly indicated that for indica variety 30 to 40 kg N/ha and japonica varieties 80 to 90 kg N/ha were economic dosages.</jats:p>"
