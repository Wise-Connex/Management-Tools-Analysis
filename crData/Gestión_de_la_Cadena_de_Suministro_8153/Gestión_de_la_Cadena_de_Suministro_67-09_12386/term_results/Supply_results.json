      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper combines simplified Harrod-Domar and\n      Mahalanobis-type models, first to show that the internal consistency of\n      a development plan may well depend on supply relationships that are\n      usually ignored in aggregate planning, and second, to suggest the value\n      of a more general version of the \"two-gap\" model [11]. An empirical\n      application of this analysis, to be published separately, will look at\n      these supply relationships and their influence on Pakistan's\n      development. The argument of the paper is simple and not unfamiliar. To\n      the extent that installed capital is specific in what it produces and\n      the products themselves are specific and non-substitutable between\n      investment and consumption uses, the pattern of investment in one period\n      may determine the allocation of subse¬quent income to saving or\n      consumption and, therefore, the rate of growth of national income. As\n      this constraint of insufficient physical capital is softened by trade, a\n      foreign exchange constraint may enter. Part I sets the context by\n      broadly contrasting the Harrod-Domar and Mahalanobis views of growth.\n      Part II develops a formal but quite simple model of an economy whose\n      growth is limited by either saving or physical output constraints. Part\n      III introduces trade as an alternative source of capital, relaxing the\n      physical capital constraint. Part IV deals with geographical specificity\n      of capital sources in a 'four-gap model'.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is suggested that an hyperbolic equation of the form (1/n) (dn/dt) = rb/(b + A) where n is the population density, b the concentration of limiting food supply and A and r are constants, is widely applicable as a density—dependent growth model. An attempt is madse to state explicitly the conditions under which it would apply. A consideration of the kinetics of food uptake leads to the interpretation of the constant A as representing a ratio of two rate constants, k<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/k<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> where k<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> is the rate constant associated with first step in food uptake and k<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> is associated with the second step which results in the freeing of the adsorption site. The constant r represents a composite expression, k<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>c<jats:sub>o</jats:sub>/(qn) where c<jats:sub>o</jats:sub>/n is the number of adsorption sites per individual, and q is the amount of food required to produce a new individual. Density dependent population growth models must always include a second equation which describes the effect of population growth on the environment (in this case food supply). The failure of the logistic equation to provide the necessary generality for this effect is pointed out. The applicability of this model for a number of different bacterial populations using a variety of both energetic and substantive food as the growth—limiting factor has been established for several years. Data are presented to show that it is also applicable to the unicellular alga, Isochrysis galbana, growing under limiting nitrate concentration and to several species of phytoplankton growing under limiting light intensity. The quantitative effects of preconditioning light intensity on chlorophyll per cell (c<jats:sub>o</jats:sub>/n) and on k<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> are noted as examples of the usefulness of this more detailed consideration of the growth constants, r and A.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the female genital tract of the cat is studied extensively with regard to the pharmacology of adrenergic mechanisms. An exact knowledge of the adrenergic innervation apparently would make the cat a particularly suitable model for functional studies on the involvement of neuronal adrenergic mechanisms in the reproductive tract.</jats:p><jats:p>Fluorimetrically, noradrenaline was the only catecholamine occurring in measurable amounts in nonpregnant cats. The amine seemed to have an exclusively neuronal distribution, although a comparatively small fraction may be also located in “chromaffin” cells present in relation to ganglion formations.</jats:p><jats:p>A considerable number of adrenergic nerve terminals were found in all organs of the reproductive tract. Consistent numbers of these terminals were directed to various structures forming the ovarian parenchyma and to the smooth muscle coats of the oviduct, uterus, and vagina. The rest of the innervation seemed to be of vasomotor nature. The histochemical results agree well with the high level of noradrenalin, 1.22–4.93 μg/gm, found in the different organs.</jats:p><jats:p>Denervation experiments revealed that the postganglionic sympathetic innervation reaches the oviduct, uterus, and vagina partly by way of the hypogastric nerves, and partly by way of short adrenergic neurons originating from adrenergic ganglia that could be directly visualized in the region of the uterovaginal junction. The ovarian adrenergic innervation seemed to arise more proximally, probably directly from the sympathetic chain.</jats:p>",
