Therefore a more comprehensive approach is required to reduce the amount of time that individuals spend in the labor market during their life span. Such an approach would aim at combining or alternating periods of education, work, and retirement throughout a person's adult life. Elements of the approach are recurrent education, flexibility of labor supply in accordance with the need of the labor market, discriminatory application for the sake of income distribution, and harmonization of the social security system. The scheme could be financed by money now invested in social security schemes of all kinds as well as out of existing educational budgets. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past thirty years, almost all developing countries have been suffering from severe underutilization of their rapidly growing work force, manifest in the first place in various forms of underemployment rather than in open unemployment. Prospective trends in the working-age population suggest an even steeper increase in labor supply and respectively rising employment problems for some time ahead. Policies promoting economic growth have proved insufficient to solve the problems. New strategies are called for, aimed explicitly at mobilizing the ill-used labor potentials for developmental purposes. This article consists of three parts. The first one gives a general outline of the relationships between population, labor supply, and employment, while the second one deals with empirical trends and structural changes in labor supply in the second half of this century. Both analyses bring forth the arguments for comprehensive approaches to the employment problem, which are presented in part three. </jats:p>",
