We find that ignoring behavioral responses understates the disposable income gain (or overstates the losses) incurred by these families. In some cases the differences are trivial, while in others (the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the imposition of time limits) ignoring the labor supply response might provide a distorted view of the effects of the reform.</jats:p>",

The absorption of the immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the past five years is marked by a completely new policy conception, known in Israel as 'direct absorption'. The Israeli government decided to replace its strategy of intervention from above with a strategy of absorption by market forces. The objective of the present study is to examine the spatial results of this policy, by looking at the geographical distribution of immigrants from the former Soviet Union in Israel, while distinguishing between the geographical distribution of supply of housing for immigrants (the public sector versus the private sector) and the geographical distribution of demand, which is manifested in the immigrants' initial place of settlement and their redistribution by means of internal migration.</jats:p>",

It can be assembled from readily available and relatively cheap components which can be itemized as follows: (1) commercial batteries; (2) fast high current switch; (3) feedback sensor; (4) PC with peripherals for controlling the switch. The apparatus was assembled for heating at very high heating rate with a low resistant load such as a graphite or vitreous carbon tube used as an atomizer in electrothermal atomization-atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements. The high heating rate must, however, be combined with a fairly good control of the temperature of the tube at various levels. This was obtained with a PC and relative peripherals which, directly or through a feedback circuit, control the switch. The system can be easily modified and adapted for other kinds of measurements as long as the high noise of the switching does not interfere with signal recovery. With the atomic spectrometer used (Perkin–Elmer Model 1100B), however, no worsening of the signal noise was observed. The level of current that can be used is mainly determined by the switch since, within a certain range, the voltage and the internal resistance of the power supply can be changed by the type of batteries and the way they are connected.</jats:p>",

The city recognized that high‐quality source water and effective watershed protection are the foundation of filtration avoidance under the federal Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR). Accordingly, the city applied for and received filtration avoidance determinations for the Catskill and Delaware portions of its system. This article summarizes the city's water quality data and watershed monitoring and protection programs in the context of the SWTR. A Watershed Memorandum of Agreement, signed Jan. 21, 1997, provides for land acquisition, updated watershed regulations, and partnership programs. As part of the watershed agreement, USEPA issued a four‐month interim filtration avoidance and will issue a revised filtration avoidance later in 1997. Provided the city meets certain provisions, this will allow it to avoid filtering the Catskill and Delaware supplies until at least Apr. 15, 2002.</jats:p>",

Theoretical models predict that without any compensation in female fitness, male sterlies will quickly disappear from a population. The amount of compensation required depends upon the mode of inheritance. In this study we investigated whether performance, during early vegetative growth, could play a role in the maintenance of male sterlies in populations of gynodioecious self‐incompatible <jats:italic>Plantago lanceolata.</jats:italic> This was accomplished by comparing the growth of the predominant male‐sterile type from a natural population with two hermaphroditic types. One of the hermaphroditic types differed from the male sterile only in nuclear genome, having the same type of cytoplasm. The other type was nuclearly nearly isogenic, but had a different cytoplasm. Plants were grown under controlled conditions, either in near‐optimal hydroponic solutions, or in a range of N‐supplies on sand. A detailed growth analysis was carried out, and the relative growth rate (RGR) of each type was analysed into its underlying components, the net assimilation rate, the leaf mass ratio and the specific leaf area. No difference between the sex types in relative growth rate was found and, in the components underlying the RGR, only a few small differences were detected. In none of the growth parameters examined did the male sterlies differ from either hermaphroditic type. Differences in plant growth related to N‐supply, differences in growth on hydroponics compared with sand culture, as well as the maintenance of male sterility in populations of <jats:italic>P. lanceolata</jats:italic> are discussed.</jats:p>",
