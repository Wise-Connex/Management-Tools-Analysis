      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research aims to explore the complex interplay between supply chain resilience (SCR), digital supply chain (DSC), and sustainability, focusing on the moderating influence of supply chain dynamism. The goal is to understand how these elements interact within the framework of contemporary supply chain management and how they collectively contribute to enhancing sustainability outcomes. The sample size is 300 CEOs and managers. The study approach integrates quantitative research methods. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is utilized to quantitatively analyze the direct and indirect effects of SCR and DSC on sustainability. The numerous surveys we conduct among supply chain ecosystem stakeholders provide a rich picture of practical implications and contextual nuances. In sum, our early findings generally support a positive relationship between SCR and sustainability in and of itself, declaring the need for more resilient supply networks for sustainability. We further find the beneficial impact of digital technologies in promoting sustainability via enhancing environmental control and controlling for efficiency in supply chains. We also offer evidence to show that supply chain dynamism compounds the positive logic between SCR and DSC and sustainability. As a final word, it must be noted that our work speaks to the burgeoning literature on supply chain dynamism as a moderator by examining the direct and contingent effects of SCR and DSC not only on performance but sustainability. By shedding light on the moderating role of dynamism, the study provides fresh insights into the multifaceted nature of supply chain management and sustainability practices. The study’s findings enhance theoretical understanding by elucidating the synergistic effects of SCR, DSC, and sustainability in dynamic supply chain settings. The study augments the existing theoretical frameworks by integrating the concepts of resilience, digitalization, and sustainability into a comprehensive model. Practical and economical, the research offers actionable guidance for organizations aiming to improve sustainability performance through resilient and digitally advanced supply chains. By acknowledging the role of supply chain dynamism, managers can tailor strategies to manage disruptions effectively and leverage digital innovations. Economically, adopting sustainable practices can result in cost savings and competitive advantages. The research emphasizes the importance of aligning supply chain strategies with sustainability goals to drive long-term value and societal impact.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The water supply situation in Lusaka district faces numerous challenges related to reliability, accessibility, and sustainability of water supply services. Despite a population of 3,079,964, only 134,807 household connections were established by LWSC in 2022. With a record 4.5% population increase from 2022 to 2023, the demand for water stands at over 420,000 cubic meters per day, while LWSC produces 250,000 cubic meters per day. Groundwater, accounting for 57% of LWSC's water, is threatened by land development and pollution. Meanwhile, 45% of the population relies on site sanitation, contributing to groundwater pollution, the very source LWSC is dependent upon. Lusaka faces low or no water supply, an average of 18 hours per day. Despite existing research on the peri-urban water supply, a gap remains in addressing the challenges of rapidly growing urban areas like Lusaka. This study aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis focusing on the unique challenges faced by LWSC, such as land development, population growth, and climate change. The research will offer practical solutions for sustainable water supply management in Lusaka and similar contexts.\nThe research philosophy employed for this study is interpretivism, as it allows for a deep understanding of the subjective experiences and perceptions of experts involved in the water supply sector in Lusaka. This approach aligns with the qualitative nature of the research, which aims to explore and understand the complex interactions between various factors influencing water supply services in the district.\nThe findings of the study reveal that climate change, population growth, and land development are significant factors influencing water supply services in Lusaka. Erratic rainfall patterns and prolonged droughts have led to challenges in water availability and quality, while rapid population growth has increased the demand for water supply services, putting pressure on the existing infrastructure. Unplanned land development has also led to challenges in water supply services, particularly in areas with shallow water tables that are vulnerable to groundwater pollution. The study recommends investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, diversifying water sources, enhancing water conservation practices, and strengthening land use planning regulations to address these challenges and ensure the sustainability of water supply services in Lusaka.</jats:p>"

Drawing from the resource-based view, dynamic capabilities, and contingency theories, this study examines the impact of green innovation strategies on supply chain resilience through the mediation role of green logistics management practices and the moderation effects of dynamic and structural supply chain complexity. Leveraging a quantitative approach, this study surveyed 404 managers from manufacturing firms in Turkey using a combination of physical and electronic questionnaires. Our analysis robustly supports the interconnected roles of green innovation strategy and logistics management practices in bolstering supply chain resilience. A green innovation strategy significantly enhances green logistics management practices and supply chain resilience. Further, green logistics practices contribute positively to supply chain resilience, acting as a crucial mediator in translating green innovation strategies into heightened supply chain resilience. Additionally, the effectiveness of green innovation strategies in improving green logistics management practices is amplified in less structurally complex supply chains. In contrast, the impact of green logistics practices on supply chain resilience becomes more pronounced in environments with lower dynamic complexity, highlighting the nuanced influence of supply chain complexity on sustainability efforts. The study’s findings contribute a novel perspective to the sustainability discourse, emphasizing complexity’s nuanced role as a determinant of supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

Conversion to continuous water supply as a means of tackling IWSSs’ inherent problems of inequitable water distribution, limited water supply hours, high non-revenue water, system operation and maintenance costs, and poor water quality is essential for sustainable water supply. Modelling and optimisation techniques have been used to aid the conversion process, optimisation of the operation of these systems, and guiding leakage reduction actions. However, modelling IWSSs have several challenges. These include the lack of accepted existing modelling techniques that include leakage modelling and the lack of comprehensive methodology for calibrating IWSS hydraulic models under limited calibration data. This study proposes a methodology for calibrating IWSS hydraulic models that include leakage modelling. The proposed methodology involves distinct steps to mitigate the problem of data scarcity, it eliminates the trial-and-error procedure of determining the leakage emitters' coefficients by using optimisation and it presents an approach for estimating the lower and upper bounds of the emitters' coefficients. The methodology was applied to a case study in Zambia. The calibration procedure gave accurate results given the limitation of data.</jats:p>",

These ERP systems meet the business requirements of integrating data and processes across the various business domains of finance, sales, warehouse, manufacturing, global trade, human resources, etc. A critical aspect of any ERP implementation is data migration for a source or legacy system to the newly implemented target ERP system. For an organization to truly leverage the big data, machine learning and data automation capabilities offered by modern ERP systems, it is imperative that project implementation teams define and executed an enhanced data migration plan ensuring data quality, accuracy and completeness, as well as establishing data governance processes for ongoing operations. The article aims to explore the components of such an effective, all-encompassing data migration strategy and execution and the future trends around the same.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This empirical study is based on primary data emphasizing the importance of evaluating supply chain performance through financial metrics, each activity within the supply chain directly impacts both the top line and bottom line of a business. In today's challenging business environment, organizations must prioritize monitoring their financial performance to ensure enduring resilience. The economy of Bangladesh has encountered turbulence due to disruptions such as the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing global political unrest. These occurrences have significantly impacted the business landscape, resulting in uncertainties in both demand and supply, shifts in consumer purchasing patterns, and notable increases in the prices of essential commodities and raw materials, therefore, the overall cost of business has risen. This study investigates the consequences of various disruptions, both internal and external, on the economy, adversely affecting organizations. The ability of an organization to withstand such challenges depends on maintaining robust financial and operational performance. Given the persistent global upheaval, there is a compelling need for an innovative approach to enhance supply chain optimizations, overall operational efficiency, and meticulous budget control and variance analysis aligned with financial planning. This is crucial at a substantial level to ensure positive entries in the profit and loss account and maintain a healthy cash flow statement. This study is done based on twenty-four (24) manufacturing sectors of Bangladesh. To address these challenges, the study advocates an Integrated Supply Chain Performance Measurement (ISCPM) model. This model contributes to academia through a novel approach, demonstrating its effectiveness by employing ten attributes to evaluate supply chain performance, with a specific focus on the financial performance termed Financial Health (FH), an attribute to measure supply chain performance in an organization. The study further elaborates Financial Health attributes into five key Performance Measurement Index (PMI) which are Economic Performance, Cost, Budget Variance, Inventory, and Planning Variance —within the context of manufacturing operations, providing insights into various facets of their impact. The study significantly contributes to the industry for practitioners by bringing synergy into the framework and performance measurement attributes, ultimately adding value to the manufacturing industry.</jats:p>"

This exceeds the 1% pharmaceutical drug storage standards the Ministry of Health set. This study aims to optimize demand forecasting and minimize total inventory costs through a two-stage process. Firstly, demand forecasting is conducted using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), predicting a future demand of 10,036 units of Medical Consumables. Subsequently, the optimal order quantity and reorder points are calculated using the continuous review (r, Q) approach. The results reveal the optimal order quantities and reorder points for four types of Medical Consumables. This research introduces a novel approach by employing ANN for demand forecasting, then calculating optimal order quantities and reorder points using continuous review (r, Q). The cost components considered in the inventory cost calculation include purchasing cost, holding cost, shortage cost, order cost, outdating cost, and inspection cost. The designed forecasting models aim to enhance inventory management efficiency, optimize cost control, and improve patient services. The limitation of this research is that it only used five types of consumable medical materials to carry out this research due to limited data access. It is hoped that future research can use other types of drugs as well as a periodic review and forecasting approach using GA.</jats:p>"

However, with the most recently reported MMR of 267, Ethiopia still ranks high in the MMR globally and needs additional interventions to lower the MMR to achieve the sustainable development goal of 70.

Furthermore, having inventory data in one place was a benefit to pharmacists and supply managers who would need to use the data to determine their historic consumption. The greatest concern related to the workflow and communication of the OESC was an inability to accurately forecast future supply needs. This is a critical issue because inaccurate forecasting can lead to undersupplying and stockouts or oversupplying and waste of medication due to expiration.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>\n                        <p>As a result of these interviews, we gained a nuanced understanding of the information needs for various levels of the health system to maintain a consistent supply of obstetric emergency resources and ultimately increase maternal survival. This study’s findings will inform future work to create customized strategies that increase supply availability in facilities and the region overall, specifically the development of electronic dashboards to increase data availability at the regional and facility levels. Without comprehensive and timely data about the OESC, facilities will continue to remain in the dark about their true readiness to manage basic obstetric emergencies, and the central Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Supply Service and regional hubs will not have the necessary information to provide essential emergency supplies prospectively before stockouts and maternal deaths occur.</p>\n                </sec>"

This study addresses the current perspectives and challenges which include inflationary pressures, trade imbalances, and disruptions in the supply chain, leading to increased expenditures for essential commodities. This research was developed through a systematic literature review based on secondary data, including online databases, journals, and review papers, etc. This exploratory study reveals that policymakers need to diversify energy sources, forge new trade partnerships, and implement measures to bolster economic resilience. The economic fallout from the conflict, surpassing the actual war in cost, has depleted the central bank's reserves, prompting austerity measures. The forex market experiences volatility, contributing to high trade deficits and the highest inflation rate in recent years. Bangladesh must address forex management challenges and formulate prudent policies for economic recovery. The conflict has disrupted global commodity markets, leading to inflationary pressures and increased costs for businesses in Bangladesh, especially larger organizations handling rising raw material costs and weak consumer demand. The rationale of this paper is to evaluate the literature on this aspect and apprehend the global demand, and supply of food and commodities, economic impacts in Bangladesh, challenges in global trade, trade relations, currency fluctuations, inflation, emergency price, and its consequences, recognize gaps and advocate future research itineraries. The paper offers a synopsis and appraisal of the overall economy of Bangladesh and finally navigates a way forward to the policymakers which would unlock further research to develop this sector.</jats:p>"

The findings reveal that trust in supplier relationships is influenced by various factors, including past performance, communication, transparency, and interpersonal relationships. Building and maintaining trust require ongoing efforts from both buyers and suppliers, including performance monitoring, proactive communication, and investment in personal relationships. However, trust is also vulnerable to challenges and threats such as opportunistic behavior, breaches of trust, cultural differences, and external factors. Moreover, the study demonstrates the significant impacts of trust on supply chain performance. Trust is associated with improved operational efficiency, cost management, collaboration, and innovation within supply chains. Conversely, trust deficits can lead to delays, disruptions, and increased costs, undermining the stability and sustainability of supplier relationships. In conclusion, this research contributes to both theoretical knowledge and practical insights in the field of supply chain management. By deepening our understanding of the dynamics of trust in supplier relationships, this study provides valuable guidance for practitioners seeking to build trust-based relationships and enhance supply chain performance in an increasingly complex and uncertain business environment.</jats:p>"

This study examines the effects of global supply chain disruptions on China's economy, using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model to assess impacts across different sectors. Findings reveal that China's economy can manage the broader effects of such disruptions post-pandemic, with industry-specific variations in trade balance, output, and employment. Increased negative impacts correlate with higher shock levels. The analysis shows primary and service industries benefit from domestic demand growth, whereas some manufacturing sectors suffer from reduced international demand. Industries deeply integrated into global value chains experience more severe effects from supply chain disruptions. The paper advises the Chinese government to address these risks, promoting domestic stability and enhancing global supply chain risk management strategies.</p>"

We find the cost without refinement, and then we calculate the cost with the refining process by using our proposed model. We compare these two results.

Through in-depth interviews and thematic analysis, the study unveils the interconnected dynamics of technological constraints, regulatory ambiguity, organizational barriers, supply chain complexity, and stakeholder collaboration shaping the landscape of circularity. Findings highlight the need for a holistic approach encompassing multi-stakeholder collaboration, regulatory alignment, organizational transformation, supply chain integration, and technological innovation. By fostering collaboration among governments, businesses, academia, civil society, and other stakeholders, it is possible to drive collective action, share knowledge and resources, and foster innovation and learning. Regulatory alignment and policy support are crucial for providing clarity, incentives, and market signals that catalyze investment and innovation. Moreover, integrating circular economy objectives into business strategy and performance metrics ensures that circularity becomes integral to decision-making processes, guiding resource allocation and investment priorities. Technological innovation and collaboration offer additional avenues for overcoming barriers and unlocking the transformative potential of circularity within supply chains. Ultimately, addressing the implementation challenges of circular economy practices requires a concerted and collaborative effort across stakeholders, sectors, and disciplines, leading to more sustainable, resilient, and regenerative supply chains.</jats:p>"

The study used secondary data from published articles on the adoption of Al in the food supply chain and adopted the Technological-Organisational-Environmental (TOE) factors as the theoretical lens for the study. The study results indicate that technological factors (usefulness, compatibility, and security), organizational factors (strategic objectives, and resource capacity), and environmental factors (maintenance and support, and government pressure) affect AI adoption in the food supply chain. The study contributes to the body of knowledge on factors that affect the adoption of AI in the food supply. Despite this contribution, the study has certain limitations that are worth mentioning.

Using collaborative forecasting methodologies, market trend analysis, and advanced analytics, automotive manufacturers can improve production schedules, minimize inventory costs, and foresee changes in demand. Reducing waste, enhancing process efficiency, and managing low inventory levels are all achieved through the use of lean manufacturing techniques like Just-in-Time (JIT) production and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). Collaboration with suppliers, uninterrupted material flow, and supply chain innovation can all be achieved through supplier relationship management (SRM). Automakers may enhance product quality, cut costs, and lessen supply chain risks by communicating openly, working together to improve processes, and forming agreements that benefit all parties involved. Automobile companies can't afford to have any product flaws that damage their reputation or the loyalty of their customers, which is why quality management is so important in this industry. Statistical Process Control (SPC), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Six Sigma are a few of the rigorous quality control methods that \nmanufacturers use to find and rectify flaws early</jats:p>"

Traditional methods for leak detection often exhibit limitations including low accuracy and high costs due to the complexity of the process. Furthermore, real-world application of these methods is hindered by factors such as scarce leak events, inadequate data collection methods, expensive data procurement, and privacy concerns around water supply network data. To overcome these barriers, our study proposes a leakage detection strategy for water supply networks that leverages a weighted optimization federal learning framework. By merging conventional leak detection techniques with federal learning, we enrich the leak detection dataset, enhancing the model's anomaly recognition abilities and fortifying its resilience. Through the implementation of effective weight allocation strategies, our method attains promising outcomes in identifying leaks within water supply network datasets, showcasing the efficacy of federal learning in leakage detection. This approach streamlines accurate detection and classification across diverse leak scenarios, introducing a novel perspective in tackling water supply network leakage challenges.</p>"

The use of semiconductors in automobiles has been on the rise since the early 2000s, as they are used for various sub-systems that aid in the optimization of everything from the primary functionalities of the vehicles to the secondary features. There have been significant disruptions in the past that have rattled the supply chain network linking these two industries. One such recent disruption that affected the two industries, and the relationship between them, was the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused production and sales in both industries to drop significantly. This paper attempts to use the SAM (specify, assess, and mitigate) framework along with data collected from dominant Indian companies in these industries during the pandemic, to analyze the potential for disruption within these industries and derive strategies that can be employed to minimize the effect of such disruptions in the future.</jats:p>",

By examining whether people believe iPhones become cheaper after being made in India and how this affects their decision to use Apple products, researchers uncovered valuable insights into consumer preferences and the role of sustainability in purchasing decisions.\nThe findings revealed a strong link between the perception of iPhones becoming cheaper after production in India and the likelihood of consumers using Apple phones. Those who strongly believed in this cost reduction tended to be more inclined to use Apple products compared to those who were less convinced. This suggests that consumers are influenced by the perceived affordability of Apple devices, which in turn affects their brand loyalty and purchasing behaviour.\nWhile the study also explored perceptions of Apple's supply chain optimization efforts, the direct impact on consumer behaviour was not as clear. Further investigation is needed to fully understand how consumers perceive Apple's efforts to streamline its supply chain and ensure product availability and timely delivery.\nOne notable finding was the positive impact of Apple's sustainability efforts on consumer behaviour. Consumers who perceived Apple as being committed to sustainability were more likely to view the brand favourably, demonstrating the increasing importance of environmental consciousness in purchasing decisions.\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge the limitations of the study. The focus was on consumer perceptions rather than actual behaviour, which may not fully capture the nuances of consumer decision-making. Additionally, the sample size and demographics of the participants were not provided, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings.\nMoving forward, future research could delve deeper into the relationship between consumer perceptions and actual behaviour, taking into account factors such as product features, pricing strategies, and competition. By understanding the underlying drivers of consumer decision-making, companies like Apple can tailor their marketing strategies to better meet consumer preferences and drive business success.\nIn conclusion, this study sheds light on the complex interplay between consumer perceptions, supply chain optimization efforts, and sustainability initiatives in shaping purchasing decisions. By aligning corporate strategies with consumer preferences, companies can not only drive financial performance but also contribute to environmental sustainability and social responsibility.</jats:p>"

It is very important to know the vascular anatomy of the carpal bones in order to predict vascular insufficiency and associated avascular necrosis that may occur as a result of any injury such as fracture. This article reviews the extraosseous and intraosseous vascular supply of the carpal bones. The carpal bones are supplied by three vascular arches formed by the radial, ulnar and anterior interosseous arteries on the dorsal and palmar sides of the wrist. These contribute to the dorsal and palmar carpal vascular systems, which consist of transverse arteries connected by longitudinal anastomoses. The scaphoid and capitate have a high risk of avascular necrosis, while the trapezium, triquetrum, pisiform and 80% of the lunate have a lower risk. With the development of new imaging techniques, new information is added to the literature. With the increase in three-dimensional studies, intraosseous vascularity and its correlation with carpal bone fractures and its relationship with avascular necrosis will be revealed more clearly.</jats:p>"

However, quantitative research on this development remains relatively scarce. This article addresses this by building a theoretical model of the relationships between internal supply chain integration, external supply chain integration and financial performance in omni-channel retailing and then verifies it by using a structural equation model to analyze 356 omni-channel retailers. The results show that in the case of omni-channel retailers, the supply chain’s internal information integration has a significant positive impact on its external information integration and that the supply chain’s internal process and internal organization integration significantly positively impact its external process and external organization integration. And it also shows the supply chain’s external information integration and external organization integration positively impact omni-channel retailers’ financial performance. However, the supply chain’s external process integration is not found to have the same effect on financial performance. This study addresses a theoretical gap in the research on the impact of supply chain integration on firm performance in omni-channel retailing. In addition, it provides suggestions about how omni-channel strategies can be effectively implemented in China’s retail industry.</jats:p>"

In recent years, the understanding and practice of procurement management have changed significantly due to increasing emphasis on and demand for agility and sustainability within supply chain management systems. Meanwhile, traditional supply chain systems, characterized by siloed processes, limited visibility, and inefficiencies due to manual interventions, can no longer cope with the current dynamic market conditions. Besides, the increasing requirements of sustainability, ethical sourcing, and environmental impact have intensified, making more responsible, transparent, and traceable procurement practices unnegotiable requirements for modern systems. In this paper, we examine the potential of emerging technologies and innovations such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT) in filling these gaps within the supply chain systems of enterprises in the US. The study employs a comprehensive review of relevant literature and case studies to discover and provide insights on how these technologies can improve procurement processes, optimize resource allocation and utilization, and improve sustainability.

The aim of this study was to describe the vessels involved in the stifle joint supply and the exact branching pattern of the popliteal artery. Colored latex was injected into the arteries of nine pelvic limbs of equine cadavers (n = 6) to evaluate the occurrences, variations and approximate diameters of vessels that supplied the stifle joints. Next to a branch of the saphenous and descending genicular arteries, eleven branches of the popliteal artery could be described in horses that feed the vascular network of the stifle joint. With a focus on the blood supply of the menisci, a vascularization map was created to show the main influx to these intra-articular structures in detail. These findings are potentially of great importance to both clinicians in preparation of best-suited incisions for arthroscopy and researchers designing new approaches for meniscal studies and choosing suitable animal models.</jats:p>"

Utilizing a questionnaire-based survey, data were collected from 297 respondents in Ho Chi Minh City, Binh Duong, and Dong Nai, Vietnam, by cluster random sampling. The data were statistically analyzed using the partial least squares method. The results indicated a positive effect of ERM on financial performance, while the association with non-financial performance lacked significance. Knowledge management and technology adoption fully mediated the positive impact of ERM on non-financial performance and partially mediated its relationship with financial performance. Furthermore, supply chain resilience strengthened the positive link between ERM and financial performance. In conclusion, these findings contribute to advancing the comprehension of the mechanisms and dynamics involved in knowledge management and technology adoption as mediators and supply chain resilience as a moderator, regarding an emerging country.

In construction projects, it is difficult for individual participants in the construction supply chain to make decisions about whether to adopt blockchain technology. It involves a complex decision-making process, the need to coordinate various players, the large capital investments involved, and the AD hoc nature of the construction supply chain. The characteristics and advantages of blockchain technology are a natural match for the construction industry's pain points, helping to solve many of the thorthoric problems that have long plagued the construction industry, such as poor information sharing, lack of trust among stakeholders, complex supply chain processes, payment delays, and lack of accountability. This study proposes a blockchain technology adoption decision model that can predict the success rate of each construction supply chain (CSC) participant after adopting blockchain technology, thereby helping them make decisions about whether or not to adopt blockchain. First, based on the TOE framework, the decision factors that affect blockchain adoption are summarized. Then, the decision model is established by Likert scale and DEMATEL method. Finally, an example is given to apply the model. This study can help CSC participants make informed decisions about whether to adopt blockchain technology. This study also further expands the construction industry as an important field of IS research.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Growth in US liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports have increased concerns about the climate impacts of methane leakage along LNG supply chains. Current life cycle analysis (LCA) models of US LNG supply chains are based on emissions estimates in national inventories that have been demonstrated to significantly underestimate emissions. In addition, recent top-down measurements of methane emissions exhibit significant sub-national spatial and temporal variation across oil and gas (O&amp;G) basins. In this study, we develop a geospatial, measurement informed LCA model that incorporates recent top-down methane measurements to examine regional differences in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity of US LNG supply chains for delivery to Europe and Asia. For every megajoule of LNG shipped from the US, the energy allocated GHG emissions intensity of the Permian-UK LNG supply chain is 42% higher compared to the Marcellus-UK LNG supply chain. Disparities in LNG emissions intensity across source basins can be directly attributed to higher measured methane emissions compared to inventory estimates. Developing measurement informed, supply-chain specific lifecycle GHG emissions assessments is critical to enabling a global market for differentiated natural gas.</jats:p>"

Developing a Composite Indicator (CI) that integrates key performance indicators (KPIs) offers significant advantages. This study aims to explore various aspects of creating a CI for assessing WSS performance, including clustering, normalizing, weighting, and aggregating KPIs. Data corresponding to selected KPIs from diverse WSSs in Iran were collected and categorized into four dimensions: Environmental, Financial, Organizational, and Social, to ensure comprehensive performance evaluation and calculation of an Overall Performance Index (OPI). A new multi-criteria method was employed to assign weights to KPIs in the CI Based on the concept of non-compensation. WSSs were grouped into clusters based on population, water resource type, and climate, and KPIs were normalized accordingly based on fair benchmarking. A non-linear (Geometric) method was utilized to aggregate KPIs, emphasizing strong sustainability and non-compensation interactions. The change in the results of the selected method was compared with the previous methods. The study found that method variation at each stage of CI development significantly affected the OPI and ranking of WSSs. Population emerged as a significant factor, and key findings include the substantial impact of resource type and climate on specific KPIs, underscoring the need to consider influencing factors in benchmarking. The non-linear aggregation method demonstrated greater rigor and sustainability compared to linear methods, aligning with principles of fair benchmarking and WSS sustainability.</jats:p>"

These parameters were compared with published data on water composition from other regions of Russia. It was found that the tap water from the Tyumen urban agglomeration has a predominantly neutral pH (5-8); the average content of organic matter (according to permanganate index) is less than 5 ppm) in all considered objects. The average water hardness does not exceed the permissible values (6 ppm); the calculated Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> - Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> contents are 75 and 45 mg-eq/l respectively. The average concentration of iron in water from non-centralized water supply sources and private wells within the Tyumen agglomeration is 1.9 MPC (maximum permissible concentration), while manganese levels are at 1.2 MPC. The LCIA method was used to assess the impact of Fe and Mn on freshwater ecosystems. An increased risk of non-cancerous health effects in the population utilizing well water for drinking purposes was identified, due to high concentrations of iron.</jats:p>"

Managing operations and supply chains in the automotive industry is complex, and this paper lays forth a comprehensive framework for doing so. An integral part of effective operations management in the automotive industry is demand forecasting and planning. Using collaborative forecasting methodologies, market trend analysis, and advanced analytics, automotive manufacturers can improve production schedules, minimize inventory costs, and foresee changes in demand. Reducing waste, enhancing process efficiency, and managing low inventory levels are all achieved through the use of lean manufacturing techniques like Just-in-Time (JIT) production and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). Collaboration with suppliers, uninterrupted material flow, and supply chain innovation can all be achieved through supplier relationship management (SRM). Automakers may enhance product quality, cut costs, and lessen supply chain risks by communicating openly, working together to improve processes, and forming agreements that benefit all parties involved. Automobile companies can't afford to have any product flaws that damage their reputation or the loyalty of their customers, which is why quality management is so important in this industry. Statistical Process Control (SPC), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Six Sigma are a few of the rigorous quality control methods that manufacturers use to find and rectify flaws early. This helps them maintain high quality standards and meets client needs. Improving operational efficiency and lowering costs in the automotive supply chain are greatly aided by inventory management. By balancing inventory carrying costs and service levels, automotive manufacturers can improve supply chain agility and responsiveness through the use of advanced inventory optimization techniques such as ABC analysis, safety stock optimization, and demand-driven replenishment strategies.</jats:p>"

In this regard, corporations are increasingly adopting the circular economy perspective to review their supply chain management practices in a sustainable manner. This paradigm shift suggests the need for a circular approach to supply chain management, moving from simple efficiency and waste reduction to a philosophy that promotes product redesign, reuse and transformation. The circular supply chain approach involves a number of interlinked elements, including product design for circularity, reverse logistics, remanufacturing (re-manufacturing), recycling and waste management. These components are integrated at different stages of the supply chain with the aim of maximising resource recovery and minimising environmental impact. Particular emphasis is placed on supply chain collaboration, which is considered one of the key drivers of the circular economy and circular supply chains. The analysis of the circular supply chain management concept highlights five dimensions of circular supply chain management: closed-loop supply chain management, reverse supply chain management, remanufacturing supply chain management, recycling supply chain management and industrial symbiosis.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In response to global warming and the dwindling reservoirs of fossil fuels, Thailand has increasingly embraced alternative energy sources. Central to its energy development strategy is the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP), which aims to reduce energy intensity, capitalize on residual resources, and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. While significant strides have been made in meeting various consumption targets set forth by the AEDP, notable challenges persist, particularly in the realms of bio-mass-derived electricity generation, bio-gas utilization, and bio-ethanol production from bio-mass. Therefore, this study delves into the factors contributing to the shortfall in achieving AEDP targets and proposes strategies to enhance the efficiency of the bio-energy supply chain. Leveraging mathematical and linear programming techniques, our research optimizes the supply chain dynamics, accounting for monthly supplier profiles spanning 77 provinces, 17 distinct biomasses, and 427 bio-energy plants equipped with diverse energy conversion technologies. Our findings indicate that Thailand currently boasts adequate bio-mass resources to fulfill the electricity and bio-ethanol targets outlined in the AEDP—provided enhancements are made to supply chain efficiency. To fully realize the objectives of the AEDP, we recommend augmenting bio-mass cultivation efforts and implementing new power plant installations. Additionally, we advocate for the consideration of high-methane content fuels, such as solid waste, as a means to alleviate bio-mass demand. This study underscores the paramount importance of strategic planning and optimization in propelling Thailand towards its alternative energy ambitions while surmounting supply chain impediments. </jats:p>"

In such instances, relying solely on intuition or managerial experience may not suffice, necessitating a quantitative approach. This demand is further accentuated in the era of big data, where the sheer scale and complexity of constraints pose significant challenges. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide a foundational framework for addressing personnel scheduling, a critical issue in organizational management. Specifically, we focus on optimizing shift assignments for staff, a task fraught with complexities due to factors such as contractual obligations and mandated rest periods. Moreover, the current landscape is characterized by frequent employee shortages across various industries, with many organizations lacking efficient and dependable management tools to address them. Therefore, our attention is particularly drawn to the nurse rostering problem, a personnel scheduling challenge prevalent in healthcare settings. These issues are characterized by a multitude of variables, given that a single healthcare facility may employ hundreds of nurses, alongside stringent constraints such as the need for adequate staffing levels and rest period’s—post-night shifts. Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated staffing challenges in healthcare institutions, underlining the importance of accurately assessing staffing needs and optimizing shift allocations for effective operation amidst crisis situations.    </jats:p>"

Research finding indicates that the application of a digitized supply chain can promote the visualization of information, enhance the quality of products, and strengthen the risk management capabilities and competitiveness of enterprises. The ongoing shift towards digital supply chains has been somewhat effective, but it has also brought to light several issues. These include low information accuracy and transparency, high pressure on inventory management, a lack of standardization, and difficulties in ensuring product quality. In response to these tough issues, the study suggests measures to encourage businesses to establish digitalized supply chain systems, prioritize data analysis and management optimization, and establish and standardize digitalization standards. These steps aim to improve operational efficiency and overall economic benefits for the supply chain for enterprises.</jats:p>"

Global energy transit is closely linked to fundamental problems in the world economy, which were aggravated during the coronavirus pandemic. Empirical evidence illustrates that new hydrocarbon supply chains have dramatically changed the balance of power in the global market. The reasons for this were the pricing policy as well as the supply and demand conditions in the market. Considering the gas market as a system of interrelated participants: producers and consumers, the study concludes that energy transit will be determined by the outcome of the economic competition between Russia and the West, as well as the speed of building the infrastructure necessary for the creation and transportation of liquefied natural gas. At the same time, the prospects for low-carbon energy are not so obvious. First of all, the high costs and the unwillingness of many countries to make significant investments hamper a transition. The study concludes that the restructuring of global energy supply chains is in the interests of some developed countries. In general, the current processes in the global energy sector represent a fundamental trend that is associated with the transition period of the world economy. The paper contributes to the knowledge by providing a comprehensive overview of the new processes in the energy sphere. </jats:p>"

The case study includes the Połaniec power plant in southeastern Poland and potential sources of forest biomass and agricultural straw within 100 km of the plant. Unit costs of biomass varied depending on biomass availability and energy demands. For energy demand on the level of 1 PJ yearly, the lowest unit costs of biomass (4.08 €/MJ) were when all kinds of biomass were available, and the highest (5.47 €/MJ) was when only stacked wood was available. As energy demand increased, unit costs increased, and the ability to meet this demand with just one type of biomass decreased. The energy biomass sector can utilize the model to benefit both biomass producers and their final buyers.</jats:p>"

We establish equilibrium existence and uniqueness, provide characterization results, and present a number of comparative statics that show how supply chains and aggregate output respond to shocks. We also show that equilibrium supply chains are inefficient and exhibit an inherent fragility: small shocks can lead to discontinuous changes in output, even though the efficient allocation is always continuous in the same shocks. We explore several macroeconomic implications of this fragility.</jats:p>",

Green Supply Chain is a term that has it’s importance in the entire supply chain starting from the designing of the product to raw material procurement to manufacturing of the product to distribution and until the end-of-life of the product. It’s main aim is to minimize the negative impact of the supply chain activities and also to maximize the efficiency of resources along with reduction of the waste generation. There are a number of challenges in implementing green practices in the organization, which include the need for cooperation, collaboration and coordination among the partners of supply chain and also the need to identify the cost-effective green practices and technologies. There are a number of strategies which have been proposed to address the challenges faced. These include packaging which is eco-friendly, the concept of reverse logistics etc. The organizations which adopt the green supply chain practices in their organizations, gain various types of benefits from it. These benefits include savings in the costs as there is reduction in the consumption and also waste generation. The brand image of the organization is enhanced by the adoption of green practices and there is increase in the customer loyalty etc. Companieswhich use green supply chain management in their supply chain include Johnson and Johnson, Ford, Adidas, Nestle, Coca-Cola, Tesla etc. The adoption of green supply chain management (GSCM) faces multiple challenges including financial barriers, lack of awareness and supplier engagement, and regulatory complexity, while cultural resistance and technological limitations also impede its implementation.

By integrating a spatially explicit hydrological model with a farmer’s behavioral module, simulated using Risks-Attitudes-Norms-Abilities-Self-regulation (RANAS) behavioral theory based on household surveys and rules derived from observed data, this paper emulates the phenomenon of supply-demand feedback. The Kamadhiya catchment in India is studied, where the decisions of 38,447 farmers in response to the intensive development of check dams (CDs) are simulated. The results show that the perceived increase in water supply from CDs has led nearby farmers to increase their cotton and wheat cultivation areas by 11.9% and 36.1%, respectively. This increase in demand has nullified the expected benefits from CD recharge with approximately 54.0% of the additional recharge being used for expanding irrigation for cotton and wheat, and lowering groundwater levels by 1.0 m. These findings underscore the need to critically understand human-water feedbacks that lead to unintended consequences and inform future investments in agricultural water interventions.</p>"

Our findings suggest that about one in three handpumps in Cameroon is nonfunctional, which in 2022 was roughly equivalent to 6,724 inoperative water points. According to this estimate, it is about 44.8 billion CFA francs, or 66.8 million USD, was invested in the construction of water points that are immobilized and do not generate any benefit. The review has found that the community-based management of handpump water supply seems not to have given the expected results. Further, there are questions in relation to the quality of handpump material and the corrosion of handpumps which have not been sufficiently taken into account in the various research projects in Cameroon and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Yet researchers remain divided as to the drivers of this trend, especially as it relates to its international origins. Some scholars have portrayed China as a foreign supply-side driver of the technologies and the practice of digital authoritarianism in Africa. However, others argue that such origins are overstated, contending that little evidence exists for a direct role of China in Africa’s increasing turn towards digital authoritarianism. In this paper, I use a norm diffusion and order project approach to propose and test an innovative theory of China’s strategic supply of its model of digital authoritarianism to Africa. China, I argue, supplies such technologies and expertise to Africa to shape international norms in a manner that favors its geopolitical goals. Consequently, I hypothesize that the more likely an African country is a regional norm diffuser, the more likely it will be that China supplies it with its model of digital authoritarianism. To test this theory, I conduct a statistical panel analysis of African countries for the years 2000–2020. My results confirm my hypothesis and present novel findings that have implications for technology governance, African politics, China’s rise, and China’s strategic contestation of international norms.</jats:p>",

In supply chain, there are a lot of members and enormous data. Therefore, a suitable scheduling scheme has become the most common and effective method to optimize the execution of big data in supply chain. A scheduling problem with production and delivery consideration, which is usually in supply chain has been considered. For the reason of highly time emergency and random coming orders in quick production and delivery system, the effective algorithms for order acceptance scheduling problem are required. This paper addressed the production and delivery problem which has one manufacturer and multiple customers. There is single machine for order production at the manufacturer. For the consideration of order acceptance or not, the manufacturer need to choose order set to be accepted for processing. The paper aims at finding a balance between orders profit, delivery cost and time-based cost to maximize the total revenue. We consider three main objective functions in scheduling theory, analyze the problem complexity. The complexity of two of the problems are weakly NP hard, and the other one is strongly NP hard. For three weakly NP hard problems, we give pseudo-polynomial time optimal algorithms.</jats:p>"

The simplicity of the design and high reliability of inductor generators create good prospects for their use in wind power plants as an alternative to synchronous and asynchronous electric machines that are currently in use. An obstacle to such an application is the specifics of the design, construction, and execution of modular machines with magnetic switching, concentrated windings, and a distributed magnetic system integrated into the wind turbine design. The purpose of the study is to consider cause-effect relationships and establish relationships between magnetic flux, EMF, the geometry of electric and magnetic circuits, the structural arrangement of electric windings, and circuit solutions of an automatic electromagnetic excitation system for the design of a new type of generators.  \nThe current issues of the effective use of an exciting magnetic flux for voltage regulation in power supply systems powered by power plants, the main generators of which contain a distributed magnetic system with concentrated electric windings, are considered. The optimal structural compositions and geometry of the ratios of electric and magnetic circuits are determined from the machine's basic calculation equation, which is obtained under the condition of maximum magnetic flux. The reasons for the induction of variable EMF in the DC excitation windings, which prevent the effective magnetization of the machine, have been established. The location of the electric windings is proposed, which makes it possible to weaken or completely compensate for the pulsations of the magnetic flux coupled with the exciting circuits. It is established that in order to eliminate parasitic EMF in the exciting windings, it is necessary to use two-circuit circuits for alternating switching of the magnetic flux in the circuits, with sequential activation of the sections of the windings of the exciting circuits. To completely eliminate these EMFs, performing two-circuit magnetic flux switching circuits with a common exciting winding is advisable. The methods and features of the circuit implementation of the conditions of electromagnetic excitation and maintenance of voltage constancy at the output of generators of a new type are considered.</jats:p>",

The story of the mathematicians who first wrote about and popularized these concepts is then also presented. The chapter ends with a discussion of the motivations of these firms. It argues that, even though measures were commonly taken in both these industries to reduce risk, any businessman or woman who owned a firm in these very risky businesses could hardly ever be regarded as being adverse to risk.</jats:p>",

The study highlights various types of interruptions that disrupt energy supply continuity within electricity distribution networks and elucidates their impacts on the network infrastructure. The establishment of alternative energy sources and the enhancement of the network infrastructure through coupling are recommended to mitigate the consequences of these interruptions. Investments in alternative energy sources and network improvements are compared to penalty amounts incurred when the quality parameters for energy supply continuity cannot be met. The F13/F14 Ring Network, a proposed coupling approach that can improve energy supply, is identified and its installation costs are compared with the existing conditions. Additionally, the magnitude of fines that distribution companies may potentially face is estimated. As a result, a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is conducted, integrating these comparisons to evaluate the economic sustainability and advantages associated with the proposed F13/F14 Ring Network coupling method.</jats:p>"

Traditional optimization methods often struggle to effectively use resources while handling complex and dynamic Supply chain networks. This paper introduces a novel biomimetic metaheuristic algorithm called the Wombat Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for supply chain optimization. This algorithm replicates the natural behaviors observed in wombats living in the wild, particularly focusing on their foraging tactics and evasive maneuvers towards predators. The theory of WOA is described and then mathematically modeled in two phases: (i) exploration based on the simulation of wombat movements during foraging and trying to find food and (ii) exploitation based on simulating wombat movements when diving towards nearby tunnels to defend against its predators. The effectiveness of WOA in addressing optimization challenges is assessed by handling the CEC 2017 test suite across various problem dimensions, including 10, 30, 50, and 100. The findings of the optimization indicate that WOA demonstrates a strong ability to effectively manage exploration and exploitation, and maintains a balance between them throughout the search phase to deliver optimal solutions for optimization problems. A total of twelve well-known metaheuristic algorithms are called upon to test their performance against WOA in the optimization process. The outcomes of the simulations reveal that WOA outperforms the other algorithms, achieving superior results across most benchmark functions and securing the top ranking as the most efficient optimizer. Using a Wilcoxon rank sum test statistical analysis, it has been proven that WOA outperforms other algorithms significantly. WOA is put to the test with twenty-two constrained optimization problems from the CEC 2011 test suite and four engineering design problems to showcase its ability to solve real-world optimization problems. The results of the simulations demonstrate that WOA excels in real-world applications by delivering superior solutions and outperforming its competitors.</jats:p>"

This study explores water and energy network provisioning to promote an integrated approach to planning and managing service delivery in Harare, Zimbabwe. The paper also establishes how water and energy provisioning challenges have affected household activities. The study embraced a sequential mixed-methods approach. In-depth interviews were used to solicit information from relevant departments and focus group discussions from communities. A total of 314 questionnaires were administered to five communities based on five settlement classifications. The study hinges on the ‘collective action theory'. Findings revealed poor governance issues, lack of finance and public participation in water-energy service delivery.

The learning from previous crises such as COVID-19 indicates that proactive strategies need to span numerous levels both within and external to food networks, requiring both vertical and horizontal collaborations. However, there is a lack of systematic performance management techniques for ripple effects in food supply chains that would enable the prediction of failure modes. Supervised learning algorithms are commonly used for prediction (classification) problems, but machine learning struggles with large data sets and complex phenomena. Consequently, this research proposes a manual approach to feature extraction for artificial intelligence with the aim of reducing dimensionality for more efficient algorithm performance, and improved interpretability/explainability for benefits in terms of ethics and managerial decision-making. The approach is based on qualitative comparative analysis informed by in-depth case knowledge which is refined through Boolean logic, yielding solutions that reflect complex causality as opposed to single failure point modes. Two case exemplars are presented to support the proposed framework for implementation: export readiness of dairy supply chains under the Russia-Ukraine war, and egg supply chain sustainability during COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom.</jats:p>"

Moreover, previous studies have mostly adopted an internal, operational perspective. By contrast, we provide healthcare professionals with guidance on how to maximize patient perceptions. Anchoring on signaling theory and construal level theory of psychological distance, we examine whether and how the disclosed information in a healthcare context influences patients' perceptions with two vignette‐based studies. In contrast with literature on SC transparency, we do not find a main effect of SC disclosures in healthcare. Instead, the effects depend on the content disclosed. We find that spatial and temporal distances of the healthcare SC significantly influence patients' perceptions. Furthermore, a three‐way interaction shows that by strategically disclosing manufacturing and distribution information, especially when these occur close to the patient's home country, and incorporating service recovery actions, such as closer follow‐ups, professionals can maximize patient perception outcomes.</jats:p>"

Adoption attempts are further hampered by technology limitations including cybersecurity threats and interoperability problems.\nPolicymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers must work together to develop collaborative solutions in order to overcome these obstacles and enable widespread adoption. Streamlining regulations, establishing standards, investing in infrastructure, promoting open standards, offering financial incentives, interacting with the community, and attending to social and ethical issues are a few of these. \nBy putting these tactics into practice, the transportation and logistics industry can realize the full potential of mobility solutions and spur expansion, sustainability, and competitiveness. Stakeholders can overcome obstacles, seize opportunities, and clear the path for a transportation ecosystem that is more effective, robust, and inclusive by embracing innovation and teamwork.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this article explores the application and compatibility of blockchain in supply chain finance by building a supply chain financial information sharing system based on blockchain. By analyzing typical scenarios and business processes, it is proven that this system can effectively improve the efficiency of supply chain financial operations, reduce transaction costs, and enhance overall trust. The results not only provide a new technical path for the practice of supply chain finance, but also provide a theoretical reference for the construction of the supply chain finance system under the new development pattern.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The policy objectives of affordable housing programs in China are two-fold: on the one hand, they are designed to assist low- and moderate-income families and reduce inequality; on the other hand, they are intended to lower commodity housing prices. However, the effects of affordable housing land on housing prices, particularly the between-city variation and the mechanisms behind the market effects, have not been sufficiently examined, making it difficult to evaluate the housing policy and improve it accordingly. In this study, we address these gaps by using a prefecture-level panel dataset covering 2009–2020, obtained from national land and housing transaction information platforms. We use a threshold model to investigate the threshold effect of population size and a mediating model to uncover the channels through which the supply of affordable housing land affects housing prices. The results confirm that the affordable housing land supply can have a beneficial influence in terms of slowing down the increase in housing prices. The population size plays a significant role in explaining the between-city market effect variations. In cities with a population greater than 10.78 million, increasing the supply of affordable housing land would cause the housing prices to increase. Meanwhile, in cities with smaller populations, increasing the supply of affordable housing land could lower the housing prices. The underlying mechanisms of the market effects vary across cities with different population sizes. Although affordable housing land crowds out commodity housing land in all cities, housing demand diversion only exists in cities with a smaller population. At present, China is experimenting with city-specific housing policies; our findings imply that decision makers should explore additional policy options, besides building on incremental construction land, in order to make housing more affordable in supercities in China.</jats:p>"

Trading and logistics are strategic decisions and are integral to most commodities including grain shipping by rail, in addition to other modes (barges, ocean shipping). There are substantial risks, such as the ordering and placement of rail cars. The other risk is having sufficient grain stocks to load rail cars. Alternatives for managing these risks include holding grain inventories and the strategic use of shipping options. The purpose of this study is to develop a model for determining an optimal grain inventory strategy for shippers. The real option methodology is used to value uncertainty in rail car velocity and determine optimal purchases and inventories. The results show the importance of integrating trading and logistics decisions and illustrate that inventories can be interpreted and valued as real options that are affected by uncertainties. Taken together, the real options indicate how much extra inventory shippers should maintain to mitigate risks and maximize profits.</jats:p>"

By comparing markets for COVID-relevant and other specialties, we show that the market for travel nurses expands dramatically and estimate travel nurse labor supply across space. Supply is quite elastic, as workers can choose to travel where they are needed. Workers travel longer distances to temporary jobs when payment increases, suggesting that an integrated national market facilitates reallocation when demand spikes. But when national cases peak, travel distance is less responsive to local demand.</jats:p>"

Beyond primary extraction, the existing concentration of production and refining within a small number of countries will also create new challenges for supply chain security. Three significant insights emerge: more global transparency and accountability are needed to safeguard environmentally and socially responsible mining as the industry grows; large-scale recycling of minerals and metals is needed to lessen the demand for primary mineral extraction; rapid technological innovation, including the development of new batteries, is needed to shift demand towards less expensive, less scarce and potentially less harmful materials.  Governments can play an important role in addressing negative externalities associated with increased mining, while ensuring that future economic benefits from mineral resources are used to support broader societal goals, including reconciliation with Indigenous communities—at home and abroad.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Drinking water is essential to public health and socioeconomic growth. Therefore, assessing and ensuring drinking water supply is a critical task in modern society. Conventional approaches to analyzing and controlling drinking water quality are labor-intensive and costly with a low throughput. Machine learning (ML) is an alternative, promising technique to assess and ensuring safe drinking water supply. Existing reviews have summarized the applications of ML in safe drinking water supply from different aspects. However, a state-of-the-art, comprehensive review is missing that focuses on applying ML to monitor, simulate, predict, and control drinking water quality, especially in municipal engineered water systems. This review, therefore, critically compiles the applications of ML in assessing and ensuring water quality in engineered water systems. To be comprehensive, we also cover the applications of ML in other drinking-water-related settings such as water sources and water purification processes. We explain the basic mechanics and workflows of ML, focusing on the applications of ML to access and control key factors or etiologies in drinking water from the physical, chemical, and microbiological aspects.

Given the rapid development of the prefabricated food industry in China, studying relevant issues in the prefabricated food supply chain is of great significance. This article conducts a literature review by searching for keywords such as prefabricated foods, supply chain pricing, and blockchain technology, analyzing trends, and summarizing findings. It is found that research on prefabricated foods, both domestically and internationally, mainly covers aspects such as raw material processing, product quality, microbial contamination prevention and control, and nutritional value assessment. Regarding pricing decisions in food supply chains, the literature discusses the impact of food loss, inventory strategies, market demand, and pricing on profits. Additionally, researchers have explored the application of blockchain technology in food supply chains, including the influence of conditions and parameters on pricing decisions. Although existing research provides important insights into prefabricated food supply chain management, there are still some limitations. Future research directions include sustainability and environmental factors, emerging markets and international trade, and the application of digital and intelligent technologies. These studies will provide theoretical guidance and practical recommendations for the sustainable development and innovation of prefabricated food supply chains, supporting the establishment of efficient shared cooperative relationships.</jats:p>"

This helps in deducing means for supply managers to control ethical sourcing, supplier codes of conduct, and social audits and resultant performance improvements across interconnected supply chain entities due to followership of acceptable socially conscious activities. Henceforth, the analysis provides a valid view that integrative csr priorities propagate positive transformations. The transformation refers to improved vendor relationships, logistics, and distribution networks. Those are achieved through enhancing climate resilience, reducing risks, and enabling cost efficiencies. The csr actions, however, need to be structured by mechanisms around supplier capability building, compliance enforcement, and monitoring systems, which are uncovered as vital framing elements allowing csr commitments.

To achieve this goal, hydrometeorological data from these basins were analyzed using the Pettitt and Mann–Kendall tests. Our results show that negative rupture was observed in the hydrometeorological time series of these basins at the annual time step in 1970–1971. The deficits associated with this rupture are estimated at −7% for rainfall and −28% for river flows. The wet season shows similar developments. However, from the 1990s onward, there has been a significant increase in the mean annual flows of the Benoue River, which coincides with that of the rainfall during the same decade. This increase over the recent decades could also be expected in response to an increase in impervious surface area in the catchment area, which could compensate for the deficit generated by the post-1990s rainfall deficit through an increase in runoff. Since the filling of the Lagdo Dam in 1983, an increase in all ranges of minimum flow, as well as an increase in the variability of extreme flows, has been detected.</jats:p>",

Three Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms were implemented and tested in order to evaluate their ability to actively manage inventories and improve the performance of supply chains. The results of the experimental phase offered important information regarding the performance of each Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm. The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm was identified as a viable choice, offering the best results in terms of accuracy to set the optimal inventories for the supply chain and improving the efficiency of the supply chain. The percentage of cost efficiency improved from 92.5% to 95.8% in the case of the DDPG model. The inventory turnover was also improved, surpassing the level of 8.1 units from the original level of 7.3 units which means that the system converts the inventor into sales in less time. The metric for on-time delivery also beneficiated from several improvements, reaching 96.5% form the level of 93.2% return. The quality metrics also registered a significant improvement and reported level of 96.2% after the implementation of the DDPG algorithm and compared to the level of 94.6% prior to the implementation of the algorithm. These results suggest that using such a system will bring beneficial changes to the supply chain and will offer the possibility of implementing a data-driven inventory system based on Deep Reinforcement Learning.</jats:p>"

The authors found a growing trend in the number of publications and citations over the years. This paper serves as an important reference to researchers by highlighting important research areas, such as multi-objective optimization, metaheuristics, sustainability issues in logistics, and machine learning integration. This bibliometric analysis also underlines the importance of Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), sustainability, machine learning, and variable neighborhood search in the application of a genetic algorithm in logistics and supply chains in the near future. The integration of a genetic algorithm with machine learning is also a potential research gap to be filled to overcome the limitations of genetic algorithms, such as the long computational time, difficulties in obtaining optimal solutions, and convergence issues for application in logistics and supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the capacity to increase security and transparency, blockchain technology is being used as an interesting subject of investigation in the fashion industry. This underscores the importance of this current research endeavour. In terms of supply chain transparency, the fashion industry faces considerable barriers, thus requiring new approaches such as blockchain that can address issues such as child labour, unethical payment practices, and environmental impact. Main objective of this research is to identify how blockchain technology can improve transparency, accountability, and compliance with ethical standards. However, knowledge of the specific ways in which blockchain technology can improve transparency in the fashion supply chain, including the drivers and barriers, needs to be improved. The research method is described through a qualitative approach that includes in-depth interviews, participatory observation, and document analysis to collect data from various stakeholders in the industry, including manufacturers, distributors, and consumers. Explanation provides an overview of how the researcher collected and analysed data to achieve the research objectives. Blockchain increases transparency through the provision of verifiable and durable product records and fosters consumer-brand trust. Blockchain facilitates accountability and compliance with environmental and ethical standards, according to key findings. Research detected significant barriers, including exorbitant costs for implementation, limited knowledge of technology, and difficulties in fostering collaboration among relevant parties. Results of this study have far-reaching consequences, providing valuable insights to fashion industry stakeholders on how to overcome barriers to blockchain adoption. Long-term benefits of enhanced supply chain transparency and strategic recommendations ensure a smooth implementation process.</jats:p>"

Over the past three decades, the growth of the RMG sector has attracted economically disadvantaged rural women, distancing them from their traditional domestic and agricultural roles. This sector predominantly employs young women due to their perceived flexibility, low wages, and limited union involvement. Additionally, their status as “unskilled” workers in the lowest echelons of a gender‐stratified labour market, along with the influence of socio‐cultural power dynamics, constrains their capacity to negotiate their positions effectively. Drawing on in‐depth ethnographic research conducted in Dhaka and Gazipur, this article unravels the intricate interplay between insecure labour conditions, the impact of the global supply chain, and gender dynamics. It underscores the pivotal significance of socio‐cultural power dynamics in understanding the vulnerability experienced by female migrant labourers. We assert that a comprehensive understanding of precarious work requires recognising the inherent link between precarious employment and precarious life within the broader context of socio‐cultural power dynamics, gender norms, and societal relations.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, the duration of supply chain relationships is longer when the firm and its supply chain partner are both headquartered in high social capital states, and when the partner invests in relationship‐specific assets. Collectively, the evidence suggests that social norms reflecting trustworthiness facilitate investment and stability along supply chains.</jats:p>",

However, when these changes are related to shifts from exploitative to explorative focuses, companies face an inflexibility problem because of involved uncertainties, creating a barrier to obtaining SC-Ad. This research proposes to overcome this barrier by integrating new combinations of the product/market strategy and SC processes and securing their fit over time. To get it, this study proposes two SC-Ad drivers (related to the SC process (ASCOS) and new product development competences (PDC)), which secure the aforementioned fit by reducing its uncertainties and thus ensuring a SC-Ad that responds to emerging competitive changes. Measurement and structural models were assessed following PLS-SEM. ASCOS and PDC’ relative importance was analyzed using the importance/performance/analysis procedure. PLS, PLS-predict, and CVPAT were used to analyze model’s in-sample and out-of-sample predictive capacity. ANOVA was used to compare SC-Ad, ASCOS and PDC in different plant groups. Results suggest that ASCOS and PDC are SC-Ad’s drivers, and that the plants with highest SC-Ad values are those with the higher ASCOS and PDC’ values. This expand knowledge about SC-Ad drivers, which represents an important literature gap. In an indirect way, some new light is also added to the topic of ambidextrous management. The adequate generalizability of these results is supported by a) a wide multi-country, multi-informant, and multi-sector sample of 268 plants, b) a good out-of-sample model predictive capacity c) no heterogeneity issues.</jats:p>"

Utilizing automatic identification system (AIS) data to analyze ship navigation patterns, the study applies Optuna to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the BILSTM network to improve prediction accuracy and efficiency. The developed Optuna–BILSTM model shows a remarkable 7% increase in prediction accuracy over traditional back propagation (BP) neural networks and standard BILSTM models.

In the era of globalization, supply chains face increased complexities and risks, particularly in cross-border logistics. Challenges include transportation uncertainties, delays due to long-distance transport, infrastructure disparities, and transparency issues. Integrating big data analytics offers a solution to these challenges by enabling predictive analytics for demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and risk management. This study highlights the role of big data in enhancing supply chain transparency, reducing uncertainties, and improving decision-making processes. Examples from JD E-commerce and NongFu Spring demonstrate the practical application of big data in optimizing inventory management and mitigating risks. JD E-commerce employs artificial intelligence and big data analytics for inventory management, leading to reduced turnover days and cost efficiency. NongFu Spring, on the other hand, uses big data for scenario marketing and supply chain optimization. The paper concludes that big data technology not only revolutionizes inventory management but also plays a crucial role in addressing risks in the supply chain, thus leading to more efficient, transparent, and resilient supply chains in the face of globalization challenges.</jats:p>"

This reservoir is situated in the Seli River, located in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone. The research period includes 138 months, covering the duration from October 2010 to April 2022. The Tasmanian Devil Optimization Algorithm, which is bio-inspired algorithm, has been shown to be an effective optimization technique in multiple scholarly researches. The decision variables in the hydroelectric energy optimization model from the reservoir are the optimal release values of the monthly hydroelectric output from the reservoirs of the dams. After verifying the correctness of the ATDOA algorithm by using several standard benchmark functions, a model was developed for optimal hydroelectric utilization of the Bumbuna Dam.</jats:p>",

These options were alternative mechanisms for imposing minimum water efficiency standards on the fixtures and appliances within buildings. The study demonstrates how both residential and non-residential sub-sectors can be modelled, using demographic and industry forecasts and other available data sources, using an end-use/stock modelling approach. Specifically, the study modelled the expected water, energy and GHG savings from potential minimum water efficiency standards for plumbing products and appliances in homes and business in Australia. It discusses the relative merits of mechanisms for implementing the proposed minimum standards via: a sustainable building planning measure – such as the Building Sustainability Index (BASIX) in New South Wales; the Australian Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards (WELS) scheme; or via plumbing regulations within the National Construction Code (NCC). The paper concludes that as well as being a useful mechanism for imposing minimum standards in itself, a star-rating system such as WELS offers advantages in developing and modelling water efficiency policy options. The approach described can support decision-making on policies that improve water efficiency across building types.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The loss of vegetables is immense which is accrued to its perishability and sub optimal level of post-harvest management. There is a technological gap in adoption of harvesting and post-harvesting practices by farmers. There is sparse qualitative and quantitative assessment of post-harvest losses of vegetables in Punjab. The objective of the study is to identify the operation and channel where the losses are crossing the threshold, to estimate the extent of losses and characterize them at various post-harvest operations and levels for selected vegetables in Punjab and to analyse the factors responsible for post-harvest losses. Methods: The sample in survey location consisted of all the stakeholders of supply chain network for vegetables in the state of Punjab, India. The stakeholders consisted of farmers, wholesalers and retailers. The study adopted cluster sampling technique. The clusters selected for the study were Nakodar, Malerkotla and Baba Bakala Sahib and the vegetables selected for the study were potato, pea, tomato, okra and cauliflower. Further snowball sampling technique was used to select 80 farmers from each cluster, making up a total sample of 240 farmers and one reference each for wholesaler and retailer was identified in every cluster. Then using snowball technique, 2 wholesalers and 10 retailers were selected from each cluster. Thus, making total sample of 10 wholesalers and 30 retailers were selected for the study. The instrument used for the data collection was a structured interview schedule. The one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference test were employed to understand the significant difference in post-harvest losses between the selected vegetables and along the supply chain. Result: The results revealed that the maximum losses were observed in tomato crop at farm level (17.71%) and retailer level (30.10%) whereas at wholesaler level maximum losses were recorded in pea (8.19%). The extent of losses at farm level has been higher as compared to wholesaler level and it was highest at the retailer level. At farmer’s level it was observed that there have been significantly higher losses in tomato crop (17.7±13.35). At retailer level, significantly higher losses were observed in tomato (30.10±15.80) whereas at wholesaler level, significantly higher losses occurred in pea (12.29±3.15). There was no significant difference in losses between farmer and retailer level. Major cause of loss reported by tomato growers (88.6%) was infestation of fruits with disease and insect. Main reason of post-harvest losses in okra and cauliflower as stated by farmers were bruises/blackening and over maturity. Since the findings reveal that the major losses in the supply chain of vegetables was due to lack adoption of harvest and post-harvest practices at farmer’s level. It is suggested that field level training should be imparted to farmers regarding post-harvest management techniques.\n</jats:p>"

This review pertaining to blockchain technology adoption by supply chain stakeholders is significant as it is a pre-requisite for the technical sustainability of blockchain technology in supply chains. Through a critical literature review, the previous studies related to technology adoption models were analyzed to explore practices brought about by blockchain applications for supply chain management. This study examined the suitability of the existing models (e.g., the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, task technology fit (TTF), unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)) of technology adoption for blockchain applications in supply chains and came up with a new unified model, namely, TOE-TTF-UTAUT. This review provides implications for a more appropriate research design using mixed methods. When adopting the TOE-TTF-UTAUT model in a study, two phases of research using mixed methods can be performed. The first phase is an exploratory sequential design in which a qualitative approach to explore the TOE and supply chain task constructs is followed by a quantitative approach using a survey and quantitative analyses to investigate the factors affecting blockchain adoption in supply chains. The second phase adopts explanatory sequential design in which the quantitative findings from the first phase are reviewed for follow-up by qualitative interviews to obtain explanations.</jats:p>"

This form best allows local self-government bodies to conduct their tasks and obligations in the drinking water supply.\nThe study revealed the main features of the water supply service. We established that the service has great social significance and that its main task is not to make a profit but to provide consumers with quality drinking water in sufficient quantity and at an acceptable cost level.\nDespite its significant social value, the drinking water supply services are subject to value-added tax at the usual rate of 20%. The study found that the drinking water supply services generate significant added value, which results in service providers paying substantial amounts of value-added tax to the state budget. We concluded that such a situation does not correspond with the spirit of providing the population with drinking water and is unacceptable for a heavily subsidised service with many chronic problems, including high levels of deterioration of water supply infrastructure and low coverage of rural areas with centralised water supply.\nFurther, we carried out an analysis of the legislation of the European Union regarding the taxation of water supply services with value-added tax. We determined that most countries of the European Union use the practice of applying a reduced value-added tax rate for the taxation of water supply services.\nThe obtained results justify the further necessity to study the issue of making changes to the tax legislation of Ukraine to apply a reduced value-added tax rate or complete exemption from taxation of the value-added tax for centralised drinking water supply services.\nKeywords: value-added tax, drinking water supply, utility company, tariff, cost price, reduced rate.</jats:p>",

Blockchain has been widely employed to enable fair and secure transactions between farmers and buyers, but concerns related to transparency and traceability in the seed supply chain, counterfeit seeds, middlemen involvement, and inefficient processes in the agricultural ecosystem have not received enough attention. To address these concerns, a blockchain-based solution is proposed that brings breeders, farmers, warehouse owners, transporters, and food corporations to a single platform to enhance transparency, traceability, and trust among trust-less parties. A smart contract updates the status of seeds from a breeder from submitted to approved. Then, a non-fungible token (NFT) corresponding to approved seeds is minted for the breeder, which records the date of cultivation and its owner (breeder). The NFT enables farmers to keep track of seeds right from the date of their cultivation and their owner, which helps them to make better decisions about picking seeds from the correct owner. Farmers directly interact with warehouses to purchase seeds, which removes the need for middlemen and improves the trust among trust-less entities. Furthermore, a tender for the transportation of seeds is auctioned on the basis of the priority location locp, Score, and bid_amount of every transporter, which provides a fair chance to every transporter to restrict the monopoly of a single transporter. The proposed system achieves immutability, decentralization, and efficiency inherently from the blockchain. We implemented the proposed scheme and deployed it on the Ethereum network. Smart contracts deployed over the Ethereum network interact with React-based web pages. The analysis and results of the proposed model indicate that it is viable and secure, as well as superior to the current seed supply chain system.</jats:p>"

Without them, it becomes difficult to maintain customer value and to serve with a competitive advantage. Supply chain disruptions are always expected to occur due to the demand for certain products either decreasing or increasing. In recent years, we have experienced a mass supply chain disruption that has affected businesses worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic took the economy by storm and has changed the way business owners view the marketplace. Market uncertainty was at an all-time high, leading business owners to reassess their operations. Both consumer and supplier behaviors were changing the way these markets were fluctuating. The intensity of consumer purchasing behaviors was beginning to shift the demand curve. Localization of supply became a more seemingly popular way to counteract product shortages. The creation of new technologies will also help industries to be more prepared and manufacture products more efficiently. Furthermore, supply chains can be unpredictable, and there are many ways in which the marketplace can be ready for those moments of uncertainty. The past few years have really opened a new lens and given businesses a new point of view on what can be expected. As for now, preparing for the future is a great place to start and will help us continue a path to a successful economy. Thus, the goal of this research is to identify and explore different businesses tactics and procedures to help explore the effects of the supply chain disruptions on the public.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable supply chain financing has emerged as a pivotal strategy in contemporary business paradigms, aiming to harmonize economic growth with environmental stewardship and social responsibility. This review delves into the integration of banking mechanisms within sustainable supply chain financing models to foster enhanced sustainability across diverse industries. In recent years, the concept of sustainability has gained momentum, prompting organizations to reevaluate their operational frameworks to mitigate environmental impacts and address societal concerns. Supply chain financing, a financial tool facilitating transactions among interconnected entities within the supply chain, plays a crucial role in advancing sustainability objectives. By integrating banking institutions into these models, businesses can leverage financial expertise, resources, and networks to bolster sustainable practices throughout the supply chain. This review explores various dimensions of sustainable supply chain financing models, highlighting the significance of banking integration. Firstly, it elucidates the evolving landscape of sustainability in supply chains, emphasizing the imperative for concerted efforts to reconcile profitability with environmental preservation and social welfare. Secondly, it examines the multifaceted benefits of integrating banking institutions into supply chain financing mechanisms, including access to capital, risk mitigation, and expertise in sustainable finance. Moreover, the review discusses the emergence of innovative financial instruments such as green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and supply chain finance programs tailored to promote sustainability goals. These instruments not only provide financial incentives for sustainable initiatives but also foster transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain ecosystem. Furthermore, the review addresses challenges and opportunities associated with integrating banking into sustainable supply chain financing, including regulatory complexities, technological advancements, and stakeholder collaboration. It underscores the need for strategic partnerships between businesses, financial institutions, and regulatory bodies to navigate these challenges effectively and realize the full potential of sustainable supply chain financing. The integration of banking institutions into sustainable supply chain financing models presents a promising avenue for advancing sustainability agendas across industries. By harnessing financial innovation and collaboration, organizations can foster resilience, efficiency, and ethical conduct within their supply chains, contributing to a more sustainable and inclusive global economy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim. Give a comparative characteristic of the course of infectious diarrhea in young children, residents of the Zaporizhzhia region (Ukraine), depending on their provision of zinc (Zn).\nMaterials and methods. The study included 99 children aged 1 to 36 months with manifestations of infectious diarrhea. On the day of hospitalization, immunochromatographic and bacteriological examination of feces was performed. Also, on the first, third and fifth days of hospitalization, a general blood test and the level of Zn in the blood were determined for each patient.\nResults. It was found that among the examined patients with infectious diarrhea at the onset of the disease, 22 children (22.2 %) had a reduced concentration of Zn in blood serum. In these children, the zinc level ranged from 7.63 to 9.17 μmol/l. It was also noted that the level of Zn in these patients on the 5th day of inpatient treatment rose to the norm of reference indicators. After studying the anamnesis, it was found that 40.9% of children with low Zn content had episodes of acute intestinal infection before this disease. During a comparative analysis of the clinical and laboratory data of patients, it was found that the tendency to more frequent vomiting occurred in patients with Zn deficiency (p = 0.05), that Zn availability had the most significant effect on the expressiveness of the diarrheal syndrome at the onset of the disease and more than a third (n = 8, 36.4 %) of children with Zn deficiency had more than 5 episodes of diarrhea per day, among which every second had more than 10. We did not determine significant differences between the frequency of viral and bacterial causes of diarrhea in the comparison groups. As for complete blood count, patients with Zn deficiency more often had a tendency to blood neutrophilia with a reliably frequent shift of the leukocyte formula to the left (p = 0.003). At the same time, children with a reduced content of Zn in blood serum significantly more often had lymphopenia at the onset of diarrheal disease (p = 0.006). When investigating the effect of Zn deficiency on the course of the disease, we found that in children with reduced Zn, the duration of diarrhea was almost twice as long (8 [6; 9] days vs. 5 [4; 6] in children with normal Zn indicators; p = 0.0001 according to the Mann–Whitney test) and in patients with infectious diarrhea who had Zn deficiency at the onset of the disease, on the seventh day of treatment diarrhea persisted significantly more often (p = 0.03). Such symptoms were accompanied by the persistence of signs of anemia (p = 0.06 on the 5th day) and a shift of the leukocyte formula to the left (p = 0.007) without leukocytosis.\nConclusions. Almost 25 % of young children with infectious diarrhea in the Zaporizhzhia region had Zn deficiency. Most likely, Zn deficiency is caused by the peculiarities of its supply with food and its metabolism. In the debut of a diarrheal disease, insufficient supply of Zn is associated with lymphopenia and a shift of the leukocyte formula to the left. Zn deficiency in infectious diarrhea leads to a long (more than 5 days) course of the disease due to prolongation of the diarrheal syndrome.</jats:p>"

The analyses demonstrate that if the retailers have access to external credits, they will borrow more (less), buy more (less), and incur a higher (lower) default probability under a parallel structure than under a distribution structure if the retailers sell substitutes (complements). The retailers' leverage improves the profit of their upstream suppliers and of the channel but improves their own profits only if they sell complements. If they sell substitutes, borrowing makes them worse off, leading to the prisoner's dilemma phenomenon. If only one retailer has access to external credit, then it will enjoy a leadership premium (loss) if the retailers sell substitutes (complements), and this effect trickles up to the upstream supplier of the leveraged retailer under the parallel structure. Thus, the dedicated suppliers will abet the leveraged retailers to compete more aggressively than unleveraged ones. However, the common supplier is independent of their downstream customer's capital structure. These results reveal that the impacts of external credit on the supply chain profitability depend on the stages the supply chain members are in, the degree of product differentiation, the supply chain structure, the uncertainty of demand, and whether the competitor also has access to external credits.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Biosecurity in agriculture is essential for preventing the introduction and spread of plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) which threaten global food security by reducing crop yields and facilitating disease spread. These risks are exacerbated by increased global trade and climate change, which may alter PPN distribution and activity, increasing their impact on agricultural systems. Addressing these challenges is vital to maintaining the integrity of the food supply chain. This review highlights significant advancements in managing PPN-related biosecurity risks within the food supply chain, particularly considering climate change’s evolving influence. It discusses the PPN modes of transmission, factors increasing the risk of infestation, the impact of PPNs on food safety and security, and traditional and emerging approaches for detecting and managing these pests. Literature suggests that implementing advanced biosecurity measures could decrease PPN infestation rates by up to 70%, substantially reducing crop yield losses and bolstering food security. Notably, the adoption of modern detection and management techniques, (molecular diagnostics and integrated pest management) and emerging geospatial surveillance and analysis systems (spectral imaging, change-detection analysis) has shown greater effectiveness than traditional methods. These innovations offer promising avenues for enhancing crop health and securing the food supply chain against environmental shifts. The integration of these strategies is crucial, demonstrating the potential to transform biosecurity practices and sustain agricultural productivity in the face of changing climatic conditions. This analysis emphasizes the importance of adopting advanced measures to protect crop health and ensure food supply chain resilience, providing valuable insights for stakeholders across the agricultural sector.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The opioid crisis has ravaged the United States, taking 69,000 lives in 2020, with prescription opioids accounting for 98% of opioid abuse. Although this epidemic is often considered a White public health crisis nationally, overdose deaths among people of color doubled from 2017 to 2019. As research has shown that the crisis was fueled by excessive supply from the pharmaceutical industry, several individual firms have received significant public criticism. However, we find evidence that the scope of the blame transcends individual actors to indict the very structure of complex supply chains, which may have exacerbated the crisis by dispensing significantly more opioids. In specific, we posit that supply chain complexity allowed mass quantities of opioids to escape detection by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Further, we find new evidence showing the greater impact of complexity on opioid dispensing in non-White communities, which underscores their exclusion from the public discourse and governmental response surrounding the crisis and suggests possible racial bias in the DEA’s regulatory policies. Our analysis was made possible by the 2019 release of the DEA’s Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System database, which logged every shipment in the US opioid supply chain from 2006 to 2014. Using a fixed effects model, we find that a one-unit increase across three dimensions of supply chain complexity is associated with a 16% increase in opioid dispensing. This effect is intensified in non-White communities, where a 10% increase in the non-White population is associated with a 3.39% (1.33%) increase in opioid dispensing by pharmacies that have supply chains with high (average) complexity. To verify that high-complexity pharmacies’ excess dispensing supplied non-medical/recreational demand, we exploit the reformulation of OxyContin (designed to prevent recreational use) as an exogenous shock to the market. In a novel approach, we leverage the fact that different pharmacies received their first shipment of reformulated OxyContin at different times and use a difference-in-differences model to estimate the heterogeneous effect of the shock on dispensing. As the reformulated OxyContin stifled demand, high-complexity pharmacies experienced a 15.31% greater reduction in dispensing compared to lower-complexity pharmacies, suggesting that their excess dispensing was indeed satisfying non-medical/recreational demand. </jats:p>"

Existing approaches to counter this issue often prove inadequate, necessitating an exploration of innovative alternatives. Beyond addressing the deficiencies of current solutions, our system contributes to secure and transparent trade practices. Our proposed system introduces dynamic product authentication checks conducted at regular intervals. This proactive feature serves as a direct response to the identified inadequacies in existing solutions, aiming to significantly diminish the infiltration of counterfeit goods into the supply chain. The pivotal innovation in our approach lies in its multifaceted nature. Dynamic product authentication checks not only bolster security but also ensure authenticity throughout the product lifecycle. By decentralizing control, we promote transparency in product transactions, aligning seamlessly with blockchain's core attributes of immutability and decentralization. This comprehensive strategy integrates with the decentralized blockchain system to fortify supply chain security, utilizing innovative verification methods. Scanned codes cross-reference with blockchain records, promptly informing consumers of a product's legitimacy or counterfeit status. This paper delineates a comprehensive solution to the challenges posed by counterfeit products in the e-commerce market, grounding its significance in the acknowledged shortcomings of current anti-counterfeit measures. By integrating dynamic product authentication checks with blockchain's inherent strengths, our system offers a practical, efficient, and innovative approach to safeguard product quality and authenticity in the global marketplace. The intersection provides a robust framework for securing e-commerce transactions, thereby bolstering consumer confidence in online trade practices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Integrated Banking-Supply Chain (IBSC) model represents a comprehensive framework designed to enhance the efficiency and resilience of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) supply chains in emerging markets. Emerging markets present unique challenges, including infrastructural limitations, economic volatility, and limited access to financing. The IBSC model addresses these challenges by integrating banking services with supply chain management practices, fostering collaboration among stakeholders and leveraging financial instruments to optimize operations. This paper explores the key components and benefits of the IBSC model within the context of FMCG industries operating in emerging markets. It highlights the significance of collaboration between banks, FMCG companies, suppliers, distributors, and other stakeholders to promote transparency, efficiency, and accountability throughout the supply chain. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of tailored financial services, such as trade finance, working capital loans, inventory financing, and supply chain financing, in meeting the unique needs of FMCG businesses in emerging markets. Trade finance plays a pivotal role in facilitating international trade transactions by providing financing for importing raw materials and exporting finished goods. Working capital loans assist FMCG companies in managing their day-to-day operational expenses, while inventory financing enables them to leverage existing inventory as collateral to secure financing and optimize cash flow. Supply chain financing mechanisms, such as factoring and invoice discounting, provide liquidity to suppliers and distributors along the supply chain, thereby enhancing overall efficiency and resilience. Overall, the IBSC model offers FMCG companies in emerging markets a strategic approach to overcome challenges related to supply chain management and financing. By integrating banking services with supply chain operations, the model enables FMCG businesses to optimize working capital, reduce financing costs, and improve cash flow management, ultimately enhancing their competitiveness and sustainability in rapidly evolving markets.&#x0D;\nKeywords:  Integrated Banking-Supply Chain Model, FMCG, Emerging Markets, Supply Chain Management, Financial Services, Collaboration.</jats:p>"

As renewable energy sources gain traction, there is an imperative to refine operational models, prioritizing sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. This study employs a comprehensive conceptual framework integrating critical analysis of business scenarios, product positioning, and market segmentation. The study adopts supply network optimization, encompassing demand forecasting, inventory management, transportation, production scheduling, cash flow management, and data analytics. The research evaluates three supply models: Satellite Manufacturing, Hub Manufacturing, and Contract Manufacturing. It employs scenario analysis to assess the impact of supply chain strategies on operating and cash cycles. The analysis reveals that Hub- based contract manufacturing is the most effective model. The research demonstrates that optimizing supply networks directly influences the operating and cash cycles of companies in the Oil and Gas industry. By reducing inventory levels, optimizing supplier payment terms, and streamlining production processes, organizations can achieve cost savings, improve efficiency, and enhance cash flow management. The study underscores the importance of thorough analysis and strategic decision-making in selecting supply chain models to enhance cost efficiency, operational effectiveness, and cash flow management. The study is limited to midstream and downstream services and may vary based on industry contexts. Future research could explore additional supply chain strategies across different sectors. This research contributes to the sustainable consumption and value co-creation literature by offering practical insights for businesses operating in the oil and gas industry or similar contexts. It provides a framework for optimizing supply chain models to improve cost efficiency and cash flow management, thereby enhancing overall business performance.</jats:p>"

Bayesian algorithm model of logistics nodes delay of supply chain is constructed through parameter learning. The empirical analysis is conducted on the basis of three types of nodes delay with 2041 sets of data for cargo departures and arrivals, upstream nodes delay, and nodes delay of supply chain. The results show that the nodes delay of supply chain gradually decreases from upstream to downstream; there are strong correlations between propagation probability and transfer time of nodes delay; the effects of initial node delay are the maximum, after 3 transitions, still having 30% probability to affect the succeeding nodes.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper summarizes the prior analysis, key findings, and recommendations from the published report titled “Initial Heliostat Supply Chain Analysis” [1]. Globally, the growing demand for concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies, primarily for electricity generation plants has been met with supply chains primarily composed of plentiful commodity materials such as steel, aluminum, and glass. Often the commodity materials can be sourced in the domestic market where power plant will be constructed. Although specialty components are required for CSP solar fields —including mirror panels used for heliostat applications—these specialty components constitute about 30-50% of total system installed costs [2]. Only a few companies and countries, including the United States, have developed the capacity to supply such specialty components. The U.S. heliostat supply chain at present is comprised of few companies (e.g., CSP developers), component suppliers, and is its infancy.\r\nBy 2035, with current and aggressive solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity expansions, there is the potential for 500,000–1,500,000 direct and indirect jobs in the areas of manufacturing, installation and development, and operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) [3]. Utilizing the CSP capacity estimations the recent NREL report [4], the construction of 39 gigawatts (GW) of CSP (assuming mainly power tower) in the U.S. could lead to approximately 195,000 manufacturing, construction, and O&amp;M jobs. This does not include the longer-term jobs and economic impact (e.g., taxes from plant operations staff) from operating the plants once constructed. It is recommended that further CSP component and system supply chain analysis and modelling be undertaken.</jats:p>"

While prior studies have recognized lead time as a crucial factor impacting supply chain performance, scant attention has been paid to the specific contribution of lead-time management strategies in this context. Hence, this study aimed to bridge this gap. By employing a descriptive survey research design, data were collected from a sample of 153 manufacturing firms selected through purposive sampling. The primary data collection instrument was a structured questionnaire, and statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software. The findings indicate that early involvement of suppliers in product design and dissemination of accurate customer specifications significantly reduces lead time. Process automation and efficient transport management, including route planning and vehicle scheduling, were found to enhance supply chain performance. Consequently, the study concludes that early supplier involvement, process automation, and effective transport management positively impact supply chain performance. Based on these findings, it is recommended that manufacturing companies prioritize initiatives aimed at reducing lead time, such as minimizing waiting times, engaging suppliers early in the process, automating processes, and improving transport management in order to enhance overall supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

In the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine war, which is one of the most significant events happening worldwide, the impact of the Organization of Turkic States (OTS) on global trade, economic, and logistical activities has been examined. In the current research, the qualitative method was employed to conduct an in-depth examination of the role of the OTS in global trade, transportation corridors, and the EU's energy supply security. For this study, secondary sources such as databases, scientific journals, books, national and international news, etc., were utilized. The research particularly highlights the quest for alternative routes in global trade, especially in recent times. In this context, it is noteworthy that Türkiye and the OTS are among the most significant partners. The presence of OTS is evident in almost all North-South and East-West oriented developed trade corridors, which supports this situation qualitatively. Additionally, the presence of OTS member countries with abundant underground resources enables the optimization of both logistics and supply elements together. This study emphasizes the significance of the OTS in the global economy and commercial activities. Particularly, it highlights the crucial role of Türkiye and OTS as a bridge between East and West, especially after the Ukraine-Russia war. The implications for the future underscore the strengths of OTS and its importance in the times to come.</jats:p>"

This study addresses this gap by proposing a bi-objective multi-user multi-task scheduling model aimed at simultaneously minimising workload and maximising customer satisfaction. To accurately capture customer satisfaction, a novel comprehensive rating index is introduced, integrating the actual completion cost, time, and processing quality against customer expectations. Furthermore, vehicle constraints are incorporated into the model to accommodate potential delays in transport vehicle availability, thereby enhancing its alignment with real-world manufacturing settings. The proposed mathematical model is solved using an improved three-stage genetic algorithm, which integrates the k-means algorithm and a real-time sequence scheduling strategy to optimise solution quality. Validation against alternative algorithms across various case scales demonstrates the efficacy of the approach in providing practical scheduling solutions for real-case scenarios.</jats:p>"

In this study, spatiotemporal changes of three ecosystem services (food provision, C sequestration, recreation) were quantified and imbalances between their supply and demand were identified in Vilnius County (Lithuania) in 2000–2020. The most significant land use transformation was the increase in forest and urbanized land at the expense of agricultural land. The lowest supply and the highest demand for food, carbon sequestration, and outdoor recreation were in the urban center. The urban land ratio had a negative impact on the provision of ecosystems’ services during the study period, most notably affecting food supply. Urbanization indicators—population density and urban land area—showed a negative relationship with the provision of ecosystem services. The balance of supply and demand changed during the 2000–2020 period—the growth of suburbs led to the distance of the supply areas from the city, and the area of the intense demand increased. The results of the study highlight the importance of spatial scale in determining the impact of urbanization on ecosystem functions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we develop a two-level supply chain model with low carbon emissions for defective deteriorating items under learning in fuzzy environment by using the double inspection process. Carbon emissions are a major issue for the environment and human life when they come from many sources like different kinds of factories, firms, and industries. The burning of diesel and petrol during the supply of items through transportation is also responsible for carbon emissions. When any company, firm, or industry supplies their items through a supply chain by using of transportation in the regular mode, then a lot of carbon units are emitted from the burning of petrol and diesel, etc., which affects the supply chain. Carbon emissions can be controlled by using different kinds of policies issued by the government of a country, and lots of companies have implemented these policies to control carbon emissions. When a seller delivers a demanded lot size to the buyer, as per demand, and the lot size has some defective items, as per consideration, the demand rate is uncertain in nature. The buyer inspects the received whole lot and divides it into two categories of defective and no defective deteriorating items, as well as immediately selling at different price. The fuzzy concept nullifies the uncertain nature of the demand rate. This paper covers two models, assuming two conditions of quality screening under learning in fuzzy environment: (i) the buyer shows the quality screening and (ii) the quality inspection becomes the seller’s responsibility. The carbon footprint from the transporting and warehousing the deteriorating items is also assumed. The aim of this study is to minimize the whole inventory cost for supply chains with respect to lot size and the number of orders per production cycle. Jointly optimizing the delivery lot size and number of orders per production cycle will minimize the whole fuzzy inventory cost for the supply chain and also reduce the carbon emissions. We take two numerical approaches with authentic data (from the literature reviews) for the justification of the proposed model 1 and model 2. Sensitivity observations, managerial insights, applications of these proposed models, and future scope are also included in this paper, which is more beneficial for firms, the industrial sector, and especially for online markets. The impact of the most effective parameters, like learning effect, fuzzy parameter, carbon emissions parameter, and inventory cost are shown in this study and had a positive effect on the total inventory cost for the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) is a flexible component of the Incentive Regulation (IBR) that empowers power producers to adjust tariffs in response to variable fuel prices, thereby enhancing the economic resilience of electricity generation. However, the cost of electricity generation is significantly influenced by the volatility of commodity prices, including coal, gas and LNG. In Malaysia, the Energy Commission has conducted biannual reviews of fuel and other generation costs. Any cost savings or increases identified during these reviews will be passed on to customers in the form of rebates or surcharges. Due to that reason, this study proposes ICPT price forecasting for the electricity market in Peninsular Malaysia. The study aims to construct an ICPT-related baseline model for the peninsular generation data by employing three forecasting methods. The forecasting performance is analysed by a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). In findings, the ARIMA method is one of the most accurate forecasting methods for fuel prices compared to the Moving Average (MA) and LSSVM methods. The observed price differences between the ARIMA and LSSVM models for ICPT are minimal. The ICPT price for July-December 2022 and January-June 2023 is MYR 0.21/ kWh for ARIMA and MYR 0.18/kWh for LSSVM, which are close to the actual TNB’s ICPT tariff. As for the forecasting, the ICPT price is expected to drop for the next announcement. The findings of this study may contribute to a positive impact on the sustainability of the energy sector in Malaysia.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 outbreak has had great impacts on traditional trading activities and lifestyles. More and more consumers choose to shop on online platforms, which requires more efficient management of supply chains. Sellers face real problems, such as maintaining a stable and reliable supply chain and avoiding the risk of supply chain disruption. There has been some research on supply chains, but they mainly focus on upgrades, digitalization, business collaboration efficiency improvement, etc. Few have paid attention to the causes of supply chain disruption and how to avoid the risk. In this regard, this article aims to summarize the actual risks that can be found in the operation of a supply chain, taking a cold chain in the food supply as an example, in the background of the digital economy, and to put forward some ideas and suggestions for avoiding such risks. The research presented in this article will help to reveal the potential risks of supply chain disruption and provide some inspiration for improving the resilience and anti-risk capabilities of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The European inland waterway transport needs to substitute 6.2 TWh of fossil diesel by renewable energy carriers. For hydrogen retrofit solutions investigated in the European project “Synergetics”, different Well-to-Tank pathways have been analysed to supply renewable hydrogen to Rotterdam, including buffer storage and fuelling to vessels. This paper compares two dominant scenarios with regards to GHG emissions and costs. One scenario is based on PV electricity from Morocco, transported to Rotterdam for electrolysis. The other scenario is calculated with electricity from offshore wind farms in the Northern Sea. The calculation of the PV scenario leads to specific emissions for the hydrogen supplied to vessels of 51 gCO2eq/kWhH2 with levelized costs of hydrogen of 0.12 €/kWhH2. The wind scenario led to 16 gCO2eq/kWhH2 with 0.19 €/kWhH2. The electrolysis has the highest impact on emissions and costs, especially the electricity demand. Accordingly, lower emissions of PV electricity supply would have a high influence on the overall results. On the other hand, for the low emission renewable hydrogen supply with wind power a further reduction of the costs of the installation will be relevant.</jats:p>"

In response, firms raise prices by 3–5 percent. This effect is decreasing in the elasticity of firms’ demand but positive for most industrial production. Our results show that firms increase prices to raise cash when external sources of liquidity dry up. (JEL D22, E23, E31, E32, E44, G01, G21) </jats:p>",

This is a critical issue with global implications. Organizations of various sizes can promote the alignment of economic, social, and environmental goals through stakeholder engagement and the implementation of corporate social responsibility strategies. Uncertainty about the future of the networked and globalizing information economy will undoubtedly necessitate socially responsible supply chain partnerships that include the entire CSR initiative of upstream partner-suppliers and socially responsible firms. The goal of this paper is to describe the creation of a modeling and analysis framework for socially responsible supply chain partnerships, which consists of five steps: CSR Equity. The framework depicts relevant optimal coordination strategies to improve the social and environmental performance of all supply chain system stakeholders from the perspective of socially responsible customers. According to the findings, the share rate of the total investment made by the partner-supplier in CSR initiatives is a critical contract provision for coordinating socially conscious supply chain partnerships and implementing the Pareto optimal policy with cost sharing contracts. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation exists between the share rate and the ratio of marginal revenues among supply chain participants, while a negative correlation exists between the share rate and the leverage rate of corporate social responsibility initiatives by the partner-supplier.</jats:p>"

Responding to evidence and the specific needs of its expeditionary context, the US Central Command (USCENTCOM) prioritized supplying stored low titer O whole blood (LTOWB) to its units from March, 2023 onward. A strategy was devised to set minimal LTOWB on-hand supply benchmarks, determined by the number of operating beds and point of injury teams. This transition led to a 54% reduction in orders for packed red blood cells. As a countermove, the Armed Services Blood Program (ASBP) enhanced LTOWB production at a conversion rate 2:1 from packed red blood cell to LTOWB. Consequently, there was a decline in expired blood products, and fulfillment rates for blood requests are projected to reach 100% consistently. This paper delves into the intricacies of the expeditionary blood supply, the rationale behind the LTOWB transition, the devised allocation strategy, and the subsequent impacts of this change.</jats:p>",

Its hydrogeological structure has been studied since the middle of the last century for the springs’ characterization for drinking purposes and for a motorway tunnel. Meanwhile, its hydrodynamic parametrization is less developed and has been limited to monitoring the discharge and chemical and isotopic parameters. Secondary porosity characterizes the aquifer, and an underlying impermeable marly complex represents the basal aquiclude. It might appear inappropriate to characterize the hydraulic properties via pumping tests, as their reliability has been proven in homogeneous and isotropic media. However, the high extent of the aquifer, the wells’ location, the scarcity of information available and the lack of alternatives has forced the estimation of hydrodynamic parameters as in porous aquifers and the experimental testing of the aquifer, especially in maximum pumping conditions, for a possible exploitation increase. Since aquifer testing was performed during the normal well field’s activities, it was not possible to perform typical tests. Therefore, the step-drawdown test was conducted by turning on an increasing number of wells over time and keeping the observation points fixed. As results, a mean hydraulic conductivity of 5 × 10−3 m/s and a mean transmissivity of 0.3 m2/s were established without interrupting the water supply; meanwhile, the influence radius and flow directions were also estimated.</jats:p>"

In such cases, the hybrid renewable microgrid systems offer abetter alternative by reducing dependency on diesel fuel and meetingenergy demands in an environmentally friendly manner. To enhance thereliability of these hybrid systems, renewable sources can be integratedwith diesel generators and utility grid. This integration allows hybridsystems to compensate for the intermittent nature of renewable energysources and achieve higher overall energy efficiency. One of the mainadvantages of hybrid systems is their potential for energy autonomy, asthey are not reliant on a single energy source.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, a large number of home appliances have entered the node of renewal, if they can be properly disposed of and utilised, used home appliances can also be converted into renewable resources to achieve the economic cycle, and at the same time, green living and circular economy are increasingly accepted by the public. Recycling of used home appliances has both economic and social benefits. At the same time, promotional efforts invested in the market for home appliances have an obvious effect on increasing their market demand. Therefore, it is necessary to study the closed-loop supply chain of home appliances based on promotion and recycling efforts. In this paper, we use literature analysis, mathematical analysis and Stackelberg game analysis to construct a closed-loop supply chain model for home appliances based on promotional and recycling efforts after determining who is the promoter among manufacturers and retailers, and then compare and analyse the decisions and benefits of the supply chain members, taking into account their centralised and decentralised decision-making. The results of this paper show that: (1) when home appliance manufacturers, retailers and third-party recyclers of used home appliances make decentralised decisions, there is a double marginal effect, i.e., the supply chain members only consider their own benefits while ignoring the benefits of the supply chain as a whole, which results in the failure of this closed-loop supply chain system of home appliances to be coordinated. (2) When the retailer's promotional effort is greater, both the retail price and the retailer's profit are lower. (3) The greater the recycling effort of the third-party recycler of used home appliance products, the higher its recycling price, i.e., the consequent increase in recycling costs, leading to a decrease in its profit.</jats:p>"

There is information asymmetry in small and medium-sized enterprises, which leads to financing constraints. Trust between regions will exacerbate this constraint, restricting the financing of buyers and sellers, and thus affecting the entire supply chain financing. The transaction between different regions is fitted with the trust between regions and the supply chain financing situation between different regions in previous years. The relationship between the two is established, and the impact mechanism of trust between regions on the development of supply chain financing is studied. After empirical analysis of the impact of trust factors on the upstream and downstream of special supply chains, the impact of trust between regions on supply chain financing is further analyzed.

To explore the complex interactions and causal effects of the selected macroeconomic indicator on economic growth, we have employed a quantitative analysis based on the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model and cointegration, implemented using the R programming language. The main findings reveal that money supply significantly boosts economic growth, while interest rates have negative effects. Moreover, inflation positively influences short-term economic growth. These insights enhance understanding of the role that monetary policy plays in promoting economic development.

The amount of groundwater and its quality are rapidly declining because of urbanization and industrialization. Groundwater resources in hard rock regions should be handled properly to maximize their utilization. This work aims to demarcate the Groundwater Potential Zones (GWPZ) in a part of the Palar River Basin (Ponnai sub-basin) by combining Remote Sensing (RS), Geographic Information System (GIS) and Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP). The factors which influence the groundwater like geology, land use/land cover (LULC), geomorphology, slope, soil, rainfall, lineament density (LD), drainage density (DD), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), topographic wetness index (TWI) and topographic position index (TPI) are considered for mapping of GWPZ. The weightage is allocated to these parameters on the basis of the FAHP technique and the obtained groundwater potential map was classified as, very poor (13.5%), poor (21.76%), moderate (31.5%), good (20.66%) and very good (8.54%). The GWPZ map was validated with the actual well yield of the Ponnai sub-basin. The research work will serve as a guideline for the effective use of groundwater and long-term sustainable management of the aquifer in the Ponnai sub-basin.</jats:p>",

This transformative technology has garnered substantial attention due to its capacity to streamline processes, save time, and enhance product quality. Simultaneously, environmental concerns are mounting, with the growing accumulation of plastic bottle waste, offering a potential source of recycled material for 3D printing. To thoroughly harness the potential of AM and address the challenge of plastic bottle waste, a robust supply chain network is essential. Such a network not only facilitates the reintegration of plastic bottle waste and 3D printing byproducts into the value chain but also delivers significant environmental, social, and economic benefits, aligning with the tenets of sustainable development and circular economy. To tackle this complex challenge, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) mathematical model is offered to configure a Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) network with a strong emphasis on circularity. Environmental considerations are integral, and the primary objective is to minimize the overall cost of the network. Three well-known metaheuristics of Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are employed to treat the problem which are also efficiently adjusted by the Taguchi design technique. The efficacy of our solution methods is appraised across various problem instances. The findings reveal that the developed model, in conjunction with the fine-tuned metaheuristics, successfully optimizes the configuration of the desired circular CLSC network. In conclusion, this research represents a significant step toward the establishment of a circular supply chain that combines the strengths of 3D printing technology and the repurposing of plastic bottle waste. This innovative approach holds promise for not only reducing waste and enhancing sustainability but also fostering economic and social well-being.</jats:p>"

The design of the architecture of contracting, the coordination among contracts, and the content of sustainability terms along the chain is the result of the cooperation of different actors, led by one or more transnational corporations. The paper describes the distribution of private regulatory power according to the structures of the chains- hierarchical, relational, market -and its impact on the compliance with sustainability standards. It considers the qualification system that regulates entry, exit, and permanence in the chain and the Suppliers codes and General principles of sustainability specified in the general terms and conditions. These represent complementary direct and indirect private regulatory instruments that can be deployed to ensure compliance. The choice of instruments depends on the distribution of regulatory power among the private actors and their exercise. Privity of contract makes it often difficult if not impossible direct regulation by the chain leader and obliges decentralization of regulatory power. The analysis shows that only the complementarity between the two sets of instruments enables control of compliance in complex chains whose actors operate across different jurisdictions with the use of sanctioning and remedial powers.

This study surveyed manufacturing companies in the Korean supply chain, and data were analyzed using SPSS 23.0 and AMOS 23.0. The results of this study imply that cognitive trust, related to the partner’s expertise and capabilities, is more crucial than emotion-based affective trust in fostering collaborative supply chain risk management among companies within the supply chain, especially in the current unpredictable and complex business environments. Given the supply chain disruptions caused by uncertainties in the business environment, it is imperative to effectively manage risks and restructure the disrupted supply chain.

In particular, as both intercompany dependencies in business activities and environmental uncertainty increase, digital transformation has become an important means of managing transaction relationships not only within but also between companies. The purpose of this study is to explicate the process of how digital transformation technology used among supply chain members can improve corporate performance and to identify the influencing variables for making good use of it. The findings have implications that can help companies invest time and money in digital innovation to achieve effective corporate performance. This research model analyzed data from 222 domestic manufacturing companies through structural equation model analysis. We found that the more developed the corporate culture and the higher the trust with partner companies, the more active the companies are in utilizing digital transformation. In addition, while digital transformation has a direct impact on corporate performance, we also confirmed the mediating effect of information sharing between companies, which can have a greater positive impact on corporate performance as its level increases. A notable result is that digital transformation significantly improves information sharing in low-trust corporate relationships. These results suggest that digital, non-face-to-face technologies can complement and strengthen relationships that have traditionally been formed through interpersonal relationships. This study compensates for the shortcomings of previous studies that verify the fragmentary achievements of digital transformation. It also has theoretical significance in that it hypothesizes and demonstrates the entire process of how digital transformation is activated in what type of environment and leads to corporate performance. In addition, although companies with a strong relationship of trust may find it easy to invest in innovation, there are practical implications that even new companies that do not have a relationship of trust should consider active use of digital transformation when conducting important transactions.</jats:p>"

However, the issue of food waste created by the food deliver industry has become a pressing concern in society. This paper aims to examine the link between food waste and food delivery services, and investigate the effects of anti-food waste regulations on the generation of food waste and the choice of logistics strategies in an Online-to-Offline (O2O) supply chain. Using game-theoretical approach, we focus on two prominent logistics strategies—the restaurant-free self-logistics strategy (<jats:italic>RF</jats:italic> strategy) and the platform-charge logistics strategy (<jats:italic>PC</jats:italic> strategy). Our research results show that anti-food waste regulation can effectively reduce food waste in food delivery service under the <jats:italic>PC</jats:italic> logistics strategy. The choice of logistics strategy is constrained by the online market potential, the relative logistics costs of platform logistics, and anti-food waste regulations. If the anti-food waste regulation is strict, as long as the size of the food delivery market and the relative logistics costs of platform logistics are not simultaneously small, the <jats:italic>RF</jats:italic> strategy will be the equilibrium strategy, whereas the supply chain members should choose the <jats:italic>PC</jats:italic> strategy.

This involves meticulously structuring, developing, and efficiently managing the supply base to ensure alignment of suppliers with the manufacturing processes and business objectives, consequently generating value and enhancing market competitiveness. The processes of acquiring, assimilating, transforming, and exploiting pertinent supply chain knowledge are vital for continuously bridging the gap between the current knowledge and the complex requirements of supply management, consequently strengthening the purchasing department's supply management capabilities. Strategic purchasing orientation commits more strategic resources to the purchasing department, allowing manufacturers to access and assimilate a broader spectrum of knowledge within the supply network. Grounded in the knowledge‐based view, our research delves into the development process of supply management capabilities, examining the influence of strategic purchasing orientation and absorptive capacity. Through hierarchical regression analysis of data from 395 manufacturers, our findings reveal that a pronounced strategic purchasing orientation significantly enhances absorptive capacity, thereby facilitating the development of supply management capabilities. Additionally, our study identifies distinct mediating roles of potential and realized absorptive capacities in the relationship between strategic purchasing orientation and supply management capability. This research offers a novel perspective on the development of supply management capabilities, providing valuable insights for manufacturers to address the complexities of supply management by narrowing the knowledge gap.

As global economic integration accelerates and technological innovations deepen, digital transformation has become key to enhancing core corporate competitiveness. This research, utilizing data from A-share listed companies in China between 2007 and 2022, analyzes how companies improve supply chain efficiency through digital transformation. Furthermore, the study establishes a theoretical framework that demonstrates how digital transformation facilitates supply chain efficiency from the perspectives of internal governance and external competition. The research indicates that digital transformation plays a key role in significantly enhancing supply chain efficiency. Furthermore, the results of the mechanism analysis confirmed that digital transformation contributes to enhancing corporate supply chain efficiency by improving the level of corporate governance and the degree of market competition. The study also finds that the effect of digital transformation on supply chain efficiency varies with different corporate backgrounds, indicating its heterogeneous impact. Lastly, an analysis of economic consequences shows that the increased supply chain efficiency resulting from digital transformation can reduce future external transaction costs, strengthening the company’s market position and financial performance.

BT consumes energy and emits carbon gases, affecting its adoption in Supply Chains (SCs). The substantial energy demand of blockchain networks contributes to carbon emissions and sustainability risks. Moreover, for secure and reliable transactions, mutual authentication needs to be established to address security concerns raised by SC managers. This paper proposes a tri-objective optimization model for the simultaneous design of the SC-BT network, considering a two-step authentication process. The model considers transparency caused by BT members, emissions of BT, and costs related to BT and SC design. It also takes into account uncertainty conditions for participating BT members in the SC and the range of transparency, cost, and emission targets. To solve the model, a Branch and Efficiency (B&amp;E) algorithm equipped with BT-related criteria is developed. The algorithm is implemented in a three-level SC and produces cost-effective and environmentally friendly outcomes. However, the adoption of BT in the SC can be costly and harmful to the environment under uncertain conditions. It is worth mentioning that implementing the proposed algorithm from our article in a three-level SC case study can result in a significant cost reduction of over 16% and an emission reduction of over 13%. The iterative nature of this algorithm plays a vital role in achieving these positive outcomes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective — to identify the relationship between changes in the concentration of vitamins A, E, D, magnesium content, and comorbid pathology in adolescent girls with menstrual function disorders.\r\nMaterials and methods. Examinations involved 237 girls with menstrual function disorders aged 11—18 years. Oligomenorrhea (OM) was diagnosed in 103 patients, and abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in 134 girls.\r\nResults and discussion. Comorbid pathology was revealed in most patients, regardless of the type of menstrual function disorder. Endocrine system disorders were the most frequent comorbidities. In girls with OM, comorbid endocrine disorders were accompanied by a decrease in the levels of vitamins A (pu &lt; 0.01) and E, due to decrease in the frequency of their elevated indicators (pφ &lt; 0.03). At the same time, mostly normal magnesium levels were registered (pφ &lt; 0.001) due to a decrease in the frequency of its reduced and elevated levels compared to patients without pathology. In girls with AUB, comorbid endocrine system pathology was accompanied by decrease in the frequency of optimal levels of 25(OH)D3 (pφ &lt; 0.03), and comorbid pathology of the neuro-­psychiatric sphere was accompanied by decrease in the frequency of elevated levels of vitamins A (pφ &lt; 0.01) and E (pφ &lt; 0.03) compared to girls without pathology. Regardless of the type of menstrual disorder, the greatest number of changes in the vitamin status were found in girls with comorbid pathology of the endocrine system. In patients with OM, the retinol levels were lower than in girls with AUB (pφ &lt; 0.01), and a decrease in tocopherol levels was observed (pφ &gt; 0.05). In girls with AUB, elevated levels of vitamin A (pφ &lt; 0.03), vitamin E (pφ &lt; 0.04), and moderate vitamin D deficiency (pφ &lt; 0.03) were more frequently registered compared to girls with OM. Vitamin D deficiency in girls with abnormal uterine bleeding was less frequently registered compared to patients with oligomenorrhea (pφ &lt; 0.05). It should be noted that comorbid pathology of the digestive system in abnormal uterine bleeding was mostly often accompanied by the decreased tocopherol levels (pφ &lt; 0.05) and normal magnesium values (pφ &lt; 0.04) compared to patients with oligomenorrhea.\r\nConclusions. The study revealed a correlation between fluctuations in the content of vitamin status components and comorbid pathology in girls with menstrual disorders. The most pronounced changes in oligomenorrhea were found under conditions of concomitant pathology of the endocrine system, while in abnormal uterine bleeding, they were identified in the presence of endocrine disorders and disturbances in the neuro­psychiatric sphere. The combination of oligomenorrhea and endocrine pathology, as well as abnormal uterine bleeding and nervous disorders, is accompanied by a decrease in retinol and tocopherol reserves, creating conditions for the deterioration of compensatory­adaptive reactions of the body by suppressing the low-­molecular-­weight link of the antioxidant defense system. Abnormal uterine bleeding and concomitant endocrine disorders are associated with more pronounced moderate vitamin D deficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Because of many firms’ lack of collateral, banks have imposed loan limits as a form of risk-control regulations of bank financing. In response, loan insurance has emerged as a useful instrument to lift loan limits. To study the joint value of bank loans and loan insurance, this article investigates a supply chain composed of one supplier and one capital-constrained buyer who takes out a bank loan and potentially purchases loan insurance. The analysis reveals that both the supplier and the buyer can benefit from the bank financing with loan insurance in an insurance-cooperation region wherein the supplier is willing to reduce the wholesale price to entice the buyer to purchase insurance. Further still, in the insurance-cooperation region, worse contract terms of the bank loan benefit the supplier, whereas worse policy terms of loan insurance help the buyer. Such benefits can lead to a higher order quantity than the capital-abundant one and partially coordinate the entire supply chain. However, when production cost is low, the supplier and the buyer can encounter a Stackelberg prisoner’s dilemma, in which both firms no longer cooperate with each other, and both are worse off. Nevertheless, a government subsidy for the insurance premium can not only reduce the Stackelberg prisoner’s dilemma, but also improve the social welfare although it is not always optimal for the government to provide that subsidy. The main qualitative results are robust in a variety of extensions. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: The first author acknowledges support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [Grant 72171162] and the Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [Grant 20YJC630148], and the second author acknowledges support from the NSFC [Grant 72232001]. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4827 . </jats:p>",

The study identified six alternative channels for onion marketing where different actors are involved throughout the supply chain. Key stakeholders include farmers, local collectors, brokers, transporters, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. Packaging and sorting activities are implemented at different supply chain stages to minimize post-harvest losses. Farm-level activities, including curing, sorting, grading, and ventilating, are crucial for reducing losses. The perishable nature of onion bulbs and the existing production and handling challenges exacerbate post-harvest losses. Efforts to address this challenge demand a comprehensive approach, integrating interventions across the value chain, from improved cultivars and storage infrastructure to enhanced market access strategies. Hence, stakeholders and governmental organizations are urged to promote onion value-addition technologies, including the establishment of processing industries. Such endeavors promote collaborative efforts across the onion supply chain, ensuring sustainable benefits for producers and traders.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

This paper offers a multifaceted viewpoint on the challenges faced by Rwanda's specialty coffee sector. Our holistic approach to studying the situation and possibilities included fieldwork, site visits, informal interviews with various stakeholders, from farmers to governmental officials, and an extensive literature study to support our findings. We highlight the challenges of optimizing the domestic supply chain and the effects of such developments on rural livelihoods. Poverty and lacking resources require a nuanced view toward sustainability, as ecological and economic sustainability do not align. The paper presents how certification programs can function as indicators of sustainability and stresses the need for policy evaluations. We also discuss the unique challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Rwanda and how corporate interests may interfere with long‐term sustainable development. As Rwanda continues to develop, this paper argues that the resilience and ingenuity of its people are crucial in the ongoing development of sustainable agricultural systems.</jats:p>",

Even while the original goal of block chain technology was to facilitate new forms of digital currency that would enable easier and more secure payment methods, they have enormous promise as a new foundation for all kinds of transactions. Agribusiness stands to gain a lot from this technology by leveraging it as a platform to conduct \"smart contracts\" for transactions, especially for high-value goods. Before we go any further, it is important to distinguish between distributed ledgers and block chain technologies and private digital currencies. Given the distributed and global character of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, it is improbable that central banks will be able to adequately oversee the underlying protocols. Monetary authorities are primarily concerned with understanding the \"on-ramps\" and \"off-ramps\" that comprise the links to the traditional payments system, rather than being able to monitor and manage the money itself. In contrast to the digital currency component of the block chain, the distributed ledger aspect holds great potential for application in trade and agriculture funding, especially in scenarios where multiple partners are involved and a dependable central authority is lacking</jats:p>"

While deep aquifers post-chlorination were adenovirus free, shallow aquifers near farm wastewater pits exhibited human adenovirus and bovine adenovirus. Coliform-negative samples also harboured pathogens, highlighting the limitations of conventional indicators. Surface water displayed higher viral contamination, potentially impacting groundwater. The use of farm wastewater for irrigation and open pit disposal emerged as key contributors, advocating for sustainable wastewater management. Physiochemical and microbial analyses revealed variations across sites, emphasising regional and temporal variations. The weighted arithmetic water quality index ranged from good to very poor, with deep aquifers showing better quality than shallow ones. A novel approach incorporating graphical representations of adenovirus estimations alongside water quality index provided a more comprehensive understanding. Intriguingly, the study revealed the presence of coliforms irrespective of water quality grade, questioning its reliability as a sole indicator. Correlations between specific water quality grades and adenovirus types suggested targeted control measures. The lack of significant correlations between viral markers and conventional parameters in groundwater compared to surface water studies highlighted the unique dynamics of groundwater contamination.</jats:p>",

For this, the physicochemical parameters and trace metals in river water were analysed in the pre- and post-monsoon seasons. The results showed that the concentrations of cations and anions were Ca2+ &amp;gt; Na+ &amp;gt; Mg2+ &amp;gt; K+ and HCO3− &amp;gt; SO42- &amp;gt; Cl− &amp;gt; NO3− &amp;gt; PO43-, respectively, in both the pre- and post-monsoon seasons. However, trace metal concentration in pre- and post-monsoon followed the trend of Pb &amp;gt; Mn &amp;gt; Cr &amp;gt; Ni &amp;gt; Cu &amp;gt; Zn &amp;gt; Co and Pb &amp;gt; Ni &amp;gt; Mn &amp;gt; Cr &amp;gt; Zn &amp;gt; Co &amp;gt; Cu, respectively. The results reveal that combined effects of rock weathering and evaporation-concentration influence hydrochemistry, along with anthropogenic factors like industrial effluents, urban domestic sewage and agricultural runoff. Piper and Durov plots suggest that the river water is dominated by Ca–Mg–HCO3− type, and the processes were governed by simple ion dissolution and mixing. However, the Gibbs plot shows that silicate and carbonate weathering govern the hydrochemical properties. Irrigational indices like sodium adsorption ratio, %Na, residual sodium carbonate, Kelly's ratio, magnesium hazard, and trace metals indicate that most of the water samples are suitable for irrigation. Comprehensive pollution index values suggest that the river water quality ranges from sub-clean to slightly to moderately polluted.</jats:p>",

This article attempts to bridge that gap in the literature using data from the Gartner Supply Chain Group, Brand Finance, American Consumer Satisfaction Index, and Bloomberg Finance. Pertinent statistical tools including multiple regression, ANOVA, t-tests, and chi-square tests were utilized in the study. SCM top performers were found to have higher customer satisfaction than their industry counterparts; supply chain variables used currently do not have a statistically significant impact on the overall success of those companies; North American companies have experienced significantly higher supply chain effectiveness than their counterparts in Europe and Asia Pacific; and European supply chain companies are significantly ahead of companies in America and Asia in the area of CSR. The findings can help managers in companies to benchmark with their global peers. The main contribution of this research is that it demonstrates the value of supply chain effectiveness while underscoring the need for further research to link supply chain effectiveness with organizational performance. Supply chain managers need to explore operational or internal process metrics that have a more significant impact on overall company success.</jats:p>"

Developing reliable simulation and forecasting tools is essential for effective management of groundwater resources from karstic springs. Although hybrid modeling approaches have been explored in hydrology, their application to spring discharge modeling is underexplored. Previous studies have focused on conceptual/distributed or data-driven models separately, missing the potential advantages of combining them. This creates a research gap in exploring the benefits of hybrid models for spring discharge. This study developed a hybrid model combining a conceptual GR5J model with Random Forests to simulate spring discharge from Bordeaux's largest karst aquifer. Model performance was assessed through comparison with the individual GR5J, RF, and benchmark models (weekly average of observed values). The hybrid model outperformed all models. Evaluation using actual meteorological data found the hybrid model achieved the highest accuracy by reducing GR5J simulation errors by 22%. When considering meteorological uncertainty, the hybrid model outperformed the individual GR5J, RF and benchmark models by 11, 30 and 47% respectively. The study findings suggest combining conceptual and machine learning approaches can improve spring discharge simulations, opening promising opportunities for enhanced forecasting in karst aquifers.</jats:p>",

Unlike earlier studies focusing on specific aspects, this research adopts a holistic approach, examining factors crucial for water supply, quality, and cost, thus providing an integrated view of Rwanda's water sector. By analyzing data from various sources, including the Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC), the study evaluates the reliability, quality, and cost-effectiveness of drinking water. It identifies cost-effective water treatment plants and studies determinants such as production cost, raw water quality, and supply between 2017 and 2022, introducing novel metrics such as performance scores and a drinking water quality index. Despite an increase in lost water, WASAC notably improves water supply, resulting in a higher water access rate by 2022. The study highlights the influence of factors such as performance scores and raw water quality on water supply and quality. It emphasizes continuous monitoring, targeted interventions, and community engagement for sustainable water service delivery. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers, stakeholders, and practitioners, aiming to enhance water management strategies and improve water access in Rwanda.</jats:p>",

This study aims to evaluate the performance of WSS using the results of a household survey and the ranking of performance indicators (PIs) by the analytic hierarchy process method. The methodology developed was tested for the case of the city of Taoura (Algeria). A survey was carried out among 340 residents of the city. The survey results showed that the majority of respondents (70%) were relatively dissatisfied with the quantity of water provided and 67% of households surveyed rated the quality of service as poor. Then, the performance was evaluated according to 5 decision criteria and 20 PIs. The results of the evaluation of the relative weights of the criteria are as follows: the ‘Financial and economic’ criterion plays the most important role, with a relative weight of 38.61%, followed by the ‘Operational’ criterion (24.7%) and the criterion ‘Physics’ (17.32%). The methodology used in this study can be a reliable tool for evaluating the performance of WSS in developing countries.</jats:p>",

This research investigates the application of effective agricultural systems focused at short-term harvests in order to increase production rates and optimize supply chain efficiency. This study's focus on innovative farming techniques, technology adoption, and supply chain management improvements desires to assist policymakers, agricultural practitioners, and stakeholders with practical knowledge. This study focuses on multiple cultivation using the ground and the spaces accessible above it; therefore, the cost will remain constant or as low as possible. Cultivators will use minimal effort to bring out maximum harvest where they will use less labour as the ground is the same. This study will discuss on efficient cultivation strategies, Short term harvests and production rates, Optimizing supply chain efficiency, Innovative farming techniques and technology adoption, Supply chain management improvements and actionable insights for sustainable agricultural development. Through an emphasis on innovative farming methodologies, technological integration, and enhancements in supply chain management, this study endeavours to furnish actionable insights crucial for policymakers, agricultural practitioners, and stakeholders invested in the agricultural sector. The study emphasizes the vital role of customized changes in agricultural methods in addressing hurdles and maximizing on potential for sustainable agricultural growth. (Kouvelis et al., 2006)\nAccording to the findings of this study, the majority of cultivators work on the ground surface. They are spending money on fertilizer, water, and insecticides. One farmer can grow cauliflower, which will occupy the ground's surface. Malabar spinach will occupy the air area starting two feet above the ground. Again, a loft can be built five to six feet above ground to grow several sorts of beans. Other short-term crops such as chilies, spinach, lettuce, and radish can be grown in the gaps between the cultivation bays. In sum, all four layers of crops will need the same quantity of fertilizer, insecticides, and water. Thus, the cost will be almost the same, but the outcome will be four times higher.</jats:p>"

Consequently, several challenges have been encountered including frequent filter backwashing, leading to a reduced plant output. In this study, the potential of substituting single-media filters (currently used at MJWTW) with triple-media filters was investigated. This was done using pilot filters of a single-media filter (SMF) and a triple-media filter (TMF) and piloted using clarified water from MJWTW. Electrical conductivity (EC), pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, and temperature were the water quality parameters that were monitored. Headloss and flow rate were the filter operation parameters that were monitored. Both water quality and operational parameters were monitored at hourly intervals until one filter reached the maximum allowable headloss or turbidity limit. The variation in effluent turbidity, TDS, EC, and pH between the filters was insignificant. Nevertheless, the headloss development for the TMF was significantly slower than that of the SMF resulting in the SMF reaching the maximum headloss earlier. Therefore, the TMF performed better overall. Therefore, the adoption of TMF could result in a longer filter run and improve filtration and water production at MJWTW.</jats:p>",

Eleven physico-chemical parameters were measured at 16 locations. Emphasis was placed on the selection of irrigation water quality index (IWQI) inputs through the application of multivariate statistical analysis, the estimation of various classical irrigation indices, and the integration of geographic information systems. The results of the IWQI, sodium adsorption ratio, Kelly index, permeability index, residual sodium carbonate and magnesium hazard showed that the majority of groundwater samples were classified for irrigation purposes in the following categories: severely restricted (100%), low sodium and excellent (100%), good (93.75%), marginally safe (100%), good (100%) and suitable (81.25%), respectively. In addition, the majority of selected samples were classified as “good to eligible for irrigation” based on %Na as shown in the distribution map. Whereas the principal component analysis results show that the four factors together explain 72.74% of the total variance according to the Kaiser rule. Cluster analysis divides the parameters into three groups. In summary, the combination of the geographic system and irrigation quality indices is useful for identifying irrigation zones.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business executives have recently indicated that supply chain disruptions represent a major threat to their firm’s profitability and revenue growth (Smyrlis, 2006; Hendricks and Singhal, 2009).  In the literature, a number of conceptual studies have suggested that supply chain complexity is a main driver of supply chain disruptions (Choi &amp; Krause, 2006; Christopher &amp; Lee, 2004; Juettner et al., 2003). Other studies have suggested that the degree of coupling in the supply chain is a major determinant of supply chain disruptions (Agrawal and Nahimias, 1997; Ahuja, 2000).  Building on the theoretical foundation of Normal Accident Theory (NAT), this paper proposes a nuanced relationship between supply chain complexity and coupling and their collective impact on supply chain disruptions. Through an empirical examination, we seek to validate the theoretical proposition that complex, tightly coupled systems are inherently prone to failures or accidents. This study contributes significantly to the supply chain management discourse, providing a detailed analysis of the mechanisms underlying supply chain vulnerabilities and offering practical guidance for developing more resilient and responsive supply chain systems. Our findings invite future research to further explore the intricacies of supply chain disruptions, complexity, and coupling, aiming to refine and expand upon the mitigation strategies discussed herein.</jats:p>",

However, demand uncertainty due to the bullwhip effect can disrupt a company's efforts to make proper plans. This research aims to reduce the value of the bullwhip effect to produce optimal inventory using the Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) method in salt processing companies. This research uses a VMI method with a probabilistic inventory control model approach. So, the vendor determines the number of orders per period. The data type used is secondary data for each distributor and vendor from March 2023 to February 2024. The novelty of this research is the addition of product shortage cost variables, and research was carried out on distributors and vendors. The research results show that the VMI method can reduce the bullwhip effect on vendors by 71%, as well as in each distributor region, such as East Java by 71%, Central Java by 59%, West Java by 57%, Sulawesi by 67%, Sumatra by 62%, Kalimantan by 60%, NTB by 61%, and Bangka Belitung by 63%. This research helps companies effectively estimate optimal inventory for each distributor to avoid information distortion that will cause a bullwhip effect.</jats:p>"

The effect is more substantial for customers who face a higher risk of losing proprietary information and with suppliers that are difficult to substitute. IDD also plays a more prominent role in the absence of alternate mechanisms that reduce contracting frictions, such as shared directors, common ownership, or joint ventures. Our results are robust to using cross‐citation measures of RSI and alternative estimations that mitigate potential biases arising from the staggered difference‐in‐difference approach. Our findings suggest that proprietary information protection enables firms to reduce contracting frictions arising in supply chain relations.</jats:p>",

The prime objective of this research is to explore the phenomenon of optimizing regional business performance through the application of data and business analytics in logistics and supply chain management for the sustainable growth of the US economy. In this study, the researcher employed machine learning methodologies, specifically ANN, RNN, and SVM, to forecast lead times for purchasing aluminum products. In the research, historical data was collected from the database of one of the aluminum-producing companies in the USA for the last 10 years. In particular, a sample of 38,500 orders of aluminum profiles was adopted for the current study. Retrospectively, the Recurrent Neural Network and the Support Vector Machine displayed the most favorable outcomes in predicting lead time in the supply chain. Particularly, RNN had the least Mean Average Error (MAE) on the testing set (447.72), followed by SVM (453.04), MLR (453.22), and NN (455.41). By deploying these algorithms, the government can optimize inventory degrees, minimize stockouts, and reduce excess inventory. This results in enhanced efficiency, diminished carrying costs, and elevated consumer satisfaction, leading to cost savings and heightened profitability for government companies within the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The problem of optimal control in a supply chain that includes a supplier and a retailer is considered. The supply chain is presented as a model of interaction between agents, and is formally organized in the form of a supply contract. Based on the analysis of various types of contracts used in economic practice, the article obtained the following new scientific results. The concept of supply chain coordination has been formed, which defines the step-by-step process of establishing contractual relations between the supplier and the retailer based on the existence of vertical market connections of these agents through their integration and coordination of their interactions. The fundamental properties of the vertical “supplier-retailer” system are identified, which explain the need for a compromise choice of coordinating contract parameters that affect the utility functions of both the supplier and the retailer. Various types of supply contracts are formalized, the models of which are presented in the form of systems of utility functions of the participants in these relations, on the basis of which a set of coordinating parameters is determined. It is shown that the range of values of the coordinating parameters forms a Pareto set. A classification of contract optimization models with a different number and set of coordinating parameters is presented, on the basis of which a hierarchy of complication of optimization models is formed, corresponding to the degree of approximation of the models to the real processes of economic interactions in the «supplier-retailer» system. This lays the methodological basis for creating a generalized model of supply chain management, which makes it possible to develop methods for optimizing management in such chains on a unified formal basis.</jats:p>"

This project aims to identify potential nitrous leak and reduce the waste of N20 in Glangwili Hospital, a small district general hospital in South Wales. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMethods: British Oxygen Company (BOC) supplied us with data on how much N20 was supplied to, and returned from, the hospital between 2021-2022. Data was collected from the anaesthetic machines over a period of three months, looking at the consumption of N20. A leak test of the piped nitrous system was performed during which no nitrous was used. Lastly, anaesthetists were surveyed on their practice with regards to N20. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nResults: On average, Glangwili purchased 54,000L of N20 per month and consumed 2109L, a usage of 3.9%.  The leak test identified a leak of 1.3L/min. From the survey of local anaesthetists, 80% of respondents state they use N20 only four times a year or less.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nConclusion: This project has identified that 96% of the N20 purchased does not reach the patient. These findings are consistent with results from Cardiff and Vale University Health board, where a similar project was performed, and other audits across the United Kingdom. These results should encourage other health boards, including smaller hospitals, to investigate the efficiency of their N20 supply, as significant gains could be made in our steps towards carbon neutrality.   &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The present study explores the impact of carbon emissions on supply chain coordination, where the supply chain entities are a retailer and a distributor. The study also involves two types of systems, namely centralized and decentralized. A centralized system computes the profit of the entire supply chain, including the profit of a retailer and a distributor, using the traditional optimization technique. In contrast, a decentralized system computes the profit of both a retailer and a distributor independently and uses the Stackelberg sequence for profit optimization. According to the Stackelberg sequence, one entity is considered a leader and the other a follower. When the profit in both systems is compared, it is found to be higher in the centralized system. So, to coordinate the system, a revenue-sharing contract is applied to coordinate the supply chain under a stock–time–price-sensitive demand rate. Finally, a carbon emission cost is implemented to the profits of both systems to make the model more sustainable. The main objective of the research is to optimize the profit of the supply chain by considering the concept of revenue-sharing contracts and making the system more sustainable through the implementation of carbon emission cost. The overall study concludes that the revenue-sharing fraction ‘δ’ helps in coordinating the system and 0.4 is the value of the revenue-sharing fraction ‘δ’ that perfectly coordinates the system. Due to this coordination, both the parties will gain profit, i.e., retailer and distributor, and this whole phenomenon increases the profit of the supply chain. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to check the stability of the model, and the model is found to be quite stable. A numerical example is illustrated, providing the result of the model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research delves into the intricate relationship between population dynamics, agricultural value chain, and environmental degradation in Otukpo Local Government Area (LGA), Benue State, Nigeria. The burgeoning population in the region has precipitated notable shifts in land use patterns, agricultural methodologies, and the overall environmental landscape. A robust research methodology was employed to explore this phenomenon comprehensively. Both primary and secondary data were collected, with a sample size of 400 determined using Taro Yamane's formula. This sample was then strategically distributed among the 13 clans within the LGA, yielding 380 returned samples for meticulous analysis. Statistical analysis, facilitated by tools such as standard deviation and mean, was conducted using SPSS software. Employing a mean criterion of 3.0, questionnaires were administered via survey techniques to discern respondents' perspectives. The research findings illuminate the multifaceted impacts of population dynamics in Otukpo LGA. Notably, these dynamics have instigated challenges within the agricultural value chain, manifesting as farmland degradation and pollution. These repercussions have reverberated throughout the environment, precipitating biodiversity loss, soil contamination, and rampant deforestation. The research also underscores the nuanced nature of these challenges. While population growth undeniably exacerbates these issues, it is crucial to acknowledge the contributory role of ineffective public policies in perpetuating environmental and agricultural dilemmas within the region. In light of these findings, the research advocates for formulating sustainable policies and evidence-based solutions. Addressing these issues holistically demands a concerted effort to mitigate the adverse impacts of population dynamics on agricultural practices and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

In this paper, research is conducted on 3181 non-financial listed enterprises in the A-share market in China from 2012 to 2021. Multiple regression analysis is adopted to examine the relationship between supply chain finance and enterprise financialization, as well as the impact of the former on the latter and the underlying mechanisms at play. The research findings indicate that the supply chain finance model, led by core enterprises, tends to exacerbate enterprise financialization in China. The significant resource dependence of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on core enterprises acts as a moderating variable for supply chain finance and enterprise financialization. This dependence amplifies the stimulus of supply chain finance on the “financialization” of enterprises, demonstrates a pronounced moderating effect within state-owned enterprises, and strengthens over time when the core enterprises possess information advantages. The findings articulated herein contribute to the scholarly discourse, offering insights into the improvement of supply chain finance and the advancement of the real economy’s sustainable development via financial services. A good supply chain finance model should align with the requirements for the development of China’s real economy. It should provide not only financial assistance to enterprises but also foster a virtuous cycle within the industrial chain and encourage industrial production over financial investment.</jats:p>"

Recently some areas of Nagpur district have faced water scarcity with severe groundwater level fluctuation (GWLF). The study incorporates the dynamic behaviour of rainfall, land use/cover, fractional impervious surface (FIS), and GWLF from 2017 to 2022 along with topographical wetness index (TWI), topographical ruggedness index (TRI), lineament density, drainage density, slope, soil, and geomorphology. The study employs the geographical information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision-making approach, analytical hierarchy process, and remote sensing for spatiotemporal GWP mapping. The weighted overlay tool of ArcGIS 10.5 was used to derive final GWP maps. Critically, the northwestern part of the study area experienced major shifts in GWP, 448 km2 area has increased under the poor GWP category representing a decline in recharge probability. The safe GWP category diminished by nearly 531 km2 which exacerbates the problem whereas, high GWP showed very less changes. The most sensitive parameters are identified using an area-sensitivity approach, which reveals that TRI, slope, soil, geomorphology, rainfall, and TWI cause 35, 29, 20, 19, 11, and 11% area changes, respectively, while maximizing their weights. The validation of GWP maps shows good agreement with pre- and post-monsoon well data. The methodology and results may serve for GWP appraisal of similar regions.</jats:p>",

While certain manufacturers are adopting a pure bioenergy strategy in their production processes, others are opting for a hybrid energy approach that combines traditional energy with bioenergy. This choice is often influenced by limitations in land capacity and the developmental stage of biomass conversion technologies. This paper introduces a game-theoretic model that explores the optimal approach to achieving supply chain decarbonization by strategically selecting energy portfolios. Our findings reveal that in scenarios where the market size is small, manufacturers tend to adopt a hybrid energy strategy, particularly when the average yield of biomass is low. However, as the biomass yield increases, manufacturers lean towards a hybrid (or pure) bioenergy strategy in smaller (or larger) markets. In larger markets, the manufacturer’s energy strategies become more complex and are influenced by various factors. Our results emphasize that farmers should base their planting decisions on considerations such as available land, initial investment, and agricultural biomass yield. This paper urges manufacturers to effectively navigate the complexities of the carbon tax policy and make informed decisions that promote a sustainable energy strategy. By utilizing technological advancements, governments and manufacturers can collect and analyze data on factors such as market size, biomass yield, and carbon tax policy, ultimately working towards a more efficient, productive, and environmentally sustainable future.</jats:p>"

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted business continuity due to lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing measures. Consequently, firms adopted specific supply chain (SC) practices to effectively navigate this global crisis. Methods: This research adopted a stochastic approach based on Bayesian Networks to evaluate the implications of business continuity on firms’ decisions to embrace SC practices, focusing on omnichannel strategies, SC coordination, and technologies such as artificial intelligence systems, big data and machine learning, and mobile applications. Results: Our findings revealed that firms facing disruption in a single performance area can apply specific strategies to maintain resilience. However, multiple areas of underperformance necessitate a varied approach. Conclusions: According to our empirical analysis, omnichannel strategies are critical when disruptions simultaneously impact quality, inventory, sales, and ROI, particularly during major disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. AI and big data become vital when multiple risks coalesce, enhancing areas such as customer service and supply chain visibility. Moreover, supply chain coordination and mobile app adoption are effective against individual performance risks, proving crucial in mitigating disruption impacts across various business aspects. These findings help policy-makers and business owners to have a better understanding of how business continuity based on performance resistance to disruptions pushes companies to adopt different practices including new technologies and supply chain coordination. Accordingly, they can use the outputs of this study to devise strategies for improving resilience considering their supply chain vulnerabilities.</jats:p>"

Recognizing the centrality of cultural landscapes to human well-being, the sustainability of these landscapes hinges upon the health and stability of ecosystems that can effectively provide the required ESs. Over the long term, the sustainable supply of ESs is constrained by the potential supply of ESs. Understanding the potential supply of ESs is crucial for averting compromises to the ecosystems within a landscape. This article introduces a novel perspective on evaluating the ESs of a landscape by means of efficiency analysis. Instead of presenting the potential supply of ESs in absolute terms, we offer a comparative analysis of ESs' relative supply to associated management costs. In principle, the efficiency of Landscape Units (LUs) is defined as the ratio of the potential supply of multiple ESs to the costs associated with land use and land cover management. The resultant efficiency maps serve as hot and cold spot maps, revealing efficient ecosystem compositions that yield multiple ESs. This composition reflects management efforts, incorporating various management costs. Forests emerge as pivotal ecosystems in landscapes, delivering the most ESs at the lowest costs. These efficiency maps offer valuable insights for regional planners, enabling them to enhance the supply of ES in inefficient LUs by studying the ecosystem structure and associated costs of the most efficient LUs.</jats:p>",

Results indicate that the total volume of NRW in the urban area of Cameroon was 100.26 million m3/year, which represents 52.5% of the total system input volume. About 2 million people could be supplied by cutting Cameroon's NRW to half the present level. Findings also suggest that the water utility (Camwater) practices passive leakage control, meaning that Camwater repairs only those leaks that are visible. Reducing NRW can be achieved through leakage detection and pipe replacement, pressure management, water metering, and a program to identify, remove, and replace illegal connections.</jats:p>",

The past 20 years have seen a decrease in specific water consumption by almost half. Infill development and the fact that new projects are not designed for the existing utility lines caused an overload in many parts of water supply and wastewater discharge systems, while others became virtually non-functioning. All these factors led to increased failure rates, significant maintenance costs, inadequate hydraulic conditions, and deterioration of drinking water quality, as well as clogs and blockages in sewers. An example is group water supply systems, whose construction was very popular in the era of “developed socialism” and the post-perestroika period. Nowadays, many of them continue to operate, with no one to supply water to, as many settlements have simply ceased to exist due to migration processes. The current situation can be attributed to planning and design errors or, more precisely, the neglect of factors that exist now and will probably arise in the future. Design is known to be a process of creating an object that is yet to be realized. The object needs to be designed so that it functions in the future, and the future is not defined and has no deterministic parameters and values (the basic contradiction of design). The article proposes one of the possible approaches to resolving this contradiction; it is based on studying the zone of uncertainty and identifying minimum economic risk options.</jats:p>"

The study first applies the Fourier ADL cointegration test, which allows for soft breaks. As a result of the test, it was found that the variables have a long run relationship. In the short run, only budget revenue has a positive effect on dollarization. In the long run, the exchange rate, exports, money supply, and deposit rates have a positive effect, while inflation has a negative effect. The study also applied the Fourier-Toda-Yamamoto causality test. As a result of the test, bidirectional causality was found between exchange rate, inflation and money supply variables and dollarization. The striking result of the study is that inflation has a negative impact on dollarization. This result, which is consistent with some studies in the literature, is attributed to the money supply. Although the demand for foreign exchange increases because the money supply is higher than inflation, the dollarization index decreases. This explanation can explain the negative relationship.</jats:p>"

This paper analyzes the results of mobility trends, production rates, logistics performance, and the strategies developed by managers and decision makers of the organizations of the agro-industrial sector for supply chain configurations during the early stages of the pandemic in a food-exporting region that contributes 14% of the world’s production of agricultural and fishery products. Through a literature review of reports and scientific articles on the behavior of the pandemic published by international organizations, research centers, and researchers around the AFSC in LATAM, the impacts on logistical disruptions, configuration strategies, and disruptive technologies applied in Latin American agrifood supply chains during the lockdown are identified. As a result of this reconfiguration of the AFSC, the development of short supply chains and the digitalization of supply based on electronic commerce were the most used strategies during COVID-19 in LATAM. The results of this study show that Mexico, Chile, and Brazil maintained a prominent position as leaders in the different logistics indicators for the AFSC by developing strategies that include short supply chains and the digitalization of supplies based on electronic commerce. Finally, this study also highlights the imminent need to address new research and theories on the reconfiguration of the AFSC, which allows expanding analytical capabilities in organizations to face future risks and challenges that will enable the reconfiguration of the supply chain in the face of catastrophic scenarios such as COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Disruptions to a medical device supply chain (MDSC), including cybersecurity attacks, have increased rapidly, with some sophisticated attacks compromising the availability and operation of life-critical devices. Understanding the impact of disruptions on MDSCs is difficult due to the attendant supply chain complexity. The lack of a systematic classification of disruptions to MDSCs limits the transferability of mitigation strategies. Thus, there is a need for evidence-based, actionable policy guidance for corporations and government agencies that address disruption risks to MDSCs. This paper first presents a disruption classification scheme based on historical and anticipated disruptions to MDSCs. Then, it introduces a model, dubbed the Focal-firm Supply-chain Integrated Model (FSIM), that integrates a focal-firm view of supply chains and attendant disruptions, illustrated through an MDSC example. Based on lessons learned from constructing a disruption classification and creating an FSIM map, we describe the following actionable insights: a) implementing procedures and technologies that enable early-detection of disruptions, b) accurate and timely information flows, c) continual monitoring of physical inventory levels and comparing them with digital data, d) enhanced and repeated testing at various supply chain testing sites, e) standardized metrics that measure the impact of disruptions, f) developing in advance a preparedness strategy and a planning process to allocate resources effectively, equitably, and transparently during disruptions, and g) the need for a common framework that bridges the medical device regulatory gaps across countries. These insights can guide MDSC stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, service providers, healthcare providers, policymakers, and government agencies.</jats:p>"

Then, an evaluation index system of industry chain resilience and safety was established, which included five dimensions: the risk management level, integrity, control force, stability, and competitiveness of industry chain. Considering the resilience of China’s industry chain and the main safety difficulties faced, the evaluation system was used to measure and evaluate the supply chain resilience and safety level of China’s lighting industry chain on the basis of the specific connotations and core elements of industry chain safety. The evaluation results show that the total score of the supply chain resilience and safety level of China’s lighting industry chain is 0.92, indicating the relatively high supply chain resilience and safety level of China’s lighting industry chain. Suggestions are put forward to strengthen the management of technological innovation ability, low-carbon ability, and domestic self-sufficiency rate of input products, so as to boost the high-quality, sustainable, and rapid development of China’s lighting industry.

We studied how different grass and legume species grown in monoculture or mixture affect the growth of the subsequent maize crop and whether the legacy effects depend on external phosphorus inputs.\nMethods\n We collected microbial inoculum from a five-year experiment with nine leys, including monocultures of two grasses and two legumes, and five legume-grass mixtures in different ratios (3:7, 4:6, 5:5, 6:4, 7:3), and conducted a greenhouse experiment to explore the biotic legacy effects conditioned by these nine leys on maize growth at three P levels (0, 20, 50 mg kg<sup>− 1</sup>).\nResults\n Significant biotic legacies on biomass of maize were only observed at high P. The biotic legacies and P application interactively impacted root morphology. Maize growth in soil conditioned by alfalfa monoculture showed stronger legacy effects by enriching beneficial bacteria and reducing accumulation of pathogenic fungi than maize growth in soil from the orchard grass monoculture. However, the effects of other monocultures and mixtures did not differ significantly.\nConclusion\n Legacy effects on plant growth were proven to be ley-specific and depended on P input. These findings stress that biotic legacy effects interacted with external nutrient input have a significant role in determining the performance of subsequent crops.</p>"

The optimization of facility location-allocation inventory problems (FLAIPs) holds the key to achieving dependable product delivery with reduced costs and carbon emissions. Despite the importance of these challenges, a substantial research gap exists regarding economic, reliability, and sustainability criteria for FLAIPs. This paper aims to fill this gap by introducing a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model, focusing on configuring a reliable sustainable supply chain network. The model addresses three key objectives: minimizing costs, minimizing emissions, and maximizing reliability. A notable contribution of this research lies in elaborating on five levels of a supply chain network catering to the delivery of multiple products across various periods. Another novelty is the simultaneous incorporation of economic, environmental, and reliability objectives in the network design—a facet rarely addressed in prior research. Results highlight that varying demand levels for each facility lead to altered trade-offs between objectives, empowering practitioners to make diverse decisions in facility location allocation. The proposed mathematical model undergoes validation through numerical examples and sensitivity analysis of parameters. The paper concludes by presenting theoretical and managerial implications, contributing valuable insights to the field of sustainable supply chains.</jats:p>"

This paper discusses the decisions of battery recovery in a supply chain consisting of a supplier and a manufacturer. Utilizing the Stackelberg game, we construct relevant models and compare the equilibrium solutions in two decision-making modes, for-profit and for-CSR (corporate social responsibility). We shows that the firms’ pursuit of CSR contributes to increasing collection prices. However, if environmental damage is severe, the firms’ pursuit of CSR leads to high retail prices, which is detrimental to the sale of NEVs. Furthermore, although not all members’ collection amounts increase when considering CSR, the overall collection effect will be better. Meanwhile, we find that both the supplier and the manufacturer have incentives to practice CSR because their pursuit of CSR leads to high profits. Finally, this paper has verified all the above conclusions using theoretical data.</jats:p>"

The paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the state of knowledge on the impact of climate change on the failure of water supply infrastructure. The bibliometric analysis was performed based on the VOSviewer program. The results of the analysis indicate current research trends in this area around the world and allow the identification of strengths and weaknesses. Most research concerns the identification of factors related to the impact of climate on the failure rate of water distribution systems. A popular research topic was also the prediction of water supply network failures, taking into account the impact of climatic factors. The main research gap is determining the impact of climate change on water quality. The acquired knowledge can be used by water companies, policy-makers and other researchers to plan adaptation strategies to climate change, which pose new challenges for the operation of water supply systems.

This study concerns fluoride removal from Metlaoui's tap water by electrocoagulation (EC) using aluminum electrodes in a batch reactor. This water contains 3.5 mg·L−1 of fluoride, the highest concentration observed in these basins. The effect of the operating conditions of EC treatment on tap water defluoridation was analyzed, namely, current density, temperature and interelectrode distance. Hydroxide aluminum flocs, formed with different durations of EC, were used as sorbents in fluorinated deionized water ([F−] = 3.5 mg·L−1) and Metlaoui's tap water. Flocs formed after 30 min of EC, produced by dissolving (79 ± 1) mg·L−1 of aluminum and adjusted at pH = 6.5, allowed the adsorption of (98 ± 1)% of fluoride ions from deionized fluorinated water. Flocs adjusted at different pH, from 5 to 9, were used as sorbents in fluorinated deionized water and Metlaoui's tap water. Acidic and neutral flocs allowed the best yields of fluoride adsorption. Contrary to the literature, this work highlighted the absence of ion exchange of hydroxide anion by fluoride anion in water, highlighting a mechanism of physical adsorption on aluminum hydroxide flocs.</jats:p>",

Blockchain technology emerges as a promising solution, offering transparency, immutability, traceability, and efficiency in the overall supply chain. This study aims to investigate determinants impacting both the intention to use and the actual usage of blockchain-driven agri-food supply chain platforms. To achieve this, an expanded and adapted conceptual model rooted in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) was formulated and empirically examined through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling using data from 175 respondents from agri-food companies across eight European countries. Agri-Food Supply Chain Partner Preparedness (FSCPP) emerged as the pivotal factor with the highest degree of influence on the intention to use blockchain-driven supply chain platforms. Additionally, the results from this study offer support for the significant influence of Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), and Perceived Trust (PT) on usage intention, while also revealing the positive impact of Organizational Blockchain Readiness (OBR) on expected Usage Behavior (UB). This study provides significant insights into blockchain adoption within agri-food supply chains, contributing to the existing literature through an extended UTAUT framework.</jats:p>"

Approximately, 70% of Ghana's populace relies on groundwater exploitation for freshwater consumption. Managed aquifer recharge is capable of sustaining water resources for all livelihood activities. Underperformance of MAR systems is often due to site-specific hydrogeological conditions turning out to be less favorable than anticipated. This study evaluates the site-specific conditions for MAR sites identification in granitic aquifers, integrating in situ hydrogeological factors and GIS-MCDA. One hundred and twenty-one datasets from different boreholes comprising hydro geophysics, borehole drilling and pump test reports were used. The constraint mapping results indicate 92% suitable for MAR application within the study area, implying available enormous bare lands for flooding recharge technique. The suitability analysis discloses that 48 and 51% of the studied area fall within very high and high suitable zones, respectively, showing convincing and great potential to support infiltration ponds for MAR technology application. The valuable information provided through this study can serve as a guide for MAR implementation and for sustainable groundwater resources management within the Upper East region of Ghana.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As urbanization accelerates globally, the concept of smart cities emerges as a promising solution to address the multifaceted challenges of sustainable urban development. Smart cities leverage advanced technologies to enhance efficiency, sustainability, and quality of life for their residents. Concurrently, the evolution of supply chain management towards smart supply chains has gained traction, driven by the imperative of optimizing logistics, minimizing waste, and enhancing resilience. This paper explores the integration of smart cities and smart supply chains as a holistic approach to foster sustainable urban development. The integration of smart cities and smart supply chains presents a symbiotic relationship wherein advancements in one domain catalyze improvements in the other. Smart cities rely on seamless and efficient supply chain operations to ensure the smooth flow of goods and services, essential for meeting the needs of urban inhabitants. [1],[2] Conversely, smart supply chains benefit from the data-rich environment and infrastructure of smart cities to optimize routing, inventory management, and last-mile delivery, thereby reducing environmental impact and enhancing overall efficiency. Key components of this integration include the utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology to enable real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and transparent, secure transactions throughout the urban supply chain. By harnessing these technologies, cities can achieve significant improvements in resource utilization, energy efficiency, and carbon footprint reduction. Furthermore, the paper examines the role of public-private partnerships (PPPs) and regulatory frameworks in facilitating the integration of smart cities and smart supply chains. Collaborative efforts between government entities, industry stakeholders, and technology providers are essential to overcome barriers such as data privacy concerns, interoperability challenges, and investment constraints. In conclusion, the integration of smart cities and smart supply chains represents a promising pathway towards achieving the goals of sustainability, resilience, and prosperity in urban environments. By embracing innovative technologies and fostering collaboration, cities can pave the way for a more efficient, equitable, and environmentally conscious future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The nature of postnatal adaptation of newborns, their further growth, development, health status and quality of life largelydepend on the well-being of intrauterine development and maturity at birth. Premature birth under hypoxia causes signifi cant metabolic disorders in the body, is accompanied by a high risk of severe organ dysfunction, which requires in-depth research to clarify the features of intracellular metabolism in order to further improve methods of diagnosis and treatment of newborns with various forms of perinatal pathology.Aim of the research. To study the trends of changes in energy metabolism in premature infants with severe forms of perinatal pathology to investigate the possibility of using them as additional criteria of hypoxic damage to the body in conditions of morphological and functional immaturity.Materials and methods. Clinical and laboratory examinations were performed on 68 newborns with severe forms of perinatal pathology at the gestational age of 32 to 34 weeks; the comparison group consisted of 27 conditionally healthy newborns at the gestational age of 34 to 37 weeks. Inclusion criteria for the main study group: gestational age at birth from 32 to 34 weeks, clinical signs of severe perinatal pathology. Exclusion criteria: gestational age at birth &lt; 32 and ≥ 37 weeks, diagnosed congenital malformations and septic conditions. The list of diseases was determined according to the International Classifi cation of Diseases, X Revision. The following blood serum laboratory parameters were studied: lactate level, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) (EC 1.1.99.5), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), NADH dehydrogenase (NADH) (EC 1.6.5.3); the electron transport chain coeffi cient (ETC) was calculated. Laboratory studies were performed using micromethods. The study was conducted in accordance with the provisions of GCP (1996), the Convention of the Council of Europe on Human Rights and Biomedicine (April 4, 1997), the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association (1964-2008), Order of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine No. 690 dated September 23, 2009 (as amended by Order of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine No. 523 dated July 12, 2012). Protocol of scientifi c research of the Biomedical Ethics Committee of BSMU dated September 12, 2015. Informed written consent was obtained from the parents of the patients before the study with an explanationof the purpose, objectives and methods of laboratory testing. Statistical processing of the results was performed using STATISTICA software (StatSoft Inc., USA, version 10). Comparison of quantitative indicators with normal distribution was performed using Student’s t-test, and the probability of diff erences was considered statistically signifi cant at p&lt;0.05. The complex of studies was conducted within the framework of the planned research topics of the Department of Pediatrics, Neonatology and Perinatal Medicine of the Bukovinian State Medical University: «Improvement of the areas of prognosis, diagnostics and treatment of perinatal pathology in newborns and infants, optimization of the schemes of catamenial observation and rehabilitation» (State registration No. 0115U002768, term of execution 01.2015-12.2019) and «Chronobiological and adaptive aspects and features of vegetative regulation in pathological conditions in children of diff erent age groups» (State registration No. 0122U002245, term of execution 01.2020-12.2024).Results. In newborns of the main group, in comparison with the control group, a signifi cant decrease in GFDH and SDHwas found, which indicates a signifi cant impairment of the activity of enzymes of the respiratory chain and explains the lack of oxygen absorption in the body at the cellular and tissue level, causing the severity of the condition of newborns. Determination of the level of GPDH and SDH in the dynamics of observation in children showed some improvement in these indicators. In the severe condition of newborns, a signifi cant increase in the NADPH index was found, with a further probable increase in its level in the dynamics of observation. Calculations of ETC coeffi cient in cord blood showed a signifi cant decrease of this indicator in comparison with the control group. The identifi ed disorders of intracellular energy metabolism under hypoxia indicate the expediency of conducting comprehensive scientifi c research to study the possibilities of appropriate pharmacological correction to improve the eff ectiveness of treatment of severe forms of perinatal pathology in premature infants.Conclusions: 1. The results of the study revealed a signifi cant decrease in GPDH and SDH at elevated levels of NADPH andETC coeffi cient, which confi rms the presence of signifi cant disturbances in intracellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial oxidation processes. 2. Timely detection of metabolic disorders with the determination of mitochondrial oxidation, in particular energy metabolism, is an important area for improving diagnostic measures in severe forms of perinatal pathology in preterm infants with hypoxic damage to the body in the pathogenesis.</jats:p>"

However, the utilization of fuelwood in Africa contributes greatly to desert encroachment and consequently has implications with regard to climate change. Its, little to understand about the drivers and dynamics of fuelwood consumption in Kenya and other African countries. This study is to analyze determinants of refugee camp forest resource utilization efficiency Kakuma refugee camp Turkana county. It accomplishes two broad objectives:( 1) To analyse utilization of fuelwood from indigenous tree species supplied to the camp, the profitability of firewood supplied to the local market and a growing body of evidence on the influence of utilization of fuelwood in the camp in the refugee camp, as the host community get cash from the refugees and food ration in exchange with the resource (Fuelwood) in a household’s level. It embraced a mixed methods approach embedded with an explanatory research design for concurrent triangulation. The study interviewed a total of 296 respondents through HH questionnaires, the KII Tool and FGD Guide. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic framework approach while quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential (correlations) statistics on SPSS. Results suggest that even with minimal investment in both productive and non-productive assets (M=2.40) and SD=0.99) from cash purchase of fuelwood from agencies, there is significant negative effect (r=0.139) and P=0.05) between asset accumulation and poverty reduction among targeted household. study reveals that the provision of alternative sources of energy has the potential to reduce overdependence on wood fuel by the refugees in Kakuma Kenya. Therefore, the government ought to support other cheaper energy alternatives like alternatives gadgets and energy-saving cooking technologies, while the local administrators should integrate the refugee needs in the development plans for equal distribution of resources at large</jats:p>"

It was found out that, the yield of soybean seeds of the northern ecotype Mageva, Svetnaya and Okskaya cultivars in dark-gray forest soils of the Central Black Earth Region averaged 2.05 t/ha, the feed units per hundredweight of the yield after harvest, 2.75 t/ha, the protein content of seeds – 39.00%,  protein yield per hectare  – 0.79 t, the ratio of essential amino acids of protein seed yield – 59.43 %,  the amount of essential amino acids per hectare – 0.47 t, critical amino acid value of  total amount (lysine, methionine, tryptophan) – 12.37 % , the amount of critical amino acids – 0.099 t/ha. The fresh above-ground biomass yield during the soybean full grain formation stage (R6)  was 19.0 t/ha, the dry above-ground biomass yield was 5.63 t/ha (2.75 times higher than its value in the seed yield); the amount of fodder units of dry above-ground biomass yield was 2.92 t/ha (about 1.06 times higher than feed units in the seed yield); protein content in dry above-ground biomass – 16.5 % (2.36 times lower than its’ value in seeds), protein yield per hectare – 0.93 t (1.21 times more than protein seed yield); the content of essential amino acids in protein, contained in dry above-ground biomass did not exceed 49.10 %, it  was 1.20 times lower than its value in seeds, as a result, the amount of essential amino acids reached 0.45 t/ha, that was close to that of the seeds  yield; the content of critical amino acids in the protein did not exceed 10.26% (1.21 times less than its value in seed protein). In other words, its value reached (0.096 kg/ha), that was close to that of the seeds yield.  According to the experiment, the following mean values per unit mass, were obtained  by comparing 1 ton of seeds with 1 ton of dry above-ground biomass: the protein value was higher 2.36 times, the value of essential amino acids – 2.85 times higher, the value of critical amino acids – 2.88 times higher in seeds than in dry above-ground biomass. In all the years of research, dry above-ground biomass had advantages in terms of yield, in the amount of feed units from 1 ha, in terms of protein yield. In terms of the amount of essential amino acids  the difference turned out to be insignificant, that is, under the moisture conditions of the Central Non-Black Earth Region, the dry above-ground biomass of the northern ecotype soybean cultivars can be used as fodder just like seeds.\n </jats:p>"

In Poland, organic farming developed dynamically from the accession to the European Union until 2013 and then slowed down. This is a good reason to investigate the conditions affecting the supply side of organic food, especially that the distribution system hardly absorbs the production potential of Polish organic farming. There are few studies with in-depth analysis of relationships between farms and distributors. The research objectives adopted in this paper are the assessment of the intensity of the relations between farmers and organic food distributors. The analysis is based on desk research and the results of a survey of 120 owners of certified organic farms and 120 representatives of shops offering organic products. The results of the analysis show that there are many shops that are supplied by farmers (with a high intensity of relations with farmers) and, at the same time, few farmers selling their products to shops (with a low intensity of relations). Along with the low intensity of farmers’ relations with food processors, this is one of the main barriers to supply development.</jats:p>"

Particularly, it disturbed the entire agriculture supply chain due to a shortage of labor, travel restrictions, and changes in demand during lockdowns. Consequently, the world population faced food insecurity due to a reduction in food production and booming food prices. Low-income households face food security challenges because of limited income generation during the pandemic. Thus, there is a need to understand comprehensive strategies to meet the complex challenges faced by the food industry and marginalized people in developing countries. This research is intended to review the agricultural supply chain, global food security, and environmental dynamics of COVID-19 by exploring the most significant literature in this domain. Due to lockdowns and reduced industrial production, positive environmental effects are achieved through improved air and water quality and reduced noise pollution globally. However, negative environmental effects emerged due to increasing medical waste, packaging waste, and plastic pollution due to disruptions in recycling operations. There is extensive literature on the effects of COVID-19 on the environment and food security. This study is an effort to review the existing literature to understand the net effects of the pandemic on the environment and food security. The literature suggested adopting innovative policies and strategies to protect the global food supply chain and achieve economic recovery with environmental sustainability. For instance, food productivity should be increased by using modern agriculture technologies to ensure food security. The government should provide food to vulnerable populations during the pandemic. Trade restrictions should be removed for food trade to improve international collaboration for food security. On the environmental side, the government should increase recycling plants during the pandemic to control waste and plastic pollution.</jats:p>"

SMEs, constituting a significant portion of the global economy, have been largely overlooked in supply chain resilience literature. Faced with crises like the COVID-19 pandemic or geopolitical tensions, SMEs often adopt a wait-and-see approach, seeking to reduce uncertainty before making tangible commitments. Our proposed conceptual framework highlights strategic intelligence as a key dynamic capability to diminish uncertainty, reduce the waiting time for SMEs, and prompt them to commit tangible resources to restore balance in a new context. Three sub-capabilities of strategic intelligence are identified: supply network visibility, environmental sensing, and timely responsiveness. External moderating determinants, such as external social capital and government support, can also help overcome the limitations of SMEs&amp;#39; internal resources. This study calls for future empirical research to explore these relationships and address current gaps in the understanding of SMEs&amp;#39; supply chain resilience. It particularly encourages testing this model using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. By focusing on strategic intelligence, inter-organizational resource sharing, and government support, it provides practical insights for managers and policymakers, emphasizing the importance of enhancing SME resilience in the face of systemic disruptions. This, in turn, contributes to the resilience of our economies in an increasingly complex and uncertain world.</jats:p>"

With significant drainage water generated in the region's irrigation networks, repurposing it for soil reclamation emerges is a low-risk strategy. Leaching, a practical technique for soil desalination, was examined using the double ring method at depths up to 150 cm. Four water qualities (electrical conductivities of 2.12, 7, 25 and 40 dS m−1) and depths (0, 25, 50 and 75 cm) were tested, with intermittent leaching over three cycles. Results indicate a substantial reduction in electrical conductivity (117.7 to 29 dS m−1) and sodium content (1415.9 to 39.83 mEq L−1) at the 0-25 cm depth with drainage water incorporation. The study highlights the beneficial impact on soil quality, emphasizing decreased sodium content, sodium adsorption ratio, and electrical conductivity. Overall, reusing drainage water proves advantageous for soils with high salinity levels, showcasing its potential for sustainable soil management in saline regions. This research underscores the importance of effective drainage water management for soil reclamation and agricultural sustainability in arid regions like Khuzestan province.</jats:p>",

Dramatic events such as the collapse of glacier tongues are apparent in satellite images but oceanographic observations are insufficient to capture the synoptic impact of such events on the supply of oceanic heat to ice shelves. This study uses a 3D numerical model and semi‐idealized experiments to examine whether the current high melting rates of ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea could be mitigated by certain icescape configurations. Specifically, the experiments quantify the impacts on oceanic heat supply of presence/absence of the Thwaites Glacier Tongue, Bear Ridge Iceberg Chain, tabular iceberg B22, and fast‐ice cover seaward of Pine Island Ice Shelf (PIS). The experiments reveal that future changes in the coastal icescape are unlikely to reverse the high ice shelf melting rates of the Amundsen Sea, and that icescape changes between 2011 and 2022 actually enhanced them slightly. Ice shelves such as Crosson and Thwaites are found to have multiple viable sources of oceanic heat whose relative importance may shift following icescape reconfigurations but the overall heat supply remains high. Similarly, the formation of a fast‐ice cover seaward of PIS slows down the cavity circulation (by 7%) but does not reduce its heat supply.</jats:p>",

Using salt spray corrosion testing and cycle performance testing, we validate the film’s excellent corrosion resistance in harsh natural environments and its provision of reliable color indication. The film possesses portability and ease of attachment to various electrical devices and circuits requiring temperature sensing.

However, the influence of channel structures on the TON and TOR optimal decisions of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) is rarely discussed. To explore the impact of the implementation of the TOR program on the optimal pricing and demand strategy, enterprise profit, environment, and social welfare when the enterprise has applied the TON program, we develop four models with different power structures and market decisions to maximize enterprise profits based on consumer utility and the Stackelberg game: (1) manufacturer-led model with TON (Model M); (2) retailer-led model with TON (Model R); (3) manufacturer-led model with TON and TOR (Model TM); (4) retailer-led model with TON and TOR (Model TR). The manufacturer-led models may benefit consumers more and stimulate the replacement consumers’ demand for TON and TOR programs. Both TON and TOR demand for the Model TM are considerable. However, when the retailer is in the driver’s seat, the retailer can profit more due to government subsidies for the TOR programs. Our analysis provides insights into the choice of corporate power structures, reducing environmental impacts and improving social welfare. This paper studies for the first time the influence of different power structures and government subsidies on TON and TOR programs in CLSCs. Future research could consider the impact of old products quality or multi-period models on TON and TOR programs.</jats:p>",

In order to ensure the frequency security of the power system, this paper conducts research on the primary frequency regulation (PR) backup configuration problem of a power system containing a high proportion of wind power. First, according to the dynamic properties of the speed regulator, a system frequency response model considering the limiting link is established. And the system frequency response model is transformed into a time-domain analytical function of PR reserve capacity and frequency maximum value. On this basis, a PR backup configuration model of a power system containing a high proportion of wind power is constructed with the optimization goal of minimizing system operating costs and taking into account the limiting link constraints. It is proposed to use the L-shape algorithm to decompose the model into main problems and sub-problems, which effectively reduces the solution complexity of the model. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of this model are verified based on the improved IEEE 39-bus system.</jats:p>"

By characterizing the equilibrium operational decisions and integration choices, we provide insights into how asymmetric customer loyalty compares and price–quality competition collectively influence the equilibrium channel structure. Our findings highlight that the option for backward integration can lead to an asymmetric equilibrium channel structure, driven by disparities in customer loyalty. In cases marked by significant differences in customer loyalty and a high market demand for product quality, the manufacturer with weaker customer loyalty might unilaterally implement decentralization. This analysis illuminates scenarios where manufacturers diverge from conventional integration norms and offers valuable insights into evolving supply chain dynamics.</jats:p>",

In active mode, such a system implements a set of measures aimed at restoring the fire-safe state of the hydrogen storage and supply system after it is in a fire-hazardous state. The authors consider variants of its functioning for a highly reliable fire prevention system. The first option has the reliability of the fire inspection, which is equal to one, and the second option has the reliability of the fire inspection, which is different from one. Using graphs of the states of the hydrogen storage and supply system, we constructed systems of Kolmogorov equations and derived expressions for the probabilities of finding this system in the corresponding states. The article shows that the time to restore the fire-safe state of the hydrogen storage and supply system in the first variant should not exceed the probability of its being in a fire-hazardous state, reduced to the unit of the intensity of the transition of this system from a fire-safe state to a fire-hazardous state. In the second option, the time to restore the fire-safe state of the hydrogen storage and supply system increases following the law described by a hyperbola of the first order, the argument of which is the reliability of the fire safety inspection of such a system. We have obtained an expression for the reliability of the functioning of the fire prevention system focused on ensuring the fire safety of hydrogen storage and supply systems. We show that the reliability of the functioning of such a prevention system depends significantly on the reliability of the fire-engineering inspection of the hydrogen storage and supply system. We have also derived an expression for the time to restore the fire-safe state of the hydrogen storage and supply system that is determined a priori by the reliability of the fire prevention system functioning, the reliability of the fire inspection, and the intensity of the transition of the hydrogen storage and supply system from the fire-safe to the fire-hazardous state.\nKeywords: hydrogen storage and supply system, fire prevention, recovery time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An integrated intermodal freight transportation system is a derived demand to transport shipping containers from/to the seaport to/from the hinterland, instead of undertaking cargo loading and unloading activities in port-protected areas. The concept of the intermodal system is to transfer containers to nearby hinterland nodes, such as dry ports, inland rail, road, and river terminals as a part of port development, as well as increasing port efficiency and productivity. Lloyd’s List ranked Chattogram Port as the 67th busiest container port in the world as per container port throughput in 2022. Chattogram Port has small-scale intermodal facilities for off-docks/ICDs in the port city only. In addition, a pure intermodal system has been developed by one rail ICD in the capital city, Dhaka, and two RICTs nearby Dhaka, but less than 5 % of port throughput. A large-scale intermodal for serving the major cities, SEZs, EPZs, and industrial areas is absent due to planning and policy problems, as well as the unavailability of intermodal infrastructure and network. Due to an improper hinterland intermodal chain, the port faced container supply chain disruptions at the port yard and exceeded port capacity, resulting in container vessel congestion at the outer anchorage of Chattogram Port. By developing rail and road infrastructure, and utilizing natural river connectivity, it is possible to develop road, rail, and river intermodal systems, and shape an integrated intermodal freight transportation system to avoid container supply chain disruptions in Chattogram Port. To develop an integrated intermodal system, this research chose a quantitative research methodology for port throughput data analysis and forecasting future throughputs that are advanced to the intermodal model for Chattogram Port. Overall, this paper aims to develop an integrated intermodal freight transportation system to support Chattogram Port to keep and increase the record of port productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness actively.\nHighlights\n\nIntermodal system is a derived demand for managing hinterland and port terminals of a seaport that needs to be implemented in Chattogram Port\nContainer supply chain disruptions to be avoided to increase the port productivity and efficiency\nInland intermodal connectivity will help to increase hinterland of a seaport\nIt is necessary to develop an integrated intermodal freight transportation system to support Chattogram Port to keep and increase the record of port productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness globally\n</jats:p>"

In this concept, adaptation entails anticipating the negative financial consequences of extreme weather events and taking appropriate measures to prevent and mitigate them. As a result, insurance is a valuable adaptation measure for compensating unexpected losses and preventing financial damage from becoming long-term economic damage. We simulated indexed insurance for the Cantareira Water Supply System (CWSS). The system is responsible for providing water to 7.2 million people in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (MRSP). Our methodology consists of three steps: (1) describing the indexed variable, (2) computing economic losses depending on event magnitude, and (3) evaluating risk premiums for low, medium, and high coverage levels. According to our findings, an annual fee (premium) of USD 0.43, 0.87, and 1.73 should be charged per person to obtain drought coverage for 3, 6, and 12 months (low, medium, and high levels), respectively. These values account for 1.7 %, 3.4 %, and 6.7 % of the annual costs paid by CWSS-supplied users, accordingly. The premium fee can be incorporated into water bills as a novel technique to pool the risk between supplied users and the utility, thereby protecting them against surcharge fluctuations.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The threat of rice price inflation is increasingly having an impact on Indonesian society, especially the poor, both rural and especially urban. Several expert reviews state that the problem of rice prices continuing to rise is due to increasing rice consumption due to population growth which is not in line with the increase in rice production capacity which continues to decline, one of which is due to the conversion of agricultural land. Rice production in Central Lombok in 2020 reached 314 327.90 GKG or the equivalent of 21.6% of NTB province's rice production. Consumption: Rice consumption for the population of Central Lombok district with a population of 947,488 people multiplied by the rice requirement of 140 kg/person/year is 132,548 tons of rice per year from rice production of 178 103 tons or a surplus of 45,555 tons. However, the rice surplus condition was unable to withstand rice price inflation in early 2024, until it reached IDR 18,000 per kg. Pengadang Village, Central Praya District, Central Lombok Regency is one of the villages with the largest number of rice mills on the island of Lombok, with 10 units and has been a supplier of Bulog rice and some of it is traded to the islands of Bali and Java. This research aims to determine the difference in prices of grain and rice in the rice milling supply chain in Pengadang Village, Praya Tengah District, Central Lombok Regency. The research method uses percentage analysis of price differences and the factors that influence it. The research results show that the lowest supply chain profit is at the price of GKP grain in Merchant at 0.26% or Rp. 20/Kg GKP, and the highest profit in the GKG grain supply chain at the mill is IDR 495/Kg or the equivalent of 6.27%. The rice price profit in the rice milling supply chain is IDR. 30/Kg or equivalent to 0.30%, but there are other benefits from by-products in the form of fine bran and coarse bran amounting to Rp. 1,219/Kg GKG or the equivalent of 12.19%. The yield of GKP grain into GKG is at an average of 84.0% and the yield of GKG to rice is at an average of 64.02%, so that a rice price of IDR can be achieved. 16,000/Kg in the milling unit.</jats:p>"

Cost-effective and scalable treatment systems with the ability to reduce nutrient and other pollutant concentrations in contaminated runoff are desirable. Biofilters are passive water treatment systems that have the potential to achieve this. The Franschhoek Water Hub, a research site for nature-based solutions, features six large biofiltration cells designed to remediate runoff from an informal settlement. Due to their large size, understanding hydraulic behaviour and validating the design proves challenging. To address this, a scaled-down version of the Water Hub's biofilters was constructed to inform design criteria for purpose-built filters. The pilot-scale subsurface flow biofilter, filled with 8–11 mm aggregate stone, had an available volume of 225 L. Pulse tracer studies conducted at various flow rates demonstrated that the system approximated plug flow behaviour. Lower flow rates resulted in deeper tracer infiltration, which is crucial for maximising the distribution of nutrients within the filter bed. This research contributes to the effective design and operation of biofiltration systems, which hold promise for addressing surface water contamination issues in resource-constrained regions.</jats:p>",

Addressing this high-resolution data gap, our study introduces a novel empirical model for quantifying grain-to-straw yield, which has been used to gauge wheat straw field management practices at the city level during 2011–2015. Utilizing both statistical review and GIS-based methods, average nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) supplies from straw field management stood at 1510, 1229, and 61700 tons, respectively. Average emissions of PM<jats:sub>2.5</jats:sub>, SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, NOx, NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> due to straw burning were 367, 41, 160, 18, 165, and 70,644 tons, respectively.

Therefore, this study developed and implemented a hydraulic modeling tool, the ‘Kyema-Net model’, based on the modified Hardy Cross algorithm in Visual Basic, to simulate a hybrid WDN with the inclusion of pipe cost assessment. The model's accuracy was validated by comparing its outputs with those of EPANET 2.2 software. The Kyema-Net model and EPANET 2.2 simulation results were comparable. Considering the WDN case study, the proposed model initialized nodal inflows in proportions of 60 and 40% for any two pipes exiting the node, reducing the computational steps. The model executed three trials to achieve the final solution against four trials for EPANET 2.2. The mean absolute percentage error, coefficient of determination (R2), and root mean square error metrics for flow velocity were ∼0.00%, 1.00, and ∼0.00 m, respectively. The modified resilience index values ranged between 0.30 and 1.09. Implementing the proposed hydraulic modeling tool in designing and/or rehabilitating WDNs demonstrated compliance with numerous social-, economic-, and technological-related Sustainable Development Goals. This would assist various water sector stakeholders in the sustainable planning, operation, and management of WDNS globally.</jats:p>",

The effect of different void percentages and various water levels on the properties of porous concrete was studied. Fabricated specimens with targeted porosities of 20% and 25% were subjected to a series of tests to evaluate their compressive strength, hydraulic conductivity (permeability), and porosity. The permeability of the specimens was assessed using a falling head permeameter to ensure effective water percolation. Porosity was quantified through a volumetric method, providing insights into void content. Both cubical and cylindrical specimens were used for all tests, along with compression tests under both air-dried and oven-dried conditions. The results showed that the maximum compressive strength occurred under oven-dried conditions for both cubical (7.05 MPa, 5.58 MPa) and cylindrical (8.36 MPa, 4.81 MPa) specimens, with 20% and 25% porosities, respectively. The compressive strength was found to be low in air-dried samples and increased with higher water levels, peaking at the 40% water level. Furthermore, the porosity exhibited a significant correlation with the reduction in density, affecting the mechanical properties. For the cylindrical and cubical samples, the dry density decreased by 16.03 kg/m3 and 20.85 kg/m3 and the permeability increased by 0.41 mm/s and 0.84 mm/s, respectively, for every 1% increase in porosity. The results showcased the effect of water level variation on porous concrete properties as well as its promising ability to infiltrate water. This promotes the development of sustainable pavement systems by minimizing surface runoff and aiding groundwater recharge.</jats:p>"

The forecasted results reveal that retail salmon prices will exhibit greater unpredictability and a predicted price increase of over CAD 30 per kilogram by 2026. In addition, increased consumption of imported salmon due to BC farm closure is expected to contribute to heightened carbon emissions and result in job losses within rural and indigenous communities.

We aimed to qualitatively explore patients’ experiences with this new service. (2) Method: Adult patients (≥18 years age) who consented to participate in the Community Pharmacy Hospital Discharge and Medicines Reconciliation Service were invited for an interview within 21 days of discharge from hospital. Qualitative, one-to-one, semi-structured patient interviews were conducted by telephone and audio-recorded using Microsoft Teams®. The interview audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and underwent thematic analysis. (3) Results: Twelve patients were interviewed, evenly split by sex and with a median age of 62 years (range 36 to 88 years). Our analysis generated main five themes: patient engagement, stakeholder communication, practical factors, human factors, and comparative experiences. Many of these were interdependent. (4) Conclusions: Patients appreciated that the service ensured a quicker discharge from hospital. Good stakeholder communication, practical factors (including choice, location, and the realities of obtaining their medication from the community pharmacy), and a pre-existing and trusted relationship in their usual community pharmacy were the key factors that regulated the patient experience. Generally, patients were positive about the introduction of this new service. However, the lack of a previous relationship or trust with a community pharmacy, and previous experiences with medication supply problems were factors which had the potential to negatively impact patient experiences.</jats:p>"

To achieve the goal of reducing carbon emissions, the development of the green intelligent building materials (GIBMs) industry has become a strategic priority and major demand for the country. Government support plays a vital role in promoting the growth of the GIBMs industry. This paper utilizes evolutionary game theory and Matlab software to analyze the impact of government regulations on the development of the GIBMs industry. The research findings indicate the following. i) Appropriate government control over building materials enterprises is beneficial for the advancement of the GIBMs industry. A balance is necessary, as both excessive control and weak control hinder the industry’s development. ii) Increased financial assistance from the government to enterprises producing GIBMs has a positive influence. This support enables building materials enterprises to overcome technical barriers, drive technological innovation, and encourage construction developers to actively purchase these materials. iii) Stronger government punishment for pollutant emissions by building materials enterprises serves as a catalyst for the production of GIBMs. Stricter penalties motivate these enterprises to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. iv) Moderate to strong government investment in infrastructure has a significant impact. It prompts construction developers to actively choose and purchase GIBMs. In response to government regulations and market demand, building materials enterprises are inclined to produce these environmentally friendly materials. This study emphasizes the importance of government regulations and support in promoting the growth of the GIBMs industry. By implementing appropriate control measures, providing financial assistance, imposing punishments for pollution, and investing in infrastructure, the government can effectively encourage the development of the GIBMs industry. These measures contribute to achieving the double carbon goals and fostering a more sustainable built environment.</jats:p>"

Facilitating pollinator populations in agroecosystems could be an efficient mechanism to ensure food production, both quantitatively and qualitatively. To better understand the role of pollinators in the agroecosystems of India, we conducted an analysis of crop production based on their reliance on pollinators during the period 2010–2021. Our findings indicate that although there were no significant changes in the yearly production or cultivation area of various pollinator‐dependent crops, the average yearly rate of crop‐yield increase in pollinator‐dependent crops was notably lower than in crops that did not depend on pollinators during 2015–2021. The study highlights that a significant portion of vitamins, particularly B7, B9, C and K, and carotenoids come from pollinator‐dependent crops. The findings of this study, which highlight the considerable contribution of micronutrients originating from pollinator‐dependent crops, are consistent with results observed in the Republic of Korea. The loss of pollinator populations may result in an approximately 19% deficit in vitamin C. Although vegetables and fruits contain substantial quantities of minerals per unit weight, a significant portion of these minerals is sourced from non‐pollinator‐dependent crops, particularly cereals and pulses, owing to their abundance. We propose that pollinator‐friendly habitat management could be a sustainable solution to avoid the negative consequences associated with reduced food and nutrition arising from a lack of pollinators in agroecosystems.</jats:p>",

With projected global coal demand declining faster than global supply, a poorly anticipated and planned transition in coal producing countries would have huge local and national economic and social impacts. Identifying the vulnerabilities of specific coal producing countries and regions to this transition is important for designing appropriate policies to manage its potential local and national impacts. For this purpose, the novel Coal Transitions Vulnerability Index (COTRAVI) is developed, composed by 12 key “transition risk” and “ability to cope” indicators, for the 10 largest coal producing countries. In addition to indicators included in previous transition risks analyses such as energy and economic dependency, coal reserves, and age of coal assets, the COTRAVI includes indicators to account for the likely speed of the transition (based on simulations from the COALMOD World model), the exposure and resilience of coal producing regions, the national economic resilience, and the transition policies in place. This provides a more holistic approach to identifying and comparing the challenges of producing countries. The results show the high importance of Just Transition plans in increasing the ability to cope with the transition, as well as the need for more structural changes and targeted policy efforts in highly vulnerable countries and heavily coal-dependent regions. The COTRAVI analysis also identifies two relevant roadblocks for a globally just coal transition: high cost of capital and stranded assets risk in the coal producing countries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Amidst stakeholder demands for transparency and the recent pandemic, the inner workings of supply chains have become more visible. This visibility has shone a spotlight on workplace corporate social irresponsibility (CSI)—actions within a company's internal supply chain operations perceived to harm the well-being of its employees. At the same time, companies scrambling to recruit new talent for operations and supply chain management (OM/SCM) face dual challenges in the shortage of diverse talent and the emergence of new generations in the workforce. Research indicates that younger generations and women more broadly expect social responsibility from their employers, but it is unclear how they perceive social irresponsibility when evaluating job offers. To begin to address this gap, we draw on attribution theory and develop hypotheses that examine prospective employees’ responses to workplace CSI in supply chain operations and whether their responses vary with gender and pay. Results from a conjoint task and mixed effects models reveal that both young men and young women respond negatively to job offers from firms with pervasive workplace CSI across their supply chain operations and atypical levels of workplace CSI relative to other firms. Although we do not find gender differences in general, supplementary analyses offer more nuanced insights (e.g., young men respond less favorably than young women when workplace CSI is pervasive, whereas young women respond more favorably than young men to above-average pay). Overall, our study advances understanding of the spillover effects of workplace CSI on new talent recruitment and highlights that the new generation's preferences run deeper than traditional gender-based expectations. In doing so, we offer timely guidance for executives and human resource managers as companies struggle to recruit diverse new OM/SCM talent. </jats:p>"

This transformation usually leads to an increase in topological complexity, which in turn results in increased operational complexity. Existing approaches from the field of supervisory and optimal control are capable of mastering complex operational problems. However, due to the complex and non-transparent implementation, there is still no industrial penetration, which hinders the necessary transformation of energy systems. This work aims at establishing trust in these control approaches and presents a procedure model for the systematic development of application-oriented operating strategies for industrial energy heating systems. It combines research approaches from the fields of sequencing control and approximate MPC to extract rule-based operating strategies, which are inherently easy to understand and implementable. By splitting the procedure model into five phases, expert knowledge can be integrated in a targeted manner. The procedure model is validated by the exemplary application to an industrial heating supply system. As part of an optimization study, the operating strategy developed is compared with both an MPC strategy and a baseline strategy. While the conventional MPC approach represents the upper limit of optimality, the operating strategy developed is able to achieve comparable results. Compared to the baseline strategy, a relative reduction in operating costs of 5.4% to 37.0% is achieved.</jats:p>"

To fulfill standards and customers’ requirements regarding the conditions under which cold supply chain products (mainly foods and pharmaceuticals) are stored (in warehouses) and transported to the end-users, tracking those conditions is a necessity. To ensure a high level of visibility, fostering emerging technologies can improve the quality of service in supply chains in terms of delivery time, cost, and quality. In this paper, a global framework for monitoring the conditions of storage and transportation of cold products across the whole supply chain is designed and implemented practically. The proposed solution is built around low-cost and low-energy consumption devices such as sensors and microcontrollers which are connected to cloud storage to allow a high level of visibility in the supply chain allowing all parties, including the end-consumers, to follow the products during their transfer, providing a conceptual framework that monitors the performance on a real-time basis and enhances decision making. A prototype using an embedded temperature/humidity sensor, a tiny microcontroller equipped with a Wi-Fi connectivity device, and a mobile 4G/5G network is designed and implemented. The proposed system is connected to a cloud-storage platform continuously accessible by the main parties of the cold supply chain including the provider, the transporter, and the end-consumer. The proposed framework may be handled as a smart contract during which any party can assume its responsibility for the assurance of the best conditions of the supply chain operation. A small-scale real-life scenario conducted in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia is introduced to show the feasibility of the proposed framework.</jats:p>"

The results showed that the SWAP model well-simulated potato yield and water productivity. The model slightly overestimates the potato yield and underestimates the water productivity. The results revealed that irrigation scheduling is an important factor effecting on evapotranspiration, yield, and water productivity of potatoes. By decreasing irrigation water to 50% WR, potato evapotranspiration and yield decreased in all three study areas. However, potato water productivity increased in Fariman and Golmakan and decreased in Ghoochan, as irrigation volume decreased to 50% WR. In Fariman and Golmakan, irrigation at the rate of 80% WR led to the best irrigation management to have maximum water productivity (2.96 and 2.48 kg m−3, respectively) and acceptable potato yield (21,376.2 and 10,998.7 kg ha−1). In Ghoochan, by adopting the irrigation scenario at the level of 90% WR, the potato yield decreased by approximately 7.6% compared to the full irrigation conditions. However, the highest amount of water productivity (2.27 kg m−3) was achieved.</jats:p>",

The semipermeability of the two layers allows for a dynamic exchange between the SCF system and its environment. The first layer is the capacity to selectively enable or control the entry and access of certain actors and practices into the SCF system. The second layer is a capacity for ongoing scrutiny of the SCF operation and its development. Further, we identify five aspects of governance to be enabled, i.e. enhancing adaptability, building confidence, improving efficiency, advancing technology and promoting transparency; and four aspects to be controlled, i.e. preventing abuse of power, curbing fraud risk, constraining operational risk and restricting risky extensions to SCF practices.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Our dynamic framework can guide supply chain (SC) members in making decisions about whether to participate, or continue to operate, in an SCF relationship.

We find that financial development can significantly affect housing prices in the long run. We confirm the robustness of our results by conducting a lag sensitivity analysis of selected determinants.

It allowed us to formulate the purpose of the study in this development. This topic is relevant since the efficient organisation of containerised supply logistics can improve the functioning of transport systems. An effective way to reduce the cost of supplying a cargo unit is efficient resource use (railway stations, ports, warehouses, wagons, vehicles, containers). The study paid considerable attention to developing the relevant infrastructure, solving specific problems of efficient use of all types of resources, using digital technologies, and building reliable models of logistics supply systems. The article builds a structural model based on the principles of logistics interaction of possible participants in the supply process, representing the interaction of subsystems that significantly affect the quality of the relevant operations. We formed five schemes of interaction between logistics participants for supplying specialised vehicles in containers with the participation of automobile, railway, and sea transport and the relevant infrastructure. These schemes identify the main ports of departure in the United States (New York and Houston) and ports of destination in Europe (Klaipeda (Lithuania), Constanta (Romania)), and take into account the possibility of using road and rail transport resources in European countries and Ukraine. We developed a mathematical model of logistics functioning for the supply of specialised vehicles in containers from North American enterprises to Ukraine, which accounts for the specifics of sequential operations and the peculiarities of determining the performance indicators of each supply chain operation. The prospect of using these models is to build a simulation model of logistics for the supply of specialised vehicles in containers from North American companies to Ukraine, conduct simulations using a software environment, and determine the rational option under the established conditions.\nKeywords: model, logistics, supply, vehicles, international transportation.</jats:p>",

The study purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental program of training means aimed at stimulating reactions of aerobic energy supply of athletes who are part of Ukraine national rugby union team.\nMaterial and methods. The athletes of the Ukrainian national rugby union team were divided into two homogeneous groups (experimental and control) consisting of 15 individuals. The experimental group underwent a specialized program aimed at developing aerobic energy supply, whereas the control group followed a standard training program. The object of study focused on the training process of Ukraine national rugby union team.\nResults. The results of testing rugby players in the experimental group demonstrated reliable changes in reactions of aerobic energy supply under the influence of a program of special training sessions. The most significant alterations were noted in the indicators of kinetics and stability of reactions. The indicators of O2 consumption and pulmonary ventilation in the intensity zone of anaerobic metabolism threshold increased significantly. There was a tendency to increase indicators characterizing the power of the respiratory response (max VE), in particular under conditions of growing fatigue (% excess VE). However, there were no significant changes in indicators of aerobic capacities components in the athletes’ control group.\nConclusions. We believe that the mentioned indicators mostly reflect specialized manifestations of rugby players’ aerobic capacities and impact the increase of athletes’ special functional capabilities.  This has been confirmed by the results of the analysis of urgent adaptive responses registered in model conditions of competition activity. As a result of the implementation of the specified experimental programme during the preparation process, the Ukrainian national team achieved 2nd place at the European Rugby Union Championship in the Trophy division of the 2022-2023 season.</jats:p>"

The analysis was conducted on the three largest valleys in the region, namely Horan, Al-Gadaf, and Al-Ubyad. The potential hydropower system, a small hydropower turbine set up on the bottom outlet of a small dam that operates as a penstock, includes developing water-harvesting systems in the dams in these valleys that can distribute water for agricultural and domestic purposes in the local community. The average expected head for dams in the study area is low, i.e. between 1.6 m and 31.5 m, while the median and mode are 11.5 m and 14 m, respectively. A return period-power generated curve is developed to demonstrate the probability and potential energy that can be generated. The potential hydropower based on rainfall in a (100-year return period) is 30 MW, 5.8 MW, and 4.3 MW for the Horan, Al-Ubyad, and Al-Gadaf catchment areas, respectively. Theoretically, these small hydropower plants are capable of serving up to 30,000 houses in the Horan catchment. Horan valley has the highest potential owing to its high storage capacity and large slope in the mainstream of the catchment and because the catchment area lies within the upper rainfall line in the western region of Iraq. Overall, the hydropower plants bring significant benefits to the area, including a constant water supply for domestic and agricultural uses, which would support the economic and social development of the region.</jats:p>"

As one of the largest palm oil producers, Malaysia has an abundance of palm oil biomass, but the biomass has high humidity, low energy density, and is scattered geographically. Establishing collection facilities with pretreatment operations is suggested to collect the biomass and improve its quality. Nevertheless, the facility placement and vehicle routing decisions significantly affect the total cost and operational efficiency. Hence, this study develops a model to address the location-routing problem and quantifies the pretreatment operation to customize the process in the biomass supply chain. This research also addresses sustainability from all dimensions through multi-objective optimization. The model minimizes costs, reduces negative social impacts by considering population densities, and measures environmental performance through CO2 emissions. The study first optimized each objective function separately and then conducted a multi-objective optimization using a weighted sum approach. Optimizing each objective function individually will achieve the best outcome for each dimension, but enhancing one objective would impair the others. However, multi-objective optimization shows some compensation for the performances where economic, social, and environmental indicator values decreased by 0.36%, 6.58%, and 15.28%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the model adjusts the locational and routing decisions based on different goals.</jats:p>"

We describe the strengths and challenges of implementing a pharmacist-only NVP supply option in Australia. Compared with the current prescription-only model, pharmacist-only supply could increase access to a lower exposure nicotine product in a highly regulated therapeutic context while addressing youth access and purchasing for non-therapeutic use, reduce demand for illicit products for smoking cessation purposes and avoid overburdening medical services with consultations to obtain NVP prescriptions. This approach can also accommodate current government goals such as eliminating NVP advertising, youth-focused branding and supply from grocery and convenience stores.</jats:p>"

Cash disbursement is a resource component that is very important in implementing programs for development planned by a local government. Supply Money is a work advance in a certain amount given to the Expenditure Treasurer (BP) to finance the daily operational activities of the Work Unit or to finance expenses which, according to their nature and purpose, are not possible to do through a direct payment mechanism. The goal to be achieved by researchers is to evaluate the application of systems and accounting procedures for cash disbursements using supply money (UP) at the South Halmahera Regency Social Service by Minister of Home Affairs Regulation (Permendagri) No. 77 of 2020. The method of analysis in this study is descriptive qualitative analysis. The results of the study show that the System and Procedures for Supply Money (UP) at the South Halmahera Regency Social Service Service are not by Minister Of Home Affairs Regulations Number 77 of 2020 concerning Technical Guidelines for Regional Financial Management, because there are several procedures, namely procedures for Warrants for Paying Supply Money (SPM-UP) and procedures Inappropriate Warrant for Disbursement of Supply Funds (SP2D-UP) and no Verification Letter from the Financial Administration Officer (PPK-SKPD) attached.</jats:p>"

Unlike petrochemical plants that use crude oil, biorefineries often have to deal with the uneven spatial‐temporal distribution of feedstock supply. The modular production strategy provides more flexibility in chemical manufacturing by allowing fast capacity expansion and unit movement. However, modeling and optimizing modular biomass supply chain under uncertainties becomes challenging due to high dimensionality and the existence of discrete decisions. This work optimizes the multiperiod biomass supply chain using the rolling horizon planning and two‐stage stochastic programming framework. We then applied generalized Benders decomposition to reduce the computational complexity of the stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming supply chain optimization. Furthermore, the solution of the stochastic programming could be used to quantitatively describe the life‐cycle assessment uncertainties of the biomass supply chain performance, demonstrating seasonality and random variability.</jats:p>",

Inefficiencies in the supply chain can disrupt access, prompting this investigation into stockout factors at an SDS in Maharashtra, India. Objectives: Study investigates the drug supply chain at the State Drug Store (SDS). Measure the stock situation for second-line anti-TB drugs at the SDS. By analyzing stakeholder perspectives, the study will explore factors contributing to gaps invloved. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2023 to January 2024 in one of three State Drug Stores (SDS) located in Maharashtra, India. Maharashtra has 3 SDS and to ensure anonymity, the SDS involved in the study are labeled as SDS1.  Five-year retrospective data of the TB drug supply chain from the Central TB Division website (quantitative) and primary data rom stakeholders (interviews, document review, TB program survey) were analyzed using Power Query (quantitative) and thematic analysis (qualitative) to identify trends, challenges, and stakeholder perspectives. Results: The key findings of the study are stockouts of medicines, expiry of drugs and delay in disposal of expired drugs, insufficient fund allotment for local purchases, and inadequate quantities received from the Central TB Division (CTD). Conclusion: State Drugs State in total has been maintained well and it is crucial to recognize the ongoing efforts of the SDS to navigate these difficulties and ensure patient access to vital medications. Moving forward, implementing the proposed solutions like demanding funds from higher authorities to start local purchases can strengthen the SDS's ability to provide uninterrupted access to essential medications.</jats:p>"

To support these activities, an allocation of domestic water needs of 200 liters second -1 is needed. The potential availability of water in the Pengga Reservoir is planned to be a source of domestic water needs in the Mandalika Special Economic Zone. Pengga Reservoir has an effective storage volume of 17.26 MCM. Potential water resources in Pengga Reservoir are obtained from reservoir outflow upstream and lateral inflow from several tributaries. The study was carried out to determine the reservoir storage capacity to meet domestic water needs and irrigation water needs covering an area 3189 ha. The cropping pattern used in the Pengga irrigation area is Paddy – Paddy/Secondary Crops – Paddy/Secondary Crops. To optimize the potential of water resources in the Pengga Reservoir, a linear programming optimization method is used. Indicators of the success of optimization calculations are indicated by the value of cropping intensity, k factor and reliability that have met the minimum limit value. The k factor value for irrigation water needs is 0.70 and domestic water needs is 0.85. Based on the optimization results, it is known the largest annual cropping intensity value occurs in the November I planting season. This conclusion can be seen from the comparison of annual cropping intensity values for the November I and November II planting schedules for the dry year inflow discharge scenario of 99.98% and 97.22% respectively. The cropping intensity value in the November I planting season is greater than November II, namely 100% and 97.25%, for the normal year discharge inflow scenario. This study provides an information for policy makers can use the November I planting schedule to obtain values for maximum cropping intensity and domestic water requirements.</jats:p>"

We offer three lenses that potentially broaden the scope of this scholarship: justice, paradox, and dialectical. The justice logic frames DEI as primarily a moral concern of inequality in firms and supply chains. It goes against an instrumental, performance-driven approach to establishing DEI in OSCM. To understand the persistence of tensions in DEI implementation, we present a paradox lens and link it to OSCM through four major types of organizational paradoxes: performing, organizing, learning, and belonging. We employ a dialectical perspective to resolve these tensions and combine instrumental and justice logics to explore how the latter can help firms realize DEI's (often unfulfilled) performance potential. OSCM scholars are well placed to use justice, paradox, and dialectical lenses to assess pathways for realizing DEI's transformative potential through modeling, decision support, and empirical research. Such research can help managers pursue objectives that conflict with or go beyond instrumental DEI, thus contributing to substantive DEI implementation. </jats:p>"

This paper delves into the economic theory underpinning digital transformation in supply chain optimization and explores its practical impacts on businesses and industries. In terms of economic theory, we examine the evolution from traditional supply chain models to digitally-enabled ecosystems. The integration of digital technologies such as big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain revolutionizes supply chain dynamics, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and mitigating risks. Drawing on game theory applications, we elucidate strategic interactions among supply chain stakeholders and the implications of digital transformation on their decision-making processes. Turning to practical impacts, we investigate how digital transformation enables enhanced visibility, real-time tracking, and predictive analytics, fostering agility and responsiveness in supply chain operations. Automation and AI-driven insights empower decision-makers to optimize resource allocation and mitigate disruptions effectively. Through case studies, we illustrate the tangible benefits and strategic advantages accrued by organizations embracing digital transformation.\r\nHowever, this transformation is not devoid of challenges. Cybersecurity threats, data privacy concerns, and the integration complexities of legacy systems pose significant hurdles. Addressing these challenges necessitates a holistic approach encompassing technological innovation, regulatory frameworks, and workforce development. Looking ahead, future trends such as blockchain integration, IoT applications, and sustainability initiatives promise further advancements in supply chain optimization.

Employing a systematic literature review coupled with content analysis, this research scrutinizes scholarly articles and case studies across various databases, focusing on the period from 2000 to 2024. The methodology hinges on precise inclusion and exclusion criteria to distill relevant literature, which is then subjected to rigorous content analysis to identify prevailing themes and insights. Key findings reveal that strategic HR practices, including talent management, training and development, and leadership cultivation, are central to embedding sustainability and ethical considerations into supply chain operations. These practices not only foster a culture of sustainability and ethics but also drive organizational change towards more sustainable supply chain models. The review identifies a dual challenge for sustainable supply chain management: the complexity of global supply chains and the increasing demands for transparency and ethical conduct, presenting both significant challenges and opportunities for innovation. Finally, the study underscores the critical role of HR in sustainable and ethical supply chain management, highlighting the necessity of integrating sustainability into HR practices. Strategic recommendations for organizations and HR professionals are provided to navigate the evolving landscape of supply chain sustainability. The study calls for further research into the dynamic interplay between HR practices and supply chain sustainability, particularly in the context of emerging technologies and global supply chain complexities.</jats:p>"

Companies can differentiate themselves by offering superior customer service. Therefore, pharmaceutical distributors need to optimize route distribution for efficient and effective delivery to pharmacies, enhancing their competitiveness. In the field of operations research (OR), efficient route optimization is a significant function of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) where the goal is to find the optimal distance travelled. The VRP can be solved using a range of algorithms, comprising exact methods, heuristics and meta-heuristics. This paper gives the basic concepts of some algorithms and these algorithms are compared based on the results. This study also extends its focus to the variation known as the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), that closely mirrors real-world scenarios, allowing for a more practical assessment of pharmaceutical distribution challenges and optimization solutions.</jats:p>",

In the Upper Skagit River, Washington, USA, introduction of anadromous salmonids above three high-head dams was proposed; however, the proliferation of invasive redside shiner Richardsonius balteatus fundamentally altered reservoir food web interactions, presenting potential challenges for the growth and production of introduced anadromous salmonids. By combining empirical measurements of zooplankton availability and temporal patterns in thermal structure of the reservoir with bioenergetics model simulations to quantify the rearing capacity of Ross Lake, we estimated the lake could support millions of sockeye salmon fry entering in spring after accounting for temporal consumption demand by the existing planktivore community dominated by redside shiner. The initial fry estimates varied according to the expected fry-to-smolt survival rate, and whether salmonids would be thermally restricted from prey in the epilimnion. This translated to estimates of 189,000 to 285,000 smolts leaving the following spring, and 7700 to 11,700 returning adults, using mean fry-to-smolt and smolt-to-adult survival rates from a nearby sockeye salmon population. We also estimated that predation potential could pose substantial mortality for lake-rearing sockeye or Chinook salmon, although it is expected to play a lesser role in limiting survival of species that only migrate through the reservoir. These results provide a case study and framework for examining bottom-up and top-down food web processes that influence growth and survival of introduced anadromous salmonids in reservoir habitats, thus guiding the direction of future feasibility studies in Ross Lake and other regulated rivers where introduction programs are considered.</jats:p>"

One of the most critical challenges in such crises is meeting the blood requirement, as an efficient and reliable blood supply chain is indispensable. The perishable nature of blood precludes the establishment of a reserve stock, making it essential to minimize shortages through effective approaches and designs. In this study, we develop a mathematical programming model to optimize supply chains in post-crisis scenarios using multiple objectives. Presented model allocates blood to various demand facilities based on their quantity and location, considering potential situations. We employ real data from a case study in Iran and a robust optimization approach to address the issue. The study identifies blood donation centers and medical facilities, as well as the number and locations of new facilities needed.

This challenge becomes increasingly higher with increasingly competitive business competition which causes perishable products to become increasingly diverse and of high quality. Even though MSMEs face problems related to business innovation, especially in perishable products. So MSMEs need a perishable product business strategy to increase competitive advantage. The main purpose of this article is to integrate the perishable supply chain model for micro, small and medium enterprises. So that the implementation of the perishable supply chain model can be carried out well. This research method used a qualitative approach by conducting in depth interviews with twelve owners of MSMEs. Validation of the data in this study is shown by observing selected informants for cross-checking and validating the data. The analysis technique in this study uses MAXQDA software. The results of this study are that integration of each existing business function in a model, namely a perishable food supply chain, is very much needed. Perishable food supply chain integration is based on the perishable supply chain process, cost strategy and environmental and product safety analysis. The perishable supply chain process consists of production, shipment, processing, shipment, storage, distribution and demand markets. From the results of the coding system, it is also known that the distribution factor makes the largest contribution to the success of implementing the perishable food supply chain model. This supply chain model for perishable food for MSMEs is in accordance with the second <jats:italic>sustainable development goals</jats:italic> (SDGs), where problems related to hunger, malnutrition, and food security can be overcome well if this model is implemented in MSMEs. This research is in accordance with the eighth SDGs, where the hope is that MSMEs can increase decent work and sustainable economic growth. For further research, there needs to be integrated cooperation between various parties using the quadruple helix principle. So that MSMEs with perishable businesses can increase their competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

Increasing consumer demand for safer, eco-friendly, and sustainably produced fresh products has highlighted the importance of sustainability in FFSC. This growing focus poses challenges for academics and practitioners dedicated to sustainable development and meeting evolving consumer expectations. FFSC management is notably complex due to unique factors such as varying perishability, seasonal production, and the need for adherence to safety and quality standards, amidst complex and diverse networks. Despite its critical role, a structured approach to navigating FFSC sustainability challenges is lacking. Our research undertakes a thorough two-stage examination of current scholarly work to identify key factors affecting FFSC sustainability. Initially, we reviewed 182 papers on broader FFSC management to gauge the field's research landscape, guiding a focused review. Subsequently, a detailed analysis of 39 papers specifically on FFSC sustainability led to the development of a comprehensive framework, comprising FFSC characteristics, entities, management practices, and enabling factors. This framework aims to enhance understanding and guide efforts by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers towards fostering sustainability in FFSC, thereby supporting the achievement of SDGs.</jats:p>"

In order to meet the needs of materials in Shanxi Province, it is urgently necessary to establish a reserve and supply system with perfect facilities and equipment. According to the geographical location of 11 prefecture-level cities in Shanxi Province and the actual situation of transportation equipment, this paper simulates the location of warehouse construction in each city. Through simulation modeling, the emergency epidemic prevention materials reserve and supply system of prefecture-level cities in Shanxi Province was simulated under the epidemic situation. The research idea of \"simulation-analysis-optimization-summary\" was defined, and the AnyLogic software was used to simulate and analyze the emergency epidemic prevention materials reserve and supply system of the whole Shanxi Province. Through the simulation of different scenarios, the optimization direction of transportation equipment is obtained. Based on the optimization effect of each plan of transportation equipment loading on the emergency epidemic prevention materials reserve and supply system in Shanxi Province, the best optimization plan was obtained. The results show that the efficiency of transportation equipment allocation is improved and the loading capacity of transportation equipment is reasonable and effective. After optimization, the order backlog of each prefecture-level city storage warehouse is reduced, and the order processing time is reduced. The optimization ideas proposed in this paper provide the optimization direction for the emergency epidemic prevention materials reserve and supply system in Shanxi Province, and also have certain guiding significance for how to deal with major public health emergencies.</jats:p>"

The main components of the CFF are the Account Receivables (AR), Account Payables (AP) and Working Capital (WC). The focus of this work is on AR, in particular on how they contribute to the overall cash flow forecasting. The prediction of AR is based on the predicted payment date of each invoice, which can be obtained from the time to payment given the issue date. In this context, we propose the use of discrete survival methods for predicting the time to payment of issued invoices. To obtain more accurate predictions for time to payment, we fit a generalized linear mixed effects model with a time-varying baseline hazard function. This approach provides greater precision for subsequent account receivables predictions compared to the prediction based on simply the payment terms of each invoice, standard time series and classification models, and continuous-time survival methods. We demonstrate the approach on two financial data sets.</jats:p>"

Also in combination with other renewable heat sources, such as solar thermal or heat pumps, a climate-neutral heat supply for districts or even complete cities can be realised. This paper deals with the analysis of different climate-neutral heat supply concepts that were elaborated for a district heating system currently in the planning phase using deep geothermal heat as the primary heat source, located in the town of Graefelfing near Munich, Germany. The authors present, discuss and assess various options regarding renewable heat sources and including (seasonal) thermal energy storage, to fully cover the thermal loads of a new district heating system in a technically, economically and environmentally favourable way. As a result of this study, a heat supply concept was selected, in which a heat pump using the return flow of the deep geothermal circuit as a heat source maximises the utilisation of the available deep geothermal heat source to cover more than 95 % of the annual heat demand by deep geothermal heat combined with a heat pump.</jats:p>"

To improve the efficiency of forced-air precooling and ultimately contribute to energy sustainability for postharvest storage of fresh produce, we designed three alternative air supply systems, simulated their cooling performances over a 96 h precooling process in a cold storage facility storing Chinese cabbages, and then compared their performances with a conventional design. All models were developed on a large scale on the basis of validated computational fluid dynamics models. The horizontal air supply scheme shortened the seven-eighths cooling time by 18.8%, and its maximum cooling rate increased by 19.7% compared to the conventional air supply scheme. The seven-eighths cooling time under another alternative design, the vertical air supply scheme, was 9.4% lower than the conventional, with the maximum cooling rate increasing by 10.5%. However, the maximum cooling rate of the last alternative design, the perforated ceiling air supply system, was 6.6% less than the conventional scheme, resulting in a 6.3% longer seven-eighths cooling time. The heterogeneity index of temperature implied that the horizontal air supply offered better overall cooling uniformity than the other designs, which can be attributed to its evenly distributed airflows and well-organized air movement paths, based on the combined analysis of temperature contours and air velocity contours at selected planes. Our findings are expected to provide practical guidelines for the refinement of the air supply system to improve its energy sustainability in forced-air precooling.</jats:p>"

Empirical analysis of tunnel parameters using three rock classification systems, rock mass rating (RMR), rock quality tunneling index, and rock mass index (RMi). Based on the classification, the rock quality was found to be fair, indicating favorable rock properties. The Q-system rated the rock as poor to fair, suggesting low discontinuity intensity, medium rock strength, or medium deformation modulus. According to the RMi, rock was rated as medium to strong, indicating low discontinuity intensity, high rock strength, or low deformability. The support design for the tunnel is based on empirical analysis, it recommends support design for the tunnel reinforcement elements such as rock bolts, wire mesh, and shotcrete lining. Overall, the tunnel is stable and does not have complex structure and weak zones.</jats:p>",

Using the Diffusion of Innovation Theory as a framework, the study investigates the adoption and influence of blockchain technology on ethical sourcing practices and supply chain transparency. Regression analysis was conducted using data from 153 firms in the agricultural and cocoa sectors to explore the relationships between blockchain technology usage, ethical sourcing, supply chain transparency, adoption of new technologies, and corporate social responsibility. The results highlight the significant influence of blockchain technology adoption on supply chain transparency and ethical sourcing practices in the cocoa and agricultural sectors. Specifically, companies that utilize blockchain technology tend to have more transparent supply chains and are more likely to engage in ethical sourcing compared to those that do not. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that the use of technology, particularly blockchain, is a strong predictor of increased transparency, with positive correlations observed across all industries. These findings illustrate the potential of blockchain technology to enhance ethical sourcing methods and supply chain transparency in Ghana's cocoa and agriculture industries. It is recommended that both public and private corporations consider investing in technology adoption, particularly blockchain technology, as it has the potential to improve ethical sourcing practices.</jats:p>"

The performance indicators were assigned weights using the Analytical Hierarchy Process in Expert Choice Software. The performance achievements were marked using the traffic light system method, and an Action Plan was suggested for the company to improve its performance.\nFindings: The present study found 17 performance indicators consisting of 4 Plan performance attributes, 5 Source performance attributes, 3 Make performance attributes, 2 Deliver performance attributes, 2 Return performance attributes, and 1 Enable performance attribute. The weighting of each indicator resulted in the weight values for each activity from highest to lowest order, namely, Plan (0.317), Enable (0.297), Deliver (0.225), Source (0.95), Make (0.44), and Return (0.22). The performance measurement using a scoring system with the \"larger is better\" method and marking achievements through the traffic light system resulted in the company's aggregation value of 78%, indicating that the company still needs improvements in its supply chain service process even though the company's performance achievement is quite good.\nOriginality: This research presents a new perspective on using SCOR-based performance measurement in service companies to become the basis for strategic decision-making and lead companies to achieve their competitive capabilities.\nPractical/Policy implication: The SCOR framework in every company business activity will provide a comprehensive view of the service supply chain as evaluation material for the company's service supply chain.</jats:p>"

Using global, firm-level supply network data, we estimate a country’s exposure to direct and indirect economic losses caused by the failure of a company in another country. We show the network of international systemic risk-flows. We find that rich countries expose poor countries stronger to systemic risk than vice-versa. The risk is highly concentrated, however, higher risk levels are not compensated with a risk premium in GDP levels, nor higher GDP growth. Our findings put the often praised benefits for developing countries from globalized production in a new light, by relating them to risks involved in the production processes. Exposure risks present a new dimension of global inequality that most affects the poor in supply shock crises.</jats:p>"

Its application in animal feed requires careful consideration of the composition and potential impact. The Indonesian Ulema Council issued a Fatwa regarding the Law on Livestock Animals Fed with Unclean Items. From a Sharia perspective, the feed composition is crucial, since it needs to be free from unclean ingredients to prevent animals from becoming classified as Al-Jallalah (Livestock Animals Fed with Unclean Items). To ensure compliance with the religious guidelines, it is necessary to implement a quarantine (Al-Istibra) or purification period (Istihalah). Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the halalan thayyiban supply chain in the management of blood from slaughtering ruminants (cattle), poultry (chicken), and pig for feed. Implementation of good practices in managing blood from slaughterhouses was assessed. The suitability of feed labels, including the presence of prohibited ingredients, adherence to good practices, and the application of Al-Istibra or Istihalah in cattle and chicken farms, as well as catfish farming units, was evaluated through questionnaire interviews and conformity scores. The results showed that 2 out of 7 (seven) objects received lower scores due to the limited effectiveness of the Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs) and unclear regulations regarding the use of blood. Based on the suitability value of the feed label, 1 (one) out of 8 (eight) objects received a lower score for failing to meet technical requirements. The feed was contaminated, and there were no operational procedures for implementing Al-Istibra or Istihalah.</jats:p>"

However, a challenge called “spillover” can hinder the incentive for green co-creation by these firms. This paper examines the spillover issue in a dual-channel structure, where downstream firms implement co-creation with customers for green product development. Our findings indicate that spillover from green investments can negatively impact the investing firm’s profits. However, in low-competition scenarios, spillover benefits the supplier and customers within the supply chain. Additionally, under specific circumstances, it can improve overall supply chain performance. Crucially, to safeguard the sustainability of green co-creation in supply chains and prevent detrimental co-destruction, we propose implementing revenue-sharing contracts that can generate Pareto improvements, benefiting all green supply chain members. As a result, unlike traditional intellectual property protection, which hinders spillover, this study offers an alternative strategy that is also somewhat complementary, promoting collaboration over restrictions to leverage the positive aspects of spillover.</jats:p>"

This study reviews and examines the content of 102 relevant papers to discuss the mathematical models, modeling approaches, and solutions that have been explored in the existing literature on forward sustainable supply chain network design. This paper also investigates the sustainability elements and supply chain network peculiarities including design factors and decision levels. In this review, several limitations in the current literature on sustainable supply chain network design optimization models are highlighted. According to the analysis, it was found that a better understanding of the industry and its sustainability requirements and priorities is essential for designing sustainable supply chain networks that are tailored to the needs of a specific industry rather than achieving general sustainability objectives. In addition, integrating strategic, tactical, and operational decision levels in the design of supply chain networks is critical for evaluating their impact on each other in terms of sustainability. More sophisticated mathematical solution methods for dealing with real-life scenarios including nonlinearity and uncertainty sources are required. The paper concludes with new prospects of research to promote a better integration of sustainability into supply chain networks.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Numerous uncertainties exist in various electricity power system problems due to the size, complexity, geographical distribution, and influence of unforeseen events in these systems, making it difficult for traditional mathematics tools based on crisp set theory to have an impact on and solve many power system problems. As a new branch of mathematical uncertainty techniques, the neutrosophic expert systems approach has therefore emerged with the development of electric power systems and has proven successful when correctly linked. The expert typically uses ambiguous or neutrosophic language to describe their empirical knowledge, such as \"very likely,\" \"quite likely,\" \"if x is large, then y is very likely to occur,\" \"x should not be less than a,\" etc. To design an optimal radius of power supply in the electrical transformer substation, this article presents a new method for creating primal and dual neutrosophic geometric programming problems. It also provides a numerical example to evaluate the approximate optimal economic power supply radius.</jats:p>"

The FMCG sector serves as a critical component of both economies, contributing significantly to GDP and employment. However, stark differences in infrastructure, consumer behavior, and regulatory environments between Africa and the USA necessitate tailored approaches to business and supply chain management. Drawing on empirical data and case studies, this study examines key elements of successful FMCG models in each region, including distribution networks, inventory management, technology adoption, and market dynamics. It explores how factors such as urbanization, income levels, and cultural preferences influence consumer demand and supply chain strategies. Moreover, the analysis delves into the impact of emerging trends such as e-commerce, sustainability, and digitalization on FMCG operations in both regions. The findings reveal opportunities for mutual learning and adaptation between Africa and the USA. While the USA boasts mature infrastructure and advanced technological capabilities, Africa offers potential for innovative solutions tailored to its unique challenges and opportunities. Through cross-regional knowledge exchange and strategic partnerships, FMCG companies can develop hybrid models that combine the best practices from both regions to drive growth, reduce costs, and enhance resilience. The study concludes by proposing actionable recommendations for FMCG companies seeking to implement transformative business and supply chain models in Africa and the USA, emphasizing the importance of flexibility, agility, and stakeholder collaboration in navigating diverse market landscapes and driving sustainable growth.</jats:p>"

To understand if lactate improves cellular viability and susceptibility to glutamate toxicity, primary cortical cells were incubated in glucose- or lactate-containing media and toxic concentrations of glutamate for 24 h. Cell death was determined by immunostaining and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Mitochondrial membrane potential and nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured using Tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester (TMRM) and 4-Amino-5-Methylamino-2′,7′-Difluorofluorescein Diacetate (DAF-FM) live staining, respectively. LDH activity was quantified in single cells in the presence of lactate (LDH substrate) and oxamate (LDH inhibitor). Nuclei of cells were stained with DAPI and neurons with MAP2. Based on the distance between neurons and glial cells, they were classified as linked (&lt;10 µm) and non-linked (&gt;10 µm) neurons. Lactate increased cell death rate and the mean value of endogenous NO levels compared to glucose incubations. Mitochondrial membrane potential was lower in the cells cultured with lactate, but this effect was reversed when glutamate was added to the lactate medium. LDH activity was higher in linked neurons compared to non-linked neurons, supporting the hypothesis of the existence of the lactate shuttle between astrocytes and at least a portion of neurons. In conclusion, glucose or lactate can equally preserve primary cortical neurons, but those neurons having a low level of LDH activity and incubated with lactate cannot cover high energetic demand solely with lactate and become more susceptible to glutamate toxicity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a new design of a magnetic shunt transformer for use in industrial microwave generators. The proposed transformer has a triangular shape and offers several advantages over existing transformer designs, including reduced volume and maintenance costs. We provide a detailed analysis of the transformer's dimensions and an equivalent model of the three-phase high voltage power supply system. The results of this study have significant implications for the field of industrial microwave generator design and could lead to the development of more efficient and costeffective systems. The resulting model is comprised of saturable inductors capable of accounting for the non-linear phenomena of saturation. The power supply is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink with a neuro-fuzzy ANFIS approach. The results are compared to experimental validations of a single-phase reference power supply for a magnetron, validating the proposed power supply. Additionally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, which outperforms existing transformers in terms of volume, energy efficiency and maintenance costs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the pharmaceutical industry, energy efficiency has played a minor role compared to other energy-intensive industries. However, there is a growing recognition of the need to address environmental concerns. With ambitious climate targets and the increasing demand for significant reductions in CO2 emissions, the pharmaceutical industry is now embracing the opportunity to enhance its sustainability practices. Mainly fossil fuels are used to provide process steam at moderate temperature levels at about 160-180°C and to a lesser extent to provide hot water or for on-site power production in CHPs. In this paper, the main processes with demands for process heat, such as media supply, cleaning, or air conditioning, are presented and possibilities for increasing efficiency, for switching to alternative heat supply and for using alternative process technologies are evaluated with respect to economics, but also regarding hurdles for implementation such as requirements for revalidation of production processes and possible necessity of re-approval of products.\nThe present study highlights the potentials for decarbonization of the Austrian pharmaceutical industry using a generic but representative production site applying various measures that either reduce heating and cooling requirements or alter the temperature requirements for heat supply. It is shown that, at least for the example case, full decarbonization is technically feasibly without an increase in energy costs if efficiency measures are progressively used on demand level.</jats:p>"

Nineteen feed mills were assessed, and a representative from each region was interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Feed samples from each feed mill representing starter, grower, and finisher diets were collected for proximate analysis. The study showed that the average broiler feed production (tonnes/year) per feed mill was approximately 12,000 for Morogoro, 15,400 for Pwani, and 35,000 for Dar es Salaam. Feed production was mainly constrained by inadequate supply and low quality of ingredients, high costs of production equipment, restricted market access, and limited capital investment. The major feed ingredients listed were maize, maize bran, cottonseed cake, sunflower seed meal, soybean meal, and fish meal, while the micro ingredients included blood meal, salt, limestone, dicalcium phosphate, and premixes. Ingredients were mostly sourced from contract suppliers and local markets. The majority of feeds were processed in mash form, while a few were pelleted. There was considerable variation in the nutrient composition of the feeds of different producers. In most of the feeds examined, crude protein (CP), metabolizable energy (ME), and amino acids were below the recommended levels for broiler chickens; fat, Mg, and Na were at the recommended levels; and P, Ca, Mn, Fe, and Zn exceeded the recommended levels. Starter feeds were more costly than grower and finisher feeds, and pelleted feeds were more costly than mash feeds. The feed ingredient prices were high between October and March and lower during the June to July crop harvesting season. In general, commercially processed feeds from different companies showed large variations in nutrient composition; the majority had values below the recommended standards for broiler chickens, while some exceeded and few attained these standards.</jats:p>"

One selected examination is the flexibility of supply temperatures by varying setpoint temperatures for a decentral solar thermal system (500 m²) integrated into an existing district heating network. The analysis of the supply temperature distribution in the network showed: A decrease of the solar thermal feed-in set point temperature by 5 K compared to the supply temperature of the central heat producer seemed acceptable in terms of security of supply, while a 10 K reduction comes with a high risk of undersupply. Furthermore, it was discovered that the points of time with the lowest supply temperatures at the consumers were just before and after they were provided with solar heat due to specific effects concerning temperature loss of the fluid.</jats:p>"

Given this situation, the definition and calculation of the characteristic index of the underground reservoir in line with the actual changes are carried out. The characteristic water level of the underground reservoir is defined based on the groundwater surface with a certain slope at the inclined level in the case of the lower dam (single dam) impoundment. The characteristic capacity is calculated through the water level at the typical section defined by the inclined surface. A new set of definition and calculation method based on the characteristic index of the underground reservoir with a dam on the inclined bottom plates is proposed and applied to the Rushan River underground reservoir, which more accurately reflects the water level change and the corresponding actual reservoir capacity during the operation of the underground reservoir.</jats:p>",

Urban water demand in Beijing has been growing rapidly. Accurate water consumption forecasting is of utmost importance for reasonable allocation and optimization of water supply systems. In this study, an innovative multi-variable grey prediction model with adjacent accumulation (AOGM(1,N)) is proposed to predict Beijing's annual water consumption for four different water usage scenarios (domestic water, agricultural water, industrial water, and environmental water) by incorporating the adjacent accumulation into the optimized grey model. Grey relational analysis is used to select the key influence factors. The adjustable parameter of the prediction model is chosen by using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. By comparing with other models in the existing literature, the proposed AOGM(1,N) model has evidently superior prediction performance based on the error indicators, which supports the novel method's merits and validity. This study could help us better understand water usage and be applied to the planning and management problems of urban water supply systems.</jats:p>",

Insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons integrates internal energy storage into memory formation. Octopamine, in turn, suppresses the formation of long-term memory. Octopamine is not required for short-term memory because octopamine-deficient mutants can form appetitive short-term memory for sucrose and to other nutrients depending on the internal energy status. The reduced positive reinforcing effect of sucrose at high internal glycogen levels, combined with the increased stability of food-related memories due to prolonged periods of starvation, could lead to increased food intake.</jats:p>"

This study uses a partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS‐SEM) to analyse survey data gathered from 290 managers of manufacturing Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Ghana. This study finds that pressure from supply chain stakeholders substantially drives manufacturing SMEs' CSC practices. This study confirms that EIEC negatively moderates the relationship between supply chain stakeholder pressure and CSC practices. Finally, this study confirms the complementarity between CIO and EIEC through moderating effects between supply chain stakeholder pressure and CSC practices. This study advances circular supply chain management (CSCM) literature by testing a research framework that examines important but rarely studied roles of CIO and EIEC in SMEs' CSC practices adoption under supply chain stakeholder pressure through institutional and resource orchestration perspectives.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main challenges in oil platforms are how to define optimal setpoints and decision-making for controlling variables due to many existing dynamical production uncertainties while conceding safe operation and minimizing discharge to sea and atmosphere without killing plantwide inventory. A novel scheduling model to optimize the whole essential units of an oil platform production gathering topside and subsea variables is disclosed. A proper topside and subsea scheduling model enables and creates harmony between optimal production, supply chain, costs, and market dynamics, satisfying demands, environmental and operations constraints leading to stability. The interest of the present research lies in determining the optimal topside and subsea operational settings and decision-making, establishing maximum E&amp;amp;P performance and production control setpoints while predicting and manipulating reservoir lifespan and its revitalization. This objective is attained through a novel multiperiod large-scale model for the planning and operational production scheduling and model predictive control (MPC) in oil platforms complying with sustainability, profitability, platform design capacities, and offloading of oil and gas to supply chains or to pipeline exportation. The present model details heat and mass transfer, PVT, flow profiles along a planning horizon and can be used to any oil platform since comprises all the essential unit operations for oil, gas, CO2, H2S and water. The model maximizes the total oil production over any planning horizon. The model is versatile, and decision-making can be either linear or nonlinear but rather a MILP or LP as best choice on optimizing large-scale systems. If the model is applied with auto rescheduling on site within variable hours or minutes, it becomes a real-time optimization schedule approach. Due to its high-velocity performance and robustness, a novel multi-objective function strategy, acting as an LP generic plantwide MPC with industrial scope to maximize production while controlling the process is presented, and as an example is here used to control slug flow to avoid equipment trips and inventory instability, at the same time production is maximized. The output from the decision-making was compared to actual plant data, and the results proved compliance to the design capacity with process safety and sustainability. Comparing to official Brazil's government data for oil, the case study showed superiority to the same size platforms, like FPSOs P-75 and MV32, e.g., more than 101.5% more capacity to produce oil in beginning of campaign after first oil, and 10.5% during campaign. The present work indicates that: 1) the production of millions of barrels is being delayed or left aside; 2) not scheduling production harms the environment and diminish process safety; 3) not scheduling production can create stochastic supply chain deliveries instead of organizing it by deterministic offloading days; 4) scheduling is essential to manipulate, revitalize and monitor reservoir's pressure and content under uncertainty; 5) the oil platform can be automatic optimized by a plantwide MPC reducing human activity/dependency; 6) scheduling gives more transparency to stakeholders and contractors by forecasting business data and capability, and can design, develop or enable new businesses. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Governments across the developing world are adopting digital technologies to improve the performance of public sector supply chains. However, empirical evidence regarding the impact of these technologies on performance is mixed. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of using biometric authentication (BA) devices on the performance of India’s food security program. The program aims to deliver subsidized food grains to nearly 160 million low-income households through approximately 500,000 fair price shops (FPSs). Nearly half of those grains do not reach the beneficiaries and are diverted to the open market for private benefit. We estimate the impact of installing BA devices on reducing diversion in more than 3,300 FPSs in the Indian state of Karnataka between 2013 and 2015 using a difference-in-differences approach. We find that BA devices reduce up to 4% of the current diversion at the last mile. We argue that this relatively low impact is due to the presence of a workaround mechanism which results in imperfect monitoring and validate the decrease in diversion mechanism by estimating the differential impact of BA devices. We complement the empirical analysis with a simulation exercise to estimate the additional value that can be unlocked by using the BA devices. We find that the value of better replenishment planning using sales and inventory information captured by BA devices can be significant. The value of better planning can be as high as six times the value of reduction in diversion, depending on the preintervention levels of demand from genuine beneficiaries and diversion at the FPSs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Strengthening the functioning of existing rural piped water supply systems is a critical strategy for ensuring household water security, particularly in water-scarce contexts. Improving operation and maintenance (O&amp;amp;M) of the systems is an important area of focus, commonly plagued by poor reliability and functionality over time. From an economic perspective, there is an opportunity to optimise O&amp;amp;M input efficiencies as a foundation for improved management. This paper presented challenges and opportunities to optimise O&amp;amp;M input efficiencies based on an analysis of water supply systems in Vietnam’s highland areas characterised by mountainous terrain and water scarcity. The analysis focused on state-based agencies for O&amp;amp;M given their mandate for restoring the inefficient systems and identified input norms for guidance on how to optimise O&amp;amp;M activities. We applied an input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) model under constant returns to scale assumption to estimate technical, economic and allocative efficiencies. The results identified efficiency levels of 90%, 30% and 33% respectively. The study suggests a 10% reduction in general input amounts and identified efficient input target values reveal potential reduction rates for technical labour (12%), electricity (12%), as well as the technical and economic norms of technical labour (0.86 person- day∙(100 m3)–1 water sold) and electricity (0.53 kWh∙m–3 water sold). The policy implications for O&amp;amp;M state-based agencies include the adoption of input-based contracting mechanisms, while the government is encouraged to approve water tariffs and provide compensation based on input items to promote water service supply as a public good in water- scarce and challenging areas.</jats:p>"

This systematic review followed the PRISMA methodology. The articles selected were identified by searching three databases: Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed. The search results showed that the meat industry and the meat supply chain have their share of positive implications instigated by Web 3.0 technologies. Web 3.0 technologies are shown to be effective for the food safety of meat from farm to fork, particularly in inspection and quality assessment with blockchain integration enhancing transparency and traceability with innovative approaches promising to improve meat safety, increase profitability, efficiency, scalability and modularisation of meat manufacturing in addition to better adherence to animal welfare increasing thus consumer's confidence. Further research is still, needed to examine the role of such technologies at the level of other parts of the supply chain including the pre-processing step, processing and packaging.</jats:p>",

Safety practices on building construction sites are crucial for the well-being of workers and the overall success of construction projects. This research employs a quantitative approach with descriptive analysis to the extent of the Integration of Safety Practices into the Supply Chain. Utilizing mean and standard deviation calculations, the study analyses rates, compliance levels and other key safety indicators across firms in the construction sectors. Addressing safety concerns at every stage of the supply chain, from sourcing raw materials to final project delivery, stakeholders can mitigate risks, minimize accidents and create a secure working environment. In the context of sustainable development, incorporating safety practices into the supply chain aligns with Malaysia's commitment to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Specifically, it contributes to SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). By prioritizing safety, the construction industry can foster a culture of well-being and productivity, attract skilled workers, and promote responsible business practices. Key safety practices that can be integrated into the supply chain include rigorous supplier vetting, ensuring the use of certified and safe construction materials, implementing proper handling and storage procedures, and conducting regular safety training for all workers involved. Additionally, leveraging technology such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, wearables, and real-time monitoring systems can enhance safety management and enable prompt response to potential hazards.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water quality monitoring plays a crucial role in urban water supply systems for the production of safe drinking water. However, the traditional approach to water monitoring in Norway relies on a periodic (weekly/biweekly/monthly) sampling and analysis of biological indicators, which fails to provide a timely response to changes in water quality. This research addresses this issue by proposing a data-driven solution that enhances the timeliness of water quality monitoring. Our research team applied a case study in Ålesund Kommune. A sensor platform has been deployed at Lake Brusdalsvatnet, the water source reservoir in Ålesund. This sensor module is capable of collecting data for 10 different physico-chemical indicators of water quality. Leveraging this sensor platform, we developed a CNN-AutoEncoder-SOM solution to automatically monitor, process, and evaluate water quality evolution in the lake. There are three components in this solution. The first one focuses on anomaly detection. We employed a recurrence map to encode the temporal dynamics and sensor correlations, which were then fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification. It is noted that this network achieved an impressive accuracy of up to 99.6%. Once an anomaly is detected, the data are calibrated in the second component using an AutoEncoder-based network. Since true values for calibration are unavailable, the results are evaluated through data analysis. With high-quality calibrated data in hand, we proceeded to cluster the data into different categories to establish water quality standards in the third component, where a self-organizing map (SOM) is applied. The results revealed that this solution demonstrated significant performance, with a silhouette score of 0.73, which illustrates a small in-cluster distance and large intra-cluster distance when the water was clustered into three levels. This system not only achieved the objective of developing a comprehensive solution for continuous water quality monitoring but also offers the potential for integration with other cyber–physical systems (CPSs) in urban water management.</jats:p>"

Whether commonly consumed plant-based diets are nutritionally adequate for maximal muscular hypertrophy remains unknown. This modeling study assessed the nutrient composition of completely plant-based diets scaled to the caloric demands of maximal muscle mass and strength development in adult male bodybuilders. To model calorie requirements, anthropometric data from bodybuilders were input into the Tinsley resting metabolic rate prediction equation, and an appropriate physical activity factor and calorie surplus were applied. Dietary data from a large cohort following completely plant-based diets were then scaled to meet these needs. Modeled intakes for nutrients of interest were calculated as 1.8 g/kg/day of protein and 2.75 g/meal of leucine, which surpass mean requirements for maximal increases in muscle mass and strength and muscle protein synthesis, respectively. Daily levels for all micronutrients, except vitamin D, also exceeded requirements. Saturated fat levels were aligned with dietary guidelines, although sodium levels exceeded recommended limits. Consumption of larger portions of commonplace plant-based diets, scaled to meet the energy demands of maximal accrual of muscle mass and strength, satisfied protein and leucine requirements without the need for additional planning.</jats:p>"

The boundary conditions associated with the U-shaped gate are complex, offering distinctive hydraulic features. In this study, the hydraulic characteristics of a vertical U-shaped gate have been investigated by model test and numerical simulation on a U-shaped channel under different flow rates, and the hydraulic evolution process was analyzed. The results show that the minimum relative error of discharges is 0.4%, so the numerical simulation can accurately describe the hydraulic performance of the vertical U-shaped gate. The flow generates a contracted cross-section and presents rhomboid water waves with a ‘hump-like’ convex structure after passing the U-shaped gate, accompanied by large kinetic energy dissipation. The gate opening exerts notable influence on the free surface width. The width of the first contraction section increased by 53.88% as the gate opening ranged from 2.5 to 5.5 cm with a flow rate of 8.24 L/s. The power function relationship of upstream flow Froude number, the width of free surface and energy loss is established. The results are helpful for engineering designing and operation management of a U-shaped gate.</jats:p>",

The <jats:italic>GeneSys</jats:italic> software framework has been developed for parametric modeling of aircraft on-board systems for overall systems design. To this end, model-based architecture definition, topology generation (components positioning and connections routing), and system sizing are conducted. The topology generation is currently performed using design templates containing knowledge-based heuristics derived from systems topologies of existing aircraft. However, using such design templates limits their generic application to novel aircraft models because exceptions for geometric differences between these models need to be implemented. This especially applies to the topology generation of power supply systems (electric, hydraulic) due to their high number of interfaces to consumer systems. To overcome these limitations, an automated routing method is presented in this paper as a generic approach for topology generation. With this method, the system topology is generated based on a defined routing network, which comprises areas of the aircraft for allowed components positioning and connections routing. Using Dijkstra’s algorithm, the shortest path connections are found within the established routing network. Furthermore, boundary conditions for routing, for instance adding a cost function for power segregation, can be defined. An assessment of the automated routing method applied on the electric power supply system is performed using qualitative parameters such as the capability to adapt the routing network. Quantitative parameters like cable length and system mass are assessed as well.</jats:p>",

In the constructed supply chain network, a node represents a supplier, assembly plant, or customer, and an arc connecting the nodes. For each arc, it has a carrier whose available carrying capacity for demand transmission. The capacity of each carrier, represented by the available delivery containers, should not be deterministic as they may be partially reserved by other customers. Under these conditions, such a supply chain network is regarded as a stochastic supply chain network (SSCN). The reliability for an SSCN is defined as the probability that the SSCN can successfully transport a specific amount of goods to a customer under supplier sustainability level, supplier production capacity, and budget. Reliability is also regarded as a performance indicator for supply chain capability when managers makes decisions under supplier sustainability consideration.</jats:p>"

The research study methodology followed a descriptive approach with a target population of the study of 240 respondents, covering various departments within the Sugar firms. A census survey was conducted on all the 15 registered sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya. Data collected was analyzed by both descriptive and inferential statistics using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS Version 28). Descriptive statistics involved calculation of means, frequencies, percentages and standard deviation. Inferential statistics on the other hand included the use of Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the extent of relationship among the independent study variables, while multiple regression analysis was used to establish the relationship between corporate governance and supply chain resilience. Findings from data analysis in the study indicated that corporate governance was significantly responsible for the supply chain resilience of sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya. Consequently, yielding a positive relationship in the regression model. The findings from the regression model indicated that corporate governance, significantly and positively affected supply chain resilience of sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study therefore recommended that the management of sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya in collaboration with the appointing authorities should embrace good practices when appointing managing directors in-charge of the sugar firms to achieve supply chain resilience through, continuous production, resource optimization, quality output and general bottom line improvement. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The water supply of water resources allocation under extreme drought is insufficient, and the limited available water resources make it urgent to tap the potential of water supply. In this paper, the Yellow River water supply area in Henan Province is taken as an example to study the multi-water source allocation under extreme drought. According to the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), the extreme drought years are selected, and the water supply and demand balance in the extreme drought years is analyzed, and the water shortage degree of each water supply area is obtained. In this paper, unconventional water, flood resource utilization and elastic exploitation of groundwater are used as potential water sources. Different water supply scenarios are set up according to different potential tapping measures, and multi-scenario supply increase under extreme drought is explored. A multi-water source allocation model with the goal of minimizing water shortage is constructed, and a multi-scenario supply increase allocation scheme is proposed, which provides a basis for the study of water supply increase allocation to alleviate the drought degree of the the Yellow River Water Supply Area in Henan. Through the Multi-scenario potential tapping of multiple water sources, the existing potential water volume can be maximized, which is conducive to reducing the water supply pressure and water use restrictions of conventional water sources, improving the support capacity and guarantee capacity of water resources, and reducing the economic and social development bottlenecks caused by extreme drought.\n                        </jats:p>"

Strict network equilibrium principles are proposed both in the case of a single criterion and multi-criteria, respectively. Based on a single criterion, it proves that strict network equilibrium flows are equivalent to vector variational inequalities, and the existence of strict network equilibrium flows is derived by virtue of the Fan–Browder fixed point theorem. Based on multi-criteria, the scalarization of strict network equilibrium flows is given by using Gerstewitz’s function without any convexity assumptions. Meanwhile, the necessary and sufficient conditions of strict network equilibrium flows are derived in terms of vector variational inequalities. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the application of the derived theoretical results.</jats:p>"

The internal glycogen storage in the muscles and adipose tissue influences how intensely sucrose-associated information is stored. Insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons integrates internal energy storage into memory formation. Octopamine, in turn, suppresses the formation of long-term memory. Octopamine is not required for short-term memory because octopamine-deficient mutants can form appetitive short-term memory for sucrose and to other nutrients depending on the internal energy status. The reduced positive reinforcing effect of sucrose at high internal glycogen levels, combined with the increased stability of food-related memories due to prolonged periods of starvation, could lead to increased food intake.</jats:p>"

This study explores how sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) takes the changing role to affect these three dimensions. Since organizations vary in size, we post and test relationships regarding how firm size can impact the implementation of SSCM practices as a moderator. We posit an empirical research model and test this using structural equation modeling with survey data from 392 managers across various Jordanian manufacturing firms. This study assessed the link between five categories of SSCM practices and TBL performance. We found that firm size is critical and moderates the positive SSCM relationship with economic and social performances. Results shed new light on SSCM and its impacts on environmental, economic, and social performance. According to the study findings, environmental management practices and supply chain integration influenced all sustainability dimensions, whereas socially inclusive community practices influenced none. Furthermore, operations had an impact on economic sustainability. Finally, socially inclusive employee practices had a significant impact on both environmental and economic sustainability. Findings show that when implementing SSCM, larger firms perform better on multiple sustainability measures compared to smaller firms. The model's integration of firm size as a moderator provides additional insights regarding the SSCM construct and its change agent role in stimulating sustainable development.</jats:p>",

Subjective and objective weights were determined by the analytic hierarchy process and the entropy weighting method, and vulnerability zoning evaluation was carried out based on the geographic information system using the vulnerability index method. The study area was classified into five zones based on the graded thresholds calculated by statistical analysis.

Subsequently, it constructs a supply security risk assessment model based on a comprehensive evaluation method combining the analytic hierarchy process method and the entropy weight method. The effectiveness of the approach is then evaluated through simulations of supply security risks across 11 provinces, including Inner Mongolia and Sichuan. Finally, the analysis of supply security risks in the Sichuan power system is conducted at different stages, focusing on changes in supply security risk levels and risk transmission mechanisms during Sichuan power crunch events in 2022. The results show that during Sichuan's 2022 high‐temperature power rationing event, the comprehensive supply security risk score of the Sichuan power system dropped from 88.7 to 76.91. This decline was mainly due to a significant reduction in hydropower output, which lowered scores of the source‐side risk and consequently increased the system's supply security risk.</jats:p>",

We propose a structured approach that encompasses both qualitative and quantitative techniques, enabling organizations to comprehensively assess risks across various stages of the 3PL relationship lifecycle. Through the application of our holistic framework, organizations can enhance their ability to navigate uncertainties in 3PL relationships, fostering resilience and competitiveness in today's dynamic business environment.  Findings: There has been a considerable focus on identifying risk types and proposing risk mitigation strategies. Research has emphasised organisational responses to 3PL risks.  Research implications: A broad, contemporary understanding of 3PL risk management is provided; leading to a conceptual framework. The research agenda guides future work towards maturation of the discipline. Practical implications: Managers are encouraged to adopt a holistic approach to risk management. Guidance is provided on how to select appropriate risk treatment actions according to the probability and impact of a risk. Key components of our framework include risk categorization, stakeholder engagement, scenario analysis, and performance metrics alignment. By systematically categorizing risks according to their nature and impact, organizations can prioritize mitigation efforts and allocate resources effectively. Stakeholder engagement ensures that diverse perspectives are considered in the risk assessment process, enhancing its accuracy and relevance. Furthermore, scenario analysis allows for the exploration of potential future events and their implications on 3PL operations, enabling proactive risk management strategies.

The research concentrated on the 134 food and beverage manufacturers that are operating in Nairobi City County besides being registered with Kenya Association of Manufacturers. The study adopted a mixed research design with both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The target population of the study was the 134 food and beverages manufacturing firms in Nairobi County. A sampling frame of this study included a list of the 134 manufacturing companies in Nairobi County that are members of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. The study utilized simple random sampling. A sample size of 100 was selected with the aid of Yamane 1967 formula. Both primary and secondary data was collected using a questionnaire. The questionnaire was tested pilot at 10 food and beverages manufacturing companies in Kiambu county. These pilot study questionnaires were filled out by warehouse managers. The statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 25 was used to analyze the data. Using content analysis, the qualitative data was analyzed. Quantitative data was analyzed using statistical methods involving descriptive and inferential data. A multiple linear regression model was applied to analyze the relationship between the variables. Analysis was also performed on the correlation. In this study, the findings were presented using tables and graphs. Data presentation made use of percentages, frequencies, means and other means of central tendencies. The study on revealed several ways to improve operational efficiency and productivity.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Community Management Plus (CM+) has recently been promoted as a better alternative approach for governing community drinking water systems (CDWS) in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the global south. However, it is still largely unearthed under what condition this model is likely to work for ensuring the sustainable performance of CDWS. The study, therefore, aims to explore the conditions that are likely to explain variation in the occurrence of the CM+ model in the Northwestern Barind Tract of Bangladesh. The study employed a case study approach where a deep tube-well water supply installation (DTWSI) was selected as a case for the study. Computing correlation (n=30 DTWSI), the study finds small group size, high dependence on a resource system, interdependency among user groups, heterogeneity of endowments, affordability and willingness to pay, locally devised rules, monitoring users’ behavior, and public agency’s support strongly influence the variation in occurrence of collective action among the end-users of DTWSI. The study also finds effective collaboration between public agency officials and end-users is affected by trust, commitment, participatory decision- making, and transparency in the decision-making process. These findings are expected to contribute towards developing a scalable drinking water governance model and thereby ensure sustainable solutions for safe drinking water scarcity in Northwestern Bangladesh and elsewhere of similar context.\nSocial Science Review, Vol. 40(2), December 2023 Page: 81-112</jats:p>"

This paper develops a two‐period game model to investigate the impacts of online reviews on the retailer's price commitment strategies in two competing supply chains, each consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. In the first period, the retailers strategically set prices and decide whether to commit to prices for their products. In the second period, the retailers adjust product prices in response to online reviews, if they choose not to commit to a price. We show that the retailers' price commitment strategies depend on consumers' perceived uncertainty about product valuations, the information value of online reviews and the unit misfit cost. Interestingly, the retailers can benefit from the information value of online reviews by implementing flexible pricing strategies. Furthermore, if the information value of online reviews is sufficiently high, both retailers will choose not to commit to a price in equilibrium. However, if the information value of online reviews is relatively low, the equilibrium in price commitment is asymmetric, that is, the retailer A commits to a price and its competitor chooses not to commit.</jats:p>",

The existence of logistic transports is critical to ensure whole nodes’ economic sustainability. This study explores the impact of human factors on SCN performance through cognitive energy expenditure (CEE) tracking. Agent-based model (ABM) simulation was used to analyze the impact of CEE from truck driver’s electroencephalography (EEG) data to obtain the postsynaptic potential values, which were then transformed to calorific energy. The fleet agents, retailers and distributor models were built based on the East Java, Indonesia, logistic transport route around Karanglo, Gempol, Bungurasih, and Gubeng. The frequency and the peak value of the EEG data, postsynaptic potential, and energy data indicate the same information. All data indicate that more challenging routes have higher frequency and higher peak values. The ABM simulation of the fleet agents shows balanced CEE throughout entire routes due to the precise rest period and eat scheduling. The average delivery success rate was 8 out of 30 or 26.7 % in each simulation time step. Hence, most goods delivery tasks can be completed by fleet agents in a balanced system. As a consequence, the SCN performance is also balanced due to the fluid inventory shift without overstock and stockouts. The rest and eat periods of a fleet agent were scheduled after the CEE has been peaked. The time lag between rest periods and transport operations has to be maintained to overcome fleet agents task buildup. Task buildup has a potential to decay both transport safety and inventory shift rates. Therefore, the upgrade in SCN performance is possible through proper fleet agents scheduling</jats:p>"

An irrigation at 0.6 irrigation water:cumulative pan evaporation (IW:CPE) ratio resulted in significantly higher growth, yield attributes, seed yield, economic benefits and water pro ductivity of soybean compared with 0.4 and 0.8 IW:CPE. Similarly, an irrigation at 0.4 IW:CPE ratio significantly in fluenced the yield-attributing characters, seed and straw yields, economic benefits and water productivity of chickpea compared with 0.6 and 0.8 IW:CPE ratios, whereas height and number of branches increased with in creasing IW:CPE ratio. Sprinkler irrigation resulted in significantly higher growth and yield attributes, seed and straw yields, economic benefits and water productivity of both the crops. The irrigation at 0.6 IW:CPE ratio showed 51.3% and 39.0% higher seed of soybean over 0.4 and 0.8 IW:CPE ratio, whereas 0.4 IW:CPE of irrigation yielded 14.5% and 32.5% higher seed of chickpea compared with 0.6 and 0.8 IW:CPE.

The purpose of this research is to enhance the efficiency of allocation and operational scheduling, particularly concerning the stock keeping units (SKUs). To achieve this, one year's operational data from a specific organization's SKUs is taken and machine learning tools are employed on the data collected. These tools are instrumental in identifying clusters of SKUs that exhibit similar behaviour. Consequently, this research offers recommendations for rational inventory allocation strategies that are finely attuned to the unique characteristics of each SKU cluster. Results obtained reveals substantial disparities between the recommended strategies for the organization's SKUs and those typically found in the literature such as same strategy cannot be used for all different types for products. This underscores the critical importance of adopting a tailored approach to supply chain management. Furthermore, the research demonstrates the remarkable efficiency of unsupervised machine learning algorithms in determining the optimal number of segments within the SKUs. The current research differentiates from others in a way that in most of the research, the holistic data-driven approach is underutilized, right from the selection of the clustering algorithm to the validation of segments.</jats:p>"

The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the most optimized renewable-energy supply chain based on natural resource availability and government policies of Bangladesh. In the present study, four renewable energy resources, including solar, biomass, wind and hydropower, are studied and nine subcriteria are defined under four primary criteria for each supply chain. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) are multicriteria decision-making approaches used in this study to compare and choose the best renewable-energy supply chain. The relative significance of four supply-chain criteria for primary renewable energy in this study, namely energy procurement, production, operations and maintenance costs, and social and environmental impact, is gathered via a survey. The results of this research, supported by a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, indicate that hydropower is the best renewable-energy supply chain, followed by wind as a compromise solution, biomass and solar. The study also demonstrates that no energy source can satisfy all supply-chain criteria alone; each resource is better for a specific criterion—solar is better for procurement, hydropower is significant for production and wind is remarkable for operations and social impact. Therefore, to maximize output, renewable energy sources must be integrated. From Bangladesh’s perspective, for the first time, by using TOPSIS and VIKOR together, this study offers significant insights to establish an efficient and sustainable renewable-energy supply chain for practitioners, academics and policymakers.</jats:p>",

Numerous instances of thriving OEM remanufacturing can be observed, predominantly in the business‐to‐business domain. The significance of Closed‐Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) in generating value and managing the recovery process is widely acknowledged within the supply chain industry. Manufacturing companies now have to come up with green supply chain and process design strategies in response to recent changes in environmental regulations. This study designates the specific features of circular closed‐loop supply‐chain design considering end‐of‐life products. Uncertainty in various aspects, such as acquisition, processing, and market stages, is impeding the progress of circular economies and also sustainable development in closed‐loop supply chains (CLSCs). This has led to increased complexity in remanufacturing processes and decreased efficiency. To address this issue, the study proposes a comprehensive, integrative approach for establishing a sustainable CLSC network that adapts to fluctuating demand through a questionnaire analysis. Moreover, the study introduces a multi‐objective optimization model for a dual‐channel supply chain network, aiming to enhance the flow. This model considers both economic and environmental objectives to achieve a sustainable and efficient supply chain system. To determine the ideal circular closed‐loop supply chain (CLSC) network design, the research proposes linear programming model with mixed integer, where recovery can take place in one of three ways: through material recovery, component recovery, or product recovery. Numerous findings from a thorough analysis by data backup that inform CLSC managers of ways to improve product returns in terms of quantity and quality. To address the uncertainty problem, the research also developed the fuzzy credibility constraint technique with a Simulated Annealing algorithm. Using cutting‐edge methods, it is explored and compared how sensitivity analysis results, the impact of altering the problem parameters, and the performance of the suggested model respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background\n Many individuals who experience preterm birth struggle with early breast milk supply, which can translate into suboptimal longer-term breastfeeding outcomes. Further investigations into the potential role of early non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions in improving breast milk production soon after birth is growing. While natural galactagogues, such as brewers’ yeast, are widely perceived by women to be safer than pharmaceutical galactagogues and are taken by many women, evidence to support their efficacy is largely absent. The BLOOM study has been designed to determine the efficacy and safety of brewers’ yeast and beta-glucans, derived from <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic>, when administered soon after birth for increasing early breast milk supply in mothers who have delivered preterm.\nMethods\n The BLOOM study is a multicentre, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial that will assess if brewers’ yeast or beta-glucan can increase early breast milk production following preterm birth. Target population are mothers of preterm infants born at less than 34 weeks’ gestation who intend to provide breast milk for their infant, are less than 72 hours following birth and able to give informed consent. Participants will be randomly allocated into three parallel groups at 1:1:1 ratio (n = 33 per group) to receive either brewers’ yeast, beta-glucan or placebo capsules for seven days. The primary outcome is total expressed breast milk volume over a 24-hour period on day 7 of intervention. Participants and their infants will be followed until the infant reaches term corrected age or is discharged home from the neonatal unit (whichever occurs first).\nDiscussion\n The use of brewers’ yeast as a galactagogue to enhance milk production is extremely common amongst breastfeeding mothers, however, there are no trials evaluating its efficacy and safety. This will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two commonly used galactagogues, brewers’ yeast and beta-glucan, compared with placebo in improving maternal breast milk supply following preterm birth. The trial will also evaluate whether early intervention with galactagogues soon after a preterm birth improves longer-term breastfeeding outcomes.\nTrial registration\n Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12622000968774 (registered on 8 July 2022) and UTN U1111-1278-8827</jats:p>"

The subject of the study is the efficiency index of the fire safety subsystem of hydrogen storage and supply systems for different modes of its operation. As such an efficiency indicator, the conditional probability that the fire safety subsystem correctly recognizes the actual state of the hydrogen storage and supply system is used. The fire safety subsystem functions under the control mode and under the test mode. Mathematical models of the operation of the fire safety subsystem were built for such modes, based on the use of graph theory. The weight matrices of these graphs include the completeness of control or testing and the intensity of transition of the fire safety subsystem from one state to another. Determination of the effectiveness of such a subsystem – reliability of functioning – is carried out using Kolmogorov’s equations. It is shown that during the testing of hydrogen storage and supply system, the probability of its being in a fire-safe state has a maximum. It is shown that with values of completeness of control (testing) that do not differ from 1.0, the effectiveness of the functioning of the fire safety subsystem is invariant with respect to the mode of its functioning. With values of completeness of control (testing), which are significantly different from 1.0, the functioning of the fire safety subsystem under the testing mode is more effective.\nThe identified features of the functioning of the fire safety subsystem make it possible in practice to implement an optimal or adaptive algorithm for the functioning of such subsystems. For example, with the appropriate selection of testing parameters, the fire safety subsystem provides determination of the location of the hydrogen storage and supply system with maximum probability</jats:p>"

The globalization of supply chains makes their management and control more challenging. Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger technology that guarantees traceability, transparency, and security and promises to ease global supply chain management issues. This paper proposes the Blockchain-assisted Secure Data Management Framework (BSDMF) for financial data handling for supply chain integrated business intelligence models. Analyzing, collecting, and demonstrating data could be important to a business, its supply chain performance, and sustainability. The blockchain can interrupt supply chain processes for improved finance handling, distributed management, and process automation. The study’s experimental result will help organizations deploy blockchain applications with intelligent business strategies to support supply chain management effectively. The simulation outcome has been implemented, and the recommended method achieves a computation time of fewer than 2 hours, an efficiency ratio of 97.4%, an error ratio of 94.1%, data authentication of 92.1%, and a data management ratio of 98.7%.</jats:p>",

This research paper introduces a groundbreaking approach that seamlessly merges deep autoencoder (DAE) models with reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance financial risk forecasting within the realm of supply chain management. The primary objective of this research is to optimize financial decision-making processes by extracting key feature representations from financial data and leveraging RL for decision optimization. To achieve this, the paper presents the PSO-SDAE model, a novel and sophisticated approach to financial risk forecasting. By incorporating advanced noise reduction features and optimization algorithms, the PSO-SDAE model significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of financial risk predictions. Notably, the PSO-SDAE model goes beyond traditional forecasting methods by addressing the need for real-time decision-making in the rapidly evolving landscape of financial risk management. This is achieved through the utilization of a distributed RL algorithm, which expedites the processing of supply chain data while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy. The results of our study showcase the exceptional precision of the PSO-SDAE model in predicting financial risks, underscoring its efficacy for proactive risk management within supply chain operations. Moreover, the augmented processing speed of the model enables real-time analysis and decision-making — a critical capability in today’s fast-paced business environment.</jats:p>"

External innovation represents a valuable source of ideas and knowledge for internal innovation, and enterprises are increasingly leveraging their supplier relationships to gain a competitive advantage. Some researchers suggest that suppliers enhance the effectiveness and outcomes of lean innovation. To deepen our understanding of the relationship between supplier orientation and innovation outcomes, this study explores the mechanisms through which supplier orientation contributes to enhancing innovation performance, with a specific focus on the role of supplier orientation in improving supply management innovativeness and innovation partnerships. Survey data from 209 Chinese firms engaged in innovation practices was analyzed using a hierarchical regression based on resource dependency theory. Results reveal that supplier orientation positively influences supply management innovativeness and innovation partnerships. Supply management innovativeness and buyer–supplier innovation partnerships both contribute to improved innovation performance. Our findings suggest that the buyer–supplier innovation partnership plays a moderating role in the relationship between supply management innovativeness and innovation performance. These insights provide a valuable basis for developing innovative strategies and managing inter‐firm relationships, emphasizing the importance of supplier relationship management practices in enhancing firms' competitiveness and performance by leveraging external resources and knowledge.</jats:p>",

The article examines the impact of political isolationism such as Brexit on trade, cost and border controls, while also discussing the effects of COVID‐19 on labour, supply chains and the rise of e‐commerce. In addition, the article examines the impact of conflicts on food access and availability and the role of international aid and assistance. The effects of natural disasters, such as the Turkish and Moroccan earthquakes, floods in Spain and Portugal and the Moroccan drought, on food security are also analysed. The article offers several strategies for taming the quadruple whammy, such as investing in local food production and supply chains, diversifying supply chains and trade partnerships and strengthening food safety regulations and standards. The importance of building resilience and preparedness in the face of these challenges is emphasised and the article concludes with final thoughts and recommendations.</jats:p>",

Design/Methodology/Approach: The quantitative research utilised survey data from 285 respondents who are processing industry players throughout Indonesia. Structural Equation Modelling-Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS) is applied for data analysis.  Research Findings: The study's findings indicate that technology adoption and environmental factors have a significant effect on HVSC traceability. The authentication and legitimacy of halal products are positively impacted by technology adoption, among others, which contributes to the overall product integrity. The research findings also indicate government support as an important factor.  Theoretical Contribution/Originality: This research is one of the first studies related to supply chain legitimacy and authentication in the context of micro, small, and medium businesses in Indonesia, a country with a Muslim majority and many micro-businesses where these businesses have direct contact with “from farm to fork or table” end customers.  Managerial Implication in the South East Asian Context: This research offers valuable contribution for managers and policymakers in South East Asia in formulating authentic halal product policies in terms of HVSC.  Research Limitations &amp; Implications: This research can benefit from a larger sample size, preferably from larger companies, for generalisation. Moreover, expanding the research across borders and employing a mixed-method approach could offer further insights to overcome supply chain challenges in the future.\"</jats:p>",

Hence, our independent variables consist (flexible procurement, supplier selection, logistics outsourcing, medical inventory management, and information technology integration). While, the dependent variable picked on performance measures. The study revealed that there exists a significant relationship between flexible material procurement and hospitals’ performance. Also, supplier selection strategy is related to hospitals’ performance.; inventory management strategy is significantly related to hospitals’ performance. It was concluded that supply chain management could significantly affect public hospitals’ operations if properly managed. This therefore calls for the need for public hospitals to embrace supply chain management by: increasing their capacity through training to efficiently forecast commodity demand, and manage inventory through proper stock codification, good housekeeping, and automation Keywords: Supply chain management; Public Hospitals; Rivers State, material procurement</jats:p>"

The stoichiometric ratio will be impacted by the sudden change in load and system failure. Under the aforementioned circumstances, precise and timely air supply regulation is required to avoid irreparable PEM damage. In order to enhance the robustness and performance of the fuel cell, a cascaded finite time sliding mode fault‐tolerant control method is proposed for the air supply system of PEMFC. The control objective is to adjust the oxygen excess ratio at the cathode flow field, which can avoid the occurrence of oxygen starvation in the PEM fuel cell when the load current changes rapidly or when fault occurs. A cascaded controller structure is introduced, where, in the inner loop, an adaptive sliding mode controller is designed to reconstruct fault signal and track the optimal output trajectory and, in the outer loop, a finite‐time observer is employed to obtain the expected output trajectory. The proposed control scheme is capable of fault‐tolerant tracking of the optimal oxygen excess ratio within finite time. The effectiveness of proposed fault‐tolerant control algorithm is verified through hardware‐in‐the‐loop (HIL) studies.</jats:p>",

Two-phase passive thermosyphons are widely used among them. To increase the efficiency of such device, a design of a heat stabilizer with a distributed refrigerant supply to the outer surface is proposed. Determining the optimal operating parameters of such device is impossible without a stage of modeling heat and mass transfer. This determines the purpose of the study — the calculation of the temperature distribution in the ground with such heat stabilizer. A calculation is carried out using physico-mathematical model of it with three related tasks: 1) description of the movement of liquid refrigerant through the inner tube of the thermosyphon; 2) calculation of the upward flow of refrigerant in the gap between the outer tube and the segments of the flow separator; 3) calculation of conductive heat transfer in the heat stabilizer-soil system. The modeling is based on the approaches of non-isothermal multiphase mechanics and thermophysics. The temperature profile was calculated in the gap between the flow-separating device consisting of four segments and the heat stabilizer pipe, as well as in the soil at 1 m from the surface of the thermosyphon. The proposed model makes it possible to determine the radial temperature distribution consistent with practical data with an accuracy of 90%. It was found that the use of such separating device can increase the efficiency of reducing soil temperature by 20%.</jats:p>",

In order to evaluate the supply capacity and use status of the ecosystem in Miyun County, so as to better apply the ecosystem services to different policies and management, the supply and use of 10 types of ecosystem services in Miyun County were calculated by using value indicators, namely potential gross ecosystem product (GEP) and actual gross ecosystem product. The results show that: (1) In 2020, potential gross ecosystem product of Miyun County is 254.32 billion yuan, and actual gross ecosystem product is 53.28 billion yuan, accounting for 21% of the potential gross ecosystem product. (2) Among all kinds of ecosystem services, the contribution of water conservation services in potential gross ecosystem product is the highest, and the contribution of climate regulation services in actual gross ecosystem product is the highest. (3) The contribution of wetland was the highest in potential gross ecosystem product, while the contribution of forest was the highest in actual gross ecosystem product. (4) Natural ecosystem area and vegetation coverage are the main factors affecting potential gross ecosystem product, while actual gross ecosystem product is mainly affected by GDP and population. (5) By studying the potential supply and actual use of ecosystem services, we evaluated and distinguished between the services that ecosystem could produce and the services that were actually used by humans, and compared the supply capacity and actual use to assess the sustainability of ecosystem services, in order to formulate different policies and management measures for gross ecosystem product surplus and deficit regions. Potential gross ecosystem product could provide data support for the assessment of ecological protection benefits. Actual gross ecosystem product could be included in the system of national accounts, and as a standard for ecological compensation and ecological trading. Confusing potential supply and actual use in policy application would affect the effect of policy implementation, and distinguishing them could ensure policy implementation. The relative size of the relationship between the two could reflect the present and future levels of human well-being in a region. Both together provided management basis and policy-making support for guiding regional ecological protection and sustainable development.</jats:p>"

Recurring droughts have highlighted town water security deficiencies in regional Australia. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is proven internationally as an effective tool for increasing drought resilience and sustainability of water resources. Uncertainty concerning costs of MAR schemes has been a barrier to wider implementation. This study presents a framework for assessing costs of MAR for well injection and infiltration basin systems across a range of conditions and scales relevant to town water supply. Novel methods were developed to account for uncertainty, capture time-varying volume dependent operating costs, and examine disaggregated capital and operating expenses through global sensitivity analysis. Levelised costs were inversely proportional to scheme scale although diminishing rates of return were shown for larger capacity systems driven by increased volume-dependent operational costs. When accounting for aquifer storage losses, levelised costs of recovered water were up to double the costs of recharge. Global sensitivity analyses revealed input variables that determined the dominant disaggregated costs were also the most sensitive and that these changed in relation to scheme scales and operating conditions. The methods allowed estimated costs and sensitivities for conceptualised MAR schemes for six towns in Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin to be oriented within the envelope of results. This demonstrated the transferability and applicability of results for providing indicative costs and informing specific investigations to reduce uncertainty in viability assessments of MAR over a range of scales and conditions.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical Abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>",

We further analyzed the hydrological connections among the small watersheds within each community using three indicators (network mean, centrality, and k-core). Finally, the clustering results were evaluated on the basis of the small watershed flood peak modulus. The results of this complex network method indicate that the study area contained six large communities and nine small communities. The community-clustering results were reasonable and showed the interconnectedness of the watersheds within each community. The three network indicators adequately described the degree of similarity, the representativeness of the watersheds, and the spatial scales of similar hydrological features. This method should be helpful for addressing the issue of parameter transplantation in ungauged watersheds and implementation of a flood risk management strategy.</jats:p>",

The empirical findings support the indirect role of I4.0 through SCV, and CEP. I4.0‐Tech enables real‐time material and product tracking for SCV. Optimizing material utilization, fostering closed‐loop supply chains, and allowing circular product design enhance CEP. Furthermore, our findings show a positive relationship between SCV, CEP, and SUS. This highlights the need for robust supply chain capabilities in enabling I4.0‐Tech to drive SUS. This paradigm emphasizes recalibrating approaches to SCV and CEP‐focused frameworks to easily include and exploit I4.0‐Tech. This study contributes to the literature and gives actionable insights for managers and policymakers wanting to synergize I4.0‐Tech, SCV, and CEP in industrial processes to promote sustainability goals and a sustainable future.</jats:p>",

Using a difference‐in‐differences approach, we find that Chinese suppliers with direct US corporate customers experience a significant decline in CSR performance, compared with their peers without direct US corporate customers. We also show that the adverse effect of tariff surges on Chinese suppliers’ CSR performance is concentrated among those with a strong cost leadership strategy. However, the CSR performance of Chinese suppliers that have direct US corporate customers with high CSR awareness is not affected by the tariff surges. Further analyses reveal that the negative effects of the trade tensions on CSR performance are felt most strongly by the employees of Chinese suppliers. Taken together, despite the challenges posed by the deglobalization wave to the diffusion of CSR across global supply chains, the increasing demand for CSR involvement from US corporate customers can exert significant pressure on Chinese suppliers’ CSR performance.</jats:p>",

This paper employs evolutionary game theory to investigate the application of blockchain in mitigating financial risks within supply chains, taking into account the technology’s maturity and the risk preferences of financial institutions. By modeling interactions among financial institutions, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and core enterprises within the accounts receivable financing framework, this study evaluates blockchain’s impact on their decision-making and its efficacy in risk reduction. Our findings suggest the transformative potential of blockchain in mitigating financial risks, solving information asymmetry, and enhancing collaboration between financial entities and SMEs. Additionally, we integrate smart contracts into supply chain finance, proposing pragmatic procedures for their deployment in real-world contexts. Via a detailed examination of blockchain’s maturity and financial institutions’ risk preferences, this research demonstrates the primary determinants of strategic decisions in supply chain finance and underscores how blockchain technology fosters system stability using risk mitigation. Our innovative contribution lies in the design of smart contracts for the ARF process, rooted in blockchain’s core attributes of security, transparency, and immutability, thereby ensuring efficient operation and cost reduction in supply chain finance.</jats:p>"

Globally, an estimate of 10–12 million tons of fish is lost per year. FPHLs in SSA are higher than those in other parts of the world. In SSA, the values of fisheries are estimated at 24 billion USD, 1.26% of the GDP of all the African countries and 6% of agriculture GDP. The vast majority of FPHLs in SSA occur at the production (39%), handling (36%), distribution (13%), processing (7%) and consumption (5%). The major factors that cause FPHLs in SSA were long time spent in hauling of fishing gears, spoilage, size discrimination, species preferences, operational losses, animal predation, poor handling practices, lengthy duration of fishing cycle, failure to use ice, lack of storage facilities, lack of transportation and insect infestation. FPHLs amount one third of total production and financial losses of 2–5 billion USD in SSA countries. Furthermore, volarization of fish waste and converting waste into useful substances is a promising approach to reduce fish waste. It can be recommended that improving fish production, live fish handling, processing, preserving, and marketing in SSA could narrow the gap between fish demand and supply.</jats:p>",

Results indicate that the use of management accounting systems increases the extent of supply chain integration, which in turn enhances firm performance. Furthermore, perceived environmental uncertainty moderates the positive associations between the use of management accounting systems, supply chain integration, and firm performance. This study makes several contributions to existing literature. First, it elucidates the role of supply chain integration in promoting partner integration in the Vietnamese context. Second, it reveals the performance implications of the interaction between management accounting systems and supply chain integration. Our findings have important implications for supply chain management because they emphasize the need to develop effective management accounting systems and supply chain integration strategies in the context of environmental uncertainty. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Deep learning (DL) frameworks have become the cornerstone of the rapidly developing DL field. Through installation dependencies specified in the distribution metadata, numerous packages directly or transitively depend on DL frameworks, layer after layer, forming DL package supply chains (SCs), which are critical for DL frameworks to remain competitive. However, vital knowledge on how to nurture and sustain DL package SCs is still lacking. Achieving this knowledge may help DL frameworks formulate effective measures to strengthen their SCs to remain competitive and shed light on dependency issues and practices in the DL SC for researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we explore the domains, clusters, and disengagement of packages in two representative PyPI DL package SCs to bridge this knowledge gap. We analyze the metadata of nearly six million PyPI package distributions and construct version-sensitive SCs for two popular DL frameworks: TensorFlow and PyTorch. We find that popular packages (measured by the number of monthly downloads) in the two SCs cover 34 domains belonging to eight categories.\n            <jats:italic>Applications</jats:italic>\n            ,\n            <jats:italic>Infrastructure</jats:italic>\n            , and\n            <jats:italic>Sciences</jats:italic>\n            categories account for over 85% of popular packages in either SC and TensorFlow and PyTorch SC have developed specializations on\n            <jats:italic>Infrastructure</jats:italic>\n            and\n            <jats:italic>Applications</jats:italic>\n            packages, respectively. We employ the Leiden community detection algorithm and detect 131 and 100 clusters in the two SCs. The clusters mainly exhibit four shapes: Arrow, Star, Tree, and Forest with increasing dependency complexity. Most clusters are Arrow or Star, while Tree and Forest clusters account for most packages (Tensorflow SC: 70.7%, PyTorch SC: 92.9%). We identify three groups of reasons why packages disengage from the SC (i.e., remove the DL framework and its dependents from their installation dependencies): dependency issues, functional improvements, and ease of installation. The most common reason in TensorFlow SC is dependency incompatibility and in PyTorch SC is to simplify functionalities and reduce installation size. Our study provides rich implications for DL framework vendors, researchers, and practitioners on the maintenance and dependency management practices of PyPI DL SCs.\n          </jats:p>",

It is possible that there will be a large increase in demand for technical cadmium in the future. This is in conflict with environmental policies for phasing out cadmium from any technical use worldwide because of its great toxicity to humans. Cadmium toxicity is on par with that of mercury, and data suggests that cadmium exposure has no safe lower limit. There is no shortage of cadmium to extract, and no shortage from lack of cadmium available in the future zinc flow is to be expected. There is a global treaty to ban it from all use. The Integrated Assessment Model WORLD7 was used to assess different aspects of the supply of cadmium to society. It would be possible to produce at least 250,000 tons/year; in reality, the 2023 production is about 24,000 tons/year. The price is about 3500–4500 $/ton and is volatile. Because there is a United Nations agreed global policy to phase out cadmium from all use, demand for cadmium will soon not be met, and there will be an actual shortage of cadmium for any use, including photovoltaic technologies and semiconductors. This is good news for nature, but bad news for the CdTe and CIGS types of photovoltaic panels. It is estimated that only 25% of the planned future capacity may not be available unless good substitutes for cadmium can be found.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Given the pressing requirements for sustainable development in civil aviation, conducting a synergistic evolution analysis of the supply and demand aspects in the airport green development holds great significance. This analysis helps achieve sustainable airport development and facilitates the green transformation of civil aviation development. Taking a collaborative learning approach and utilizing historical data from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport spanning 2008 to 2019, the supply-demand composite system for airport green development was deconstructed into two subsystems—demand and supply—and relevant evaluation index systems were established in this paper. A screening and optimization model of supply and demand synergy indicators for airport green development was constructed, and it was solved using a simulated annealing genetic algorithm. The Haken model was constructed to analyze the synergistic evolutionary relationship of the composite system of supply and demand for green airport development in two stages. The results indicate a shift in the order parameter of the co-evolution of the supply-demand composite system at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, moving from the demand subsystem in the first stage (2008–2015) to the supply subsystem in the second stage (2016–2019). The co-evolution of the airport supply-demand composite system has entered a new stage, but has not reached a high level of synergy. The study not only contributes theoretically by explaining the interaction mechanism between supply and demand for airport green development, but also offers targeted suggestions for achieving high-quality synergistic evolution of supply and demand for airport green development.</jats:p>"

The scientific selection of appropriate water and fertilizer management methods is important for improving the utilization efficiency of agricultural resources and alleviating agricultural non-point source pollution. This study focused on wolfberry and compared the effects of four irrigation levels [full irrigation (W0, 75%–85% θ<jats:sub>f</jats:sub>), slight water deficit (W1, 65%–75% θ<jats:sub>f</jats:sub>), moderate water deficit (W2, 55%–65% θ<jats:sub>f</jats:sub>), and severe water deficit (W3, 45%–55% θ<jats:sub>f</jats:sub>)] and four nitrogen application levels [no nitrogen application (N0, 0 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), low nitrogen application (N1, 150 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), medium nitrogen application (N2, 300 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), and high nitrogen application (N3, 450 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>)] on soil nitrate nitrogen (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N) transport, plant nitrogen allocation, and soil nitrous oxide (N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O) emissions during the harvest period of wolfberry. And this study used CRITIC-entropy weights-TOPSIS model to evaluate 16 water and nitrogen regulation models comprehensively. The results revealed the following: (1) The NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N content of the soil decreased with increasing horizontal distance from the wolfberry. It initially decreased, then increased, and finally decreased with an increase in soil depth. The average NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N content in the 0–100 cm soil layer ranged from 3.95–13.29 mg·kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, indicating that W0 &amp;gt; W1, W2, W3, and N3 &amp;gt; N2 &amp;gt; N1 &amp;gt; N0. (2) The soil NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N accumulation ranged from 64.45–215.27 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> under varying water and nitrogen levels, demonstrating a decreasing trend with increasing horizontal distance. The NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N accumulation at each horizontal distance increased with increasing irrigation and nitrogen application. The NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N accumulation of W0N3 treatment increased by 5.55%–57.60% compared with the other treatments. (3) The total nitrogen content and nitrogen uptake in all wolfberry organs were W1 &amp;gt; W0 &amp;gt; W2 &amp;gt; W3, and N2 &amp;gt; N3 &amp;gt; N1 &amp;gt; N0. The maximum total nitrogen content and nitrogen uptake in W1N2 treatment were 3.25% and 27.82 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the roots, 3.30% and 57.19 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the stems, 3.91% and 11.88 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the leaves, and 2.42% and 63.56 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the fruits, respectively. (4) The emission flux and total emission of N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O increased with increasing irrigation and nitrogen application. The emission flux exhibited a transient peak (116.39–177.91 ug·m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>·h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) after irrigation. The intensity of N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions initially decreased and then increased with an increase in the irrigation amount. It also initially increased with increasing nitrogen application amount, then decreased, and finally increased again. The maximum emission intensity was observed under the W3N3 treatment (0.23 kg·kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). The N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emission coefficients ranged from 0.17%–0.39%, in the order of W0 &amp;gt; W1 &amp;gt; W2 &amp;gt; W3 (except for N1) and N1 &amp;gt; N2 &amp;gt; N3. (5) Under varying water and nitrogen concentrations, N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emission flux showed a positive linear correlation with soil pore water content and NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N content and a negative linear correlation with soil temperature. The comprehensive evaluation revealed that a slight water deficit (65%–75% θ<jats:sub>f</jats:sub>) combined with medium nitrogen application (300 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) decreased soil NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N leaching, increased nitrogen uptake, and reduced N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emission. These findings can serve as a reference for improving the efficiency and reducing emissions of wolfberry in the Yellow River irrigation region of Gansu Province and in similar climate zones.</jats:p>"

Four rations were randomly allotted to four rumen-cannulated lambs (BW = 37.4 ± 4.9 kg) using a 4 × 4 Latin square design to assess the effect of increasing levels (0, 15, 30 and 45% DM basis) of foliage of Brosimum alicastrum on a basal ration of M. maximus. Organic matter intake and water consumption increased linearly (p &lt; 0.01) with increasing levels of B. alicastrum in the ration. The rate and potential extent of rumen fermentation of OM and CP of B. alicastrum were 10.6%/h and 86.6% and 11.4%/h and 95.2%, respectively, but no effect (p &gt; 0.05) was found on the potential rumen degradation of DM (40.2%) or on the rate of degradation of DM (0.033%/h) of M. maximus, although a positive effect was found in the rumen degradation rate of NDF (p &lt; 0.05). VFA and ammonia concentration in the rumen and the rate of passage of solids and liquids through the rumen (k1) increased linearly (p &lt; 0.01) with increasing levels of B. alicastrum. Rumen pH was not affected by the incorporation of B. alicastrum (p &gt; 0.05). Microbial nitrogen supply to the small intestine (p &lt; 0.001), apparent digestibility of dry matter (p &lt; 0.01) and NDF (p &lt; 0.05) of the rations were also significantly increased as a result of the incorporation of B. alicastrum foliage. Results from this experiment suggest that the foliage of Brosimum alicastrum can be readily incorporated at around 30% of the ration of dry matter in hair sheep with beneficial effects on feed intake, rate of passage and microbial N supply to the lower tract.</jats:p>"

Voltage sags can seriously affect the output voltage of switching power supply and the working condition of its power supply equipment; at the same time, the working scenarios of power equipment using switching power supply often have different level of harmonic problems. Considering the continuous innovation of switching power supply technology, the previous analysis and test results on the effect of voltage sags and harmonics on switching power supplies may no longer be applicable. The paper reveals the mechanism of the effect of harmonic alone as well as voltage sag superimposed harmonics on the output voltage of the switching power supply. Then the test research program was developed, and four different brands switching power supplies were selected for the test research, with which the effects of different amplitude voltage sags, harmonics with different frequencies and distortion, as well as voltage sag superimposed harmonics on the output voltage of switching power supplies were investigated. The results show that the tolerance ability of switching power supplies to voltage sags has been improved compared with previous switching power supplies, and the harmonic itself has less effect on the output voltage of switching power supply, but the joint action of harmonics and voltage sags will have a greater effect on the output voltage of switching power supply. © 2024 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan and Wiley Periodicals LLC.</jats:p>",

This study is conducted in the context of the Taquari-Antas Hydrographic Basin, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and assesses the quality of drinking water in 101 rural properties, focusing on identifying problems of potability, especially regarding excessive fluoride concentration, which is a known problem for the water in this region. The study involves the collection of water samples from rural properties, a survey to understand water use and quality perception by users, and water quality analysis using established analytical methodologies. Results show that 58.4% of the investigated rural properties have potability issues, with excessive fluoride being the most prevalent concern, affecting 39.6% of properties. High fluoride levels have significant health implications, including dental and skeletal fluorosis, with global relevance. To address this issue, activated bone charcoal filtration systems were installed in ten properties, effectively reducing fluoride concentrations to within acceptable limits for human consumption. These defluoridation systems are characterized as sustainable, cost-effective, and scalable, offering a practical solution for regions facing similar challenges.\r\nKeywords: groundwater, rural properties, water stewardship.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The fundamental component of the ecological compensation system, as well as the crucial basis for its efficient functioning, is calculating the ecological compensation amount and establishing the ecological compensation standard. This study integrates the ecological footprint with natural capital monetization and other methods by introducing a natural capital accounting system. From the standpoint of natural capital supply and demand, it also builds an accounting framework for ecological compensation standards that is standardized, dynamic, and regionally differentiated while taking local socioeconomic aspects into account. We determined the amount of ecological compensation by using Xinjiang as the research object and calculating and analyzing the features of regional and temporal changes in the monetary and physical quantities of natural capital in Xinjiang from 2010 to 2020. The findings show that from 2010 to 2020, Xinjiang’s ecological footprint increased by 1.26 times in physical terms and 1.21 times in monetary terms and that its ecological carrying capacity increased by 4.13% in physical terms and 9.42% in monetary terms. The ecological deficit continues to grow in physical and monetary terms, with a per capita ecological deficit in 2020 of 19.92 s-nha/cap and 70,100 CNY/cap in physical and monetary terms, respectively. The amount of ecological compensation required to be paid in Xinjiang increased from CNY 5659 million to CNY 10,259 million, and the per capita ecological compensation payment standard increased from 259.42 CNY/cap/yr to 396.11 CNY/cap/yr. In summary, Xinjiang’s natural capital supply is insufficient to meet the demand for consumption, and the ecological deficit is growing with time, necessitating the payment of ecological compensation. The study’s results lay the foundation for formulating and implementing ecological compensation policies in Xinjiang and provide theoretical support for constructing ecological civilization in Xinjiang. In addition, the ecological compensation accounting framework constructed in this study organically integrates natural capital theory, ecosystem services, and socioeconomic influencing factors, which enriches the methodology of accounting for ecological compensation standards, and, at the same time, can be used as a paradigm of a dynamic and equitable ecological compensation accounting framework to further promote its use at different scales and regions.</jats:p>"

To fill this research gap, this study investigates the multivariate relationship from internal capabilities and external relationships mutually complementary perspective to improve supply chain sustainability. Grounded on dynamic capabilities theory and relational view, we put forward the supply chain dynamic capability construct under the internal perspective, and relationship construct with supply chain members under the external perspective. Based on the configuration theory, 270 data from enterprises were analyzed using fsQCA (fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis), and the results shows that: first, there is no necessary condition for generating high supply chain sustainability, which means that individual factors do not lead to high supply chain sustainability; second, this study identified two paths to achieve high supply chain sustainability: capability‐driven and relationship‐driven, which reflects the multiple paths and complex mechanisms to achieve high supply chain sustainability; third, this study finds the important role of supply chain dynamic reconfiguring capability in forming high supply chain sustainability. These results can provide some theoretical guidance for enterprises to improve supply chain sustainability and achieve high quality economic development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Wind and solar power curtailment and the difficulty of peak regulation are issues that urgently need to be addressed in the process of China’s new electric power system. Enterprises with captive power plants (ECPPs) are large-capacity power consumers and producers, with significant optimization and adjustment potential on both the supply and demand sides. This paper aims to promote the active participation of ECPPs in grid supply–demand regulation and proposes an optimization model for the power generation and consumption of ECPPs based on a day-ahead, intra-day two-stage dispatching model. First, targeting demand response scenarios, mathematical models for analyzing the potential of ECPPs to participate in power grid supply–demand regulation are proposed. Then, an optimization model for ECPP generation and consumption with load regulation is established, and a two-stage dispatching model is proposed to fully mobilize the regulation flexibility of ECPPs. Finally, a robust dispatching model considering price uncertainty is established based on information gap decision theory. The case results show that ECPPs can reduce the curtailment rate in a region by approximately 9%, alleviate the peak pressure of the power grid, reduce carbon emissions by 1373.55 tons, and promote low-carbon development for themselves. Meanwhile, considering price uncertainty strengthens the risk resistance capability of ECPPs and provides a basis for their willingness to participate in supply–demand regulation.</jats:p>"

Due to the widespread integration of renewable energy generation into urban electrical grids, an increasing number of power electronic devices are being connected to the grid, which has a certain impact on harmonic power flow. Firstly, the harmonic components of 6-pulse and 12-pulse rectifiers are analyzed for the switching power supply model widely used in the distribution network. Secondly, the equivalent parameter models of the generator, the transformer, and the lines are reviewed. Finally, from the perspective of power balance, a harmonic power flow model considering the terminal switching power supplies and the correlation between impedance and frequency is proposed.

We demonstrate that the tone of buyers' annual reports promotes suppliers' green innovation, showing a spillover effect on the supply chain. Furthermore, the signal strength and effectiveness may be affected by the signal environment. Specifically, buyers' power over suppliers (supply chain environment) and suppliers' industry competition (industry environment) positively moderate the spillover effects of green innovation.

In this study, by using low-cost PP fibers hybridized with PE fibers and adjusting the fly ash/ground granulated blast furnace slag (FA/GGBS) ratio, cost-effective, high-performing hybrid PE/PP-reinforced engineered geopolymer composites (H-EGCs) were developed. This study conducted axial compressive and tensile tests on H-EGCs with different FA/GGBS ratios (7:3, 6:4, and 5:5) and PP fiber replacement ratios (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%), investigated the influence of FA/GGBS and PP fiber replacement ratio on static mechanical behavior, and evaluated the economic and environmental benefits based on mechanical performance indicators. The result indicated that the compressive strength of H-EGCs can reach 120 MPa when the FA/GGBS ratio is 5:5; however, an increase in FA/GGBS and PP fiber replacement ratio leads to a loss in compressive strength and elastic modulus. The incorporation of PP fibers in moderate amounts enhances ultimate tensile strain by reducing crack control ability, and the maximum tensile deformation capacity (7.82–9.66%) was obtained for H-EGCs with a PP fiber replacement ratio of 50%. The optimal economic and environmental benefits of H-EGCs are observed when the FA/GGBS ratio is 5:5 and the PP fiber replacement ratio is set at 50%.</jats:p>"

This study examines the current supply and demand of medical cannabis on Malaysian Facebook Pages. Researchers searched for cannabis Facebook Pages in Malay and English between April and June 2022, using the keywords associated with cannabis and marijuana in popular search engines. The Facebook content, including the posts and users’ responses to supply and demand information for medical cannabis, were screened and analysed. Subsequently, the contents of the Facebook Pages were categorised into five themes: (1) demand for medical cannabis; (2) testimony; (3) supply information; (4) adverse health effects of medical cannabis; and (5) product types and routes of administration. The findings indicate that medical cannabis is available online and searchable via popular search engines, despite being illegal in Malaysia. A total of 46 Facebook Pages related to cannabis were identified in this study, where 13 pages sell medical cannabis directly, and 3 sell both medical and recreational cannabis. In addition to private messages via Facebook Messenger, most pages share contact details. The information on the sampled Facebook Pages reflected the growing demand and illegal sales of medical cannabis in Malaysia via online platforms since 2012. Thus, there is an urgent need for proper regulations and laws to control medical cannabis usage besides protecting patients against potentially harmful medical cannabis online.</jats:p>"

We test a new space‐based remote sensing product, spatially and temporally complete (STC) MODSCAG fractional snow‐covered area (fSCA), as input for the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) operational US West‐wide WSF system. fSCA data were considered alongside traditional SNOTEL predictors, in both statistical and AI‐based NRCS operational hydrologic models, throughout the forecast season, in four test watersheds (Walker, Wind, Piedra, and Gila Rivers in California, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico). Outcomes from over 200 WSF models suggest fSCA‐enabled accuracy gains are most consistent and explainable for short‐lead, late‐season forecasts (roughly 10%–25% improvements, typically), which in operational practice can be challenging as snowlines rise above in situ measurement sites. Gains are roughly proportional to how thoroughly spring‐summer runoff is dominated by snowmelt, and how poorly in situ networks monitor late‐season snowpack. fSCA also improved accuracy for long‐lead, early‐season forecasts, which are similarly problematic in WSF practice, but not for WSFs issued around the time of peak snow accumulation, when in situ measurements reasonably characterize mountain snowpack available for upcoming spring‐summer snowmelt. The AI‐based hydrologic model generally outperformed the statistical model and, in some cases, better‐capitalized on satellite remote sensing. Additionally, preliminary analyses suggest reasonable WSF skill in many cases using fSCA as the sole predictor, potentially useful in sparsely monitored regions; and that combining satellite and in situ products in data‐driven hydrologic models using genetic algorithm‐based predictor selection could help guide new SNOTEL site selection.</jats:p>",

In order to seek the optimal strategy of evolutionary game in the implementation of green supply chain management and explore the influence of environmental regulation intensity and public preference degree on the evolution process of green supply chain management diffusion development, this paper takes the study of green supply chain management diffusion as the core innovation point, and under the premise of environmental regulation, selects the government, the core enterprise, and the public as the participating bodies of green supply chain management diffusion, and uses the theory of evolutionary game to construct a diffusion model of green supply chain management. Using evolutionary game theory to construct a diffusion model, and with the help of MATLAB and other mathematical tools for numerical simulation analysis, we discuss the diffusion of the green supply chain and derive the optimal combination strategy. The results of the study show that: (1) there are four evolutionary stable states in the process of green supply chain management diffusion: preliminary diffusion, extinction, semi-diffusion, and full diffusion; (2) it will be beneficial for the government to promote the evolutionary diffusion of green supply chain management by implementing a higher intensity of pollution tax policy while implementing green supply chain incentive strategies; (3) the government, while implementing environmental regulation policies, should also pay attention to the guidance of the public’s awareness of environmental friendliness and greenness, and focus on the role of the comprehensive strategy selection of the three parties of the game in reaching the optimal state. The conclusions of the study provide theoretical guidance and decision support for the implementation and diffusion of green supply chain management under environmental regulation.</jats:p>"

In the desert ecosystem of Northwest China, shrubs are often foraged by camels and this causes the shrubs lost their aboveground tissues. Although the aboveground tissue could recover after the disturbance, the mechanisms of resprouts’ recovery after the disturbance are still poorly understood. We investigated the morphological and physiological characteristics and root water uptake sources of resprouts and non-disturbed seedlings of four desert shrub species that were often foraged by camels.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The results showed that the resprouts grew rapidly after the removal of aboveground tissue. The height and aboveground biomass of resprouts reached the level of 5-year-old seedlings following a growing season. Compared to un-disturbed seedlings, higher leaf water potential, leaf hydraulic conductance and photosynthesis rate were observed in resprouts, indicating that resprouts grew rapidly after disturbance. Furthermore, we found that the root water uptake source did not change after disturbance. This indicated that the roots of resprouts kept intact water uptake capacity after disturbance, which could keep supplying sufficient water to the aboveground tissue. Due to the removal of aboveground tissue of the resprouts, the water demand of aboveground tissue decreased, which induced an imbalance of water supply from roots to demand of aboveground tissues of resprouts.

Traditional water treatment processes have proven to be inadequate in effectively removing microplastics. Besides, previous studies have often utilized disinfectant dosages that surpass those commonly employed in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), and the biotoxicity changes induced by microplastics after disinfection remain largely unexplored. To address these knowledge gaps, our study aimed to investigate the impact of practical disinfectant dosages on the leaching of organic compounds from microplastics and the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Furthermore, the resulting acute and genetic toxicity was evaluated through bioassays. Our findings revealed an elevated release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from microplastics. Additionally, both acute and genetic toxicity increased following various disinfection processes. Specifically, chlorination exhibited the highest level of toxicity in short-term disinfection, while the pretreatment of ozonation followed by residual chlorination demonstrated the highest toxicity in the long-term disinfection, which was correlated with the concentration of CHCl3 formed. These findings will advance our understanding of the potential risks associated with microplastics during various disinfection processes, with the ultimate goal of safeguarding water supplies.</jats:p>",

Ensuring their reliable and uninterrupted operation requires continuous monitoring and diagnostics of their technical condition.\nThe diagnosis of distributed water supply systems depends on many factors, which can be both deterministic and random. At present, this is a complex task due to the diversity of processes affecting the parameters of the water supply network's operational state. The non-stationarity of data, caused by cyclic changes in flow rate and pressure over time, also makes their diagnosis challenging. For precise diagnosis of the state of distributed water supply systems, it is necessary to consider not only typical emergency situations but also anomalous water consumption conditions and peculiarities of pressure management system operation.\nThe article proposes a mathematical model for assessing the reliability of electrical engineering complexes in distributed water supply systems for the purpose of their diagnostics. The model is based on the analysis of failure probabilities of various components and subsystems of the complex. The research aims to help identify problematic areas in the water supply system and prevent potential emergency situations. The research results can be used to improve the safety and efficiency of water supply systems, as well as to optimize resource management. The use of the mathematical model in conjunction with modern diagnostic technologies can significantly improve the management of water supply infrastructure and ensure the reliable operation of electrical complexes.\nA convenient indicator for assessing the diagnosis of the technical condition of electrical engineering complexes in distributed water supply systems is the probability of failure downtime, which reflects both the frequency of failure occurrence and the duration of downtime. For assessing the reliability of the consumer water supply system, it is expedient to use such an indicator: the probability of safe downtime, which takes into account both the frequency of failures and the permissible duration of downtime under safety conditions.</jats:p>"

However, research on the interfacial bonding performance between SFCBs and concrete remains inadequate. This study conducted central pullout tests on SFCB-concrete specimens with different concrete strengths (C30, C50, and C70), bar diameters (12, 16 and 20 mm), and hoop reinforcement constraints, analyzing variations in failure modes, bond-slip curves, bond strength, etc. Additionally, finite element simulations were performed using ABAQUS software to further validate the bonding mechanism of SFCB-concrete. The results showed that the failure mode of the specimens was related to the confinement effect on the bars. Insufficient concrete cover and lack of hoop restraint led to splitting failure, whereas pullout failure occurred otherwise. For the specimens with pullout failure, the interfacial damage between the SFCB and concrete was mainly caused by the surface fibers wear of the bar and the shear of the concrete lugs, which indicated that the bond of the SFCB-concrete interface consisted mainly of mechanical interlocking forces. In addition, the variation of concrete strength as well as bar diameter did not affect the bond-slip relationship of SFCB-concrete. However, the bond strength of SFCB-concrete increased with the increase of concrete strength. For example, compared with C30 concrete, when the concrete strength was increased to C70, the bond strength of the specimens under the same conditions was increased to 50–101.6%. In contrast, the bond strength of the specimens decreased by 13.29–28.71% when the bar diameter was increased from 12 to 14 mm. These discoveries serve as valuable references for the implementation of sustainable SFCB-reinforced concrete structures.</jats:p>"

The importance of each driving factor was quantitatively analyzed on account of the model’s operation results. The results showed: the order of importance of driver levels is technology-driven &gt; economic-driven &gt; market-driven &gt; government-driven &gt; supply chain coordination-driven. The key driving factors are summarized based on the ranking of driving factor indicators in each dimension, providing a reference for participants in PBSCs to adopt low-carbon measures and providing a basis for government departments to formulate carbon emission-reduction strategies.</jats:p>"

We aimed to disentangle where challenges exist hierarchically and administratively through the application of process mapping to the supply chain of an integrated community case management (iCCM) intervention in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We conducted a document review, semi-structured key informant interviews, and focus group discussions with program agents involved in supply chain processes of the child health intervention. Enterprise architecture was used to map the intervention’s supply chain and its participatory actors, and detailed bottlenecks of the chain through the application of a health systems framework. The results of this study will be used to inform a system dynamics model of the supply chain of iCCM in DRC. The greatest bottlenecks leading to stockouts at the community level occurred upstream (from national to province and from zone to health facility). While the use of local procurement processes was partially attempted to strengthen systems, parallel supply chain activities compromised sustainable system integration and development. Initial delays in stock dispensation were due to international procurement at the supplier, inducing a trickle-down effect. Inadequate quantification of supply needs and subsequent insufficient product procuration were the single most important steps that led to stockouts. This study demonstrated that the community health supply chain would be most impacted by improvements made in processes at the highest administrative strata, while exposing its delicate dependence on activities at the lowest levels. Visibility of inventory at all levels and improved data quality and use through a transparent tracking system have the potential to significantly reduce stockouts. Future interventions should take care to not develop parallel processes or exclude local health system agents to avoid disruption and ensure sustainable health outcome gains. Causal loop studies and system dynamics can further identify the systems interactions and relationships and their underlying causal mechanisms in need of intervention.</jats:p>"

Biosynthesis of AVE “a” components requires 2‐methylbutyryl‐CoA (MBCoA) as starter unit, and malonyl‐CoA (MalCoA) and methylmalonyl‐CoA (MMCoA) as extender units. We describe here a novel strategy for increasing B1a production by enhancing acyl‐CoA precursor supply. First, we engineered meilingmycin (MEI) polyketide synthase (PKS) for increasing MBCoA precursor supply. The loading module (using acetyl‐CoA as substrate), extension module 7 (using MMCoA as substrate) and TE domain of MEI PKS were assembled to produce 2‐methylbutyrate, providing the starter unit for B1a production. Heterologous expression of the newly designed PKS (termed Mei‐PKS) in <jats:italic>S. avermitilis</jats:italic> wild‐type (WT) strain increased MBCoA level, leading to B1a titer 262.2 μg/mL – 4.36‐fold higher than WT value (48.9 μg/mL). Next, we separately inhibited three key nodes in essential pathways using CRISPRi to increase MalCoA and MMCoA levels in WT. The resulting strains all showed increased B1a titer. Combined inhibition of these key nodes in Mei‐PKS expression strain increased B1a titer to 341.9 μg/mL. Overexpression of fatty acid β‐oxidation pathway genes in the strain further increased B1a titer to 452.8 μg/mL – 8.25‐fold higher than WT value. Finally, we applied our precursor supply strategies to high‐yield industrial strain A229. The strategies, in combination, led to B1a titer 8836.4 μg/mL – 37.8% higher than parental A229 value. These findings provide an effective combination strategy for increasing AVE B1a production in WT and industrial <jats:italic>S. avermitilis</jats:italic> strains, and our precursor supply strategies can be readily adapted for overproduction of other polyketides.</jats:p>",

This involves steering reactor microbiomes to yield desired products, with CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply playing a crucial role in controlling ethanol-based chain elongation and facilitating various bioprocesses simultaneously. In the absence of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply (Phase I), chain elongation predominantly led to n-caproate with a high selectivity of 96 Cmol%, albeit leaving approximately 80% of ethanol unconverted. During this phase, <jats:italic>C. kluyveri</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Proteiniphilum</jats:italic>-related species dominated the reactors. In Phase II, with low CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> input (2.0 NmL L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), formation of n-butyrate, butanol, and hexanol was stimulated. Increasing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> doses in Phase III (6 NmL L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) led to CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> utilization via homoacetogenesis, coinciding with the enrichment of <jats:italic>Clostridium luticellarii</jats:italic>, a bacterium that can use CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as an electron acceptor. Lowering CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> dose to 0.5 NmL L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> led to a shift in microbiome composition, diminishing the dominance of <jats:italic>C. luticellarii</jats:italic> while increasing <jats:italic>C. kluyveri</jats:italic> abundance. Additionally, other <jats:italic>Clostridia</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Proteiniphilum</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Lactobacillus sakei</jats:italic>-related species became prevalent.

The decreased ethanol oxidation coincided with the resurgence of hydrogen formation at partial pressures above 1%. High concentrations of butyrate, caproate, and ethanol in the reactor, along with low acetate concentration, promoted the formation of butanol and hexanol. It is evident that CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply is indispensable for controlling chain elongation in an open culture and it can be harnessed to stimulate higher alcohol formation or induce CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> utilization as an electron acceptor.</jats:p>"

Existing literature falls short of offering decision support (DS) models to address the barriers and strategies to designing SHSC. To this end, this study develops a DS model that identifies and prioritizes the barriers to SHSC and determines optimal strategies for mitigating those barriers. This study adopted both qualitative and quantitative approaches. As part of the qualitative approach, a field study was applied using in-depth interviews to determine the barriers and corresponding strategies, while under the quantitative approach, a quality function deployment (QFD) integrated optimization technique was used to prioritize barriers and determine optimal strategies to mitigate the SHSC barriers. The study found that a lack of contingency planning, the prevalence of corruption and political interference, and a lack of social and environmental awareness are the most important barriers, while logistics outsourcing, supply chain (SC) performance management, and SC flexibility are the most essential strategies. We also found that our DS model is highly flexible and can be adapted under different scenarios, which makes the model applicable to different contexts. This study has a significant contribution to literature and practice. We developed a novel decision model that captured cost savings and leveraged both cost and time savings from interrelated strategies to determine the best optimal strategy while applying QFD-integrated optimization modeling. The paper’s findings will assist humanitarian SC managers in designing an effective, efficient, and sustainable humanitarian SC.</jats:p>",

Due to the no‐load consumption of the Diesel Generators (DGs), fuel savings are only possible when the DGs are shut down. This requires a proper implementation of the frequency control to avoid perturbations because of the wind speed variations. During wind‐only (WO) operation, the Synchronous Machine (SM) generates the isolated grid voltage and the frequency controller varies the energy stored/supplied by an Energy Storage System and consumed by the controllable loads to balance the power. In this paper, a Battery‐based Energy Storage System (BESS) uses Li‐Ion batteries with a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) and a grid‐tie inverter connected to the isolated network. The controllable load is an Irrigation Water Supply System (IWSS), consisting of a pump supplying water to a reservoir tank. The pump is driven by a variable speed drive that uses a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM). The coordinated control of BESS and IWSS gives full priority to the BESS for harnessing the wind potential whereas the IWSS consumes the excess of wind power. The full Wind Diesel Power System (WDPS) is modelled and simulated to validate the proposed system for different case scenarios.</jats:p>",

Leveraging a sample of 302 SMEs in China, the study employs SEM techniques to validate the direct effect of ICTs on the digital integration capability, and the relationship between the digital integration capability and firm financial performance. Furthermore, the LMS technique is applied to investigate the moderating role of government support and cognitive constraints within these relationships. Result shows that: (1) ICTs positively affect firm’s supply chain digital integration capability; (2) firm’s supply chain digital integration capability positively affects firm financial performance; (3) perceived government support exhibits an antagonistic effect, hindering the promotion of supply chain digital integration capabilities through ICT infrastructures; (4) Certain cognitive constraints related to digital transformation act as negative moderators within the digital transformation process. Through the exploration of two previously overlooked factors, namely perceived government support and cognitive constraints related to digital transformation, our research contributes to a deepened understanding of dynamic capability theory, social cognitive theory, and organizational inertia theory. Our findings suggest that government policymakers must reassess the effectiveness and objectives of policies in the digital transformation journey. Furthermore, firms are urged to acknowledge and address the potential adverse effects of cognitive constraints within their organizations and among their supply chain partners. Emphasizing the importance of digital integration capability is also crucial. </jats:p>",

This paper aims to consider the effectiveness and shortcomings of emergency water supply based on local wells and to support policy formulation regarding groundwater usage in the event of a disaster. In Kamisu City, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, not only public-operated formal water supply points using water trucks but also informal water supply points using private wells were open to address water outages following the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011. This study clarified the pattern of appearance and spatial distribution of those points by combining information from local newspapers, Internet archives, and an original questionnaire survey. In addition, the function of informal water supply points was quantitatively evaluated using GIS by comparing cases with and without informal water supply points. Analysis revealed that informal water supply points expanded the size of the serviced population within a 500-m radius of the water supply points by 47%, compared with cases when only formal water supply points were available. However, well water was not necessarily suitable for drinking owing to quality issues. As a policy lesson, the importance of sharing well information is indicated.</jats:p>",

This research paper presents an integrated model of an AC and DC traction power system (TPS), along with a unified chain equivalent circuit model, the ground wire through the AC section, and the insulation joints fixed in the AC–DC neutral section under different operating positions. To make a unified impedance and admittance matrix for traction network, a virtual conductor wire has been added in the DC section to make the balance order of the TPS. The influence of reflex system configuration on rail potential, stray current, and distribution of rail potential at AC and DC stations has also been calculated. The simulation results demonstrate that establishing the insulation joints in the AC–DC section and using ground wires in the AC part can significantly decrease the stray current and rail potential.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, while supplier diversity efforts are not yet widespread, these initiatives are increasingly common, especially in the form of references to diversity in companies’ supplier codes of conduct. Companies in North America and in certain economic sectors, such as the financial and healthcare sectors, are more likely to have such efforts in place. Based on our data, companies that report on their internal diversity and companies that have other forms of supplier sustainability initiatives are also more likely to have supplier diversity initiatives. We argue further that supplier diversity efforts will follow a trajectory similar to other supplier sustainability efforts. Finally, we suggest possible avenues for future research on supplier diversity. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The declining availability of natural sand resources and the significant carbon footprint associated with the extensive use of cement are posing severe limitations on the advancement and application of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC). In this study, waste tyre-derived recycled crumb rubber particles (CR) were employed to replace quartz sand, and an alkali-activated cementitious material was used to produce waste tyre-alkali-activated UHPC (T-UHPAC). The influence of different CR replacement ratios (0%, 5%, 20%, 35%, 50%) on the tensile and flexural performance of T-UHPAC was investigated, and a predictive model for the stress–strain response considering the CR replacement ratio was established. An optimization method for improving the tensile and flexural performance of T-UHPAC was proposed. The results indicate that the effect of rough-surfaced CR on the interfacial properties of concrete differs from that of smooth quartz sand. A CR replacement ratio exceeding 35% led to a reduction in both the tensile and flexural strengths of UHPAC, while a replacement ratio at or below 20% resulted in a superior tensile and flexural performance of T-UHPAC. The established predictive model for tensile performance accurately forecasts the stress–strain behaviour of T-UHPAC under varying CR replacement ratios, with the accuracy improving as the CR replacement ratio increases. By utilizing CR to replace quartz sand in proportions not exceeding 20%, the production of low-carbon UHPC with exceptional comprehensive mechanical properties is achievable. Moreover, the development of T-UHPAC through the comprehensive utilization of waste tyres presents a promising and innovative approach for the low-carbon and cost-effective production of UHPC, thereby facilitating the sustainable development of natural resources. This research represents a significant step towards the widespread adoption and application of UHPC and thus holds substantial importance.</jats:p>"

To do this, a multi-method and multi-study approach was adopted. Phase 1 of the study employed a qualitative approach to explore supply chain risk factors and their mitigation strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Phase 2, the quality function deployment technique was used alongside quantitative case studies to determine the most critical risk factors and most crucial resilience strategies. The final phase, Phase 3, used fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to determine the alternative portfolio of strategies for SCP to create flexibility when employing resilience strategies. The results revealed that implementing resilience strategies alone is ineffective in improving SCP, while resilience strategies combined with the nullification of risk factors enhance SCP. The study also revealed two alternative configurations of resilience strategies to tackle the relevant risk factors. These findings can be used to guide managers toward identifying the most suitable configuration of resilience strategies to manage severe and unprecedented supply chain risk. The alternative configurations of resilience strategies can also provide flexibility to managers in deciding the best course of action for their firms.</jats:p>",

Methods. 12 sheep of Altai breed were divided into 2 equal groups. Classical techniques of pulmonary ventilation and cardiopulmonary bypass were simulated in the CPB group. The sheep of the CPB + NO group were supplied with 80 ppm nitric oxide (via respiratory circuit or extracorporeal circulation circuit) during mechanical ventilation and cardiopulmonary bypass. The gas supply started immediately after tracheal intubation and continued until the end of the experiment. In both groups, the cardiopulmonary bypass time was 90 min, after which the sheep were switched to spontaneous circulation and observed for 60 min. Subsequently, blood was sampled, and the animals were withdrawn from the experiment with subsequent collection of histologic specimens.<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>. Statistically significant intergroup differences in P / F-index level before the end of the experiment were found (p = 0.041). Nitric oxide supply was associated with decreased infiltrate density in the lung parenchyma (p = 0.006) and increased alveolar area (p &lt; 0.001).<jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>. Supply of NO during modelling of cardiopulmonary bypass in experimental animals improves the morphological and functional state of the lungs by reducing inflammation, vascular changes and damage to the respiratory part of the lungs (structure of alveoli, alveolar passages and pneumocytes). Clinical studies are needed to investigate pulmonoprotective properties of NO in humans.</jats:p>"

In this model, source–network–load–storage resources are cost-optimally planned, including the lines, soft open point (SOP), building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), building-integrated wind turbine (BIWT), building-integrated energy storage system (ESS), etc. To enhance fault recovery capability during extreme faults, fault scenarios are incorporated into the distribution system operation via coupled multiple recovery stages. The resilience-oriented planning is a thorny problem due to its source–network–load–storage couplings, normal-fault couplings, etc. The original resilience-oriented planning is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which can then be solved with a two-stage method and evaluated via a multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. The proposed planning methodology is benchmarked over a Portugal 54-node urban distribution system to verify the superiority and effectiveness on the system economy and resilience levels. Case studies show that the proposed methodology can exploit the optimal synergies of different source–network–load–storage components and enhance system dispatchability.</jats:p>"

Field experiments were conducted over a three-year period from 2020 to 2022, measuring physiological, growth, and yield parameters. To get insight into the physiological state of the plants, we measured the soluble sugars content and the ratio of stable carbon isotopes in the flag leaf tissue, which reflects conditions during its formation. The dominant factors that influenced the measured parameters were the genotypes and seasons, as well as their interaction, rather than other experimental factors. The results showed that the Spitfire and Accordine varieties were the best performing in both the 2020 and 2021 seasons, as indicated by their yield. However, in the drier 2022 season, the yield of these two varieties decreased significantly (to 55% for Spitfire and to 69% for Accordine of their yield in 2021), while for the arid-region genotypes, it remained at the same level as the previous year. This study sheds light on the potential of various genotypes to withstand periods of drought and the effectiveness of using potassium application and S. indica inoculation as mitigation approaches.</jats:p>"

Thus, it is possible to infer that there is a causal link between circularity and supply chain performance. However, the analysis of this relationship occurs under subjective perspectives. To computationally process human language can overcome this issue. Hence, this paper aims to propose an approach for assessing the influence of circular economy (CE) implementation principles on supply chain performance using the fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), a well‐established soft computing technique. The study develops a computational model and brings an illustrative application. Methodologically, is model‐based, quantitative, axiomatic and descriptive. It contributes by providing means to support the formulation of strategies for aligning CE implementation efforts with supply chain performance improvement efforts. The FCM visually represents how supply chain performance attributes are influenced by CE principles, supporting informed decision‐making towards circularity.</jats:p>",

Yet, in this paper, we show that despite these problems, there is a lot of dynamism in demand and supply of these nutrient‐dense products in Africa: (1) macro evidence of “domestic supply booms\"—with supply growing as fast as or faster than in Asia and Latin America; (2) only 2–4% of FV, and 10% of AP consumption in Africa is imported, and only about 1–2% of the output of FV and AP is exported: the supply booms have thus been overwhelming domestically sourced, not imported; (3) micro evidence of substantial shares of consumption of FV and AP in total food consumption, similar to Asia's; (4) evidence of rapid development of spontaneous clusters of farms and off‐farm SMEs (output wholesalers, logistics, processors, and agro‐dealers supporting farmers). These clusters are important in fueling the supply booms. Illustrative cases from Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia are presented. We recommend that African governments and international partners: (1) internalize the fact that these spontaneous clusters are forming and already fueling supply booms; (2) note that important drivers of the booms have been government investments in wholesale markets, roads, and other infrastructure like electrification, and agricultural research/extension; (3) leverage and support existing spontaneous clusters and help new ones to form by greatly increasing those three types of public investments.</jats:p>",

Indeed, the existing body of literature does not offer detailed analyses of the pathways and effects concerning the interplay among the three dimensions within the sustainable development framework. The model's foundation is rooted in stakeholder theory. By examining a sample of 3947 listed Chinese firms, this study's results highlight a noteworthy link between digital transformation and enhanced sustainable performance, assessed through the triple bottom line framework, thus helping to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as the eighth and ninth SDGs. This improvement is attributed to reducing supply chain concentration and promoting a diversified supply chain configuration. Furthermore, the correlation between digital transformation and sustainable performance settings demonstrates significant heterogeneity. This study enhances stakeholder theory by demonstrating that digital transformation and supply chain concentration contribute to sustainable performance, supporting the eighth and ninth SDGs and offering managers a pathway for sustainable development. It also calls for policies that promote digital transformation and diversified supply chains to improve societal welfare and sustainability practices.</jats:p>",

Consumers’ showrooming behavior would affect not only the offline stores but also manufacturers in the long run. This study aims at putting forward an online customized strategy offered by a manufacturer to defeat the negative of showrooming in the context of a dual-channel supply chain where a manufacturer sells products online to consumers via a direct channel and wholesales products to an offline retailer, then the retailer sells products via an offline channel. Based on game theory and backward induction, optimal pricing decisions for the manufacturer and the retailer are established. It shows that consumers’ showrooming behavior decreases the selling prices and increases sales volumes in both the online direct channel and the offline channel. As further revealed, showrooming behavior would hurt the retailer under certain conditions and always damage the manufacturer. To mitigate the negative effects of showrooming, an online customized strategy is developed for the manufacturer. That is, the manufacturer would provide standard and customized products for online channel, allowing offline channel to sell only standard products. According to the results, online customized strategy would always damage the interests of the retailer, while customized strategy increases the profit of the manufacturer and increases the social welfare of the supply chain under certain circumstances.</jats:p>",

Subsequently, under the premise of demand satisfaction, we optimize the supply chain network of emergency materials and embed two insurance strategies in the supply system in advance: multi‐source purchase and buffer production capacity, to enhance the stability of supply chain by sacrificing part of the cost. Next, a bi‐objective linear programming model based on minimizing system cost and maximizing demand satisfaction is proposed with the intention of realizing the design of emergency materials supply chain network, which balances the risk and cost. Finally, through the analysis of the example, we find that compared with the traditional supply chain network of emergency materials, the total satisfaction rate of the supply chain network optimized by balancing cost and risk is increased by 11.70%, while the cost is increased by only 2.04%, which fully verifies the validity of the optimized design of supply chain network of emergency materials.</jats:p>",

Policy simulation results suggest that supply-based interventions would be more effective than housing tax policies for cooling down overheated housing markets without decreasing consumer welfare. Tax-based demand-side approaches result in a 1.8–2.2% housing price drop and a 1.1–1.2% welfare decline annually between 2021 and 2024.

This requires knowledge about the drought response of tree species in pure and mixed-culture neighborhoods. In addition, drought frequently interacts with continued atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. To disentangle these factors for European beech, Norway spruce and Douglas fir, we conducted a replicated 3-factorial sapling growth experiment with three moisture levels, (high, medium, and low), two N levels (high and ambient), and pure and mixed-culture neighborhoods. We measured biomass, stomatal conductance (GS), shoot water potential (at predawn: ΨPD, midday, and turgor loss point: ΨTLP), branch xylem embolism resistance (Ψ50) and minimum epidermal conductance (Gmin). The three species differed most with respect to Gmin (10-fold higher in beech than in the conifers), hydroscape area (larger in beech), and the time elapsed to reach stomatal closure (TΨGS90) and ΨTLP (TTLP; shorter in beech), while Ψ50 and ΨTLP were remarkably similar. Neighborhood (pure vs mixed-culture) influenced biomass production, water status and hydraulic traits, notably GS (higher in Douglas fir, but lower in spruce and beech, in mixtures than pure culture), hydraulic safety margin (smaller for beech in mixtures), and TΨGS90 and TTLP (shorter for spruce in mixture). High N generally increased GS, but no consistent N effects on leaf water status and hydraulic traits were detected, suggesting that neighbor identity had a larger effect on plant water relations than N availability. We conclude that both tree neighborhood and N availability modulate the drought response of beech, spruce, and Douglas fir. Species mixing can alleviate the drought stress of some species, but often by disadvantaging other species. Thus, our study suggests that stabilizing and building resilience of production forests against a drier and warmer climate may depend primarily on the right species choice; species mixing can support the agenda.</jats:p>",

The result shows a significant variation between industries concerning the cost-benefit ratio at the end of pipe technology, which turns on the significance level at ten percent. In correlation, it shows a positive relationship between cleaner technology and conventional technology concerning ROI and the cost-benefit ratio at the 1 percent significance level. Compared with the descriptive statistics of CBR of end Pipe technology, the sugar industry's mean value shows a high CBR 6.820 compared to other sectors. Further, it is also found that the environmental benefits and profit are higher in both technologies.</jats:p>",

However, little is known about how these measures affect the soil moisture variations under natural rainfall conditions. To compare their effects on soil water content, four different treatments were conducted at runoff plots, i.e., super absorbent polymer amendment (SCR), ridge–furrow rainwater harvesting with plastic mulching (CRP), the same measure with CRP but without mulching (CRN), and flat planting (FSN, control), soil moisture at multiple slope positions and depths were periodically measured. The results showed that in the top 0- to 30-cm soil, SCR and CRN relatively greatly varied with time, yet CRP and FSN changed less. The mean soil water content of these treatments generally followed the pattern of CRN &amp;gt; SCR &amp;gt; CRP &amp;gt; FSN. Responding to a heavy rainfall event, the recharge and depletion rates of soil water storage generally showed similar patterns of SCR &amp;gt; CRN &amp;gt; CRP &amp;gt; FSN in the topsoil, yet in the deeper soil they followed the patterns of CRP &amp;gt; CRN &amp;gt; FSN &amp;gt; SCR. It suggested that SCR and CRN could improve the water accumulation and infiltration performances in the topsoil, and thus may be more suitable for rain-fed crop planting on sloping farmlands of the loess region.</jats:p>",

However, although some studies have explored the evolution mechanism of the supply and demand system, these scholars have not noticed that in today's prosperous economy, demand‐driven markets have become mainstream in many countries. This paper establishes an evolutionary game model with producers and consumers in a demand‐driven market and analyzes the evolution mechanism of the system. The results indicate that (1) producers are willing to produce green products only if they can obtain excess green profits; (2) the lack of supply is the critical factor hindering consumers from purchasing green products; (3) additionally, there are multiple evolutionary paths under different substitution relations of different products; (4) interestingly, green premium and the consumers' sensitivity can simultaneously mitigate the perceived losses even when green products are insufficient. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are further discussed.</jats:p>",

However, scientific indicators to analyze ecosystem service (ES) risk patterns need to be explored in detail. In addition, studies on ES supply risk are stagnating on historical or status explorations, especially from the view of disturbance from land‐use changes. This study seeks to develop a framework for modeling past‐future ES supply risk pattern evaluation and probing into ES risk patterns under different future land‐use scenarios. To achieve this objective, the framework integrates the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model, the Intelligent Urban Ecosystem Management System (IUEMS) model, and an established indicator system incorporating ES supply trend, hotspots and coldspots, and ES trade‐offs, and synergies. The results show that: (1) In 2050, the supply of climate regulation in the Xi'an Metropolitan Area (XMA) will increase, while that of carbon sequestration and recreation will decrease. In 2050, the supply of climate regulation is the highest under ecological protection (EP) scenario, while the supply of carbon sequestration and recreation are the highest under cropland protection (CP) scenario. (2) From 2000 to 2050, the hotspots and coldspots of climate regulation increase in both natural development (ND) scenario and CP scenario. Notably, CP scenario experiences the most significant reduction in extremely significant hotspots and coldspots of carbon sequestration. From 2000 to 2050, at the regional and pixel scales, climate regulation and carbon sequestration mainly show trade‐offs, and carbon sequestration and recreation show synergies. (3) ES supply risk in XMA is high in the center and low in the north and south. The ES supply risk from 2000 to 2050 is increasing, with expanding “extremely high risk”, “high risk”, and “extremely safe” areas. ES supply risk management should adhere to more strict land‐use policies and guidelines, management zoning for areas with different levels of ES risk, and an accurate understanding of ES trade‐offs and synergies for scientific risk management. This study could provide theoretical and technical references for ES risk assessment research and promote scientific ecological risk management.</jats:p>",

Choosing high-yielding cultivars is an important measure to minimize the negative effects of drought stress. Field studies were conducted with 10 cultivars in the 2020–2022 seasons under three irrigation treatments (I0, without irrigation; I1, irrigated at jointing stage; I2, irrigated at jointing and anthesis stages) in the NCP to examine the water use strategies and root and shoot traits of high-yielding cultivars under different water supply conditions. The results showed that yield variation among cultivars was 21.2–24.6%, 23.7–25.9% and 11.6–15.3% for the I0, I1 and I2 treatments, respectively. Under water deficit conditions (I0 and I1), high-yielding cultivars reduced water use during vegetative stages and increased soil water use during reproductive stages, especially water use from deeper soil layers. Those cultivars with higher root length density (RLD) in deep soil layers exhibited higher water uptake. Each additional millimeter of water used after anthesis from the 100–200 cm soil layers increased grain yield by 23.6–29.6 kg/ha and 16.4–28.5 kg/ha under I0 and I1, respectively. This water use strategy enhanced dry matter accumulation after anthesis, decreased canopy temperature (CT) and increased relative leaf water contents (RLWC), which ultimately improved grain yield. For winter wheat grown under I2, cultivars that decreased water use after anthesis had higher water productivity (WP). Root length (RL), root weight (RW) and root:shoot ratio were each negatively correlated with grain yield, while above-ground biomass was positively correlated with grain yield. Therefore, higher dry matter accumulation and smaller root systems are two important traits of high-yielding cultivars under sufficient water supply conditions (I2) in the NCP.</jats:p>"

At present, a wide variety of actors are experimenting with new and flexible approaches, and it does not yet seem foreseeable which models will ultimately prevail. How can the initial experiences be systematized and what is the potential for establishment? To this end, we compare five pilot projects that use decentralized, mobile and digital formats to bring everyday goods to consumers. For the five case studies, 35 semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts and customers. Central comparative dimensions are the context of emergence and the actor constellations, the contribution to local supply, the economic viability as well as the social function of the offers. The results show that two cases are strongly subsidy-driven or depend on public support. In two other cases, the social function dominates with the involvement of socially oriented enterprises, where the approaches can rather fulfill a complementary supply function.

To address these challenges, there is a need to increase domestic food production while limiting deforestation and land degradation. In this study, we modified the FABLE Calculator, a food and land-use system model, to focus on The Gambia to simulate scenarios for future food demand and increasing domestic food production. We considered the impacts of climate change on crops, the adoption of climate change adaptation techniques, as well as the potential of enhanced fertiliser use and irrigation to boost crop productivity, and assessed whether these measures would be sufficient to meet the projected increase in food demand. Our results indicate that domestic food production on existing cropland will not be sufficient to meet national food demand by 2050, leading to a significant supply–demand gap. However, investments in fertiliser availability and the development of sustainable irrigation infrastructure, coupled with climate change adaptation strategies like the adoption of climate-resilient crop varieties and optimised planting dates, could halve this gap. Addressing the remaining gap will require additional strategies, such as increasing imports, expanding cropland, or prioritising the production of domestic food crops over export crops. Given the critical role imports play in The Gambia’s food supply, it is essential to ensure a robust flow of food imports by diversifying partners and addressing regional trade barriers. Our study highlights the urgent need for sustained investment and policy support to enhance domestic food production and food imports to secure sufficient and healthy food supplies amidst growing demand and climate change challenges.</jats:p>",

These are labor-intensive and energy-consuming technologies. The intensively developing gasification of rural areas makes it possible to universally transfer the heating of rural houses and the preparation of feed and food to natural gas. In the presented work, the main evaluation indicator of the digester is the efficiency factor. Equations are given that describe the useful energy consumption for preparing the product in a digester, as well as heat losses for heating metal structures, for compensating for energy losses from the boiler casing, for purging the steam jacket, and energy losses with flue gases. The energy consumption per unit of production was determined when loading the boiler from 100 to 20 liters. It has been revealed that the efficiency of the boiler decreases by almost 2 times if, instead of 100 liters, the cooking tank is loaded with only 20 liters. Based on experimental data, the useful component of the energy spent on heating 100 liters of water to a boil was determined and the boiler efficiency in automatic and manual mode was determined, which was: in automatic mode, efficiency = 0.84, in manual mode, efficiency = 0.7. Taking into account experimental data, the total gas consumption for the full cycle of feed preparation in automatic and manual modes was determined. The annual operating costs from burning gas in a digester in automatic and manual modes and cost savings on energy supply for the feed preparation process were determined.</jats:p>",

Understanding the permeation and diffusion patterns of water in soil is crucial for deciphering the mechanisms underlying soil settlement and damage. Notably, the pressure within water supply pipes significantly influences the settlement and damage of the soil. Therefore, this study simulated experiments on soil settlement and damage caused by water seepage from a preexisting damaged pipeline under various internal pipe pressure conditions using an indoor model apparatus. The results indicate that the internal pressure of the pipe significantly influences the settlement of the soil. High-pressure seepage causes noticeable erosion in the soil, forming cavities within it. In contrast, low-pressure seepage results in water diffusing in an ellipsoidal pattern, leading to the formation of circular surface cracks. The degree of surface settlement increases with higher pipe pressure. The onset of subsidence at a specific point on the ground is not directly related to whether the moistening front within the soil has reached that point horizontally. Instead, it is associated with the moisture content below the subsidence point within the soil. The research results further illustrate the water diffusion and moisture content increase processes after water seepage from pipes with different pressures, revealing the influence of pipe pressure on the degree and form of soil settlement damage and clarifying the relationship between water diffusion and settlement in the soil.</jats:p>",

Referencial teórico: A realidade do saneamento básico no Brasil é marcada por desigualdades regionais e sociais na prestação dos serviços de abastecimento de água potável e sistema de esgoto. A fim de melhorar o acesso aos serviços de Saneamento Básico no Brasil, foi estabelecido o Novo Marco Regulatório, sancionado pela Lei nº 14.026/2020, atualizando a Lei Federal. A cidade de Rio Branco é marcada por um forte processo de diversificação da produção rural e de infraestrutura urbana marcando, fortemente, a dinâmica de implementação dos serviços de saneamento na cidade. Método: Foram utilizadas informações do primeiro ciclo de auditoria, conforme metodologia ACERTAR, dos serviços prestados pelo então Departamento Estadual de Água e Saneamento do Acre - DEPASA. A avaliação ocorreu com base nos indicadores de desempenho, em suas dimensões de acesso, eficiência e qualidade. Resultados e conclusão: As informações obtidas através dos indicadores analisados revelaram que a prestação dos serviços de água e esgoto em todas as dimensões avaliadas é insatisfatória, muito aquém do que se pretende para a universalização dos serviços, necessitando de um aperfeiçoamento no que tange aos mecanismos e procedimentos de avaliação e monitoramento dos serviços prestados.\r\n \r\n </jats:p>"

The proposed work analysed the distribution of E. coli among various sources of animal-based food supply chain. Overall, 500 samples were heaped up from livestock, poultry sectors, environment, fisheries, and dairy. Standard microbiological procedures were used to isolate and identify E. coli. Further, isolates were confirmed by using MALDI-TOF and virulence associated genes (VAGs). The phenotypic resistance pattern of the isolates was determined by molecular identification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through PCR using specific primers. Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) were subjected to PCR based O typing using specific primers against different O types. Overall results revealed that 154 (30.5%) samples were confirmed as E. coli, in which77 (50%) isolates were MDR E. coli. Among these, total 52 (67.53%) isolates showed array of VAGs in which 21 (40.38%) were confirmed as STEC based on stx1 and stx2. Furthermore, 12/52 (23.07%) isolates were detected as Non-O157 STEC co-harboring mcr-1 and blaNMD-1. Overall, O26 STEC was found to be the most prevalent among different non-O157 types. Herein, results proposed that detection of such STEC MDR E. coli causing serious public health consequences in developing countries.</jats:p>"

Data for extractable resources of scandium were found and evaluated by application of estimated yields. The feasible extractable resource is about 6.1 million ton, and with present technology, about 676,000 ton scandium appear as potentially extractable. The potential for scandium extraction is about 1500 ton/year at present, but only about 45 ton per year was produced in 2022. With improved extraction and access yields, production could be increased to about 450 ton per year, and the scandium resource would increase to about 1.5 million ton. The investigation suggests that there will be an increased demand for scandium metal in the future, but that it is limited by the high price and the lack of a properly functioning market and by a lack of production infrastructure. The scandium market show signs of being disorganized and unstructured. Modelling of future scandium production was done using the WORLD7 integrated assessment model, after development of a scandium module. Simulations show that the price will remain relatively high, but lower than in the past. The most uncertain factor for predicting the price is the size of the demand. The main limitation for making scandium metal is high energy costs and low extraction yields.</jats:p>",

We establish the demand function of two channels based on consumers’ sensitivity to the blockchain and use the Stackelberg game model to compare and analyse the e-tailers’ profits from the two channels. For the basic properties, interestingly, we find that there exists a critical threshold on the cost sensitivity to effort that helps each e-tailer decide whether to implement effort. If the cost sensitivity to effort is high, the two-sided e-tailers will reduce their effort as much as possible to obtain greater profits. Conversely, if the cost sensitivity to effort is low, they will increase their effort to obtain more benefits. We also discuss the role of blockchain technology in competition between e-tailers and analyse the impact of the product brand effect brought by the traceability characteristic of blockchain on the competition between e-tailers. To check the robustness of the core results and to investigate different forms of supply chain configurations, this paper further develops the analysis of the supplier entering agency agreements with two-sided e-tailers. Under this scenario, the supplier sells their products directly to consumers through two-sided e-platforms and shares revenue with e-tailers as platform agency fees. These core ideas remain valid in the extended model.</jats:p>"

In this study, based on the research case of the Hanzhong section of the Hanjiang River Basin (HSHRB), the demand and supply matching relationships between three groups of people, namely residents, employees, and tourists, and four types of CS—memorial or religious space (MRS), cultural heritage space (CHS), cultural facilities space (CFS), and cultural industries space (CIS)—is analyzed, with communities as the units. Findings: (1) The CS demand–supply matching relationship exhibited the spatial distribution characteristics of high value balance in urbanized areas, significant lag in suburban supply, and low value balance in rural areas. (2) For the CS demands of residents, employees, and tourists, the total supply was in a substantial shortage, in general balance, and in significant surplus, respectively. (3) There were significant differences in the fairness and adequacy of the demand–supply matching of the four types of CS, with MRS and CHS more equitable and better able to meet the needs of different regions and populations. (4) Six community types with significantly different demand and supply characteristics were classified based on the demand–supply relationship within the community and the supply environment of neighboring communities. They presented a spatial structure of circles outward in the order of high-value-balanced communities, deprived communities, insufficient-supply communities, low-value-balanced communities, and shared communities, with urbanized areas as the core. Deprived communities and shared communities have shown spatial dynamics of urban expansion and village decay, respectively, and they require urgent attention. The study employs a more systematic categorization of CS supply and a more diverse perspective of demand entities, offering new evidence for the equitable distribution of cultural resources among heterogeneous groups and regions. Ultimately, it presents strategies for optimizing demand and supply as well as policy recommendations for community governance, bringing fresh insights into promoting sustainable community development.</jats:p>"

This study elucidated the natural food intake and its contribution to tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) growth in fertilized and unfertilized ponds, using stable isotope and stomach contents analyses. Additionally, it described the impact of fertilization management on natural food availability, fish performance, and production costs. Tambaqui juveniles (93.8 ± 15.0 g) were stocked (0.55 fish/m2) in fertilized (Fert) and unfertilized (NoFert) ponds (600 m2) for a culture period of 10 months in quadruplicate. A lower food conversion ratio was observed in Fert ponds. The main natural food items ingested by tambaqui were insects, vegetables, and cladocerans. Plankton contributed 39.4% and 10.7% of muscle formation in Fert and NoFert ponds, respectively. Pond fertilization (2.45 g of nitrogen and 0.80 g of phosphorus per square meter every two weeks) did not significantly affect fish growth, survival, or productivity but had a slightly influence on water quality parameters. However, fertilization increased the zooplankton density (through phytoplankton) in the water, thereby increasing autochthonous food availability for tambaqui consumption. This species demonstrates the ability to alternate between natural food sources and commercial feed without compromising its development. Consequently, tambaqui exhibits suitability for farming within restorative and integrated aquaculture systems as well as intensive systems reliant on commercial feed.</jats:p>"

The short-term forecast of wind power aims at providing a reference for the dispatch of the intraday power grid. This study proposes a soft sensor model based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network by combining data preprocessing with Variational Modal Decomposition (VMD) to improve wind power prediction accuracy. It does so by adopting the isolation forest algorithm for anomaly detection of the original wind power series and processing the missing data by multiple imputation. Based on the process data samples, VMD technology is used to achieve power data decomposition and noise reduction. The LSTM network is introduced to predict each modal component separately, and further sum reconstructs the prediction results of each component to complete the wind power prediction. From the experimental results, it can be seen that the LSTM network which uses an Adam optimizing algorithm has better convergence accuracy. The VMD method exhibited superior decomposition outcomes due to its inherent Wiener filter capabilities, which effectively mitigate noise and forestall modal aliasing. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) was reduced by 9.3508%, which indicates that the LSTM network combined with the VMD method has better prediction accuracy.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is necessary to propose an energy supply to synchronise two supplies from solar photovoltaic and the state electricity company grid. This concept can use some special inverters. However, due to the high cost, it is rarely applied to residential users. The diode-blocking method aims to increase the stability of the supply system so that the load is not disturbed due to erratic weather conditions. Solar PV is used as the main power source, while the grid becomes a backup resource. The results of the diode block showed that in the synchronisation for 120 minutes of the solar PV, the energy is supplied from the grid, indicating a stable load supply.

Infill drilling provides opportunities to collect additional information associated with the mineral deposits, which can inform future production scheduling decisions. A framework is developed for optimising infill drilling locations with a criterion that seeks areas that directly affect long-term planning decisions and requires the use of geostatistical simulations.

This study suggested that the cascade was not strictly followed, and several reasons may justify it, such as the lack of veterinary products, different formulations, and differences in costs. An effective, safe and sustainable use of the therapeutic option available can only be accomplished with a rational use of the prescription cascade and a correct use of the Regulation (EU) 2019/6.</jats:p>"

O estudo adotou uma metodologia exploratória qualitativa com treze profissionais da cadeia de suprimentos de uma rede farmacêutica de um município brasileiro. Os dados foram coletados por meio de entrevistas semiestruturadas e posteriormente analisados utilizando a técnica da análise do discurso. Diante da análise realizada sobre o processo de logística reversa de medicamentos na rede farmacêutica em estudo, foi possível evidenciar a importância dessa prática para a sustentabilidade ambiental, responsabilidade social corporativa e eficiência operacional. A coleta de dados revelou uma abordagem abrangente na coleta, manipulação e destinação dos medicamentos, ressaltando a necessidade de estratégias institucionais e envolvimento da comunidade para garantir a eficácia do processo. Verificou-se a existência de uma infraestrutura organizada e estruturada para lidar com os medicamentos coletados, enfatizando a importância do planejamento prévio, rastreabilidade e conformidade com regulamentações ambientais e de saúde pública. Os relatos dos profissionais destacaram a contribuição da logística reversa para a redução do impacto ambiental, preservação dos recursos naturais e promoção da responsabilidade social corporativa, fortalecendo a imagem e reputação da empresa e evidenciando um compromisso tangível com a proteção ambiental e bem-estar da sociedade. Essa percepção ressalta o potencial de diferenciação competitiva e abertura para oportunidades de negócios sustentáveis, destacando que a logística reversa não é apenas uma obrigação regulatória, mas sim uma oportunidade estratégica para as empresas demonstrarem liderança, responsabilidade e compromisso com a sustentabilidade e o bem-estar social.</jats:p>"

In Burkina Faso and Mali, we worked in 24 primary health care centers per country, whereas in Nigeria and Palestine, we focused on 26 primary schools per country. Facilities were eligible if they were not connected to a functioning water source but were deemed accessible to the implementation partners. Moreover, health care centers were eligible if they had a maternity ward and ≥5 employees, and schools if they had ≤7000 students studying in grades 5 to 7. We used covariate-constrained randomization to assign intervention facilities that received a hardware, management and monitoring support, and behavior change. Control facilities will receive the same or improved intervention after endline data collection. To evaluate the intervention, at baseline and endline, we used a self-reported survey, structured handwashing observations, and hand-rinse samples. At follow-up, hand-rinse samples were dropped. Starting from the intervention implementation, we collected longitudinal data on hygiene-related health conditions and absenteeism. We also collected qualitative data with focus group discussions and interviews. Data were analyzed descriptively and with random effect regression models with the random effect at a cluster level. The primary outcome for health centers is the handwashing rate, defined as the number of times health care workers performed good handwashing practice with soap or alcohol-based handrub at one of the World Health Organization 5 moments for hand hygiene, divided by the number of moments for hand hygiene that presented themselves during the patient interaction within an hour of observation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>China is a major player in the marine fish trade. The price prediction of marine fish is of great significance to socio-economic development and the fisheries industry. However, due to the complexity and uncertainty of the marine fish market, traditional forecasting methods often struggle to accurately predict price fluctuations. Therefore, this study adopts an intelligent combination model to enhance the accuracy of food product price prediction. Firstly, three decomposition methods, namely empirical wavelet transform, singular spectrum analysis, and variational mode decomposition, are applied to decompose complex original price series. Secondly, a combination of bidirectional long short-term memory artificial neural network, extreme learning machine, and exponential smoothing prediction methods are applied to the decomposed results for cross-prediction. Subsequently, the predicted results are input into the PSO–CS intelligence algorithm for weight allocation and to generate combined prediction results. Empirical analysis is conducted using data illustrating the daily sea purchase price of larimichthys crocea in Ningde City, Fujian Province, China. The combination prediction accuracy with PSO–CS weight allocation is found to be higher than that of single model predictions, yielding superior results. With the implementation of weight allocation intelligent combinatorial modelling, the prediction of marine fish prices demonstrates higher accuracy and stability, enabling better adaptation to market changes and price fluctuations.</jats:p>"

The design obtained allows costs to be reduced compared to commercial ones, highlighting that the manufacturing of this HVDC is easy to replicate. To demonstrate the operation of the pulsed power supply prototype, coatings of silicon carbide (SiC) and SiC mixed with graphite (C) and/or alumina (Al2O3) were made using the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method. After processing, samples underwent a heat treatment at 500 °C to evaluate their thermoelectric (TE) efficiency. The samples were analysed via X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity. The Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity were measured in a temperature range of 100–500 °C in a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere. The electrical conductivity of the SiC 6C-4Al sample was 0.65 S/cm at 500 °C, while the maximum Seebeck coefficient was 2500 μV/K of the SiC 6C-4Al sample at 200 °C. The thermal conductivity of SiC 6C-4Al was in the range of 0.35–0.37 W/m·K, which was much lower than the SiC sample free of alumina and graphite in the same measured temperature range. In conclusion, the SiC 6C-4Al sample presented the highest figure of merit with a ZT ≈ 0.01.</jats:p>"

To reveal the dynamic pattern of the coordination of ecosystem service (ES) supply and demand in the Lhasa River Basin, we quantified the supply of the following four ESs using the InVEST model from 2000 to 2018: carbon sequestration (CS), water conservation (WC), habitat quality (HQ), and soil conservation (SC). Using socio-economic data, including land development degree, GDP, and population density, the ES demand was quantified. The ES supply–demand ratio (ESDR) and coupling coordination degree (CCD) model were used to evaluate the coupling relationship and coordination of ES supply and demand. The spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to determine the spatial correlation and changes in the ES supply–demand coupling coordination degree. The results indicate that the distribution of ESDR exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity. The area with ES supply far greater than demand was always in the upstream area of the Lhasa River, while the ES demand of Chengguan District far exceeded supply. Grasslands and forests were the main contributors to ESDRs, providing positive ESDRs for three services, SC, HQ, and WC, with a total proportion above 80%. From 2000 to 2018, the mismatch between ES supply and demand was gradually spreading upstream, while the upstream areas had a relatively high CCD. The spatial correlations of the CCD in the Lhasa River basin all showed statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.01). The high–high aggregation areas were concentrated in the northeast of the Lhasa River basin, while the low–low aggregation areas were centered around Chengguan District. This study provides reference values for optimizing the land use spatial patterns in ecologically vulnerable areas with the goal of sustainable development.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a new method of supply chain resilience assessment based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) and matter element extension theory. Firstly, based on the research status quo at home and abroad, a low-carbon enterprise supply chain resilience assessment index system is established, which includes six first-level indicators and corresponding 21 second-level indicators of product supply resilience, resource resilience, partner resilience, information response resilience, financial resilience and knowledge resilience. Secondly, HFLTS was used to collect expert opinions and Ordered Weighted Arithmetic (OWA) to calculate the expert composite language, by which the fuzzy evaluation matrix of supply chain resilience assessment indicators was obtained. Once again, the resilience indicator weights are determined based on a game-theoretic portfolio assignment method combining the best-worst method (BWM) and the CRITIC method. Finally, the nearness degree function is combined with the extension comprehensive evaluation method to improve the matter element extension model, and the supply chain resilience assessment model of low-carbon enterprises based on the game theory combination assignment-improved matter element extension is established. Taking X low-carbon enterprise as an example, the evaluation results show that the supply chain resilience level of this enterprise is II, and the eigenvalue of the grade variable is 2.69, and the supply chain resilience is shifting to III, and the supply chain resilience is shifting to III, which indicates that the supply chain resilience of this enterprise is being enhanced. Therefore, the improved matter element extension not only ensures the accuracy of the evaluation results, but also has higher prediction accuracy.</jats:p>"

The dynamic model is based on a linear mathematical model of the resonant converter built according to the superposition principle. The structure of the resonant converter with the processes outline function is given and analyzed. The structure of the discrete dynamic model of the resonant converter of the nth order is presented. It is proved that the transfer function of the discrete dynamic model for the outline function can be determined by the transfer function of the continuous system. The resulting dependencies describing the discrete transfer functions of the resonant converter are used to obtain the discrete dynamic model of the double-circuit transformer resonant converter in a synchronous rectifier. For this, the sequence of actions is defined: definition of the transfer function of the continuous dynamic model; obtaining the system of equations in vector-matrix form describing electromagnetic processes in the converter; definition of the system of discrete equations; definition of the transfer function of the circuit. The obtained theoretical results were verified by means of simulation modeling of the considered double-circuit resonant converter. The proposed dynamic model makes it possible to analyze the influence of instability and low-frequency fluctuations of the supply voltage of the resonant converter on the output values. The presented results can be used in the development and improvement of single- or multi-circuit bridge high-frequency resonant converters as the secondary power sources and converters used in ship demagnetization systems.

Synchronous series representativeness analysis, water quality analysis, and water resource availability estimation are conducted to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of rainfall, evaporation, and water quality and calculate the availability of various types of water resources. The results indicate that the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall and evapotranspiration in the study area is uneven, which increases the threat of local floods and droughts. The quality of the main rivers and lakes in the region is good, and the water quality of the drinking water source area and groundwater reaches and even exceeds Class III water standards. In the year 2020, the total water usage in the research area reached 341 million m3. However, the available sum of surface water resources and transit water availability in 2022 was only 201 million m3, so local water supply needs cannot be easily met. Exploring the water resource characterization model of the Lower Rivers Plain can help in local water resource management and protection.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The past decades have witnessed intensive research on the biological effects of graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) and the application of GBNs in different fields. The published literature shows that GBNs exhibit inhibitory effects on almost all microorganisms under pure culture conditions, and that this inhibitory effect is influenced by the microbial species, the GBN’s physicochemical properties, the GBN’s concentration, treatment time, and experimental surroundings. In addition, microorganisms exist in the soil in the form of microbial communities. Considering the complex interactions between different soil components, different microbial communities, and GBNs in the soil environment, the effects of GBNs on soil microbial communities are undoubtedly intertwined. Since bacteria and fungi are major players in terrestrial biogeochemistry, this review focuses on the antibacterial and antifungal performance of GBNs, their antimicrobial mechanisms and influencing factors, as well as the impact of this effect on soil microbial communities. This review will provide a better understanding of the effects of GBNs on microorganisms at both the individual and population scales, thus providing an ecologically safe reference for the release of GBNs to different soil environments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) has emerged as a promising sustainable nitrogen removal technology that offers significant advantages over conventional nitrification–denitrification processes, such as reduced energy consumption, a 60% reduction in oxygen demand, and a 90% reduction in sludge production. However, the practical application of ANAMMOX is hindered by several challenges, including the slow growth of ANAMMOX bacteria, long start-up periods, and high sensitivity to environmental disturbances. Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) in the formation, activity, and stability of ANAMMOX biofilms and granules. An EPS is a complex mixture of high-molecular-weight polymers secreted by microorganisms, mainly composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. The diverse physicochemical properties and functional groups of EPSs enable them to serve as a structural scaffold, protective barrier, sorption site, electron shuttle, and nutrient source for ANAMMOX bacteria. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest research progress on harnessing the potential of EPSs to enhance the ANAMMOX process. The characteristics, compositions, and extraction methods of ANAMMOX-derived EPSs are summarized. The mechanisms of how EPSs facilitate the enrichment, immobilization, aggregation, and adaptation of ANAMMOX bacteria are elucidated. The strategies and effects of EPS supplementation on improving the performance and robustness of ANAMMOX reactors under various stresses are critically reviewed. The challenges and future perspectives of the EPS-mediated optimization of the ANAMMOX process are also discussed. This review sheds new light on exploiting EPSs as a renewable bioresource to develop more efficient and stable ANAMMOX applications for sustainable wastewater treatment.</jats:p>"

The effect of soda residue soil content on Sedum lineare growth and pollutant removal from the stormwater runoff was analyzed and the runoff quality index (RQI) was calculated. Results showed that the relative growth rate of S. lineare height in system B with 10% soda residue soil was about 21.5–53.2% higher than the other systems. The outflow of system B with 10% soda residue soil had the lowest mass concentration of NH4+-N and TN, which were 2.2 and 3.2 mg/L, respectively. The average repetitive rainfall retention rate of system A without soda residue soil was the lowest at 82.6%. System B had the highest RQI at about 0.71. It confirmed that soda residue soil can be a material with practical application value, and when the volume ratio of peat soil, coconut bran, perlite, and soda residue soil was 4:3:2:1, the green roof would have the best performance in regulating and purifying the initial rainwater runoff.</jats:p>",

The algorithm is prone to unstable learning rate and performance degradation on some models. To solve these problems, in this paper, an improved algorithm named Linear Curvature Momentum Adam (LCMAdam) is proposed, which introduces curvature-controlled gradient and linear interpolation strategies. The curvature-controlled gradient can make the gradient update smoother, and the linear interpolation technique can adaptively adjust the size of the learning rate according to the characteristics of the curve during the training process so that it can find the exact value faster, which improves the efficiency and robustness of training. The experimental results show that the LCMAdam algorithm achieves 98.49% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, 75.20% on the CIFAR10 dataset, and 76.80% on the Stomach dataset, which is more difficult to recognize medical images. The LCMAdam optimizer achieves significant performance gains on a variety of neural network structures and tasks, proving its effectiveness and utility in the field of deep learning.</jats:p>"

The results show that postharvest fragrant pears treated with ozone had a higher firmness and lower weight loss rate and decay rate during their shelf life, especially in the late stage. Ozone treatment could also delay the occurrence of the respiratory peak and reduce the peak value. The generation rate of superoxide anion (O2−), the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) level were reduced in the ozone-treated group, while the activities of key enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD), related to ROS metabolism in postharvest fragrant pears were stimulated by ozone treatment, especially in the middle and late stages of shelf life. Analysis of the proteomics results indicates that the POD family enzymes were the main target protein in postharvest fragrant pears treated by ozone during the middle and late stages of shelf life. The activity and expression of antioxidant-related enzymes in postharvest fragrant pears were stimulated by ozone to accelerate the metabolism of ROS and maintain high quality, especially in the middle and late shelf lives.</jats:p>"

The mislocalization of CENP-A to noncentromeric regions contributes to chromosomal instability (CIN), a hallmark of cancer. However, pathways that promote or prevent CENP-A mislocalization remain poorly defined. Here, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen for regulators of CENP-A localization which identified DNAJC9, a J-domain protein implicated in histone H3–H4 protein folding, as a factor restricting CENP-A mislocalization. Cells lacking DNAJC9 exhibit mislocalization of CENP-A throughout the genome, and CIN phenotypes. Global interactome analysis showed that DNAJC9 depletion promotes the interaction of CENP-A with the DNA-replication-associated histone chaperone MCM2. CENP-A mislocalization upon DNAJC9 depletion was dependent on MCM2, defining MCM2 as a driver of CENP-A deposition at ectopic sites when H3–H4 supply chains are disrupted. Cells depleted for histone H3.3, also exhibit CENP-A mislocalization. In summary, we have defined novel factors that prevent mislocalization of CENP-A, and demonstrated that the integrity of H3–H4 supply chains regulated by histone chaperones such as DNAJC9 restrict CENP-A mislocalization and CIN.</jats:p>"
