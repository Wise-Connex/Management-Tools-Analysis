      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The supply chain risk management (SCRM) process is aimed at the implementation of strategies that assist in managing both daily and exceptional risks facing the supply chain through continuous risk assessment to reduce vulnerability and ensure continuity.Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine whether the SCRM process enables supply chain resilience among grocery manufacturers in South Africa. The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)-manufacturing industry faces increased risk because of the nature of their products being perishable with a limited shelf life.Method: This study was conducted using a descriptive qualitative research design. Data were collected by means of 12 semi-structured interviews with senior supply chain practitioners within the South African grocery manufacturing industry.Findings: The study found that most firms informally implement SCRM processes of risk identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring to mitigate disruptions. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the SCRM processes facilitate resilience among grocery manufacturers in South Africa.Conclusion: The managerial implications show that supply chain managers of grocery manufacturers should formalise the SCRM process and develop risk assessment scales to better prioritise risks in order to run a resilient supply chain. The research contributes to the supply chain management field by adding to the scarce literature relating to SCRM as an enabler of supply chain resilience in a South African context.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Many participants in the South African wine industry still exhibit low supply chain maturity in the management of their supply chains. This hampers export performance and ultimately client satisfaction. The development and tracking of appropriate metrics are key steps in improving supply chain performance.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to develop a performance measurement framework for the South African wine industry, focussing on the bulk export segment.Method: The framework was developed using an emergent multi-phased exploratory approach. The approach was implemented in two distinct phases, namely qualitative research followed by quantitative research in each of three iterations to develop and refine the framework. In each iteration, the qualitative research phase consisted of a literature survey, semi-structured and unstructured interviews and case studies, while the quantitative research phase consisted of the development, distribution, completion and analysis of the framework questionnaire, each iteration building on the framework outputs from the previous iteration.Results: The research highlighted that the wine supply chain performance of bulk exports is hindered by the lack of a measurement culture, hampering the identification and prioritisation of interventions. The creation of a performance measurement framework in conjunction with industry, and informed by the Supply Chain Operations Reference framework, creates a platform for the industry to address these challenges.Conclusion: The implementation of this framework will provide performance visibility for cellars in the wine industry. This would enable them to improve their logistics processes and increase their supply chain maturity, ultimately enabling benchmarking against competing supply chains both within South Africa and abroad, such as in Australia, Argentina and Chile.</jats:p>"

Therefore, we propose a new paradigm for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SLR</jats:styled-content>s in the supply chain domain that is based on both best practice and the unique attributes of doing supply chain management research. This approach involves exploring existing studies with attention to theoretical boundaries, units of analysis, sources of data, study contexts, and definitions and the operationalization of constructs, as well as research methods, with the goal of refining or revising existing theory. This new paradigm will push supply chain management research to the frontier of current methodological standards and build a foundation for improving the contribution of future <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SLR</jats:styled-content>s in the supply chain and adjacent management disciplines.</jats:p>",

Such behavior remains unexamined concerning how adaptive systems succeed in biology, supply networks, the economy, and beyond. In the presence of Unknown‐Unknown events (Unk‐Unks) that have no prior occurrences and are evident only in their realizations, the design of supply networks must allow for developing adaptive capabilities at the firm‐level. When performed right, such organic development in the supply network would mimic a biological phenomenon of tinkering and natural selection. We describe enabling such adaptive processes as jury rigging. We discuss how firms could design their supply networks and organize their supply network <jats:italic>ex‐ante</jats:italic> that enables the network members to respond to Unk‐Unks in an innovative way through jury rigging of their relationships.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Literature on the negative socio-economic and environmental externalities generated by informal public transport (IPT) in developing countries is vast, vibrant and growing fast. These externalities include but are not limited to noise, air and land pollution, accidents and, more importantly, a source of congestion (human and vehicular) because of poor driver behaviour. In this article, the research does not seek to reinstate these, but rather, it argues that poor driver behaviour is a dependent variable to some regulatory policy stimuli. Yet, an extensive literature survey has shown that the driver behaviour and urban transport regulation linkage remain little explored.Objective: The purpose of this article was to unpack the relationship between informal public transport driver behaviour and the prevailing regulatory framework.Method: Based on a case study of Harare, Zimbabwe, the researcher adopted a mixed-methods paradigm and interrogated the prevailing urban public transport regulatory regimes and applied professional judgement, oral interviews backed by some quantitative data and relate these to obtaining IPT driver behavioural characteristics.Results: Poor driver behaviour exhibited by IPT were generated, exacerbated and or eased by the prevailing regulatory policy. This is well depicted through an IPT driver behaviour and regulation loop reinforcing diagram.Conclusion: Following this argument, the article cautions policy makers and urban managers alike that direct approaches and interventions when trying to regulate IPT poor driver behaviour and its secondary negative effects will be futile as long as the regulatory policy remains the same. Failure to recognise and connect the dots between IPT driver behaviour and policy partly explains why globally, the IPT sector has proved difficult in prohibiting, restructuring or even formalising it.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate how management practices and processes contribute to stock-outs in the warehouse retail liquor sector in Johannesburg.Research design: A pragmatic research philosophy was used in a multi-case approach to determine the association between business management practices and stock-outs. The unit of analysis of the study is the highest turnover outlets.Findings: The results revealed that retailers base demand forecasting on judgement and naïve or simple moving average forecast methods. There is little consideration of variability, lead time or targeted customer service levels when determining optimal inventory levels. Product breakages are common, implying that data inaccuracies and stock-outs are highly probable. Information sharing between the retailers and suppliers is limited and formal collaboration programmes do not exist. The respondents revealed that frequent stock-outs resulted in poor business performance characterised by declining sales, customer retention and competitive advantage.Limitations: Although the sample selected represented a significant portion of the top 50% contributors to the sector’s sales, the sample is small and the focus of the study is limited, which decreases the generalisability of the results.Practical implications: Retailers can reduce stock-outs by investing in improvements in demand forecasting, synchronisation through collaboration and training of employees.Originality or value: This study provides empirical evidence of the linkages between poor management practices and processes, stock-outs, customer service and business performance.</jats:p>"

This article adopts the Harrod–Domar (HD) model of economic growth and development theory, endogenous growth theory and Solow–Swan neoclassical growth model.Method: Data were derived from the South African Reserve Bank, Quantec database and Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) between 1990 and 2014. It used time series, econometric models cointegration and vector error correction model (VECM) to analyse.Result: The results of the estimation demonstrate that the explanatory variables account for approximately 86.7% variation in ED in South Africa. Therefore, there exists a positive relationship between ROTI and ED.Conclusion: This study established a long-run relationship between phenomena and demonstrates the role of road transport investment on economic development in South Africa.</jats:p>"

The proposed method has a significant advantage that determines which aspects have more priority and which ones are less important; hence, it gives a very good guideline for planning and implementation of a country's projects for sustainable development in WSSs. Additionally, the application of the proposed method is shown for Algeria as a case study. six dimensions, 12 criteria and 50 indicators were defined as three different levels of hierarchy for this purpose. Moreover, the matrices of pairwise comparisons were obtained by judgments of 12 experts in different involved fields including policy makers, managers and scientists. According to the results, the most important dimensions were economic (38.3%) and technical (26.1%) aspects. Furthermore, the financial autonomy (18.7%) and technical performance (18.4%) had the highest and transparency (2%) and organization (2.8%) had the lowest weights among all criteria. In addition, indicators with a high overall weight are: operation and maintenance cost, grand balanced budget, reliability, small budget balance, opportunity cost and state subsidy rates for investments.</jats:p>",

Hitherto, in the context of montanistic tourism, the attention is paid primarily to the objects associated with the exploration and exploitation of mineral resources. Professionally and touristically, processes of transport of mineral raw materials and products of their processing can be interesting. Therefore, during the selection, development and implementation of montanistic tourism products, it will be useful to focus on these parts of a supply chain, especially if they are implemented in areas with high levels of geodiversity and biodiversity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The US tax and transfer system generates revenue and provides safety net programs that move millions out of poverty. Since women are more likely to live in poverty, they are more likely to qualify for means-tested transfers. The structure of taxation in the United States often penalizes secondary earners, who are usually women. These programs alter work incentives and consequently may affect labor supply decisions. In this chapter, we examine the empirical evidence on the effects of taxes and transfers on the labor supply of women in the United States. We show that much has changed since 1990, with the biggest shift being a change from cash transfers via welfare to refundable tax credits to workers. Overall, the evidence we review shows women have higher labor force participation and are less responsive to changes in after-tax wages than they were before 1990, but the labor supply effects vary substantially by program considered.</p>",

Upon reviewing all stakeholders through participatory research, it is made clear that in the whole food supply chain, retail chains generally have the greatest and primary producers the smallest bargaining power. For this reason, in the process of regulating mutual relations in contractual commitments and mutual operations, unfair practices and illicit conduct often emerge, through which the parties with significant market power impose additional discounts, rebates and other contributions on the parties with smaller market power in order to improve their own financial management. Unfair practices and illicit conduct lead to the weakening of the entire food supply chain, so it is important to recognise such tendencies in the food chain. In this article, the autor would like to draw attention to the illicit conduct and unfair practices in Slovenia which are used by retail chains in their interpersonal relationships and their dealings with suppliers.</jats:p>"

The study developed econometric models and examined a 10-year period (2006 to 2015) pertaining to eight (8) Sub-Sahara African countries namely: Botswana, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. The empirical model includes six determinants (initial public offering, market capitalisation, unemployment rate, foreign direct investment inflow, inflation rate and trade openness). Secondary data was utilised for the study. The primary sources of data were the World Bank Development indicators and Preqin data base. All the statistical analyses in the study were performed using E-views version 8. Panel data models of pooled, fixed and random effects were employed. The results suggest that there is a significant positive relationship between initial public offering, market capitalisation and venture capital supply. Second, there is no significant relationship between unemployment rate, foreign direct investment inflows, trade openness and venture capital supply. Based on the empirical findings, this study recommends that Sub-Sahara African governments should attempt to develop their economies by improving infrastructure and corporate governance. There is also a need for African countries to develop the equity market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>With the rapid development of the petroleum industry, downhole tools in used in are gradually developing from mechanization towards automation and intelligence. Now most of the electrical devices used in the downhole tools utlizize the wellbore control technolgy to work in differenl situation. These devices usually adopt traditional battery technology as the solution of power supply. It is unavoidable to fish up the devices using disposable batteries or to put the charger into the accurate downhole position to charge the rechargeable batteries if the the batteries run out. As a result of these situaion, the normal working process is interrupted, which leads to a significant decline in productivity. Facing the delimma, this paper proposes a bionics piezoelectric energy harvester based on vortex-shedding vibration to solve the existing problem of traditional battery technology in the fluid environment. The harvester mainly consists of bluff body, piezoelectric energy transducer, and the rectifying circuit. PZT and PVDF are used as functioanl materials in the key component of the piezoelectric energy transducer. Finally PZT shows the superior performance than the one of PVDF considering the experimental results about the working condition, service life and awful operating process. Testing results also showed that the voltage of the harvester can achieve 4.88V under the condition of 0.8m/s flow velocity and 25mm pipeline diameter and the power can reach 1600mW when the load resistance is about 360 kΩ. The bionic vibration energy harvester offers an intriguing alternative to collect ambient energy from liquid environment for long-term use of power.</jats:p>",

This systematic literature review (n = 77) analyses and discusses the fragmented body of knowledge on the meso-level of supply chains (SCs): (a) to find common ground that underpins the current implementation of the CE on this level; and (b) to identify drivers, inhibitors, and enablers from which CE SC configurations emerge. The review finds that there remain differences in CE definitions that result from claimed antecedents and scopes, resulting in distinct research streams. On the meso-level, eco-industrial parks, environmental SCs, and closed-loop SCs each face significant challenges. The latter potentially offers the largest environmental benefits but engenders radical changes for business models and exposes SCs to more risk. We firstly argue for moving away from using a prescriptive set of practices as definitions for the CE towards a set of overarching goals to allow for the inclusion of future practices and techniques. Secondly, we highlight that research going beyond the meso-level to consider the wider social and institutional environment is needed to solve current challenges.</jats:p>"

The study developed econometric models and examined a 10-year period (2006 to 2015) pertaining to eight (8) Sub-Sahara African countries namely: Botswana, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. The empirical model includes six determinants (initial public offering, market capitalisation, unemployment rate, foreign direct investment inflow, inflation rate and trade openness). Secondary data was utilised for the study. The primary sources of data were the World Bank Development indicators and Preqin data base. All the statistical analyses in the study were performed using E-views version 8. Panel data models of pooled, fixed and random effects were employed. The results suggest that there is a significant positive relationship between initial public offering, market capitalisation and venture capital supply. Second, there is no significant relationship between unemployment rate, foreign direct investment inflows, trade openness and venture capital supply. Based on the empirical findings, this study recommends that Sub-Sahara African governments should attempt to develop their economies by improving infrastructure and corporate governance. There is also a need for African countries to develop the equity market.</jats:p>"

The information contained in the documents was summarized and made anonymous to preserve confi dentiality of consumers. The researchers also studies data from the offi cial site of the Municipal Service Department of Omsk Administration. The data showed housing stock structure and its coverage with centralized heating services. The following percentage rating for reasons causing the thermal load removal is detected: thus, 31 of 47 construction objects with a total load of 80.8% (of the total load removed during the period under review) were switched off the system because of \"The resett lement program for citizens from the emergency housing stock\" in 2016. Typical problems of a large sett lement centralized heating system operation are also described in the paper. It is shown that there is a tendency towards a signifi cant increase in the amount of annual heat consumption decline underway. This increase in decline may be 32-multiple in some regions, and it may go slow in the others. Making recommendations based on the results of the design calculation will clarify diameters of trunk and intra networks, which the authors see a task for the future. In general, this methodology should help to adjust industrial strategies for consumer needs.</jats:p>"

Plain coupons of copper, stainless steel (SS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) were dipped and tested in a cooling water from a food industry. PVC and HDPE coupons showed promising responses and appear to be preferable since they are corrosion-free. Moreover, an experimental vibration sensor monitored biofilm adhesion on SS and PVC tubular coupons (simulators of the respective sensor tubes), inside which flowed the water aforementioned. The SS sensor tube and tubular coupons displayed the most satisfactory results, i.e. the highest vibration amplitude and the highest adhered biofilm mass, respectively. Biofilm adhesion onto the materials tested depended on their surface shear stress, effective roughness and hydrophobicity, as determined by scanning electron microscopy and goniometry.</jats:p>",

These models do not require a regular spatial grid for integration and introduce the pipe lengths as parameters. In this paper a calibration procedure based on this particular feature is introduced, to determine a basic item of information that can be lost about the water distribution system, that is the length of the pipes. The network admittance matrix method is implemented and its numerical efficiency allows the investigation of the calibration optimization function on a regular grid in the parameter space. The calibration is tested using in series a genetic and the Nelder–Mead algorithms, considering both elastic and viscoelastic material pipes. The results of the presented numerical investigation allow some insights into the existence of the solution and into the shape of the optimization function.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to analyze the aspects of educational tourism experience that are affected by tourism demand and supply. Data were collected by survey technique to 150 respondents and analyzed using path analysis. The results of analysis show that tourism demand and supply contributed to the variation of tourism activities by 45.1%, while the remaining was explained by other variables, such as National Budget, Local Budget, ticket sale, and cooperation with some stakeholders. Tourism supply had a higher effect than tourism demand. Tourism demand did not partially affect tourism experience. However, the results of the path analysis indicate that tourism supply had direct and indirect effects on tourism experience through the variation of tourism activities with indirect effect being dominant. In the management of Smart Park, there is still a gap between tourism demand and supply, so that the environment of tourism experience has not been created maximally.</jats:p>"

The occurrence of water shortage problems is attributed to an increased population and water pollution. Traditional methods of draining rainwater from rooftops, based on the Rainfall-Discharge (R-D) model, are challenged. By storing some of the rainfall that falls on building rooftops, flooding of nearby sewer systems can be mitigated, and the reduction of peak runoff can then calculated using the Rainfall-Storage-Discharge (R-S-D) model. By utilizing stored rainfall in or near a building, flooding can be further mitigated while conserving water, and the reduction of peak runoff and the amount of used rainwater can also be calculated using the Rainfall-Storage-Utilization-Discharge (R-S-U-D) model. The R-S-U-D model uses site-specific rainfall characteristics; thus, we take Seoul, Korea as a study case. The reduced peak flow and increased design return period for a combination of tank volume and utilization rate can be calculated and presented by a curve, which can be used in the design and operation of sewer systems. Results from the R-S-U-D model can help in designing methods to reduce the flooding risk in existing sewer systems without increasing their capacity, thus reducing expenses. Water conservation is an additional benefit.</jats:p>",

During this period the dependency on the commercial plasma industry has increased considerably. The debate has two main themes. The first focusses on the ethical principles underpinning World Health Assembly resolutions on voluntary non‐remunerated donation and questions relating to donor compensation and the use of incentives in the voluntary sector. The second theme concerns barriers to achieving the goal of self‐sufficiency. The needs of patients and the most effective way to ensure equitable access to sufficient plasma derived medicinal products and issues around security of supply lie at the centre of the debate. Ultimately health authorities will need to carefully balance ethical principles and practical reality in assuring that this is achieved.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>: Sustainable development issues are considerably popular subjects within the international research community. On the other hand the importance of the issues related to global supply chains has also increased significantly. This paper will also mention a change in one of the main economic paradigms: from international exchange between countries and individual companies there is a transition to exchange between the participants along the global supply chains. The interest in global supply chains and their management is provoked by the fact that they are a major source of competitive advantage on global markets. Nowadays, global supply chains are an integral part of the activities of a number of companies operating abroad. Every business operation finds its place in one or more supply chains. Within the contemporary context of scarce resources and the widely spread sustainable development idea, the companies compete on a global economic scale where the main business unit is the world as a whole, not an individual country or region. All these trends and global developments provoked our scientific interest and with the project â€śCorporate governance and the global supply chainsâ€ť we tried to find out how the global supply chains are actually influenced by the issues of sustainable development. Within the course of the project we have reviewed and analyzed quite a lot of scientific literature, we studied the publicly available information of the big international corporations related to their social corporate responsibility and sustainable development issues. In addition, we have made empirical research among local suppliers of big international companies as well as a number of international NGOs dealing with sustainable development and social policy issues. Some of the findings from our project are presented in the current paper.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT This paper reports the application of information acquired by aerial survey to characterize water supply reservoirs in the Pajeú River Basin (Pernambuco State/Brazil). The survey was carried out with digital cameras of high spatial resolution and laser relief profiling (LiDAR technology). Two areas were selected to apply the remote sensing products. Small reservoirs in the Quixaba Creek Basin were identified based on their topographic characteristics. Given that the small reservoirs are “depressions” in the terrain, they can be “filled”, resulting in a new Digital Terrain Model (DTM). The difference between the filled DTM and the original DTM makes it possible to identify the reservoirs. A summary of the results is: 61 reservoirs were correctly detected; 18 reservoirs were not detected; 13 reservoirs were detected erroneously. In another application, the storage capacity of the reservoirs belonging to the hydrosystems of Pajeú River Basin was estimated. The storage in these reservoirs and maximum surface area were estimated using DTM and geoprocessing tools. From the total of 31 reservoirs evaluated, eight were completely empty at the time of the LiDAR data collection. The official registers reported 83.83 million m3 for the storage capacity of these eight reservoirs, whereas our applications estimated the value at 70.23 million m3. This difference is explained by the loss of volume in the reservoirs due to the process of sediment transport.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To survive in the ceaseless cycle of competition, businesses have developed strategies to become sustainable. These strategies include reusing products, which can lead not only to the creation of economic benefits but also to improvements in a corporation’s social and environmental responsibility. Product reuse can also increase the profit earned on new products by compensating customers who bring in old products to buy new ones, as the ensuing remanufacturing process allows for the reuse of materials and thus drives down costs. As businesses have come to recognize these values, the marketing competition to retrieve used products from customers has intensified. This research focuses on identifying effective compensation strategies to determine the appropriate advertising investment and trade-in value in a market where two homogeneous retailers compete. Retailers advertise to secure more customers to trade in their used products and to generate more trade-in sales than competitors do. A retailer’s results may vary according to its competitor’s investment strategy, which makes it useful to employ information on past competitor investment patterns to plan future investment strategies. However, as competitors using one another’s information may intensify the competition, better investment results could be obtained by ignoring competitor investment information. Therefore, this study suggests four competition strategies that determine the advertisement costs and trade-in allowance spent by retailers and discusses the difference in the profits obtained by the retailers under each of the four strategies.</jats:p>"

In this study, 2741 private forest owners, logging contractors, and wood products manufacturers in Virginia, U.S.A. were surveyed about their beliefs regarding the impact of certification on economic opportunities and image and the extent to which they think it positively affects the forestry sector and understand how to certify forestland. Co-orientation was used to map alignment and predictions between respondents. Owner and contractor responses were similar and predictions about each other mostly accurate, but manufacturer responses and predictions were largely incongruent. Manufacturers generally aligned more so with contractors than owners but contractors identified slightly more with owners. Owners and contractors shared perspectives and a discernable identity, whereas manufacturers viewed certification in a less positive light. Implications for participation in forest certification focus largely on interrelationships of actor perspectives regardless of scale and emphasize the roles each can play in the forest certification sector.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We describe an optimization-based methodology that Western Digital implemented to support its site-qualification decisions; that is, which sites(s) are qualified to produce each of its products. Qualifying a product at a site commonly takes several months and hundreds of hours of engineering effort. These decisions are especially challenging because Western Digital Silicon Operations offers thousands of products; and demands more than a month or two into the future are very uncertain, as they are with many electronic products. Therefore, because shortages result in lost sales, the company must consider both expected demand and demand uncertainty. We solve the problem as a mixed-integer stochastic program with multiple stages of recourse, using a linear programming solver for the recourse stages and a greedy heuristic to determine the site qualifications. Western Digital deployed the model starting in the first quarter of 2015 and established a quarterly process for making site-qualification decisions. The decision support tool facilitated a more streamlined decision process and has already provided substantial savings to Western Digital. </jats:p>",

Therefore, Xuliujing station, which is much nearer to the river mouth, is chosen to accurately estimate the net discharge in this paper. The Multi-Profile Method that considers the cross-sectional variability of flow is applied at Xuliujing station to estimate the tidal discharge. Then, the low-pass filter is used to remove the effects of the tide and the net discharge is obtained. Lastly, the net discharge in Datong and that in Xuliujing are compared. The results show that the net discharge of Xuliujing is obviously larger than that of Datong in the rainy season due to precipitation, but the net discharge of Xuliujing is slightly smaller than that of Datong in the dry season due to persistent abstraction and less precipitation. Therefore, in some degree, the net discharge of Xuliujing is more representative than that of Datong regarding the discharge into the East China Sea.</jats:p>",

The seasonality and imbalance of trade are the main factors giving rise to problems related to empty container repositioning. The aim of this paper is to develop a concept of empty container supply chains and formulate prerequisites for its modelling in the search for the optimal solution with the help of linear programming and mixed integer programming methods. This paper indicates causes of the empty container relocation problem based on the literature analysis with a special focus on the Eurasian transportation route. Also, it provides a concept of empty container supply chain, prerequisites for its modelling and examples of container supply chains modelling presented in the literature. The main results of the paper include conceptualisation of an empty container supply chain and suggested modelling prerequisites.

Having multiple modes of transportation in the system promotes supply chain sustainability. We present an integer linear programming model that captures the availability of multiple transportation modes.

The combined levitation and traction system (CLTS) with alternating current represents a kind of electrodynamic suspension system in which the traction and levitation force are created by one set of onboard electromagnets, and the lifting force is provided at any speeds of the crew, including the zero speed. The disadvantages of the system are the low energy factor and the complexity of controlling the start-brake regimes. The scope of such a system can be passenger transportation within large cities and urban agglomerations for distances up to 100 km with speeds up to 150-200 km / h. Goal. The aim of the work is the solution of the complex problem of providing CLTS onboard electromagnets with electric power with an increased energy factor and the ability to control all driving regimes. Method (methodology). Mathematical modeling of electromagnetic and electromechanical processes with subsequent evaluation of technical and economic parameters of the CLTS were used. Results. A practically realizable version of the power supply system for the on-board electromagnets CLTS is proposed. Practical significance. The proposed version of the power supply system has significant advantages over previously considered ones: the ability to flexibly control all modes of CLTS traffic with an increased energy factor. Conclusion. The system of power supply of the CLTS with alternating current from the traction network of constant voltage 3 ... 5 kV with placement of autonomous inverters onboard the crew allows to reduce the mass of the on-board electrical equipment by 10-20%, to minimize the consumption of inactive power and to flexibly control all modes of the crew's movement.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, numerous support vector machine (SVM) models were developed and tested using four series of flume experimental data sets. This study was divided into two parts; the first section aimed to model the total overland flow resistance and investigates the effect of the different parameters on the resistance. In the second section, the resistance was linearly divided into different types of resistance (namely, grain resistance (fg), form resistance (ff), wave resistance (fw), sediment transport resistance (fs)). Then the separated components (fw and fs) were estimated by SVM. The results revealed the importance of the Froude number (Fr) values as an input data in most of the estimated models. Also, it was concluded that the slope gradient has a stronger impact on the on the sediment transport resistance over plane beds than the other hydraulic properties do. The outcome of the models approved the capability of the proposed models based on SVM. Also, SVM outperformed the empirical approaches.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is difficult to demonstrate Fe corrosion in concrete in the laboratory in a short time. A new method for acceleration of Fe corrosion is necessary. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Recently, some researchers tried to accelerate the Fe corrosion in concrete. They accelerated Fe corrosion by anodic polarization and cyclic corrosion test. In this study, an accelerated corrosion test method with enhancing oxygen supply was developed to enhance oxygen reduction on Fe surface and Fe corrosion in concrete. The effect of amount of oxygen supply on Fe corrosion in cement paste and mortar will be discussed in our presentation. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The sample was 99.5% Fe sheet with 7×7 mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>and 1 mm thickness. The Fe sample was embedded in cement paste or mortar with 5 mm cover thickness and cured for 28 days. In order to prompt breakdown of passive film on the Fe sample, 2.06 M NaCl solution was mixed to the cement paste and mortar. Fig. 1 shows the schematic image of Hyperbaric-oxygen accelerated corrosion test we developed. In the gas pressure chamber, Fe in cement and Fe in mortar were immersed in 2.06 M NaCl solution under the pressured oxygen of 0.5 or 2.0 MPa for 14 days. For comparison, corrosion of Fe in cement and Fe in mortar immersed in the NaCl solution under ambient air was also discussed. After finishing the immersion under pressured oxygen or ambient air, surface and cross section of Fe sample were observed using an optical microscope and SEM. In addition, composition of the rust on Fe sample was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy measurement. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Corrosion of the Fe in cement and Fe in mortar was obviously accelerated under the pressured oxygen of 0.5 MPa, and the corrosion of Fe in mortar was further enhanced than that of Fe in cement. Composition of the rust formed under the pressured oxygen of 0.5 MPa was similar to those formed in the real environment. It is thus demonstrated that the enhancement of oxygen supply is beneficial and effective to validly accelerate Fe corrosion in concrete. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Corrosion of the Fe in cement and Fe in mortar was suppressed under the pressured oxygen of 2.0 MPa compared to corrosion under the pressured oxygen of 0.5 MPa.

This article will share what occurred during one particular instance where a home owner witnessed and photographed an energized neutral event. Fortunately, a fire did not occur, but easily could have. The home owner photographed the gas appliance connector connected to a water heater that was glowing red hot during the event. It is the intent of this article to share the particulars of this case and explore the effects of an energized neutral circuit as it relates to current flow in a gas appliance connector. The energized neutral circuit was witnessed and documented by the home owner. The glowing gas appliance connector was a real event, not theoretical or staged. The glowing gas appliance connector did not result in a fire; however, it did raise questions regarding the current carrying capability of the gas appliance connector and what level of surface temperatures resulted from the current flow through the short section of gas line. The energized gas appliance connector was duplicated in the lab. The external surface temperature of the gas appliance connector was measured at various current levels and documented. </jats:p>",

Irrigation is largely governed by water availability, soil type and crop water requirements, among other factors. Thus, a study was conducted to assess the suitability of various water sources for irrigation in northern Ghana. Specifically, the study sought to assess quality of water sources in the Savelugu, Kasena-Nankana East, and Nabdam districts for small-scale irrigation development. The water quality parameters used were: pH, electrical conductivity (ECw), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), sodium percent (Na%), soluble sodium percentage (SSP), magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR), Kelley's ratio (KR), total hardness (TH), chloride (Cl), Escherichia coli, and fecal coliforms. While we found most of the irrigation water sources, including small reservoirs, dams, wells and rivers suitable, few unsuitable irrigation water sources were also identified. Overall, the study found that opportunities for scaling small-scale irrigation exist in all the sites. The knowledge generated from this study will guide irrigation water use, and agricultural policy for sustainable smallholder irrigation development in the region.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we investigate the effects of regional and temporal variation in U.S. personal bankruptcy laws on firms’ innovative activities. We find that bankruptcy laws that provide stronger debtor protection decrease the number of patents produced by small firms. Stronger debtor protection also decreases the average quality, and variance in quality, of firms’ patents. We find evidence that the negative effect of stronger debtor protection on experimentation and innovation may be due to the decreased availability of external financing in response to stronger debtor rights, an effect amplified in industries with a high dependence on external financing. Hence, while it is typically assumed that stronger debtor protection encourages innovation by reducing the cost of failure for innovators, we show that it can instead dampen innovative activities by tightening the availability of external financing to innovative firms. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by David Hsu, entrepreneurship and innovation. </jats:p>",

Meanwhile understanding the principal driving factors in the evolution of water consumption is essential for water consumption prediction and management. Firstly, the information entropies of water consumption in China were calculated from 1997 to 2010. Secondly, the principal driving factors were extracted using principal component analysis. Finally, based on the principal driving factors, the water consumption system was predicted. The results showed that the entropies can be divided into two stages: an entropy increasing period (1997–2002) and an entropy convergence period (2003–2010). On a national scale, the entropies in the majority of provinces are focused between 0.6 and 1.1. The principal driving factors were population, gross domestic product, food production, command irrigation area, and urban consumption levels. Chinese water consumption structure will develop an inverted ‘U’-shape curve and water consumption levels are expected to plateau during 1997 to 2020. The system is gradually becoming more orderly through coordination and self-organization.</jats:p>",

This is done by examining how effective collaboration in supply chain management creating confidence and trust between vendor-customer relationships that provides benefit to both organizations; one of such benefit is improved customer service. This can be obtained through the use of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), which ensures that products are delivered to customers faster with great accuracy, and demand forecasting and inventory management, which ensures that vendors maintain optimal inventory level so that they always have what customers want in stock.

The scientists believe that if environmental degradation continues at its current pace, the prospect of human life will be shrouded in mystery. One of the most effective ways to deal with the environmental adverse effects is by implementing green supply chains. In this study a multilevel mathematical model including supply, production, distribution and customer levels has been presented for routing–location–inventoryin green supply chain. Vehicle routing between distribution centres and customers has been considered in the model. Establishment place of distribution centres among potential places is determined by the model. The distributors use continuous review policy (r, Q) to control the inventory. The proposed model object is to find an optimal supply chain with minimum costs. To validate the proposed model and measure its compliance with real world problems, GAMS IDE/Cplex has been used. In order to measure the efficiency of the proposed model in large scale problems, a genetic algorithm has been used. The results confirm the efficiency of the proposed model as a practical tool for decision makers to solve location-inventory-routing problems in green supply chain. The proposed GA could reduce the solving time by 85% while reaching on the average 97% of optimal solution compared with exact method.</jats:p>"

(<jats:italic>Journal of Political Economy</jats:italic>, 2002, 110 (1): 37–72), we propose a collective labour supply model in which the custody reforms play roles of a distribution factor that influences household bargaining power. In the empirical section, using data from the March Current Population Survey and Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find a significantly positive influence of the legality on married women's labour supply and a negative influence on their husbands’. Checking robustness with different groups: non‐migrant couples, couples with children under 18, couples with children before the passage of the laws, couples married before the reforms and couples with non‐anti‐divorce religious preference, we find the results are consistent with those of the baseline model.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We offer a complete systemic review of the anatomy of arteries of the thumb, including their sources in the first web space. Eleven studies were selected from the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus and Ovid databases. Data about each artery of the thumb were obtained; in particular, the incidence and dominance of each of these arteries were calculated. The ulnopalmar digital artery of the thumb (UPDAT) was found in 99.63%, the radiopalmar digital artery of the thumb (RPDAT) in 99.26%, the ulnodorsal digital artery of the thumb (UDDAT) in 83.39%, and the radiodorsal digital artery of the thumb (RDDAT) in 70.38%. The sources for the thumb arteries are the first palmar metacarpal artery (for UPDAT in 63.15%, for RPDAT in 78.88%, for UDDAT in 56.95% and for RDDAT in 41.48%), the first dorsal metacarpal artery (for UPDAT in 20.54%, for RPDAT 2.53%, for UDDAT in 20.62%, and for RDDAT in 4.81%) and the superficial palmar arch, either complete or incomplete (for UPDAT in 25.57%, for RPDAT in 23.04%, for UDDAT in 0%, and for RDDAT in 5.19%). The dominant source could be identified in 88.2% of cases: the first palmar metacarpal artery (66.2%), the first dorsal metacarpal artery (15.5%) and the superficial palmar arch, complete or incomplete (8.2%). Four arteries usually supply the thumb. Any artery in the first web space can be a source for the thumb arteries. We propose a new classification of the arteries of the hand, dividing them into three systems (superficial palmar, deep palmar and dorsal system), and suggest that the term “princeps pollicis artery” be reconsidered and systemic anatomical terms of the thumb arteries preferred.

The study area includes four groundwater systems of Halkidiki Prefecture in Northern Greece, all facing serious water quality and/or quantity issues, especially during the summer period due to intensive agricultural activity and tourism. Within all four systems, the water demand is met exclusively by groundwater resources. Initially, a supply–demand model is applied under different climate conditions to assess groundwater resource availability. Then a certain quantity of surface water is considered available, due to the potential (future) construction and operation of two reservoirs within the study area and an optimal water allocation model using linear programming is developed. The combined use and allocation of surface and subsurface water under climate changing conditions is also being studied by investigating three additional scenarios in which either every one of the two reservoirs operates solely or both reservoirs operate together. The model was applied using Water and Evaluation Planning (WEAP) software, while the climate data were abstracted from Regional Climate Model REGCM3_10 km and ERA-Interim reanalysis data bases. Finally, the results of unmet demand, water supply coverage and reservoir storage were evaluated as water management action efficiency indicators.</jats:p>",

In addition, the environmental impacts caused by increases in the production of certain foods have made food supplying even more challenging. As few studies have dealt with this issue in Brazil, this paper aims to evaluate the country's nutritional situation since 1995, focusing on the effects of producing animal feed and biofuels on both the domestic availability of food and the role of Brazil as a food supplier to foreign countries. We estimate the quantity of nutrients produced in the country, compare them with the necessities of Brazilians and estimate the population that could be fed by means of Brazilian exports. The results indicate that despite the food-feed-fuel competition, the supply of food has increased and has been sufficient to nourish all Brazilians plus a number even larger of foreigners. As food availability is adequate, the large number of Brazilians still exposed to undernourishment reflects the limited access to food by low-income consumers. We also conclude that Brazil could contribute even more to feed foreigners if policies were implemented aiming to induce farmers to produce a different sort of products.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>After the deregulation of the sugar and alcohol sector, the decision on the location and scale of processing units was transferred to the private sector. Given the competition, the search for raw materials increased substantially and became the key variable in determining the viability of plants. The neoclassical microeconomics indicates that the increase in capacity is the result of a decision to maximize the outcome of firms, especially considering the industrial economies of scale. However, the theory of industrial organization, raises the possibility of the decision on the installed capacity be affected by the competitive strategy of the firm, leading to raise barriers to entry. Thus, plants located in regions with greater competition for sugarcane would work with higher levels of idle capacity, as deterrent to entry of new units. Using techniques of geo-referencing, the research shows that in the traditional sugarcane areas, the installed capacity in recent years far exceeds the availability of raw material. Thus, it is unlikely that plants installed in these regions are operating in an ìoptimalî level grinding. Gains force the hypothesis that excess capacity has the role to impose barriers to entry despite the reduced efficiency of the plants</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Disasters are on the increase globally with accompanying devastating effects on dairy supply chains. The devastating effects, caused by disasters on economies in various countries such as United States of America, Japan, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique and Zimbabwe call for urgent sustainable mitigating measures in disaster risk reduction. These countries have experienced notable natural and man-made disasters in the past. The disasters negatively impacted the economies of both developed and developing countries, causing misery to people as hunger and poverty drastically increased. Zimbabwe’s dairy industry was not spared from these devastating effects as it was vulnerable to disasters such as droughts and cyclones. Disasters adversely affected supply chains in the country as evidenced by the closure of some dairy firms between the years 2000 and 2014. This article is set against the backdrop of declining output across all agricultural sectors in Zimbabwe, evident particularly in the dairy farming sector which has witnessed inadequate supply of raw milk and dairy products by local producers. The article assesses the impact of dairy organisations’ partnerships with government departments and non-governmental organisations in reducing disaster risks on the dairy supply chain cost efficiency. It also aims to show how partnerships can reduce disaster risks and weighs the benefits of reduced supply chain costs in improving the affordability of milk and milk products to the general public. The study employs a mixed-methods approach comprising structured questionnaires, administered to a sample of 92 respondents out of a randomly sampled population of 122 participants from dairy farming clusters across the country, with an 85% response rate. Key informants in the form of 18 dairy officers were purposively sampled for interviews throughout the dairy farming regions. The research findings will help government in the formulation of public policies for the dairy sector network in reducing disaster risks.</jats:p>"

External inputs mainly affected quality water in the summer–autumn season. By contrast, intrinsic biochemical processes were highly correlated with water quality in the winter–spring season. Ranges of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) of four sampling sites measured 1.2 mg/L to 11.4 mg/L and 0.04 mg/L to 2.06 mg/L, respectively. TN/TP (mass ratio) was mainly between 9 and 23, indicating severely eutrophicated mainstream of the Haihe River and sufficient amounts of nutrients for phytoplankton growth and reproduction. Hence, dual nutrients control strategies should be implemented in this stagnant urban river.</jats:p>",

This paper examines further, which of these SCM models and what elements of them can be applied for wood pellet supply chains, also examining the possibility of their combination. The result of these examinations is, that even though fuel pellets can be considered as simple commodity and not a very innovative product, diversity in input characteristics, optimization of fuel pellet technology process variables and changes in output market qualities and quantities need sometimes agile, flexible answer from pellet fuel SCM. The basically lean character of pellet fuel technologies and SCM can further enhanced by implementing agile SCM model elements, as is the increased integration of suppliers into the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Due to large-scale development in the last 60 years, the ecological environment of Sanjiang Plain has changed significantly. In order to identify the eco-environmental problems and make regional ecological environment and water resources sustainable, trend and correlation analyses were performed to analyze the eco-environmental effects of WRDU from the aspects of water resources, land resources, vegetation and climate. The results show that the regional eco-environmental effects caused by WRDU in Sanjiang Plain are significant. The quantity and quality of groundwater resources and the social and ecological functions of land resources are significantly affected by the regional development and utilization of water resources, while the effect of surface water resources is not obvious. The changes of vegetation and climate are also significant, but the response mechanism to WRDU requires further study. With the changes of extent, pattern and degree of surface water utilization in Sanjiang Plain, the effect of surface water resources is becoming more and more prominent.</jats:p>",

The results showed that invertebrate reproduction occurred in both BAC filters, but the invertebrate abundance in the finished water processed by tra-BAC was about 15 times greater than that processed using the pre-BAC process. In the pre-BAC process, the sand filter was placed after the BAC filter, and sand filtration removed most of the invertebrates, with an average removal efficiency of 91.1%. However, the pre-BAC filter, which was positioned behind the sedimentation tank, needed to be backwashed more frequently than the tra-BAC filter because of the high turbidity of the inlet water. The frequent backwashing reduced the biomass on the activated carbon and decreased the invertebrate reproductive rate. The results of this study are helpful for evaluating the pre-BAC treatment process in drinking water treatment plants.</jats:p>",

The game effectively helps students and managers realize the challenges in managing demand and supply in wood supply chains, and gain insight into the types of measures required to make these divergent chains effective. The WSG is an adaptation of the Beer game, a popular didactic tool used to empirically demonstrate demand amplification in a simple and generic context. The supply chain modeled by the Beer game does not involve co-products, and thus is very different from the wood supply chain, which is divergent by nature. The WSG presented in this paper models a supply network with one point of divergence and demand for two products. This preserves the simplicity of the game but enables it to offer a base for supply network simulation in a large number of industrial sectors with divergent processes. We describe an online version of the WSG, discuss our experiences playing it with students and managers, and provide hints to the instructor. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Precipitation over Southwest China (SWC) significantly decreased during 1979–2013. The months from July to September (JAS) contributed the most to the decrease in precipitation. By tracing moisture sources of JAS precipitation over the SWC region, it is found that most moisture originates in regions from the northern Indian Ocean to SWC and from South China Sea to SWC. The major moisture contributing area is divided into an extended west region, SWC, and an extended east region. The extended west region is mainly influenced by the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) and the westerlies, while the extended east region is mainly influenced by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). The extended west, SWC, and extended east regions contribute 48.2, 15.5, and 24.5 % of the moisture for the SWC precipitation, respectively. Moisture supply from the extended west region decreased at a rate of −7.9 mm month−1 decade−1, whereas that from the extended east increased at a rate of 1.4 mm month−1 decade−1, resulting in an overall decrease in moisture supply. Further analysis reveals that the decline of JAS precipitation is mainly caused by change in the seasonal-mean component rather than the transient component of the moisture transport over the SWC region. In addition, the dynamic processes (i.e., changes in wind) rather than the thermodynamic processes (i.e., changes in specific humidity) are dominant in affecting the seasonal-mean moisture transport. A prevailing easterly anomaly of moisture transport that weakened moisture supply from the Indian Ocean is to a large extent responsible for the precipitation decrease over the SWC region.\n                    </jats:p>"

We find that men and people with higher education are more likely to migrate than women and people with lower education. Middle‐aged people are also more likely to migrate than young or old people. International migration does not seem to affect the overall employment of remaining members of migrant‐sending households. However, it tends to increase the self‐employed work of members of migrant‐sending households. Finally, international migration also helps migrant‐sending households increase their wealth index. Remittances are used to improve living conditions (housing) and purchase more assets and durables. This finding supports the theory as well as the policy to increase migration as a way to stabilize consumption and reduce poverty in low income countries.</jats:p>",

The intelligent system developed is generic, which allows the application of its control structure in similar processes, and it was applied in an experimental setup that simulates a real water supply system. The performance of the network was tested experimentally under different operating conditions, including in the presence of disturbances. The settling time was, in all experiments, less than 30 seconds, the tests did not show overshoot and the maximum error was 2.9%. Results showed excellent performance in terms of pressure regulation, and it is hoped that the controller can be successfully implemented in real water distribution systems, in order to reduce water and electricity consumption, decrease maintenance costs and increase the reliability of operating procedures.</jats:p>",

We develop mathematical models for quantity-based and time-based policies and obtain optimality properties for the models. Efficient algorithms using optimal properties are provided to compute the optimal parameters for ordering and shipment decisions.

In the process of establishing the model, we follow the metastatic pattern of water resources' ecological economic value. The model considered the discharge of pollutant between administrative area, pollutant absorbing capacity of river basin, ability of pollutant treatment and other factors, so as to closely combine ecological compensation standard with the total pollutants and water resource value (WRV). On this basis, total pollutant control model (TPC) and WRV model were constructed, the former model complied with properties of regional socio-economic, environmental resources and water environmental carrying capacity while the latter reflected the situation of resources, environment and socio-economic. And further, the ecological compensation standard coupling model of TPC-WRV was constructed by these two models, and the dilution water was introduced as a coupling pathway. Applying this coupling model to Xiao Honghe of China, the ecological compensation standard of four counties from 2008 to 2012 was calculated. The results show that the compensation value of Xiao Honghe basically presented increasing trend from upstream to downstream during 2008 to 2012. This study develops new ideas to comprehensively quantify the ecological compensation standard of river basin.</jats:p>",

Hence, it is pivotal to understand how such large brand portfolios and global supply networks could be effectively managed in a united way.

Also to relate it to the Modern Supply Chain in relevant to future Demand for the sustainable growth of this Industry . Textile industry of Bangladesh has been occupying as the largest source of exports and foreign currency for the country . It contributes 82.3% of the total export of Bangladesh .Also 4.00 Millions of women and men are employed in this industry. The export-oriented RMG sector has some distinctive features, which differentiate it from other businesses. Wage, supply chain, timeframe, and compliances are among the most important features of this business. Whatever the wage level or lead time is without proper supply chain management no business is viable. Our endeavor was to manage and exploit the opportunity that lies in an integrated supply chain which will provide competitive advantage to the Bangladesh garment factories. The study revels that the decision makers and planners of Textile &amp; Clothing Industry should align their supply chain strategies, work together with all the supply chain partners, share information among the stages of supply chain, have a standard SCM procedure, comply the code of conduct, adapt changing technologies, minimize corruption and bureaucratic tangles in customs, cut lead time etc to sustain its growth.</jats:p>"

Power, gas and heat systems are becoming tightly interlinked with each other in ESI. The dispatching strategy of local-area ESI has significant impact on its operation. In this paper, a local-area ESI operational scheduling model based on conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is proposed to minimize expected operational cost, which considers the uncertainty of energy supply-side and demand-side as well as multi-energy network constraints, including electrical network, thermal network and gas network. The risk cost is analyzed comprehensively under the condition of under- or overestimated cost. On this basis, a hybrid method combining particle swarm optimization with interior point algorithm is executed to compute the optimal solutions of two-stage multi-period mixed-integer convex model. Finally, a case study is performed on ESI to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Three different process types of heat supply for industrial production processes requiring low temperature heat at 140°C are analyzed and compared with each other. The thermodynamic and economic efficiency of a gas turbine process with a heat recovery boiler (GT), a gas and steam turbine combined cycle process with a back-pressure turbine (GT-CC) and a high temperature heat pump (HTHP) system recovering waste heat from humid exhaust air between 90°C and 50°C are assessed based on energy flows, exergy flows and costs of heat provided as 4 bar (abs) saturated steam. The economic analysis bases on the comparison of the consumption-related costs of heat, the capital-related costs of heat and the operation-related costs of heat. The payback-times are calculated for different HTHP investment cost levels (1000 EUR/kW<jats:sub>Q</jats:sub>, 750 EUR/kW<jats:sub>Q</jats:sub>, 500 EUR/kW<jats:sub>Q</jats:sub>and 250 EUR/kW<jats:sub>Q</jats:sub>). To evaluate the effects of fluctuating energy costs, a sensitivity analysis with varying gas and electricity prices has been carried out.</jats:p><jats:p>The results show that the HTHP system, even with modest performance assumptions, has a higher exergetic efficiency than the GT or the GT-CC process. For the consumption-related costs, the economic calculation shows that the operation of a HTHP, working with a coefficient of performance (COP) of four and for a natural gas price of 25 EUR/MWh, is the cheapest way of heat production as long as the electricity price is lower than 45 EUR/MWh. An electricity price above 45 EUR/MWh makes a GT-CC process more favorable. For the period from January 2013 until June 2016, the total costs of heat and the payback times, based on real gas and electricity prices from the EEX, are calculated and analyzed. For overall cost-optimized heat supply, the results show that the share of heat provided by the HTHP system varies between 45% and 76% between January 2013 and June 2016. Especially in 2013 and 2014, the economic conditions for operating heat pumps were very good. Since October 2015, the natural gas prices have seen a decrease and the economic conditions shifted again favoring the industrial heat supply with combined heat and power systems.</jats:p>",

Economists have argued that, in the presence of excess demand, waiting times act as nonmonetary prices to bring demand for and supply of health care in equilibrium. Using administrative data disaggregated by region and surgical procedure over 2010–2014 in Italy, we estimate demand and supply elasticities with respect to waiting times. We employ linear regression models with first differences and instrumental variables to deal with endogeneity of waiting times. We find that demand is inelastic to waiting times while supply is more elastic. Estimates of demand elasticity are between −0.15 to −0.24. Our results have implications on the effectiveness of policies aimed at increasing supply and their ability to reduce waiting times.</jats:p>",

Structure and morphology of raw scoria (RS) and Fe(III)-doped scoria (FeS) were studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A four-factor central composite design combined with response surface modeling (RSM) was employed for maximizing fluoride and nitrate removal based on 30 different experimental data obtained in a batch system. At optimum condition, the maximum removal of fluoride and nitrate were 78.36% and 81.4%, respectively. The kinetic of fluoride and nitrate adsorption onto RS and FeS were followed the pseudo-first-order with high determination coefficient values (R2 &amp;gt; 0.997). The isotherm data of fluoride was fitted with the Freundlich model, whereas equilibrium data of nitrate are better fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model. The Langmuir maximum adsorption capacities of Fe(III)-doped scoria for fluoride and nitrate were 0.317 and 11.3 mg/g, respectively. In conclusion, Fe(III)-doped scoria is recommended as an economic and efficient sorbent for nitrate and fluoride removal from contaminated water.</jats:p>",

Five common factors (agricultural activities, groundwater extraction, industrial activities, river pollution, and sewage discharges) represented 77.10% of the total variance. The results showed that the relatively high pollution risk mainly occurred in the west, with 19.91% of the area. The southeastern area showed a low risk of pollution, covering only 1.07% of the study area.

The supply chain integration and collaboration of the SMEs was also explored to ascertain the IT influence. A quantitative methodology was used as it was the best way to measure the extent of the information technology (IT) influence. The participants were sent questionnaires via the e-mail and provided feedback to the researcher via the same medium. The sample size of 300 comprised the owner/manager in the manufacturing and service sector SMEs from the two provinces. The data collected was analysed using a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) method and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using AMOS 22 Statistical Analysis software. The findings from the study indicated that information technology adoption enhanced integration and collaboration of SMEs supply chain. It also emerged that there was wide application of information technology amongst most of the SMEs approached. The other benefits that emerged from the increased use of IT in the supply chain included enhancement of customer service, inventory management, lead time, and relationship building. Indeed, Instilling IT skills to the SMEs employees was actually knowledge enhancement in performing business tasks.</jats:p>"

Labor supply is analyzed both at the extensive and intensive margins using cross-sectional data for 2011. To overcome endogeneity concerns, an instrumental variable approach was implemented. Findings demonstrate that migration, rather than remittances, pushes the left-behind youth to become unpaid family workers. This is explained by the substitution effect as the youth left behind are called upon to replace the migrant labor. Moreover, this effect is heterogeneous – female youth are more inclined to becoming unpaid family workers both at the extensive and intensive margins. </jats:p>",

First, the SCE algorithm is merged with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to form the SCE-DE algorithm. Then, a complex mathematical function is used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance and validate the SCE-DE algorithm and the outcomes are compared with the original SCE algorithm to show the superiority of the proposed SCE-DE algorithm. In addition, the two-reservoir system of Dez-Gotvand is considered as a real optimization problem to evaluate the performance of the SCE-DE algorithm. It is revealed that optimization by SCE-DE is much better than SCE. In conclusion, the results show that the proposed SCE-DE algorithm is a reasonable alternative to optimizing resource systems and can be used to solve complex issues of water resources.</jats:p>",

The study was conducted in the years 2014-2015 on a selected rural water supply line. The analysis was based on values of hourly water demand as measured by a water meter coupled with a recording device. The research showed that both the volume and fluctuations in daily water demand were higher in the spring and the summer, versus the autumn and the winter. This was most probably caused by water consumption for additional purposes, specific for rural areas. Individual water demand was the highest in the summer, and the lowest in the winter. Two peaks for hourly water demand were determined for the analyzed seasons. The morning peak always occurred at 7 a.m. on working days, while on days off work it fell at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m., depending on the season. The evening peak always fell at 8 p.m., regardless of a season or a day of a week. On working days, the evening peak was always higher than the morning one, while on days off work the morning peak was higher than the evening one in the autumn and in the winter, and both peaks were the same in the spring and in the summer.</jats:p>",

However, the recent integration of supply‐side factors into economic base models (EBMs) can contribute to renewing applications of this type of model in regional economics. This paper proposes a literature review focused on new EBMs that explicitly take into account supply effects and includes both North American and European studies. It first explains why integrating supply‐side factors is relevant for EBMs. Second, the paper shows how to integrate these supply‐side factors into the various types of models, focusing on two production factors: land and its amenities and labor. Third, the paper discusses the conditions for integrating such supply‐side factors into EBMs.</jats:p>",

This study maps the mobility of recently graduated teachers in urban, exurban, micropolitan and other rural areas of Iceland. The graduation rate of teachers was found to be higher in rural than urban areas, yet rural teachers are less likely to remain after graduation. Relatively few rural teachers return from on‐campus studies in the either the capital area or the northern regional centre. Rural distance students are however almost equally likely as urban on‐campus students to stay in their home areas after graduation, and they are the majority of teachers in rural areas. From a policy perspective, distance education appears more effective than regional campuses in increasing the supply of qualified teachers in rural and remote areas.</jats:p>",

Conditional on demand-side factors, we find that corruption is highly correlated with an increase in land supply. The corruption effects are strongest for commercial land, followed by residential land, and then industrial land. To shed light on the competition motives among prefectural leaders, we examine how the number of years in office affects land supply and distinguish among different hypotheses. Our empirical results show robust rising trends in land sales. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that among prefectural leaders the impatience and anxiety in later years from not being promoted may contribute to an increase in land sales revenue in later years. We also find that prefectural leaders may aim for more land sales revenue over their first few years in office instead of seeking higher revenue in their first 1–2 years. </jats:p>",

The criteria for evaluating the quality and quantity of available water were based on works from classical antiquity and remained essentially unchanged from early colonial times to the end of the empire. Not even population growth and increasing susceptibility to epidemics in the nineteenth century induced the authorities to reform the water supply system, as they were confident that the city was provided with good and abundant water by virtue of its natural predisposition.</jats:p>",

Relying on dynamic panel techniques, we observe that acreage, production and yields respond to price signals, even if with a limited intensity. Moreover, we find that direct price incentives arising from border protection, government interventions in domestic markets, and price shocks at the border stimulate farmers’ supply. We also show that omitting transaction costs from the analysis leads to underestimation of the price elasticity of supply. Conversely, using wholesale instead of farm gate prices as proxy for producer prices leads to overestimation of this price elasticity.</jats:p>",

However, little is known about how forced labor arises within domestic supply chains concentrated within national borders, producing products for domestic consumption. We conduct one of the first studies of forced labor in domestic supply chains, through a cross‐industry comparison of the regulatory gaps surrounding forced labor in the United Kingdom. We find that understanding the dynamics of forced labor in domestic supply chains requires us to conceptually modify the global value chain framework to understand similarities and differences across these contexts. We conclude that addressing the governance gaps that surround forced labor will require scholars and policymakers to carefully refine their thinking about how we might design operative governance that effectively engages with local variation.</jats:p>",

Previous studies have examined the relationships between supplier management–related variables and market performance with cross-sectional data; however, little guidance is available for newly internationalizing ventures aiming to build a global supply chain network from scratch. To shed light on this dynamic process, we examine Uniqlo's successful supply chain development in China, using longitudinal contextual data. Our findings show that Uniqlo went through discrete dynamic stages in its supply chain development efforts. First, Uniqlo, initially a small firm, developed relational governance with its suppliers by exercising dynamic economic power concentration over time. Second, it began to provide technical support to help its suppliers build competence with the aim of increasing their cooperation. Third, Uniqlo enforced compulsory nonexclusivity arrangements with suppliers to achieve supplier flexibility by not just having Uniqlo as primary customer. This provides relational flexibility through both relational governance and partner flexibility for the principal firm in the global supply chain development. </jats:p>",

In-situ measurements were performed in April, June, August and October of 2013 in the Panjiakou, a channel reservoir located in Hebei Province of China. Sampling points of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were set at 0.5 m under water surface, 1/2 water depth and near the bottom, respectively, while Chl-a were set according to thermocline. The spatiotemporal variations of TN, TP and Chl-a were studied using Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) method, and the influence of nutrients on Chl-a was examined using an empirical method. Generally, the peak values of both TN and TP concentrations appeared in October. The TN concentration in the upstream was higher than that in the downstream, while the TP concentration was opposite. High nutrients concentration or low nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (NPR) promoted the increase of Chl-a concentration. However, phosphorus was the limiting element to Chl-a as it had placed greater contribution to NPR than nitrogen. Therefore, limiting phosphorus input is important to improve reservoir water quality.</jats:p>",

We also show that the price index is always lower, while labor supply, per capita income, real wages, and welfare are always higher in the more agglomerated region.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The role of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in the governance of global supply chains is typically neglected or simply dismissed as ineffective. This is understandable as global supply chains have undermined the traditional nation state (horizontal) paradigm of global labour governance, most notably the international Conventions agreed by the tripartite constituents (governments, employers and workers’ representatives) of the ILO. But this simply poses the question of whether, and if so how, the ILO can reframe the system of global labour governance to include the (vertical) global supply chains that all too often fail to deliver ‘decent work for all’. Based on an extended ethnographic study, we demonstrate how policy entrepreneurs (international civil servants) within the ILO can play a pivotal role in not only reframing the discourse in a way that resonates with the ‘lived experiences’ of constituents but also ‘orchestrate’ the social partners in order to secure majority support for a process that might ultimately lead to a new standard (Convention) for decent work in global supply chains. A new approach to employment relationships in global supply chains is ‘in the making’, with the potential to improve working conditions and rights at work for millions across the globe. </jats:p>",

A microbial fuel cell (MFC) system comprising graphite felt electrodes was also installed to generate electricity in the paddy field. The highest rice yield (9.0 ton/ha), dry mass (12.4 ton/ha), and protein content (13.1%), an important nutrient in animal feed, were obtained when a bottom-to-top irrigation (TWW was supplied to the underdrain pipe) was applied at the highest flow rate. The bottom-to-top irrigation achieved 79 to 91% removal of nitrogen in TWW, which was much higher than the top-to-top irrigation (58%). No accumulation of heavy metals was found in the experimental soils, and heavy metal concentrations in brown rice were lower than the allowable levels of current standards. The electric output from the MFC system was much lower than that reported in normal paddy fields, probably due to the poor connection between cables and electrodes. Further study is necessary to improve the electricity generation and to continuously monitor heavy metals in brown rice and the soil.</jats:p>",

However, since model input parameters (i.e. hydraulic response unit (HRU) map, stream network, database (DB), etc.) should be built by user manually, it is difficult to use the model for a nonprofessional or environmental policy decision-maker. In addition, it is difficult to analyze model outputs in time and space because the model does not provide geographic information system (GIS) information for the simulation results. To overcome the limitations, an advanced version of L-THIA ACN-WQ system which is based on ArcGIS interface was developed in this study. To evaluate the applicability of the developed system, it was applied to the Banbyeon A watershed in which total maximum daily load (TMDL) has been implemented. The required model input datasets were automatically collected in the system, and stream flow, T-N and T-P pollutant loads were simulated for the watershed. Furthermore, flow duration curve (FDC) and load duration curve (LDC) were generated to analyze hot spot areas in the system through automatic processes included in the system. The system can establish the model input data easily, automatically provide the graphs of FDC and LDC, and provide hot spot areas which indicate high pollutant loads. Therefore, this system can be useful in establishing various watershed management plans.</jats:p>",

However, the use of ultra‐low supply voltage in millimetre‐wave circuits provides an interesting application scenario not only for demonstrating the potential of modern silicon germanium (SiGe) HBT technologies in implementing severely power‐constrained wireless circuits on silicon but also for verifying the accuracy of compact models beyond standard characteristics typically measured by foundries. The results of a 96 GHz frequency tripler deliberately designed with a reduced supply voltage (0.5 V) in a 130 nm SiGe HBT technology are presented. With only 4.7 mW DC power consumption, this frequency tripler achieves a conversion loss of 3.8 dB, generating a 96 GHz output signal with only −10 dBm input signal at 32 GHz.

As a solution, we proposed a three-tier model to optimize the distribution of river water resources. Using three constraint conditions, namely the ratio of wastewater to clean water, the eco-environmental water requirements of each node and the use of wetland projects, we determined various water quantity and quality allocation scenarios. We tested the model on the Qingyi River, and found that, for the recommended scenario that involved enhanced water-saving, a wastewater/clean water ratio and wetlands, more than 80% of the eco-environmental water requirements of each node except for the Luma section were achieved for each month. While the water quality in some individual river sections did not meet the standards for a few months of the year, the water quality of the remaining sections could be improved from class V, the current state, to class IV, and ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand (COD) standards could be achieved 82% and 96% of the time, respectively. These results show that the proposed model is effective and fit for purpose.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Wireless sensor technologies open up new possibilities for optimizing product quality and spoilage in the perishables supply chain. In particular, the processing of sensor data such as temperature information allows for the construction of novel issuing policies in retail distribution centres for fresh or frozen goods (e.g., meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, flowers). The objective of the present study is to investigate the potential of sensor-based issuing policies in comparison to classical policies based on identity and expiry information. In a simulation study, we consider a three-echelon supply chain model, including a manufacturer, a distribution centre, and a retail store. We investigate the impact of different combinations of issuing policies and customer withdrawal behaviours on the quality of sold goods and total spoilage. Our results show that sensor-based issuing policies may pose an effective complement to conventional issuing policies. However, they also indicate that wireless sensors are no one-size-fits-all solution and that important trade-offs must be taken into account in the selection of a specific policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Esta investigación analizó un conjunto de hogares que experimentan escasez de agua para consumo doméstico en la comunidad Maraxco en Chiquimula, Guatemala. Históricamente, esta comunidad ha estado bajo condiciones de sequías prolongadas. Estas condiciones han contribuido sustancialmente a reducir la capacidad del sistema comunitario de agua de satisfacer las necesidades de esta comunidad. En esta investigación se identificó y estimó los costos económicos de las distintas medidas de adaptación (también llamadas defensivas) implementadas por los hogares ante la escasez de agua (p.ej. colectar agua de los ríos y quebradas, compra de agua con vendedores privados, e invertir en infraestructura de almacenamiento). También, se estimó el Beneficio Social Neto (BSN) de un nuevo sistema comunitario de agua entubada, el cual se supone que evitaría que los hogares realicen las acciones defensivas ya mencionadas. Para estimar este BSN se usaron dos métodos de valoración económica: el método de costos evitados, y el método de valoración contingente. Los resultados indican que los hogares enfrentan la ineficiencia del actual sistema comunitario de agua mediante tres grupos de medidas de adaptación: 1) colecta y acarreo de agua, 2) compra de agua, y 3) almacenamiento de agua.  En promedio, todas las medidas de adaptación imputan a cada hogar costos mensuales de 15.14 US$ (115.20 quetzales), distribuidos en: costos por colecta y acarreo 5.15 US$ (39.19 quetzales) mensuales, costos por almacenamiento 0.96 US$ (7.29 quetzales) mensuales, y costos por compra de agua 9.03 US$ (68.69 quetzales) mensuales. Dentro de los costos de colecta y acarreo, el tiempo invertido representa el 34.03% de dichos costos. Respecto a la implementación de un nuevo sistema de provisión de agua entubada, se estableció que la disposición a pagar es de 21.23 US$ al mes por hogar. Por su parte la construcción de un nuevo sistema comunitario de agua entubada sería rentable y proporcionaría ganancias sociales con ambos métodos de valoración económica utilizados. En un horizonte de 30 años, flujos de caja constantes y tasas de descuento de 8, 10 y 12 %, el VAN fue superior a 0 en todos los casos, con lo que el nuevo sistema comunitario superó exitosamente la prueba de costo-beneficio. Finalmente, los hallazgos de esta investigación proveen elementos importantes para guiar la aplicación de políticas públicas en el sector de agua para consumo doméstico, y para promover inversiones que permitan mejorar los sistemas de suministro comunitarios de agua. Si dichos sistemas son fortalecidos, esencialmente se mejorará la capacidad de adaptación de las comunidades rurales ante eventos de sequía (es decir, mejor capacidad de suministro de agua para hacer frente a la escasez) y, por ende, se incrementará su bienestar.</jats:p>"

The objectives of this study are: (1) To examine the important factors influencing customers’ attitude to participate in RSCM; (2) To examine the important factors influencing customers’ subjective norm to participate in RSCM; (3) To examine the main factors influencing customers’ perceived behavioral control to participate in RSCM; (4) To examine the influence of attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on customers’ participation intention in RSCM. The Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour (DTPB) has been chosen as the underpinning theory for this research. The research conducted employed the quantitative approach. Non-probability (convenience sampling) method was used to determine the sample and data was collected using questionnaires. Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique was employed. A total of 800 questionnaires were distributed among customers of electronic products in Malaysia. Finally, the questionnaire was distributed among the customers in electronic retailer companies based on convenience sampling method. The empirical results confirm that consumers perception about the risk associated with EOL electronic products, consumers’ ecological knowledge and relative advantages associated with reuse, repair and recycling can influence the attitude of consumers to return the EOL products for reuse, repair and recycling to producer.</jats:p>"

Previous research has highlighted benefits of IAJS for the thermal climate and energy saving potential in view of human thermal perception of the indoor environment. The study herein explores the occupant acceptability of air movements and perceived indoor air quality. Thirty-six participants were exposed to three room air temperatures (nominal: 22.5℃, 25.5℃ and 28.5℃) with each having four air speed conditions (nominal: &lt; 0.15 m/s under mixing ventilation (MV) and 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 m/s under IAJS) measured at the breathing height (1.1 m). The results show that participants preferred low air movements at lower temperatures and high air movements at higher temperatures. A model to predict percentage satisfied with intermittent air movements was developed. The model predicts that 87% of occupants, in compliance with ASHRAE 55-2013 standard, will find intermittent air movements acceptable between 23.7℃ and 29.1℃ within an air speed range of 0.4 to 0.8 m/s. IAJS also improved participants' perception of air quality in conditions deemed poor under MV. The findings support the potential of IAJS as a primary ventilation system in high occupant spaces such as classrooms. </jats:p>",

Potential sediment source regions and conduits for sediment supply into the deep-water portion of the basin are evaluated based on the tectonic history and framework of the region, and are supported by observations from published well, reflection seismic and isopach data. The outcrop geology of the present-day land areas adjacent to the basin is used as a guide to the likely provenance and, hence, quality of potential siliciclastic reservoirs. Reservoir presence and reservoir quality are key subsurface risks for exploration in deep-water plays involving Maykop turbidite sandstones and charge from the well-known Maykop organic carbon-rich mudstones that are widespread across the basin.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Sediments sourced from the NE Moesian Platform and Dobrogea, channelled into the offshore Black Sea via the Histria Trough, are considered moderate risk in terms of primary reservoir quality, as evidenced by thick packages of fine-grained sediment. In contrast, sediments derived from the southern Strandja Massif fed into the Burgas Basin, and potentially into the deeper-water Turkish Black Sea, are relatively low risk in terms of reservoir quality, given the abundance of acidic intrusions within the massif. Sediment derived from parts of the northern Strandja Massif, especially the volcaniclastics of the Srednogornie region, are likely to have poorer reservoir quality characteristics. Sediments derived from the granitic Bolu Massif within the Pontides might be of good reservoir quality but are likely to be ponded behind the offshore Kozlu Ridge. An important sediment source-to-sink system was derived from the Balkanides and entered the deeper-water western Black Sea via the Kamchia Trough. The present-day Kamchia river is a relatively minor sediment supplier to the Black Sea, but the palaeo-Kamchia river of the Oligocene–Early Miocene would have exploited a much greater drainage area consisting of an axial trunk stream, occupying the newly formed Kamchia Foredeep to the north of the Balkanides, and transverse rivers sourcing sediment from the granitic and gneissic bodies of the Balkan Mountains and from Early Cretaceous and Palaeogene sandstones. These would provide reasonable reservoir quality, and it is estimated from reference source-to-sink relationships that offshore sediment flux via this system was probably at least eight times greater than at present. Known shelf-edge canyons in offshore Bulgaria facilitated this sediment reaching the deep water offshore, where a sedimentary fan with a length in excess of 150 km is likely to have developed. This suggests that the potential is good for encountering good-quality reservoir sands in the Maykop succession deep water of the western Black Sea, and this aspect of regional play risk could be of less concern than was previously considered.</jats:p>",

The Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) in Chuoshui River watershed is selected as a study case and an integrated risk assessment tool of water resources TaiWAP is used. The water shortage of FPC is mainly in the dry seasons because the water rights of public and agricultural uses are prioritized over industrial use. The considered adaptation options including water reuse, a desalination plant, smart agricultural water management, and rainwater harvesting. The results show that the waste-water reuse and sea-water desalination are the most effective adaptation options, which reduces the water shortage risks 33–44% per day in the return period of ten years. The results are generalized for the reference of other studies. The risk assessment and adaptation measure identification of the company require regional information. Moreover, some adaptation measures that the company implements help reduce the water shortage of the region and are consequently beneficial to the company, e.g., smart agricultural water management.</jats:p>"

Methods The data were obtained monthly, from November 2014 to April 2015, at eight locations in two rivers in the south of Brazil. The landscape is predominantly rural, with the occurrence of small reforested areas, as well as yerba mate and grape cultivations. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected monthly using a Surber sampler. Water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration were measured in the field using a portable oximeter. The following parameters were measured in the laboratory: pH, Turbidity, BOD, Conductivity and Nitrate. Results The evaluation carried out in the rivers revealed good water quality, but some sample sites presented reduced water quality. The waters of the Leãozinho River were classified as doubtful at site 1 and as good at sites 2, 3 and 4. Ligeirinho River presented an acceptable rating at sites 1 and 4 and was classified as good at sites 2 and 3. The BMWP’ index was significantly correlated with the abundance of macroinvertebrates, EPT richness and BOD. The abundance and richness of macroinvertebrates in Leãozinho and Ligeirinho Rivers were associated with the physical, chemical and microbiological parameters. Conclusion This study reinforces the importance of biomonitoring in the evaluation of water quality for human consumption, considering that environmental management and monitoring practices should integrate physicochemical, microbiological and biological parameters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A high level of operational reliability of power supply systems is virtually impossible to provide without operational control of the reliability of the measurement variables (currents, voltages, powers, energies, temperatures, pressures) that characterize the condition of power equipment and technological processes. Reforming the power engineering and its transition to market relations necessitate one to toughen the requirements for the reliability of the measuring information. Inaccurate measurements are a potential source of misdiagnosis of malfunctions of equipment and they cause incorrect operation of emergency control equipment and erroneous actions of operating personnel in the control of technological processes. Operational methods of reliability control that enhance the operational reliability of the measuring information are based on the usage of the semantic value of the measured data, their consistency, process consistency, and consistency of balance. These methods use technological sense of the measured variables and they complement the methods of hardware status monitoring of automated control systems based on digital codes. That improves the overall operational reliability of the transmission, collection and processing of information. The most common semantic method of control is the method of limits (“fork”) that compares the numeric value of the measured variable with the upper and lower boundaries of valid values. The disadvantage of limit values in many cases is its poor resolution, due to the wide range of appearance of results of measurements. This reduces the probability of detection of gross and systematic errors of measurements more than it may be accepted. With this regard, the objective of a reasonable narrowing of the range of valid values of the variables, that uses the theory of statistical decisions, acquires high relevance.</jats:p>"

Starting with an initial input of nitrate from coastal upwelling, growth and grazing equations evolve phytoplankton and zooplankton over time and space following surface currents. The model simulates the transition from coastal (large phytoplankton, e.g., diatoms) to offshore (picophytoplankton and microzooplankton) communities, and in between generates a large zooplankton maximum. The method was applied to four major upwelling systems (California, Peru, Northwest Africa, and Benguela) using latitudinal estimates of wind‐driven nitrate supply and satellite‐based surface currents. The resulting zooplankton simulations are patchy in nature; areas of high concentrations coincide with previously documented copepod and krill hotspots. The exercise highlights the importance of the upwelling process and surface currents in shaping plankton communities.</jats:p>",

Energy storage system is a key solution for system operators to provide the required flexibility needed to balance the net load uncertainty. This study proposes a probabilistic approach for sizing a battery storage system (BSS) with the aim of mitigating the net load uncertainty associated with the off‐grid wind power plant. A novel battery‐sizing index that takes into account the probabilistic nature of the wind resources and the electric load is developed. The proposed sizing approach aims to quantify the required BSS capacity for operating the wind plant without incurring excessive battery installation cost as well as for reducing the mismatch between the wind generation and the electric load. An 8.5 MW utility‐scale wind farm is used as a test system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</jats:p>",

Results indicate that the optimal acreage of land irrigated increases with water right priority when hydroclimate risk exhibits a negatively skewed or right‐truncated distribution. Simulation results suggest that prior appropriation enables senior water rights holders to allocate a higher proportion of their land to irrigation, 6 times as much as junior rights holders do, creating a gap in the annual expected net revenue reaching up to $141.4 acre<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> or $55,800 per farm between the two groups. The optimal irrigated acreage, expected net revenue, and shadow value of a water right's priority are subject to substantial changes under a changing climate in the future, where temporal variation in water supply risks significantly affects the profitability of agricultural land use under the priority‐based water sharing mechanism.</jats:p>",

Water intake from a river and a neighboring urban area led to eutrophication and a strong cyanobacterial water bloom. Both the water intake and recreation were threatened due to the possible influence of cyanobacterial toxins. The lake was subjected to three sustainable restoration methods: aeration of sediment-water; iron addition to precipitate P, and; biomanipulation. The goal of our study was to determine the changes in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and chemical water variables during restoration measures. A comparison of the data obtained during this research with the pre-restoration data showed that, as a result of the treatments orthophosphates decreased, rarely exceeding 0.06 mg P·L−1, and cyanobacterial water blooms disappeared. Cyanobacteria were found in the lake but they were not abundant. Chrysophytes and diatoms were the most abundant in springtime of each year. Green algae, desmids and chrysophytes were particularly abundant in summer, while cryptophytes predominated in autumn. Algae from all these groups do not pose a threat to either recreation or water intake. The deep chlorophyll maximum occurring in summer at a depth of 5 m as a result of restoration confirms the lower trophic status of the lake, alluding to mesotrophic conditions.</jats:p>"

The annual averages of the fluoride concentrations in waters between the years of 2004 and 2015 were verified by reports supplied by the responsible company. Results: The averages of the fluoride concentrations in the water supply in the cities of Cocal do Sul and Morro da Fumaça, during the analyzed period, were 0.86 and 0,85 ppm of fluoride, respectively, without statistically significant difference. The smaller concentration was found in 2006, in the city of Morro da Fumaça, with 0.64 ppm of F; the greatest concentration occurred in Cocal do Sul, in 2007, with 1.1 ppm of F. The prevalence of dental fluorosis in Cocal do Sul was 24.5% and in Morro da Fumaça was 14.6%, without statistically significant differences. All 12-year-old schoolers who had dental fluorosis were classified as light according to Dean index. Conclusion: Most of the 12-year-old schoolers did not show any fluorosis degree. The cases of dental fluorosis were classified as little severity and with low esthetic impairment. It can be concluded that the fluoride levels in water supply were within the adequate and safe limits with low risk of dental fluorosis.</jats:p>"

Despite the importance of the anatomical sciences in the training and practice of clinicians, no studies have examined the need/state of anatomy‐related CE nationally. This study assessed the current landscape of CE in the anatomical sciences to contextualize preferences for CE, identify factors that influence the perceived need for CE, and examine the association between supply and demand. Surveys were distributed to educators in the anatomical sciences, practicing physical therapists (PTs), and anatomy training programs across the United States. Twenty‐five percent (9 of 36) of training programs surveyed offered CE, certificates, or summer series programs related to anatomy. The majority of PTs (92%) and anatomy educators (81%) felt they had a potential or actual need for anatomy related CE with the most popular formats being online videos/learning modules and intensive, hands‐on workshops. The most commonly perceived barriers to participating in CE for both groups were program location, cost, and duration, while educators also perceived time of year as a significant factor. Logistic regression analyses revealed that no investigated factor influenced the need or desire for PTs to engage in anatomy related CE (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> ≤ 0.124), while teaching experience and the highest level of learner taught significantly influenced the perceived need among anatomy educators (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001).

Existing research has produced evidence that companies can increase their suppliers’ CSR engagement by exerting explicit pressure on them, for example, through contractual clauses. Adding to this conventional chain of CSR enforcement, this article conceptualizes and empirically validates a yet-undescribed extended chain of CSR enforcement that also leads to higher levels of CSR engagement by a supplier firm, irrespective and even in absence of explicit pressure by the customer firm. In particular, a customer firm's CSR orientation in interaction with a powerful position in the supply chain leads suppliers to perceive pressure to engage in CSR regardless of factually exerted pressure. As a result, suppliers are likely to increase their CSR engagement in order to be customer oriented or in preemptive obedience. These results entail substantial implications for policy makers as well as marketing academics and managers. </jats:p>",

Of the 46 Antarctic coastal polynyas documented in a recent study, the Amundsen Sea Polynya (ASP) stands out as having the highest net primary production per unit area. Incubation experiments suggest that this productivity is partly controlled by the availability of dissolved iron (dFe). As a first step toward understanding the iron supply of the ASP, we introduce four plausible sources of dFe and simulate their steady spatial distribution using conservative numerical tracers. The modeled distributions replicate important features from observations including dFe maxima at the bottom of deep troughs and enhanced concentrations near the ice shelf fronts. A perturbation experiment with an idealized drawdown mimicking summertime biological uptake and subsequent resupply suggests that glacial meltwater and sediment‐derived dFe are the main contributors to the prebloom dFe inventory in the top 100 m of the ASP. The sediment‐derived dFe depends strongly on the buoyancy‐driven overturning circulation associated with the melting ice shelves (the “meltwater pump”) to add dFe to the upper 300 m of the water column. The results support the view that ice shelf melting plays an important direct and indirect role in the dFe supply and delivery to polynyas such as the ASP.</jats:p>",

Grounded in Ha-Brookshire’s moral responsibility theory of corporate sustainability, the authors explored a set of real-life business situations where business professionals experienced morally challenging dilemmas. The study was conducted within the context of the textile and apparel (TA) industry because of the global and fragmented supply chain nature of the industry. The real-life business situations were interpreted using Kohlberg’s moral development stage theory. The results of in-depth individual interviews followed by three focus groups of industry professionals in spring 2017 showed that participants have experienced a variety of morally challenging business situations throughout their careers. This includes simple problems at the individual and firm levels, as well as wicked and complex problems at the industry and global levels. The study concludes that for TA businesses to be truly sustainable, professionals’ moral ability is critical and, therefore, appropriate moral development education is necessary.</jats:p>"

Policymakers and nonprofit advocacy organizations are increasingly looking to engage actors across supply chains to encourage conservation and environmental impact reduction. Unfortunately, traceability across complex, heterogeneous supply hinders these efforts.

As a result, the design of release schedules requires metrics that quantify the benefit and damages created by releases to the downstream ecosystem. Such metrics should support making operational decisions under uncertain hydrologic conditions, including drought and flood seasons. This study addresses this need and develops a reservoir operation rule structure and method to maximize downstream environmental benefit while meeting human water demands. The result is a general approach for hedging downstream environmental objectives. A multistage stochastic mixed‐integer nonlinear program with Markov Chains, identifies optimal “environmental hedging,” releases to maximize environmental benefits subject to probabilistic seasonal hydrologic conditions, current, past, and future environmental demand, human water supply needs, infrastructure limitations, population dynamics, drought storage protection, and the river's carrying capacity. Environmental hedging “hedges bets” for drought by reducing releases for fish, sometimes intentionally killing some fish early to reduce the likelihood of large fish kills and storage crises later. This approach is applied to Folsom reservoir in California to support survival of fall‐run Chinook salmon in the lower American River for a range of carryover and initial storage cases. Benefit is measured in terms of fish survival; maintaining self‐sustaining native fish populations is a significant indicator of ecosystem function. Environmental hedging meets human demand and outperforms other operating rules, including the current Folsom operating strategy, based on metrics of fish extirpation and water supply reliability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Marine phytoplankton stoichiometry links nutrient supply to marine carbon export. Deviations of phytoplankton stoichiometry from Redfield proportions (106C : 1P) could therefore have a significant impact on carbon cycling, and understanding which environmental factors drive these deviations may reveal new mechanisms that regulate the carbon cycle. To explore the links between environmental conditions, stoichiometry, and carbon cycling, we compared four different models for variations in phytoplankton C : P: a fixed Redfield model, a model with C : P given as a function of surface phosphorus concentration ([P]), a model with C : P given as a function of temperature, and a new multi-environmental model that predicts C : P as a function of light, temperature, and [P]. These stoichiometric models were embedded into a box model of the ocean circulation, which resolves the three major ocean biomes (high-latitude, subtropical gyres, and iron-limited tropical upwelling regions). Contrary to the expectation of a monotonic relationship between surface nutrient drawdown and carbon export, we found that lateral nutrient transport from lower C : P tropical waters to high C : P subtropical waters could cause carbon-export to decrease with increased tropical nutrient utilization. Temperature is thought to be one of the primary drivers of changes in atmospheric pCO2 (pCO2,atm) across glacial/interglacial periods, and it has been hypothesized that a positive feedback between temperature and pCO2,atm will play an important role in anthropogenic climate change, with changes in the biological pump playing at most a secondary role. Here we show that environmentally driven shifts in stoichiometry make the biological pump more influential, and may reverse the expected negative relationship between temperature and pCO2,atm. In the temperature-only model changes in tropical temperature have more impact on the Δ pCO2,atm (~ 41 ppm) compared to subtropical temperature (~ 4.5 ppm). Our multi-environmental model produced a decline in pCO2,atm of ~ 46 when temperature spanned a change of 10 °C. Thus, we find that variation in marine phytoplankton stoichiometry and its environmental controlling factor can lead to counterintuitive controls on pCO2,atm, suggesting the need for further studies of ocean C : P and the impact on ocean carbon cycling.\n                        </jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to determine the increase in the leaf K concentration of tobacco (<jats:italic>Nicotiana tabaccum</jats:italic> L.) with a heterogeneous K supply. Two field experiments were conducted from 2013 to 2015 with five K rates applied in homogeneous environments and one K rate applied in varying fractions of soil volume (from 0% to 100%) in heterogeneous environments. Under ridge culture, leaf biomass was not significantly affected by homogeneous (K rate) or heterogeneous (patch size) K management. Under homogeneous conditions, increasing the K supply to three times the standard rate used by farmers (249 kg K ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) increased leaf K concentration significantly, but the effect was limited and not cost‐effective. Heterogeneous supply of K fertilizer at the standard K rate in patches of 0–40% of soil volume outperformed homogeneous K supply in terms of leaf K concentrations. Furthermore, K fertilizer mixed in intermediate soil volume fractions of 1–20% resulted in higher leaf K concentrations than the smallest (0%) and larger (30–40%) soil fractions. However, such K‐rich patch application should be managed precisely with specific placement due to the sharp reduction in available K with increasing distance from the fertilizer. To maximize the sorption of immobile K, the match between the uptake volume of the rhizosphere and the area available for K diffusion is important.</jats:p>",

The interaction of these tectonic‐scale processes with orbitally forced climate change and their influence on Asia's atmospheric moisture distribution are poorly constrained. A Miocene succession of continental mudflat deposits, exposed in the Aktau Mountains (Ili Basin, south‐east Kazakhstan), has great potential as a terrestrial palaeoclimate archive. About 90 m of the 1700 m thick succession comprise alluvial mudflat deposits and appear as cyclic alternation of coarse sheet floods, mudflat fines and semi‐arid hydromorphic soils. In this study, bulk‐sediment mineralogy and geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility, sediment colour and palynology are used to reconstruct environmental conditions by determining changes and forcing mechanisms in the intensity of sediment discharge, weathering and pedogenesis. The results presented here indicate four major periods of arid soil formation and one palustrine interval characterized by higher evaporation rates under highly alkaline/saline conditions. A positive correlation between weathering indices and the Mg/Al ratio suggest that these horizons correspond to maximum rates of evapotranspiration and aridity. The formation of mudflat fines is, instead, interpreted as representing higher detrital sediment production by more intense alluvial fan activity during times of higher precipitation. Time series analysis of weathering indices, colour and magnetic susceptibility data yields cycle‐to‐frequency ratios with the potential to represent Milankovitch cyclicity with short and long eccentricity as dominant periodicities. Periods of pronounced aridity, paced by long eccentricity forcing, reflect changes in moisture availability. On longer tectonic timescales, the persistent appearance of gypsum indicates a shift towards more arid conditions. This trend in climate is considered to result from the closure of the eastern gateway of the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean that restricted circulation and enhanced salinity within the Eastern Paratethys.</jats:p>",

Under the auspices of “The Micronutrient Powders Consultation: Lessons Learned for Operational Guidance,” 3 working groups were formed to summarize experiences and lessons across countries regarding micronutrient powders (MNP) interventions for young children. This paper focuses on programmatic experiences in the planning stages of an MNP intervention, encompassing assessment, enabling environment and adaptation, as well as considerations for supply. Methods included a review of published and grey literature, key informant interviews, and deliberations throughout the consultation process. We found that assessments helped justify adopting an MNP intervention, but these assessments were often limited by their narrow scope and inadequate data. Establishing coordinating bodies and integrating MNP into existing policies and programmes have helped foster an enabling environment and support programme stability. Formative research and pilots have been used to adapt MNP interventions to specific contexts, but they have been insufficient to inform scale‐up. In terms of supply, most countries have opted to procure MNP through international suppliers, but this still requires understanding and navigating the local regulatory environment at the earliest stages of an intervention. Overall, these findings indicate that although some key planning and supply activities are generally undertaken, improvements are needed to plan for effective scale‐up. Much still needs to be learned on MNP planning, and we propose a set of research questions that require further investigation.</jats:p>",

To gain insight into the killing process, transcriptional profiling was performed on SK-03-92 treated vs. untreated S. aureus. Fourteen genes were upregulated and 38 genes downregulated by SK-03-92 treatment. Genes involved in sortase A production, protein metabolism, and transcriptional regulation were upregulated, whereas genes encoding transporters, purine synthesis proteins, and a putative two-component system (SACOL2360 (MW2284) and SACOL2361 (MW2285)) were downregulated by SK-03-92 treatment. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses validated upregulation of srtA and tdk as well as downregulation of the MW2284/MW2285 and purine biosynthesis genes in the drug-treated population. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of MW2284 and MW2285 mutants compared to wild-type cells demonstrated that the srtA gene was upregulated by both putative two-component regulatory gene mutants compared to the wild-type strain. Using a transcription profiling technique, we have identified several cellular pathways regulated by SK-03-92 treatment, including a putative two-component system that may regulate srtA and other genes that could be tied to the SK-03-92 mechanism of action, biofilm formation, and drug persisters.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Because of environmental and economic reasons, an increasing number of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) nowadays sell both new and remanufactured products. When both products are available, customers will buy the one that gives them a higher (and non‐negative) utility. Thus, if the firm does not price the products properly, then product cannibalization may arise and its revenue may be adversely impacted. In this paper, we study the pricing problem of a firm that sells both new and remanufactured products over a finite planning horizon. Customer demand processes for both new and remanufactured products are random and price‐sensitive, and product returns (also called cores) are random and remanufactured upon receipt. We characterize the optimal pricing and manufacturing policies that maximize the expected total discounted profit. If new products are made‐to‐order (MTO), we show that when the inventory level of remanufactured product increases, the optimal price of remanufactured product decreases while the price difference between new and remanufactured products increases; however, the optimal selling price of new product may increase or decrease. If new products are made to stock (MTS), then the optimal manufacturing policy is of a base‐stock policy with the base‐stock level decreasing in the remanufactured product inventory level. To understand the potential benefit in implementing an MTO system, we study the difference between the value functions of the MTO and MTS systems, and develop lower and upper bounds for it. Finally, we study several extensions of the base model and show that most of our results extend to those more general settings. </jats:p>",
