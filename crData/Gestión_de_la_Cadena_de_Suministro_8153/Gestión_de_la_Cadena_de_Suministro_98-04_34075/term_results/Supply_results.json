It deals with the information supply‐chain as an important entity, whose performance and optimisation very significantly affect the efficiency and performance of industrial enterprises. A conceptual modelling and simulation environment is proposed for analysing information supply‐chain management strategies, policies and decisions. A decomposable, “autonomous agents” approach is adopted to specify information supply chain models. Models in turn are defined in terms of their constituent information supply chain “agents” (e.g. suppliers, buyers, distributors, etc). This includes their structural relationships, interaction “protocols” and co‐ordination policies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Our total cycle time (TCT) compression strategy encompasses the whole system in the supply chain from consumer demand to customer satisfaction. TCT has two major components that are essential to meeting customer demand: information flow and material flow. Both are necessities and together make up the total supply chain lead‐time; the information activates the material pipeline. Therefore to optimise a time compression strategy TCT must include both the information and material flows. We show in the paper that a very effective way of achieving TCT is via access to EPoS data by all “players” in the supply chain. The tremendous benefits exhibited by TCT compression within the supply chain can be described as “squaring the dynamic response circle”. Not only are the stock dynamic responses improved via time compression, but the capacity dynamics are also radically improved. Therefore TCT compression avoids the dilemma frequently faced by companies when implementing change of having to trade off customer service level against capacity utilisation. Our results are verified using a simulation model of a common real‐world supply chain. </jats:p>",

In this case report we describe an incident where a small hole in the diaphragm of the oxygen failure alarm in a Midogas nitrous oxide/oxygen blender led to retrograde flow of oxygen contaminating the nitrous oxide pipeline supply to the operating theatres and the delivery ward. This caused a reduced level of nitrous oxide to the patient in theatre, but there was no adverse outcome. However, if the oxygen pipeline pressure had been lower than the nitrous oxide pipeline pressure, the contamination would have been reversed, potentially resulting in a hypoxic mixture being delivered to many patients. Suggestions are made as to a method of prevention of this problem. </jats:p>",

Lean supply is proposed as a means of obtaining better value from suppliers and achieving the goals of better quality, more efficient services and continuous improvement. Empirical evidence is presented from a postal survey of local government purchasing officers, interviews with selected respondents and experiments based upon ‘live’ contracts. Whilst the survey identifies as obstacles a lack of understanding of lean supply and the culture of local government, the interviews and experiments give a much more positive flavour to the prospects for lean supply, and hence Best Value within local government. The paper concludes that lean supply is most applicable for major expenditure items, that the enthusiasm and drive of a ‘champion’ and recognised purchasing professional assist with introducing the concepts and that ‘marketing’ of purchasing's value added contribution assists in overcoming barriers. However, the lean supply model derived from the private sector requires adaptation both in its operational practices and philosophical underpinnings to fit with the local government context. </jats:p>",

The numbers of MIRUs were found to vary among strains, resulting in six different groups of strains on the basis of the size of the amplified PCR fragment. However, the vast majority of the strains (approximately 90%) fell within the same group, containing two 77-bp MIRUs followed by one 53-bp MIRU.\n          </jats:p>",

These problems are typically not the result of an unexpected event, but are the result of growth trends or decreasing water quality experienced over several years. This analysis uses the contingent valuation and benefit transfer methods to evaluate the willingness to pay for a rural water system in northcentral Montana. Both of the procedures resulted in similar values, ranging from about $4.05 to $7.50 per household per month for urban residents and $5.40 to $11.50 per household per month for rural residents, which is equal to 11 percent to 23 percent of current average water costs. The willingness to pay estimates do not include non‐household water users. This analysis shows that useful planning information can be obtained from relatively inexpensive contingent valuation mail survey data and the benefit transfer method as long as the limitations of the data are understood. The willingness to pay for ensuring good quality rural water supplies in the future is likely to be low compared to the costs of extensive diversion and treatment systems. Willingness to pay estimates provide decision makers with information that can be used to avoid building a large water supply system that water users do not want to connect to because of high costs.</jats:p>",

The stochastic nature of streamflow is incorporated explicitly by considering it in the form of a multivariate probability distribution. The computationally efficient Gaussian Legendre quadrature method is employed to compute the conditional probabilities of streamflow, which accounts for the serial correlation of streamflow into each storage and the cross correlation between the streamflow into various storages. A realistic assumption of cross correlation of streamflow is introduced to eliminate the need to consider the streamflow combinations which are unlikely to occur in the SDP formulation. A “corridor” approach is devised to eliminate the need to consider the infeasible and/or inferior storage volume combinations in the preceding stage in computing the objective function in the recursive relation. These methods are verified in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy by using a hypothetical example of three interconnected urban water supply reservoirs. Therefore, it can be concluded that these methods allow SDP to be more attractive for deriving optimal operating rules for multiple urban water supply reservoir systems.</jats:p>",

The distribution of particles on the surface of sprayed leaves, in particular crystals around and in stomata, indicated the possible entry of nutrients via thin water films through the stomatal pores in addition to diffusion through the cuticle. Ammonium was taken up more readily than nitrate by the foliage, but both at relatively low rates which caused N limitation. Interestingly, the inorganic N, both in the form of nitrate and even ammonium, was entirely assimilated in the shoots; phloem transport of inorganic N to the root was negligible. The flows of malate, and the acidification of the apoplastic washing solution of leaves in ammonium‐sprayed plants pointed to the role of metabolism of malate and excretion of protons in maintaining pH during ammonium assimilation in the shoot. Ammonium‐sprayed plants incorporated the N in the same amounts in shoots and roots, only 38% of the shoot‐borne N being recycled in the xylem. In nitrate‐sprayed plants the root was not only favoured in N partitioning, but even a net export of previously incorporated N from the shoots occurred which reflected the N limitation. The N limitation also affected carbon metabolism, in particular the flows of C, incorporation in the shoot and photosynthesis, which were decreased when compared with data from recent experiments with pedospheric well fed <jats:italic>Ricinus</jats:italic>. However, there was little difference in C flows between nitrate and ammonium‐sprayed plants with respect to respiration, C partitioning and, most interestingly, in relative stimulation of root growth. The loss of C from dark respiration of the shoots was high on a f. wt basis as well as in relative terms, owing to exclusive N assimilation in the shoot. In general the plants invested untargeted increases in root growth as a result of N limitation irrespective of the imposed artificial treatment which made the shoot the site of mineral N uptake.</jats:p>",

The question arises whether abscisic acid occurs in these plants and whether it plays a role in their adaptation to limited water supply. Thus, after identification by GC/MS, the content of free ABA and its alkaline hydrolysable conjugates was determined by capillary GLC in sugar‐beet plants of pot and field experiments with differentiated water supply. It was shown that leaves had a higher content of free ABA than tap roots. Within the leaf apparatus the young organs contained more ABA than the fully developed leaves. Moderate drought stress increased both free and alkaline hydrolysable ABA contents in leaves of intact plants, whereas the ABA content of tap roots was not demonstrably influenced. In contrast, severe and rapid osmotic stress treatment of detached leaves by dipping the petioles in mannitol solutions increased the free ABA content at the expense of the hydrolysable conjugates. This suggests an ABA release by the latter. Therefore, sugar‐beet plants seem to have two mechanisms for increasing the free ABA content under drought stress conditions: the gradual synthesis of ABA including its conjugates and the release of free ABA from ABA conjugates.</jats:p>",
