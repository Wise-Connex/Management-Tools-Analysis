      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1998, a government‐sponsored review of the UK construction sector called for the adoption of initiatives from manufacturing industry in order to increase productivity and reduce costs. Subsequent research has focused on how supply chain management practices could be implemented effectively by clients, consultants and large contracting organisations. However, little attention has been paid to the integration of small and medium‐size enterprises (SMEs) in the subcontractor and material supply sectors. This paper presents the findings of research that focused on the role of these SMEs in re‐engineered construction supply chains. It was found that significant barriers exist to supplier integration within the construction sector, which stem from SME scepticism over the motives behind supply chain management practices. It is suggested that the industry must make greater efforts to extol the mutual benefits of supplier integration to SMEs if significant performance improvement is to be achieved.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Preventing tobacco use by young people emerged as a major, if not the major, theme of tobacco control public policy in the 1990s for several reasons. From the public health perspective, prevention is more appealing than treatment as a remedy for harmful exposure. Conceptually, the simplest way to stop the harm of tobacco use is to prevent it from starting in the first place. This inevitably leads to a focus on youths because nearly 90% of smokers in the United States smoke their first cigarette before the age of 18 (USDHHS 1994). A youth-focused approach also has great political appeal. Protecting children from harm is a popular theme in American culture and electoral politics (Cismoski 1994). Because minors are supposedly too young to make rational decisions for themselves, American political tradition opens up additional policy options for tobacco control and permits government to regulate minors’ behavior in ways that would not be acceptable if applied to adults. A youth-focused approach is also difficult for the tobacco industry to oppose because it is politically unacceptable for tobacco manufacturers to admit that they market to youths or that they want youths to use their products, even though previously secret tobacco industry documents provide ample evidence that they have done so.</jats:p>",

This development is based on what is at times rather rapid advances generated or supported by the external environment with factors like institutions and electronic infrastructures. E‐commerce is rapidly spreading internationally, but by no means uniformly, across boundaries, or for that matter within countries. The great relevance of examining the international spread of  e‐commerce is that most corporations actually source globally.

These projects are also alike in that they are governed by the same rules of management, which can be applied regardless of project objective, technology used, local conditions, type of financing, and even the personalities of the project participants. Almost every project progresses through the same sequence of stages: appraisal, preliminary study, feasibility study, decision to finance and realize the project, detailed engineering design, tendering, final engineering design, construction, startup, commissioning, and maintenance. Through these stages, the project is defined, studied, assessed, financed, designed, contracted, specified, constructed, tested, commissioned, and operated. Each stage is critical to the project's ultimate success or failure; many projects founder when their objective is not properly defined, that objective is lost sight of, or approval procedures are inadequate. Total quality management (TQM) offers the guidelines and controls to help ensure that each phase of the project is successfully completed. To create a high‐quality facility or infrastructure, the project owner, financing institution, management office, and other components of the project team must work together while carrying out their individual responsibilities at the highest level.</jats:p>",

In our first model, called local forecasting, each member updates the forecasts of future demands periodically, and is able to integrate the adjusted forecasts into his replenishment process. Forecast adjustments made at both levels of the supply chain can be correlated. The supply chain has a decentralized information structure, so that day-to-day inventory and forecast information are known locally only. In our second model, named collaborative forecasting, the supply chain members jointly maintain and update a single forecasting process in the system. Hence, forecasting information becomes centralized. Finally, we consider as a benchmark the special case in which forecasts are not integrated into the replenishment processes at all. We propose a unified framework that allows us to study and compare the three types of settings. This study comes at a time when various types of collaborative forecasting partnerships are being experimented within industry, and when the drivers for success or failure of such initiatives are not yet fully understood. In addition to providing some managerial insights into questions that arise in this context, our set of models is tailored to serve as building blocks for future work in this emerging area of research. </jats:p>",

However, at Kharagpur it was not possible to substitute N without any significant reduction in productivity. Continuous rice-rice cropping led to increase in organic carbon status, whereas it had variable impact on available P and K status at different locations. Integrated nutrient supply had favourable effect on organic carbon status only at Bhubaneshwar, but had no effect on available P and K status. There was positive N and P balance and negative K balance with the recommended levels of nutrient application.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The relationships between buyers and suppliers have received considerable attention in recent years. Traditionally, buyer‐supplier relationships were considered as adversarial, arm’s‐length transactions. However, this relationship is moving towards a more collaborative approach. This change is subjected to the belief that suppliers are essential sources to gain competitive advantage in world markets in terms of their expertise, knowledge and their ability to share risks. The paper presents the initial findings from the responses of large companies in Hong Kong about their supplier criteria requirement. The results are also compared with a similar study conducted in the United Kingdom to obtain a clearer picture concerning Eastern and Western approaches to strategic purchasing. Some of the key reasons for the differences between purchasing practices in European and Asian companies are outlined. Such information is potentially useful since it can be used as a reference guideline for suppliers when initiating collaborative relationships with customers, who may come from different cultural backgrounds.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies the competitive and cooperative selection of inventory policies in a two-echelon supply chain with one supplier and N retailers. Stochastic demand is monitored continuously. Retailers incur inventory holding and backorder penalty costs. The supplier incurs holding costs for its inventory and backorder penalty costs for backorders at the retailers. The latter cost reflects the supplier's desire to maintain adequate availability of its product to consumers. Previous research finds the supply chain cost minimizing reorder point policies, the cooperative solution. The competitive solution is a Nash equilibrium, a set of reorder points such that no firm can deviate from the equilibrium and lower its cost. It is shown that Nash equilibria exist and a method is presented to find all of them. In some settings the cooperative solution is a Nash equilibrium; competition does not necessarily lead to supply chain inefficiency. In other settings, competition leads to costs that are substantially higher than optimal. Usually (but not always), the competitive supply chain carries too little inventory. Three cooperation strategies are discussed: change incentives, change equilibrium, and change control. A set of contracts is provided that changes the firms' incentives so that the optimal policy is a Nash equilibrium. An equilibrium change can improve performance but does not guarantee optimal performance. To change control, the firms let the supplier choose all reorder points, a key component in vendor managed inventory. That change leads to optimal supply chain performance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Global and electronic markets are increasingly forcing manufacturing enterprises to become more competitive. As a result, many manufacturing enterprises are seeking to manage their supply chains more effectively. Product differentiation timing is one important factor in supply chain management. Under an early product differentiation process, finished products are manufactured and stored in a distribution center until delivery. Under a delayed product differentiation process, partially completed product components are manufactured and stored in a distribution center; later, based on demand information, finished products are completed from the product components. The difference in value between early product differentiation and delayed product differentiation is the value of postponement. Prior research has analytically shown that the value of postponement is affected by information precision in demand forecasts. In this article, we investigate whether adding a market-making electronic broker to a supply chain increases the value of postponement. We hypothesize that it may do so by providing greater accuracy in demand forecasting. We test this relationship by comparing the results of agent-based simulations that vary between early and late differentiation strategies and the use of an electronic broker. In each simulation, the effects of demand correlation, demand variability, and demand pooling are considered. The simulations show that an electronic broker increases inventory cost savings (compared to a non-broker) and increases the value of postponement in the face of increasing demand variability, increasing demand pooling, and decreasing demand correlation. Moreover, an electronic broker may, through its own actions, increase demand variability and demand pooling, while decreasing demand correlation, thereby creating the environment in which is best operates.</p>",

Similarly, the best re turns (Rs 126,564) were obtained with integration of goat fish cropping applied with recycled fish pond s lt fed with goat droppings and the same combination resulted in the highest return of Rs 493/ha/rupee invested. Crop fish pigeon stood next, fetching Rs 443/ha/rupee invested.

The highest level of employment (575 man days/ha/year) was achieved in crop fish goat integration. Additional nutrients gained by recycling were the highest with poultry manure (65.7, 28.4 and 25.0 kg N, P,O, and K,O respectively) than with goat or pigeon manure. To enhance the productivity, economic returns and employment generation for family labour, integration of crop with fish goat or pigeon or poultry could be adopted than cultivating the crop alone under lowland situation.

The circumstances  raised a number of very serious issues to the medical research community  and have led to a consideration of the legal and ethical framework in  which human tissue is used for medical research. The use of human tissue has become an increasingly common feature of  the drug discovery and preclinical research process in the last decade. This is because, as the understanding of human biochemistry increases,  it is important to study the biochemistry of drugs in the tissue in  which they are intended to act. The use of  animals is currently the subject of much debate, but if the need for  animal experiments is to be reduced more reliance will have to be placed  on experiments based on the use of human tissue. Several problems have been encountered in this area over the last few years. These include the retention of organs by Bristol Royal Infirmary and  the Alder Hey Hospital but also the more bizarre case of Anthony-Noel  Kelly, an artist who had acquired body parts for use in his sculptures. This has been an area of some debate for several years and the  historical precept that the body of a deceased person could not be owned  has been considered in relation to the use of the human tissue in  research. The debate about the ownership of  human remains as such is not reviewed, but the current case law is  applied to the use of human tissue both in the context of treatment and  in research.</jats:p>"

Application of farmyard manure and cut rice straw as well as green-manuring in rice and wheat significantly improved the available N, P, K and Zn status of the soil.</jats:p>"

Experiment was laid out in factorial RCBD design in which fifteen NPK combinations along with or without zinc and sulphur were tested on TTB 7 and BRG 2 pigeonpea genotypes. Significant increase in grain (1.76t/ha) and stalk yields (5.86 t/ha) of pigeonpea was recorded after application of 50, 75 and 100 kg NPK/ha along with common dose of Zn (12.5 kg/ha) and S (10 kg/ha). The increase in grain yield was attributed to im- provement in number of pods/plant, test weight and grain yield/plant. Combined nutrient uptake by grain and stalk was significantly higher in 50, 100 and 75 kg NPK along with Zn and S as compared to individual application. In- teraction effect of pigeonpea genotypes and fertilizer levels was significant on seed yield and nutrient uptake. Higher yield has resulted in higher net income (25.52  103 /ha) and B: C ratio (3.21) over other treatment combi- nations. The results showed that application of 50:100:75:10:12.5 kg N:P:K:S:Zn /ha is essential for obtaining high grain yield as well as net returns of pigeonpea variety BRG 2.</jats:p>"

This paper identifies which strategic approach is followed by domestic and multinational firms that operate in the Greek food multiple retail sector. The findings point out the major importance of warehousing in multinational firms’ logistics operations and the vital role of logistics in multinational retailers’ strategy.

With this aim, five (three male and two female) adult porcupines were used. The vascular tree of the thoracic limb was injected through the common carotid arteries with coloured latex. The a. thoracica externa arose from the a. axillaris at the level of the fourth rib. It divided into two branches and went to the m. cutaneus trunci and the m. pectoralis ascendens. The a. subscapularis came off the a. thoracodorsalis. Later, the a. circumflexa humeri caudalis et cranialis, the three muscular branches and the a. circumflexa scapulae arose from the a. subscapularis. The a. profunda brachii arose together with the a. bicipitalis from the same truncus. The a. collateralis ulnaris left from the a. brachialis independently. Rete carpi dorsale was formed by the a. radialis, the r. carpeus dorsalis of the a. collateralis ulnaris and the a. interossea caudalis. Arcus palmaris profundus was formed by the r. profundus of the a. interossea caudalis and the r. palmaris profundus of the a. radialis. In conclusion, despite a partial resemblance to that in the rat, the distribution of the thoracic limb arteries in the porcupine was found to be completely different from that of other mammals. These findings represent, to our knowledge, the first study on the distribution of thoracic limb arteries in the porcupine.</jats:p>",

The highest N level in the medium (252 mg N/kg) had a negative effect on % NdfF and % labeled fertilizer utilization for all mycorrhizal plants. Regarding the time of<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N fertilizer application, G. fasciculatum-colonized plants had a minimum change in % NdfF and % labeled fertilizer utilization during the growth period (60 days application vs. 30 days application). In contrast, G. mosseae-colonized plants growing at 168 mg N/kg in the medium, decreased these two values in the latest application.

The Laab basin received sediments of stable European provenance, indicated by pre‐Variscan, Variscan, and Permian–Triassic zircon FT ages, and was thus located in the immediate south of the European margin. The Main flysch basin was supplied mainly from the evolving Eastern Alps and was therefore situated south of the Laab basin. Zircon populations with Permian to Jurassic cooling ages in the Main flysch basin are related to increased heat fluxes during the break‐up of Pangaea and are probably derived from the northwestern part of the Eastern Alps.

Production in all the four cropping systems with organic manuring alone (ONS) was significantly lower than with INS, although the differ- ences decreased as the cropping systems progressed over years. Organic farming system can be profitable only if a price premium of 20% or above is provided. From the view point of soil fertility, IPNS was the best followed by organic nutrient supply system (ONS), while the application of chemical fertilizer alone (INS) recorded the lowest values of available N, P and K and bacterial count.</jats:p>"

The results show that Hsinchu is in an area without sufficient water to meet demand for domestic and industrial uses. Until the completion of the Baoshan II Reservoir in 2006, the most feasible options for the Taiwan Water Supply Corporation to offset the water deficiency in Hsinchu City over the next five years are: (a) to obtain water gratuitously from the southern Yungheshan Reservoir; (b) to import additional water at an extra charge from other sources such as the northern Shihmen Reservoir and the agricultural sector; and (c) to conduct a comprehensive water conservation program at the Hsinchu Science‐based Industrial Park.</jats:p>",

Rice, as a base crop, was sequenced with other feasible winter crops, viz. wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend.

Green pods of pea taken after rice with 4 irrigations gave the highest rice equivalent yield (84.99 qlha) and net return (Rs 42,900lha). The second best sequence was tomato after rice (89.63 q/ ha and Rs 38,200lha) followed by potato after rice (67.52 qlha and Rs 28,4701 ha). Wheat after rice gave the lowest rice equivalent yield (46.92 qlha) and net return (Rs 18,9401ha) with 4 irrigations. Irrigation efficiency and water use efficiency were higher in potato and tomato grown after rice. Rice yield up to 28 qlha and net return up to RS 9,OOOlha were common in all the sequences. Rice pea sequence recorded lower land use efficiency and higher production efficiency, while the reverse was true in case of rice wheat sequence.</jats:p>"

Water samples from 15 pairs of wells with similar screened intervals completed in the central High Plains regional aquifer in parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas were analyzed for more than 200 water quality constituents. No statistically significant differences were observed between the concentrations of naturally‐derived constituents (major ions, trace elements, and radon) in paired wells. However, differences in water quality between paired wells were observed for selected anthropogenic compounds (pesticides and tritium), in that some public supply wells produced water that was more recently recharged and contained constituents derived from surface activities. The presence of recently recharged water and compounds indicative of anthropogenic activities in some public supply wells was likely due to operational variations (pumping rate and pumping cycles), as demonstrated in a particle tracking simulation. Water containing surface‐derived anthropogenic compounds from near the water table was more quickly drawn to high volume public supply wells (less than five years) than domestic wells (greater than 120 years) with small pumping rates. These findings indicate that water quality samples collected from different well types in the same area are not necessarily directly comparable. Sampling domestic wells provides the best broad‐scale assessment of water quality in this aquifer setting because they are less susceptible to localized contamination from near the water table. However, sampling public supply wells better represents the quality of the used resource because of the population served.</jats:p>",

Fatty acid oxidation was measured in isolated working rat hearts exposed to different concentrations of exogenous long-chain (0.4 or 1.2 mM palmitate) or medium-chain (0.6 or 2.4 mM octanoate) fatty acids. Fatty acid oxidation was increased with increasing exogenous substrate concentration in both palmitate and octanoate groups. Malonyl-CoA content only rose as acetyl-CoA supply from octanoate oxidation increased. The increases in octanoate oxidation and malonyl-CoA content were independent of changes in ACC and AMPK activity, except that ACC activity increased with very high acetyl-CoA supply levels. Our data suggest that myocardial substrate supply is the primary mechanism responsible for alterations in fatty acid oxidation rates under nonstressful conditions and when substrates are present at physiological concentrations. More extreme variations in substrate supply lead to changes in fatty acid oxidation by the additional involvement of intracellular regulatory pathways.</jats:p>",

Analysis of a blinded reference set of 90 strains from 38 countries (K. Kremer et al., J. Clin.

Interestingly, the proportion and number of CD4<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> NKT cells increased or remained unchanged in the liver after adult thymectomy and this phenomenon continued for up to 6 months after thymectomy.

It allows the user to quantify the volume benefit of protecting alternative areas and determine effects on forest development and annual allowable cut. Implementing the SBW DSS on a land base involves seven steps: (i) defining the base defoliation, or an explicit forecast of the defoliation level included in yield forecasts; (ii) compiling historical defoliation; (iii) defining base volume yields; (iv) obtaining the harvest schedule from the land base management plan; (v) building the stand impact matrix, which quantifies direct impacts of defoliation; (vi) building the forest impact matrix, which quantifies indirect impacts of defoliation on harvest schedules; and (vii) building the stand-history file, which contains all stand-level and defoliation data. These tasks are usually completed every 5 years. The remaining aspects of the planning methodology are implemented annually, including (i) recording the previous year's defoliation, (ii) estimating potential defoliation in the current year from budworm survey data, (iii) calculating volume loss or protection priority, (iv) generating budworm-caused volume loss maps, (v) digitizing potential spray blocks, and (vi) evaluating the protection program. Using ARC/INFO<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> and ArcView<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> geographic information system programs, the Protection Planning System component (PROPS) generates volume loss maps that can be used to help design and analyze costs and benefits of insecticide spray programs.
