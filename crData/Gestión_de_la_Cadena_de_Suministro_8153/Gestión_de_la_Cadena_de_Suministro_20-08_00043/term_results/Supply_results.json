It aims to get the products to the right place at the right time, in the right quantity, and at the right price. An effective distribution strategy requires a distribution network that balances the distribution cost with service level. The connectivity empowered by the Internet and particularly mobile broadband accelerates the information exchange in the supply chain, enables new business models, and demands a more connected, customer-driven, and responsive distribution network. Empowered by data technologies, the distribution network is becoming increasingly proactive and integrated. More research is called on to study the new challenges and research issues resulting from technological advancements and new business models.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The scourge of modern slavery has led to legislation in various countries requiring firms to engage in a particular form of supply chain transparency. However, these regulatory initiatives have been widely perceived to be, by themselves, a weak response to such a serious challenge. This chapter argues that assessment of these initiatives hinges on the interpretation of modern slavery itself: Are extreme forms of labor exploitation aberrations of an otherwise blameless system, or are they intrinsic to the functioning of contemporary global capitalism? If the latter, then new types of transparency might be needed that go beyond firms reporting on their policies and efforts. The chapter introduces the idea of interrogational transparency as a mechanism by which civil society actors (including consumers, activists, and researchers) can develop accountability dialogues with powerful corporations. To illustrate these points, the chapter examines emergent patterns of transparency within the food giant Nestlé.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The cannabis industry is a new quasi‐legal industry. Growing, selling, and using cannabis are still illegal in most countries. However, 24 countries and 33 U.S. states have approved cannabis for medical use, and five countries and 11 U.S. states allow recreational use. This research focuses on value‐added producers (VAPs), companies that process cannabis to manufacture ingestible, inhalable, or topical products. Due to public health concerns, the VAP tier of the cannabis supply chain faces stringent regulatory focus and turbulence. Using multiple case studies of VAPs in an emerging cannabis industry, this research investigates how these companies' primary supply chain decision‐makers make and implement strategic decisions in an environment characterized by fast‐changing regulations. While the public often perceives this new market as a way for new business owners to get rich quick, the results of this research paint a different picture. Neither significant corporate expertise and funding nor black‐market cannabis experience are necessarily predictors of success. Incorporating the underpinnings of dynamic managerial capabilities, namely managerial cognitive capital, human capital, and social capital, this research investigates how VAP companies have managed their production and supply chains to ultimately thrive, survive, or fail. Human and cognitive capital is important, but social capital that reaches beyond the supply chain is a distinguishing feature of firms that thrive in this nonpredictive environment.</jats:p>",

An extensive research related the role of energy in economic life and people’s business activity, as well as, its modern market system being formed as a global commodity was carried out. After analytic generalization, new interpretation of “Energy security” concept was presented. It was clarified once more that, in contemporary world, energy security is measured not only by the quantity of energy consumption supply, but also by its quality values and standards. Given the fact that in the Azerbaijan Republic, as in a sustainable social country, energy security is not separated from energy efficiency and is considered as an important indicator in the supply of fuel-energy resources for increasing the national development level of the economy, the paper intends to investigate these features. It also studies preparation of national energy security strategy and criteria, activities, and objectives that define its conditions being justified by analysis for providing sustainability of these activities.

This can strain business viability and reduce the return on investment for shareholders. To increase the return on investment and favorably impact profitability, organizations focus on cost reduction efforts. Cost management should be both holistic and purposeful, while taking a supply chain perspective. This is often not the case because the cost reduction efforts tend to be internal and short-term focused and do not consider the supply chain implications of decisions. Strategic cost management takes a supply chain perspective and includes several tools that can help facilitate cost management. This chapter provides a definition of strategic cost management with supporting examples. It also discusses some tools, including total cost of ownership, target costing, and supply chain finance, that can be used to holistically and strategically manage supply chain costs. The chapter closes with a discussion around the growing role of supply chain finance in cost management.</jats:p>"

Many technologies are finding their way into supply management, with differing levels of penetration and application and with mixed results. It may be challenging for supply management professionals to understand how, when, and where these technologies are likely to yield positive results. This chapter reviews several technologies, including artificial intelligence/machine learning, big data/advanced analytics, blockchain, cloud computing, conversational things (e.g., chatbots), immersive technologies (e.g., virtual and augmented reality), and robotic process automation. Findings indicate that the primary advantages are achieved by improving current processes and workflows, rather than that these technologies are currently disrupting or will fundamentally change supply management. Another important finding is the importance of “clean data” inputs, something that artificial intelligence can help with and that is foundational for successful robotic process automation.</jats:p>"

They specify the terms and conditions of the agreement between two parties, interpret and adapt the relevant legal and industrial norms, serve as framing devices, and establish the rules and norms underpinning the relationship. The objective of this chapter is to synthesize the extant literature on interorganizational contracting to guide future research and practice. This chapter focuses on the three phases of contracting: (1) designing the contracting portfolio; (2) negotiating initial contracts; and (3) managing the relationship using contracts. The chapter explores the key decisions in each phase and the criteria involved in making these decisions. In doing so, it draws on existing research and theoretical frameworks that have contributed to the development of the contracting literature. The chapter also identifies some important and interesting directions for future contracting research and offers suggestions regarding how selected theoretical lenses might guide these endeavors. The principal conclusion is that while the existing research has primarily focused on the structural issues guiding contracting design, a more processual, social, and behavioral focus is required in future developments of the contracting literature.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A water supply canal having a length of 8.9 km, originating from Durgapur Barrage at Durgapur, West Bengal, India and terminating in a pool at a downstream distance of 8.9 km was constructed by Damodar Valley Corporation during 1957-60 to supply drinking water to the city of Durgapur, West Bengal, India and water to several industries situated at Durgapur. Durgapur Municipal Corporation withdraws its complete demand from this canal of DVC.  The major industries withdrawing water from the canal is M/S Durgapur Chemical Limited, M/S Durgapur Steel Plant, M/S Phillips Carbon, M/S Durgapur Thermal Power Station. Though the canal was designed for original capacity of 900 cusecs, but now there is withdrawal of about 400 cusecs only from the canal due collapse of the cross section of the earthen canal at different chainage, silting of the canal throughout its reach resulting in failure of the function of the canal to supply water to major customers. A study was undertaken to assess the present hydraulic and environmental conditions of the existing canal and propose procedure for revival of the canal in the most economic way without disrupting the present withdrawal from the canal and also suggest measures to be undertaken for maintenance of environment along the canal to prevent canal cross section from unlawful ingress of water into the canal. In this study, present hydraulic conditions of the canal have been analyzed.  Different alternatives of reviving the canal to carry a discharge of 500 cusecs were attempted    by (i) designing pre-cast section of the canal capable of carrying a discharge more than 500 cusec, (ii) simply using the existing cross section with side protection with steel sheet piling and bottom protection with concrete blocks, and (iii) providing diaphragm wall on each side of the section and bottom protection with concrete blocks. Feasibility of construction under conditions of continued supply to the existing stake holders was considered while analyzing the economics of  revival for all the three alternatives. Revival of the canal by option (ii) has been recommended on the basis of economics of revival amid running condition of the canal. Though the working life of the canal with sheet pile protected side wall is less than that of the canal with diaphragm wall as the side wall of the cross section but workability under running condition of the canal is much higher for the case of side protection with steel sheet piles. Measures such as diverting the unlawful ingress away from the canal, protecting the side berms with green cover has been recommended to improve the environment around the canal.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>What is the optimal rate of new housing supply? We answer this question with a simple model of new housing supply where the choice variable is the rate of new housing lot sales. This model is informed by the cost-side assumptions of the static equilibrium model but allows for demand for home-buying to vary over time. It differs from static models of housing production equilibrium by assuming that landowners hold land assets that are sold in asset markets to create new supply. Landowners maximise the present value of their balance sheet by choosing a rate of new housing lot sales, accounting for the effect on asset price growth from their sales in a housing market of finite depth. The resulting absorption rate equation has radically different parameter effects compared to the popular static housing density model. Constraints on density, for example, increase the optimal rate of supply by reducing the return to delaying development. Interest rates, land value tax rates, and demand growth, positively relate to the optimal rate of supply. The policy lessons are (1) the relationship between demand growth and the optimal supply rate limits the ability for market supply to reduce prices, and (2) increasing the cost to delaying housing development is the primary way to increase the market rate of housing supply.</p>"

This paper studies a supply chain comprised of a buyer and two types of suppliers: one is cheap but unreliable and the other is reliable but expensive. If there is a major disruption, the unreliable supplier may not be able to fully satisfy the buyer’s order, despite the fact that it exerts additional effort to rebuild capacity; at the same time, the reliable supplier cannot fulfill extra orders from the buyer due to capacity constraints. In this way, the buyer should strategically allocate its order between the two types of suppliers by offering different contracts at the very beginning, and then the unreliable supplier chooses its optimal restoration effort according to the contract if a disruption occurs. The model is built based on the real-life cases such as Walmart and Apple such that it is the buyer who determines the wholesale price of the unreliable supplier’s products. The results show the optimal contracts provided by the buyer under different circumstances, which aims to help managers design their contracts under disruption risks to maximize the company’s profit.</jats:p>",

The social capital literature is used to develop hypotheses concerning the cognitive, structural, and relational dimensions that may play roles in decisions to buy from minority firms. Subsequently, modern discrimination theory is employed to provide inductive insights into how buyers' attitudes toward supplier diversity mediate the effects of social capital on their procurement activities with EMBs. The results of multiple regression analysis suggest that in both the U.S. and U.K., positive social capital as perceived by the buyers has a direct, significant relationship with their expenditures with EMBs. The results also reveal that in both countries, buyers' attitudes toward supplier diversity mediate the relationship. Interestingly, although the U.S. originated the concept of supplier diversity, our research uncovers that U.K. LPO buyers have greater expenditures with their EMBs. Based on these findings, this research illustrates how strategic corporate social responsibility initiatives set forth by LPOs may be impacted by their buyers' social relationships with EMBs and their attitudes toward supplier diversity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Platform operations are very common in the sharing economy. Nowadays, retailers can sell the end‐of‐season product leftovers to platforms which offer product rental services to the market. Motivated by this observed industrial practice, we build stylized supply chain models to explore the platform supported supply chain operations. We uncover that the presence of the platform creates the “triple marginalization” problem in which supply chain coordination cannot be achieved even if the manufacturer is willing to supply at cost using the wholesale pricing contract. We show how the markdown sponsor (MS) contract can deal with the triple marginalization problem and achieve supply chain coordination. However, we illustrate that a moral hazard problem, in which the retailer has incentive to overclaim the amount of markdown sponsor, arises. We reveal that the moral hazard problem brings a loss to the manufacturer, an immoral gain for the retailer, and there is no impact on the platform and consumers. We analytically derive the impact of moral hazard (which means the loss to the manufacturer, and the gain for the retailer) and find that it relates to the markdown sponsor rate, as well as the degree of overclaiming. To overcome the moral hazard problem under MS contract, we propose measures such as the adoption of blockchain technology, and “discounted” markdown sponsor contract, to help. We also explore the implementations of other contracts to overcome the moral hazard, like virtual buyback with inventory reallocation contract, and wholesale pricing contract with side payments.</jats:p>",

As of June 2020, about 180 food businesses have agreed to this commitment as a result of efforts by animal advocates. While these commitments are a valuable step toward improved animal welfare, it is important to also measure their actual implementation and the resulting supply of chicken products meeting these higher welfare standards. We review potential approaches for measuring the supply of BCC-compliant chickens and available data for making such measurements. We find that relatively little data is currently available in the US and that efforts by industry and government agencies may be necessary to collect such data.</p>"

The yield of triazine was doubled from 31% to 59%, and the synthetic step count was reduced from 4 to 2. A one-pot cascade sequence was developed for direct cyanation of pyrrole. Amination and cyclization with formamidine acetate complete the synthesis. The problematic nature of typically dilute electrophilic aminations was solved with semi-continuous processing. Moreover, development of a continuous platform afforded access to the ideal yet non-commercial aminating reagent, monochloramine. These efforts help to secure the Remdesivir supply chain.</jats:p>"

They have the off-season demand, predictable and well-known needs, their satisfaction is easily accessible. The research is looking for the answer to the question of whether the hotels have the opportunity of acquire the senior segment and what are the special features of the products recommended for them. Parts related to the topic of tourism marketing literature have been reduced to the accommodation services in the secondary information processing section of this paper.

This may bring psychological stress to the CSSD staff. However, the mental state of the CSSD staff during COVID-19 epidemic has been rarely studied. We aim to investigate the mental state of the CSSD staff and the relevant influencing factors during COVID-19 epidemic.<jats:bold>Methods: </jats:bold>Conduct the questionnaire survey with the general information questionnaire, Chinese perceived stress scale (CPSS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) among 423 CSSD staff from 35 hospitals in Sichuan Province, China. Analyse the data in SPSS 24.0, use classification and regression tree (CART) to analyse variables, and find variation between groups. Perform chi-square test on enumeration data, and perform t-test and analysis of variance on measurement data.<jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>The CSSD staff’s SAS score was 37.39 ± 8.458, their CPSS score was 19.21 ± 7.265, and their CD-RISC score was 64.26 ± 15.129 (Tenacity factor score: 31.70 ± 8.066, Strength factor score: 21.60 ± 5.066, Optimism factor scores: 10.96 ± 3.189). The CPSS score was positively correlated with the SAS score (r = 0.66; P &lt; 0.01), the CPSS score was negatively correlated with the CD-RISC score (r = -0.617, P &lt; 0.01), and the SAS score was negatively correlated with the CD-RISC score (r = -0.477, P &lt; 0.01). The job, age and political status of the CSSD staff were the main factors affecting their mental state. The CPSS score and SAS score of the CSSD nurses were significantly different from those of the CSSD logistic staff (P &lt; 0.01). <jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold>During the epidemic, the CSSD staff’s psychological resilience was at a low level, and the anxiety level of the CSSD nurses was higher than that of the CSSD logistic staff. Therefore, more attention shall be paid to the mental health of the CSSD staff, and it is necessary to take the protective measures regarding the risk factors at work to ensure they can maintain a good mental state during the epidemic.</jats:p>"

Penelitian dilakukan dengan pendekatan kualitatif menggunakan  metode deskriptif studi kasus.  Pengumpulan data dilakukan dengan teknik observasi, wawancara dan studi dokumentasi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan kondisi tenaga pendidik di SDN 1 Nagrikidul mengalami surplus (kelebihan tenaga pendidik) atau kondisi non-equilibrium (ketidakseimbangan demand dengan supply). Beberapa penyebab kondisi nonequilibrium tersebut yaitu kebijakan pemerintah daerah atas sekolah negeri, kebijakan yang belum berbasis riset, kewenangan  kepala sekolah, kondisi guru dan pendekatan perencanaan tenaga  pendidik.  Kondisi surplus tenaga pendidik tersebut menimbulkan permasalahan dan menimbulkan dampak positif dan negatif bagi lembaga SDN 1 Nagrikidul Purwakarta. Namun meskipun demikian sebagai sebuah lembaga pendidikan profesional tentunya SDN 1 Nagrikidul mampu mengambil langkah strategik dalam menemukan solusi atas permasalahan yang dihadapi berkaitan dengan kondisi surplus tersebut</jats:p>"

The higher level of competition will require a good flow of information in each supply chain. Each stage in the supply chain is an important aspect, especially in terms of distribution of both goods and information. The implementation of supply chain integration will help businesses to collaborate throughout the supply chain. The greater number of distribution channels both in downstream and upstream each business will need supply chain integration. This research will be conducted with descriptive analysis and qualitative methods. Researchers will conduct interviews directly to businesses in the fashion industry, especially who made their own products. The results of this research is the supply chain integration carried out at the upstream part of the supply chain, the business actors are still very competitive with other business actors because the raw material taken is not much so they are not immediately given a specialization by the supplier. Whereas in the downstream part of the supply chain, businesses have various promotions carried out new customers.</jats:p>"

The profitability of each of these tiers is ensured if information sharing as well as an effective and seamless coordination system are realized between the tiers. This process reduces the influence of an important risk factor known as the bullwhip effect. The purpose of the current study is to determine the necessary information sharing level to optimize the supply chain that has asymmetric flows of input and output values and to examine the effects of information sharing on the order fill rate (OFR) and total inventory cost (TIC) of the supply chain through analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing. In this work, the supply chain was optimized by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, with an objective function that assumes the maximization of OFR and minimization of TIC. The proposed method showed excellent results in comparing the mean, variance, and coefficient of variation. In addition, the method used the ANOVA test with a 5% significance level to verify the impact of the information sharing level.</jats:p>"

In a broader perspective this can result in more efficient use of natural resources as well as reduced climate-impacting emissions. This study examines how decreased DH supply temperatures influence the power-to-heat ratio and thereby electricity production and fuel use in a combined heat and power plant. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eqv.) emissions and primary energy use were calculated with three different marginal electricity perspectives. A regional DH system situated in mid-Sweden was used as a case study and the energy system cost optimization modelling tool MODEST (Model for Optimization of Dynamic Energy Systems with Time-Dependent Components and Boundary Conditions) was used. The results show that decreasing the DH supply temperature results in increased electricity production as well as increased fuel use within the system. Further, there is a significant difference in CO2-eqv. emissions and primary energy use for the studied marginal electricity perspectives.</jats:p>",

The process and practice of deciding on the alternative hull &amp; structure materials are presented in the case study to verify and validate the method. The technique includes four main parts. Firstly, Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment, which was developed from Life Cycle Assessment, and which has been carried out to analyze the environmental, economic, and social impacts. Secondly, Monetary Valuation is used to convert the results of the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment. Moreover, Life Cycle Sustainability Costing is used as an accounting tool to aggregate the results from the Monetary Valuation, including environmental cost, economic cost, and social cost. Finally, the results of Life Cycle Sustainability Costing have been analyzed through Sensitivity Analysis to interpret and make sound recommendations. The novelty of this research is the combination of the different methods, as well as its application to Offshore Supply Vessels.</jats:p>",

Looking at the buyer–supplier relationships via the lens of embeddedness allows us to consider the duality of relational outcomes—the primary outcome contained in the dyad and the incidental outcome on the supplier’s part. The chapter conceptualizes dyadic embeddedness in the buyer–supplier context and demonstrates how that dyadic embeddedness is accountable for the diverse relational outcomes and helps resolve some puzzling observations that have been made in the literature. How a supplier relates to its buyer in the dyad constrains how it perceives and behaves outside the dyad, which in turn would have spillover effect on the buyer–supplier dyad. As such, taking the embeddedness view broadens our understanding of the dynamics of buyer–supplier relationships.</jats:p>"

Given the rapid shifts in technology that are under way in this field, academic research may struggle to keep up with the dynamic evolution of procurement platforms. This chapter assesses the current set of procurement analytics–based research and observes the organizational and temporal evolution of how procurement analytics is proceeding. Next, the chapter reviews a number of procurement platforms and interviews with procurement executives to suggest that academic research is at the same nascent stage as the evolution of the technology, which is often highly touted but is in the early stages of development. The analysis also highlights the importance of data integrity and quality as major roadblocks preventing the adoption of advanced procurement analytics. However, the analysis suggests that technologies will continue to propel the expansion of organizational and temporal shifts in procurement analytics, enabled by the emerging digital environment and evolving technologies such as data analytics and cognitive analytics. As a result, we will likely continue to witness massive changes in the procurement analytics environment in the next three to five years. The chapter concludes that although the current maturity of procurement analytics is low, supply management should adopt a leadership role in advancing the procurement analytics scope and scale.</jats:p>"

Pharmacists may sometimes show different unethical behaviors in their interactions, so it is essential to understand these behaviors. The present study aimed to determine the challenges of ethical behaviors based on a principles-based approach in the area of drug supply in pharmacies.<jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> This qualitative content analysis was conducted in Kerman in 2018.  Several key players in the field of medication supply were selected using snowball sampling to be interviewed. An effort was made to select samples with maximum variation. Exclusion criteria include having less than 3 years of experience in pharmacy and supervision, not willing to participate in the interview, and canceling the interview 3 times. The participants in this study consisted of pharmacy technicians (n=5), patients (n=6), pharmacists (n=8), inspectors of insurance companies (n=4), and inspectors of food and drug administration (n=3). Data were analyzed using directed content analysis by Maxqda software version 10 (VERBI Software, Berlin, Germany). The principles of the “Beauchamp and Childress Ethics” theory including autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice were selected as the main principles. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> After data analysis, 8 main categories and 26 subcategories were obtained. The main categories include patient privacy, patient independence, communication principles, patient-centered services, drug supplier, patient harm avoidance, supervision, and distributive, procedural, and interactive justice. The subcategories include increasing patient awareness, culturizing prescription, and rational drug use, confidentiality and privacy, and pharmacist-patient relationship/communication, which were the biggest ethical challenges in the area of drug supply at pharmacies. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> According to the Principles-based approach, two principles of autonomy and beneficence had the greatest challenges. The policymakers in the health care system should emphasize patient independence, patient privacy, and patient-centered services. The results of this study can be used as a tool to introduce ethical challenges to policymakers and develop educational contents, the charter of professional ethics in pharmacies, and measures of pharmacy accreditation.</jats:p>"

However, this does not include the system’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Given the existential threat posed by global warming, it is pertinent to consider how the design of the system affects its GHG emissions. We model the supply chain as a network of customers and store locations, with customers driving in cars to and from stores and the retailer resupplying the stores from a central warehouse. The number and location of stores is determined while minimizing the GHG emission. Our contributions are (1) to remove the assumption of uniform demand, and instead build a model of a GSC based on population data; (2) to model the GSC as a two-echelon k-median problem. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to study the effect of a carbon tax in encouraging a greener system considering various scenarios under which emissions might increase or decrease. Specific scenarios lead to a lower overall GHG emission. For example, doubling the fuel efficiency of cars decreases emissions by 46% compared to the baseline scenario. The proposed design approach is not limited to GSC design and can be extended to many design problems, including manufacturing, material design, and healthcare.</jats:p>",

It is a case-based study conducted in the Spanish retail sector. A representative set of mechanisms is identified, and both their theoretical background and their degree of practical adoption is established. These mechanisms are then characterized in terms of several traits regarding either the mechanisms themselves or the way they are adopted both by the focal company (internal view) and by its suppliers (external view) in each of the cases. Results suggest that mechanisms might be classified into either ‘enablers’, which increasingly constitute a prerequisite for achieving acceptable levels of sustainability, and ‘differentiators’, which can potentially confer sustainable strategic advantages. Actually, achieving these advantages, however, seems contingent on the additional attainment of a comprehensive ‘depth’ in the implementation of an integrated set of mechanisms of both types, both internally within the focal company and throughout the whole supply chain, as measured by the traits proposed in the study. Furthermore, the concept of ‘circular improvement models’ for sustainable supply chains, akin to Total Quality Management models, is proposed by the authors. The resulting model encompassing enabling and differentiating governance mechanisms could guide the self-evaluation and improvement plans of companies aiming to improve their supply chains sustainability; further guidance on ‘deep adoption’ comprehensive strategies and on the potential for self-reinforcing continuous improvement in sustainability beyond a certain threshold are provided by the study’s conclusions.</jats:p>"

Various evolutionary algorithms (EAs) proposed in the past involve the use of algorithm-specific parameters and their synchronizing to get the optimal solution and thus require more computational effort and time. To overcome this drawback, the present work introduces an optimization technique, JayaNet, which is the integration of the Jaya algorithm and hydraulic network solver EPANET 2. The best part of this technique is that no algorithm-specific parameter is to be synchronized for optimal cost but there needs to be adjustment of penalty parameter and population size based on network size. Four well-known benchmark networks with different sizes and layout have been taken and optimized using JayaNet. The results are compared with those obtained from other EAs. It is found that optimized costs obtained for four networks by JayaNet are either the same or less than the results obtained from other EAs even with a lower number of function evaluations (NFE). The NFE are found to increase with population size in all networks. The statistical parameter obtained from JayaNet is also compared for different networks.</jats:p>",

Findings revealed that bank credit and bank lending rate does not have significant impact on real sector performance in Nigeria. It was showed that there was a positive and significant relationship between agricultural credit guarantee scheme fund and agricultural production in Nigeria. The study therefore recommends that banks should be directed to channel their credits towards the real sector to facilitate overall economic growth and development in Nigeria. It was recommended that there is the need policies that will favor the revamp of the agricultural sector in Nigeria should be given pride of place.

The instantaneous overvoltages from the load side, which leads to high reverse recovery currents in high-power thyristors, can be induced by load mutations in the electromagnetic launching field. This paper establishes circuit models of PPS topologies, and investigates effects of the initial voltage of the energy-storage capacitor, the discharge time intervals, and the load resistance on the reverse recovery currents in high-power thyristors. To overcome the shortcomings of conventional PPS topologies, an improved PPS topology is developed. The improved PPS topology applies coupling inductor and resistance-capacitance snubber techniques, which can absorb the surge energy from the load side and reduce the reverse recovery currents in high-power thyristors. The simulation technique has been applied to validate theoretical analysis and the proposed model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>INTRODUCTION: Supply chains face various disruptions from human-made to natural disasters preventing proper flow of materials and products. This problem is more important in the healthcare supply chains, especially the blood supply chains, in which human lives are at risk. Making the supply chains resilient, recently addressed by managers and researchers, can be a good way to tackle them. This study aimed to identify the most important disruptions and associated resilience strategies in the blood supply chain of Tehran, Iran, and prioritize the identified strategies based on the disruptions.\nMETHODS: In the current study, important disruptions and associated appropriate resilience strategies were determined using previous studies and Delphi method. Then, the most important resilience strategies were identified and prioritized proposing the House of Quality and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) as a novel hybrid approach.\nFINDINGS: A total of 9 disruptions and 16 resilience strategies were determined by reviewing previous studies and asking for expert opinions. The suggested hybrid model also contributed to determining the importance of each strategy in addressing disruptions and prioritizing them in the blood supply chain of Tehran.\nCONCLUSION: Those strategies with high importance and low performance, such as flexibility or risk management culture, are of great importance and should be considered by managers and improved according to IPA. In addition, other strategies, such as social responsibility or redundancy, should be continued in the current way.</jats:p>",

Few works are present in the literature about this topic, thus this paper overcomes this limitation considering carbon supply chains producing different products. The objective of the numerical models is to minimize expected total costs, under the uncertainties of the production costs of carbon-dioxide-based compounds. Once carbon dioxide emissions that should be avoided are fixed, according to environmental protection requirements for each country, the optimal design of these supply chains is obtained finding the distribution of carbon dioxide captured between utilization and storage sections, the amount of different carbon-based products and the best connection between each element inside the system. The expected total costs for the CCUS supply chain of Italy, Germany and the UK are, respectively, 77.3, 98.0 and 1.05 billion€/year (1004, 613 and 164 €/ton CO2 captured). A comparison with the respective deterministic model, analyzed elsewhere, is considered through the evaluation of the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) and the Value of Stochastic Solution (VSS). The former is 1.29 billion€/year, 0.18 million€/year and 8.31 billion€/year, respectively, for the CCUS of Italy, the UK and Germany. VSS on the other hand is equal to 1.56 billion€/year, 0 €/year and 0.1 billion€/year, respectively, for the frameworks of Italy, the UK and Germany. The results show that the uncertain production cost in the stochastic model does not have a significant effect on the results; thus, in this case, there are few advantages in solving a stochastic model instead of the deterministic one.</jats:p>"

The demand for smart buildings is growing not only in the world, but also in Russia, especially in the market of construction and operation of large business centers, shopping centers and other business projects. Accurate cost estimates are important for promoting energy efficiency construction projects and demonstrating their economic attractiveness. The growing number of digital measurement infrastructure, used in commercial buildings, led to increase access to high-frequency data that can be used for anomaly detection and diagnostics of equipment, heating, ventilation, and optimization of air conditioning. This led to the use of modern and efficient machine learning methods that provide promising opportunities to obtain more accurate forecasts of energy consumption of the buildings, and thus increase energy efficiency. In this paper, based on the gradient boosting model, a method of modeling and forecasting the energy consumption of buildings is proposed and computer algorithms are developed to implement it. Energy consumption dataset of 300 commercial buildings was used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Computer simulations showed that the use of these algorithms has increased the accuracy of the prediction of energy consumptionin more than 80 percent of cases compared to other machine learning algorithms.</jats:p>",

The intent is to demonstrate the validity of applying the fail‐safe concept, not to reveal the details of the physiology involved. The model calculations are based on a single compartment of the relevant tissue in each case that is challenged with a decrease in oxygen supply. The model equation parameters were adjusted to reproduce experimental observations. The fail‐safe model of cerebral blood flow control yielded results similar in form to published experimental observations of the cerebral blood flow responses to hypoxia and anaemia. The fail‐safe model of carotid body glomus cell control of intracellular hydrogen ion concentration also yielded results similar in form to observations of carotid sinus nerve responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. The ability of these simple models to simulate experimental observations demonstrates the applicability of the fail‐safe concept to oxygen delivery.

In particular, higher combustion temperatures in the gas turbine are important, since they result in higher fuel efficiency and thus in lower CO2 emissions. In this paper, a semi-quantitative assessment scheme is used to evaluate the relative supply risks associated with elements contained in various Ni-based superalloys: aluminium, titanium, chromium, iron, cobalt, niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium, tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium. Twelve indicators on the elemental level and four aggregation methods are applied in order to obtain the supply risk at the alloy level. The supply risks for the elements rhenium, molybdenum and cobalt are found to be the highest. For three of the aggregation schemes, the spread in supply risk values for the different alloy types (as characterized by chemical composition and the endurance temperature) is generally narrow. The fourth, namely the cost-share’ aggregation scheme, gives rise to a broader distribution of supply risk values. This is mainly due to the introduction of rhenium as a component starting with second-generation single crystal alloys. The resulting higher supply risk appears, however, to be acceptable for jet engine applications due to the higher temperatures these alloys can endure.</jats:p>"

The common point of pandemics is their serious negative effects on the global economy. Considering the food supply chain, one of the most important sectors of the economy, it has been seen that COVID-19 has an impact on the whole process from the field to the consumer. In the light of recent challenges in food supply chain, there is now considerable concern about food production, processing, distribution, and demand. COVID-19 resulted in the movement restrictions of workers, changes in demand of consumers, closure of food production facilities, restricted food trade policies, and financial pressures in food supply chain. Therefore, governments should facilitate the movement of workers and agri-food products. In addition, small farmers or vulnerable people should be supported financially. Facilities should change the working conditions and maintain the health and safety of employees by altering safety measures. Food protectionist policies should be avoided to prevent an increase in food prices. In conclusion, each country must realize the severity of the situation and sometimes should tighten or loosen the measures according to the spread of the pandemic. The supply chain also should be flexible enough to respond to the challenges in the food supply chain. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the agriculture and food sector and to summarize the recommendations required to reduce and control the effect of the pandemic.</jats:p>",

The chapter points out that the relationship between individuals, education, and employment in an era of twentieth-century industrialism is no longer appropriate in an age of machine intelligence.

US law now requires stakeholders in the agri-food supply chain to support traceability by tracking food materials they acquire and sell. However, having complete and consistent information needed to quickly investigate sources and identify affected material has proven difficult. There are multiple reasons that makes food traceability a challenging task including diversity of stakeholders and their lexicons, standards, tools and methods; unwillingness to expose information of internal operations; lack of a common understanding of steps in a supply chain; and incompleteness of data. Ontologies can address the traceability challenge by creating a shared understanding of the traceability model across stakeholders in a food supply chain. They can also support semantic mediation, data integration, and data exploration. This paper reports an on ongoing effort aimed at developing a formal ontology for supply chain traceability using use cases and data from partners in the bulk grain domain. The developed ontology was validated in VocBench environment through creating RDF triples from real datasets and executing SPARQL queries corresponding to predefined competency questions.</jats:p>",

To achieve this, the grid side current phase angles are optimized while satisfying the grid code on the power factor and voltage unbalance limits. The optimized phase angles are then used to design control references under varying load conditions. The compensation control action is updated regularly based on real-time measurements of the traction load, and the required currents are controlled by a 25-level single-phase back-to-back MMC power conditioner to achieve the compensation target.

The impact of the number of polyelectrolyte bilayers (2, 4, 6) on the retention of Escherichia coli was systematically investigated. Test results showed the water permeability coefficients (Lp) were 85.3 L/m2.h.bar and 69.5, 28.3, 50.1 L/m2.h.bar for pristine (CM0) and ceramic membranes with two bilayers (CM2), four bilayers (CM4), and six bilayers (CM6), respectively. Complete retention of E. coli was achieved by the multilayer polyelectrolyte ceramic membrane with four bilayers. The surface morphology of the multilayer polyelectrolyte ceramic membrane was identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the multilayer polyelectrolyte ceramic membrane can be safely applied in providing water disinfection.</jats:p>",

To investigate seawater intrusion in this island, a modified GALDIT index is used to map the vulnerability of the whole region. Considering the vulnerability map, two critical sections which have the highest vulnerability, one in the northeast and the other in the west side of the island, are chosen for detailed investigation. To achieve this goal, two numerical models, MODFLOW and SEAWAT are applied to simulate the groundwater flow and solute transport. The results show that the aquifer is in a dangerous level of threat of vulnerability and 15 km2 of the aquifer is in danger of being salinized. A comparison is made between MT3DMS and SEAWAT results, indicating that SEAWAT simulates seawater intrusion with more accuracy. It seems because of considering salt density in SEAWAT flow equations. The numerical simulation shows that the seawater is intruding on the island at a rapid rate.</jats:p>",

Currently, this industry requires expensive vacuum systems which consume energy and time, and therefore it is very appealing to develop similar processes at atmospheric pressure. Under this condition, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is one of the best ways to obtain a cold plasma. The dielectric barriers naturally limit the current, and then the plasma temperature. Unfortunately, at atmospheric pressure the discharge ignition between the electrodes requires high voltage, which is generally obtained through a step-up transformer. The parasitic elements of this device exclude a smart control for the discharge. In order to overcome this default, we analyze the performance of a transformerless power supply developed with a recently released single-chip high-voltage semiconductor. The circuit uses only two high-voltage switches synthesized by means of the 10 kV SiC MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor). The design and implementation of the electric converter are presented and validated with experiments carried out on UV excimer DBD lamps. Then, the performances of the 10 kV SiC switches are analyzed and the relevance of this device for DBD applications is discussed.</jats:p>"

Based on NIST real gas model and state equation of modefied Bennedict-Webb-Rubin (BWR), flow field simulation model is developed. A stepwise initialization method for convergence of calculation is proposed in the paper. The numerical simulations for the flow in two-stage pressure reducing valve are carried out.

Occurrence of drought depends on physiographical, climatic factors and optimum utilization of available resources of the river basin. This study aims to evaluate the vulnerability and resilience of river basin systems for the identification of priority areas under drought susceptibility for three different river basins, namely Arpa, Kharun and Upper Seonath of Mahanadi river in central India, as a pilot area for this study. The study represents an approach to evaluate the drought susceptibility of river basins based on physiographical factors and anthropogenic activities. A model proposed for vulnerability assessment based on variables of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, and a geospatial database of basin characteristics contributing to vulnerability, was generated using remote sensing and a geographic information system. Multi-criteria decision analysis was done to evaluate the influence of river basin characteristics, population load and land-use/cover on drought susceptibility for assessing the drought vulnerability of the river basin and suggest the solution for the optimum utilization of natural resources according to the river basin characteristics. The result of this study demarcates the area in four categories of Extremely vulnerable, Moderately vulnerable, Vulnerable and Not vulnerable. On the analysis, only 3.86% of Upper Seonath is Not vulnerable, followed by Kharun basin having 15.59% as Not vulnerable area and 48.23% of the area of Arpa river basin identified as Not vulnerable. Arpa river basin is least affected by drought due to its lower population density and high coverage of forest and agriculture area.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to find out and analyze the implementation of the Public-Private Partnership implemented by PAM Jaya and private partners in the supply of clean water in DKI Jakarta. The research method used qualitative research methods.  The theory used is the utilization of the Public-Private Partnership proposed by Emanual Savas (2000) which consists of roles and functions, competition, regulation, risk, procurement, and financing. The results of this study the implementation of the Public-Private Partnership in the supply of clean water in DKI Jakarta has not been effective because of the failure to fully utilize the Public-Private Partnership. The absence of competition and procurement processes between partners, the absence of regulations referred to so that the impact on the Cooperation Agreement (PKS) did not reflect public interests. There were roles and functions of PAM Jaya and private partners that were not conducted, unclear risk-sharing and compensation to private partners were more giving loss to the PAM Jaya, resulting in a shortfall.

It is therefore imperative for procurement leaders to understand and address digitization trends in supply chains and to develop strategies to create robust data architecture and analytics strategies for the future. This chapter assesses and examines the ways companies can organize their procurement data architectures in the big data space to mitigate current limitations and to lay foundations for the discovery of new insights. It sets out to understand and define the levels of maturity in procurement organizations as they pertain to the capture, curation, exploitation, and management of procurement data. The chapter then develops a framework for articulating the value proposition of moving between maturity levels and examines what the future entails for companies with mature data architectures. In addition to surveying the practitioner and academic research literature on procurement data analytics, the chapter presents detailed and structured interviews with over fifteen procurement experts from companies around the globe. The chapter finds several important and useful strategies that have helped procurement organizations design strategic roadmaps for the development of robust data architectures. It then further identifies four archetype procurement area data architecture contexts. In addition, this chapter details exemplary high-level mature data architecture for each archetype and examines the critical assumptions underlying each one. Data architectures built for the future need a design approach that supports both descriptive and real-time, prescriptive analytics.</jats:p>"

The current focus on producing zero-carbon buildings, emphasises reducing OC and ignores the importance of reducing EC emissions. This study focuses on EC. Methods available in EC estimating currently produce estimates that often do not complement each other. This makes it important to develop a robust and accurate methodology for estimating EC. Blockchain is an emerging technology that has significant potential for transaction processing in supply chains. The construction industry being the second least digitalised industry, the adoption of innovative technologies is predominantly important. This paper explores the potential application of blockchain for accurate estimation of EC in construction supply chains. A detailed literature review and expert interviews revealed that, compared to traditional information systems, blockchain systems could eliminate issues in EC estimating highlighting its potential credible application for EC estimating. Scalability was identified as a feature that was lacking in a blockchain system, however, for EC estimating, its impact was identified as minimal. It will be difficult to generalise the findings of the study due to interview based qualitative methodology adopted in this study along with the fact that blockchain is an emerging and fairly new technology. However, a similar process could be followed by other studies to compare blockchain with traditional information systems, to evaluate the suitability of blockchain technology to develop prototype systems.</jats:p>"

First, a bibliometric tool is used and then a more in-depth analysis of selected literature is performed, focusing on the type of renewable energy analyzed and the level of development of countries, the dimension of sustainability focused on and the country’s development level, and the type of renewable energies focused on and the dimension of sustainability analyzed. It represents a milestone in the topic giving insights on the state of the art of the research on this research area, enhancing empirical evidence on the kind of relationships and developing a discussion on how closely aligned the political and institutional discourses are with the research concerns. We conclude that, while studies on lower-income countries focus on lower-rung energies, studies on higher-income countries focus on the study of more diversified sources. Moreover, wind–solar energy is the most reported in the articles concerned with environmental sustainability. Our main recommendation is to further investigate the implementation of modern renewable energies in developing countries, to help those countries to climb the energy ladder toward cleaner energy supply.</jats:p>"

Multi-national and transregional e-commerce enterprises have the characteristics of simple circulation structure, simplified transaction cost, high efficiency and rapid evolution in economic and trade activities. However, the traditional transnational and transregional e-commerce enterprises have the disadvantages of slow development and low efficiency in the supply chain. At the same time, there are still many uncertain factors in the corresponding decision sequence. In this paper, the risks faced by cross-border e-commerce supply chain will be comprehensively analyzed and studied. At the same time, the decision-making problem of cross-border e-commerce supply chain sequence will be studied innovatively from two aspects of random uncertainty and fuzzy uncertainty, and a double-layer random expectation model will be established to form a fractal statistical model of supply chain sequence. In this paper, two kinds of sequential strategies are discussed in detail, and a double-layer fuzzy equivalent model is established. Finally, the model is solved by optimization software. The experimental results show that the fractal fractional optimization model proposed in this paper has advantages for the supply chain optimization of multi-national and cross regional e-commerce enterprises. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the 21st century, major changes have taken place in supply chain management. First of all, some new type of supply chains has appeared beside the traditional supply chains. The growing level of pollution, the decreasing level of non-renewable sources indicate changes in the business life. Companies find some alternate solutions to protect the environment – use renewable sources, integrate recycling processes, use the inverse logistics etc. So companies are getting to be eco-conscious, we are called them as ‘green companies’. If these green companies are in one supply chain, we are called as ‘green supply chain’. The coordination of supply chains – whether if traditional or green– is one of the most important research topics in this century. The number of chain members is growing; the cooperation is getting to be more difficult. That is why contracts could be a good solution for this problem, because they define a framework for the parties to manage their relationships. Contracts work well, if the right type is chosen according to the nature of the relationship. But in the case of a green supply chain, there are other influencing factors. Green companies are able to accept higher prices to get higher quality products. In the paper, we analyse how these factors influence the decision-makers to choose between the contracts; we use the AHP decision-making method.</jats:p>"

This study used the list of manufacturing firms in Nairobi as provided in the KAM directory that showed a total of 499 manufacturing firms operating in Nairobi. The research study used stratified random sampling. The sample size of the research study was 50 manufacturing firms. The data was collected by use of structured questionnaires. It was done from operations managers, quality assurance managers and supply chain managers or their equivalents since they were deemed to be well versed and had good understanding of strategic quality management practices and operational activities of manufacturing firms. The information from the analysis was presented by use of pie charts, graphs, bar charts and tables to search for any correlation between strategic quality management practices and firms’ competitiveness.Results and conclusion: The results revealed that bench marking and competitiveness were positively and significantly correlated (r=0.578, p=0.000). The results further showed that continuous improvement and competitiveness were positively and significantly related (r=0.620, p=0.000). It was additionally verified that supplier partnering and competitiveness were positively and significantly related (r=0.510, p=0.000). Equally, the results showed that six sigma and competitiveness were positively and significantly related (r=0.529, p=0.000). Finally, the results revealed that quality management practices and competitiveness were positively and significantly related (r=0.642, p=0.000). The results indicated that the overall model was statistically significant. Further, the results imply that the independent variables are good predictors of firm competitiveness. This was reinforced by an F statistic of 21.769 and the reported p value (0.000) which was less than the conventional probability of 0.05 significance level. Policy recommendation: The author recommended that manufacturing firms should institute and involve the support of strategic leadership to monitor the adoption and implementation of quality management practices as a way of improving their competitiveness in their respective industries. Further, firms should come up with as many benchmarking approaches and to also hold several of them so as to increase on adoption of effective mechanism that makes firms more competitive</jats:p>"

Based on calculations of the amount of farm waste that act as raw materials for a biogas power plant, the amount of electricity that can be produced from biogas has been determined. The value of electricity generation was also determined when a biogas plant and solar panels are used together in order to fully cover the need for electricity. It has been established that the use of renewable energy sources for autonomous power supply has significant potential for growth, in particular, the generation of electricity by a biogas power plant is calculated according to the minimum indicators for a cattle farm, provides 57% of the required electricity, in addition, there is also thermal energy, which is used for heating farms. The combined operation of the biogas plant and solar panels installed on the roof of the farm allows to cover the need for electricity with a reduction factor of 2.6 solar panels generation. The use of biogas obtained from the waste of a cattle farm and together with solar panels makes it possible to cover the need for electricity with a significant reserve. For a typical farm of 100 cattle, this stock is about 80%. The use of which is possible with the use of energy storage devices and the formation of a biogas reserve. It has been established that the electrical power of a biogas plant, which works in conjunction with solar panels, should be at least the average value of the power consumption to provide autonomous power supply to consumers of the livestock farm, especially in the winter months when solar insolation is minimal.</jats:p>",

Under the SFSTS practice, to fill the demand (offline and online) from a customer region, two or more nearby stores of the retailers’ frequently replenish from each other as well as from a distribution center (DC) to better prepare inventory before the demand arrives. We study how to best replenish the DC and multiple nearby stores under this new practice using a multi‐period inventory model with proactive transshipments. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to solve this model, and the characterized optimal replenishment policy is valuable especially as it differs significantly from the past relevant literature on single‐period models. In contrast, for the DC, although the procure‐up‐to policy is still optimal, the procure‐up‐to level is no longer constant but depends on all stores’ on‐hand inventory. For each store, the optimal policy no longer remains the same structure but changes with whether the DC procures inventory from the supplier. When the DC procures inventory, the stores’ optimal policy is no longer single‐threshold, but two‐threshold (order‐up‐to and ship‐down‐to); and these thresholds decrease in any other store’s on‐hand inventory. When the DC does not procure inventory, the stores ship between each other only when their inventories are imbalanced enough, and they ship until the benefit drops to just cover the shipping cost. Our results demonstrate that it is important to constantly track every store’s on‐hand inventory and it is much more complex to implement SFSTS with more nearby stores, despite the additional profit earned. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The main objective of this study was to establish the influence of quality management practices on competitiveness of manufacturing firms in Nairobi.Methodology: The research adopted a descriptive survey research design in trying to focus on manufacturing firms operating in Nairobi. This study used the list of manufacturing firms in Nairobi as provided in the KAM directory that showed a total of 499 manufacturing firms operating in Nairobi. The research study used stratified random sampling. The sample size of the research study was 50 manufacturing firms. The data was collected by use of structured questionnaires. It was done from operations managers, quality assurance managers and supply chain managers or their equivalents since they were deemed to be well versed and had good understanding of strategic quality management practices and operational activities of manufacturing firms. The information from the analysis was presented by use of pie charts, graphs, bar charts and tables to search for any correlation between strategic quality management practices and firms’ competitiveness.Results and conclusion: The results revealed that bench marking and competitiveness were positively and significantly correlated (r=0.578, p=0.000). The results further showed that continuous improvement and competitiveness were positively and significantly related (r=0.620, p=0.000). It was additionally verified that supplier partnering and competitiveness were positively and significantly related (r=0.510, p=0.000). Equally, the results showed that six sigma and competitiveness were positively and significantly related (r=0.529, p=0.000). Finally, the results revealed that quality management practices and competitiveness were positively and significantly related (r=0.642, p=0.000). The results indicated that the overall model was statistically significant. Further, the results imply that the independent variables are good predictors of firm competitiveness. This was reinforced by an F statistic of 21.769 and the reported p value (0.000) which was less than the conventional probability of 0.05 significance level. Policy recommendation: The author recommended that manufacturing firms should institute and involve the support of strategic leadership to monitor the adoption and implementation of quality management practices as a way of improving their competitiveness in their respective industries. Further, firms should come up with as many benchmarking approaches and to also hold several of them so as to increase on adoption of effective mechanism that makes firms more competitive</jats:p>"

To handle these challenges, industries need to connect engineering technology with enterprise systems to transform their practices toward industry 4.0 requirements. The supply chain sector is targeting stakeholders to enhance their product competitiveness by leveraging innovative digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things (IoT), and blockchain to make effective decisions instantaneously. This article will help in contextualizing emerging adaptive intelligence technology to drive connected intelligence and achieve supply chain operational excellence. A real-time case study in the manufacturing industry will be discussed. Subsequently, how adaptive intelligence can help quality management in real-time will be explored to manage the production quality, which is measured by rejections, scraps, and cost savings. Additionally, this article discusses how technology-embedded enterprise systems help the organization to manage the daily production, which is measured by production rate, quality, and yield. For the case organization, the IoT architecture is proposed and the performance metric framework for the supply chain is described. Furthermore, the article discusses how materials can be reused to extract economic benefits with collaborated diverse industries. This influences the eco-friendly environment across the supply chain with the focus on reducing the carbon footage.</jats:p>",

Moreover, with rapid development of the Internet of Things technology, application of intelligent information management has become a development trend of various neighborhoods where LoRa communication technology with low power consumption and long-distance transmission characteristics has been widely used. Therefore, starting from the concept of green environmental protection, LoRa technology is used in this paper to design and develop a runoff pollution control system including a management terminal, terminal and network components for waste-water discharge projects. The main function is to calculate and comprehensively analyze the conventional indexes such as CODCr, BOD5, ammonia nitrogen, and total phosphorus in the sewage treatment process, which reduces the calculation error of total pollutant treatment volume and total production volume, and improves the data accuracy of the sewage purification project. Meanwhile, the example verifies that the system proposed in the paper has accurate analysis of runoff pollution characteristics and accurate data calculation, which provides technical support for sustainable development and green development goals and mitigation of water crisis.</jats:p>",

The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 presents the members of the supply chains with extreme challenges. Because of the epidemic, the value added activities of the supply chains are getting even more importance. It became clear that the different supply chains connect the whole economy in a global and local scale as well. The choice of the inventory and organizational strategy is a key aspect in a crisis like this. The aim of this study is to present the current challenges and their viable solutions in order to check the possibilities to maintain the operation of the supply chains even in this difficult economic and social period using an automotive case study as an example.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The bullwhip effect reflects the variance amplification of demand as they are moving upstream in a supply chain, and leading to the distortion of demand information that hinders supply chain performance sustainability. Extensive research has been undertaken to model, measure, and analyze the bullwhip effect while assuming stationary independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) demand, employing the classical order-up-to (OUT) policy and allowing return orders. On the contrary, correlated demand where a period’s demand is related to previous periods’ demands is evident in several real-life situations, such as demand patterns that exhibit trends or seasonality. This paper assumes correlated demand and aims to investigate the order variance ratio (OVR), net stock amplification ratio (NSA), and average fill rate/service level (AFR). Moreover, the impact of correlated demand on the supply chain performance under various operational parameters, such as lead-time, forecasting parameter, and ordering policy parameters, is analyzed. A simulation modeling approach is adopted to analyze the response of a single-echelon supply chain model that restricts return orders and faces a first order autoregressive demand process AR(1). A generalized order-up-to policy that allows order smoothing through the proper tuning of its smoothing parameters is applied. The characterization results confirm that the correlated demand affects the three performance measures and interacts with the operating conditions. The results also indicate that the generalized OUT inventory policy should be adopted with the correlated demand, as its smoothing parameters can be adapted to utilize the demand characteristics such that OVR and NSA can be reduced without affecting the service level (AFR), implying sustainable supply chain operations. Furthermore, the results of a factorial design have confirmed that the ordering policy parameters and their interactions have the largest impact on the three performance measures. Based on the above characterization, the paper provides management with means to sustain good performance of a supply chain whenever a correlated demand pattern is realized through selecting the control parameters that decrease the bullwhip effect.</jats:p>"

A description is given of research questions and the international developments in the field of asset management. This is followed by the developments on asset management at the Dutch water company Evides. Twenty years of asset management research at KWR is presented in five phases, showing a transition from the question of how can the concepts of asset management help to better plan the replacement of distribution networks, towards integrated decision making on the asset system as a whole. A focal point for research could be how research can contribute to creating value for water companies. More formal information and improved modelling will continue to play a central role; however, attention is required for making use of expert knowledge, scenario building, data quality and the integration of information of technical, financial and societal origin.</jats:p>",

Corals, the animals that create these immensely biodiverse habitats, are particularly vulnerable to climate change and inadequately protected. Increasing ocean temperatures leave corals starved as they lose their primary source of food: the photosynthetic algae that live within their tissue. Ocean warming has been impacting coral reefs around the globe for decades, with the latest 2014-2016 heat stress event affecting more than 75% of the world’s corals. Here, we discuss the benefits humans derive from healthy reefs, the threats corals face, and review current policies and management efforts. We also identify management and policy gaps in preserving coral habitats. The gain and urgency of protecting coral reefs is evident from their vast economic and ecological value. Management and restoration efforts are growing across the globe, and many of these have been influential in mitigating local stressors to reefs such as overfishing, nutrient inputs, and water quality. However, the current trajectory of ocean temperatures requires sweeping global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to effectively safeguard the future of coral reefs. The U.S. should stand as a world leader in addressing climate change and in preserving one of the planet’s most valuable ecosystems.</jats:p>"

In this study, data were collected through questionnaire survey on the SMEs in Klang Valley Malaysia. A total of 298 responses were analyzed. The regression analysis method was used to test the hypothetical relationships among technological, organizational and environmental factors and SMEs’ intention to adopt GSCM practices. Research findings show that perceived relative advantage, perceived cost, top management support, complexity, compatibility, firms size, customer pressure, regulatory pressure and the quality of human resources are statistically significant factors influencing GSCM adoption among SMEs in Malaysia. However, observability and governmental support do not have significant effects on GSCM adoption intention. According to research findings, some implications which are valuable to academics and practitioners are also addressed.

The approach was anchored in existing manual practices, but equipped with a mechanism for collecting critical data and incorporating it into decision-making, paving the path to gradual automation. Two key variables that affect the risk were: the likelihood of an event and the importance of the specific shipment. User-specified event likelihood, with elliptical spatial component, allowed the model to attach different probabilistic interpretations; uniform and Gaussian probability distributions were discussed, including possible paths for extensions. The framework development included a practical implementation in the Python scientific ecosystem. Although the framework was demonstrated in a prototype environment, the results clearly showed that the framework was quickly able to show scheduled and in-process shipments that were at risk of delay, while also providing a prioritized ranking of these shipments in order for personnel within the manufacturing organization to quickly implement mitigation actions and proactive communications with customers to ensure critical shipments were delivered when needed. Since the framework pulled in data from various business information systems, the framework proved to assist personnel to quickly identify potentially impacted shipments much faster than existing methods, which resulted in improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.</jats:p>"

This is reflected in the growing number of articles, conferences, special publications and websites devoted to the subject. Nonetheless, sustainable development in emerging economies just started gaining importance. The objective of this article is to review, from a global perspective, the existing literature regarding sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in emerging economies. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was performed, analyzing 56 articles from the year 2010 to April 2020 from a descriptive and content approach. Subsequently, the results are presented, showing the increasing interest in SSCM, however lagging behind in emerging economies’ research versus developed ones. Findings indicate the context in developing countries plays an important role when conducting empirical or case study investigations. Additionally, the integration of the three dimensions of sustainability and how they impact supply chain performance becomes crucial to research from an emerging economy perspective. Consequently, limitations of this work are presented, and opportunities are identified for future lines of research, in particular in key supply chain functions. Finally, the conclusion confirms the need for further research from different supply chain viewpoints, such as collaboration, sustainable practices innovation, sourcing and supplier development from emerging countries’ standpoint and background.</jats:p>"

This paper seeks to organize A-SMEs to develop a cooperative organization via collaborative strategies and alliance structures, named as the home-delivery-oriented agri-food supply chain (HASC) alliance, to form a substantive relationship to gain a stable foothold in the emerging e-commerce market. A theoretical framework of the HASC alliance is built with its organizational structure and schematics of the process of implementation strategies that cover the aspects of last-mile chain extension, food transportation, and production/distribution control. Furthermore, a three-step analytical method is proposed to analyze the performance of the alliance with the aim to provide appropriate strategies to hedge against the potential risks of cooperation instability. A hypothetical case is conducted, and the results show that: (1) the performance of the hypothetical HASC alliance with time shows significant variation in the beginning, but it gains stability with the application of stability control strategies; (2) the cooperation stability of HASC alliance is very sensitive to the performance of the strategies that control the customer and environment variations; (3) the factors of trust and market fluctuation have higher effects on membership and environmental stability, respectively; (4) the minimum and maximum cost ranges of control strategies at which the alliance can maintain its stability and performance are 5% and 29%, respectively, of the total operation cost.</jats:p>"

This paper describes that energy supply planning must be sufficient, secure, reliable, and affordable for users by using local potency of energy resources that are renewable and unlimited. The paper identifies local energy potential demand of energy, current productive economy, current system of electricity, and infrastructure of energy. It finds that the local potential of energy resources is photovoltaic. The demand of energy of Islands is primary for lighting, ironing, and entertainment. The existing economy of islands is dominated by fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. The total of electricity generated is about 6.000 kW that is all supplied using PLTD. The infrastructure of energy is covered by PLN using 4 system of distributions that are System of Siau, System of Makalehi, System of Tagulandang dan System of Biaro. The local government is concerning to build up industrial cluster of fisheries for domestic and abroad markets and also to create the exotics tourism. With a serious commitment and high awareness among government, industries, and society, it is possible to increase the economy and social welfare because they have enough energy potential, abundant fish in the sea, and good tourism prospect in the future. It concludes that the energy supply should meet the demand sufficiently, securely, reliably, and affordably. In terms of productive economy, the energy should create the value added in society and increase the welfare. It recommends that in the border, small, and isolated island, the abundant and renewable of energy resources, photovoltaic, can be substituted to PLTD. Since it is only available in daylight. In order to make it useful in midnight, we need a power storage as a back up of energy resources.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Salaries and wages structure are always established haphazardly and arbitrarily. This results in salaries and wages inequities, which are the most dangerous sources of friction, conflict and low morale in organizations. It has also created negative attitudes of workers towards their jobs and responsibilities in organizations. This study adopted survey research design. The population 1206 which consist of the various workers of the Cross River State Civil Service Commission that cut across ministries, agencies, institutions and other parastatals. Simple random sampling technique was applied through the use of Taro Yamane formula in determining the sample size of 234 respondents. Primary data was collected through the use of a structured questionnaire using 4 points Likert scale of strongly agreed (4), agreed (3), and disagreed (2), strongly disagreed (1).  The data analysis technique used for the study was linear regression model, including ordinary least square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) through SPSS version 20, to test the hypotheses. The study revealed that salaries and wages management significantly influence the development of organizational performance of the Cross River State ministries, agencies and institutions. Early payments of salaries and wages have a significant influence on organizational performance in the state. The amount of salaries and wages paid also has a significant effect on workers’ involvement, loyalty and commitment of the state.  Salaries and wages structure also have a significant influence on organizational job satisfaction of the state. Salaries and wages management also contributes to workers’ motivation and morale in the state. The study recommended that management as well as administrators of the various ministries and institutions should ensure that their workers are financially satisfied at when due in their payment of wages and salaries, if they are to be motivated, committed and loyal, satisfied on the job performance and productivity.  This is because financially satisfied workers will be more motivated, productive, engaged and emotionally attached to the organizational jobs.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in predicting the influent BOD5 concentration and the performance of WWTPs. The WWTP performance was defined in terms of the COD, BOD, and TSS concentrations in the effluent. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the best-performing ANN network structure and configuration. The results showed that the ANN model developed to predict the BOD concentration performed the best among the three outputs. The top-performing ANN models yielded R2 values of 0.752, 0.612, and 0.631 for the prediction of the BOD, COD, and TSS concentrations, respectively. The optimal performing models were obtained (three inputs – one output), which indicated that the influent temperature and conductivity greatly affect the WWTP performance as inputs in all models. The developed prediction model for the influent BOD5 concentration attained a high accuracy, i.e., R2 = 0.754, which implies that the model is viable as a soft sensor for online control and management systems for WWTPs. Overall, the ANN model provides a simple approach for the prediction of the complex processes of WWTPs.</jats:p>",

The development of this industry, in addition to having a positive impact on the economy also has the potential for negative impacts on the environment if not managed properly. This condition is inseparable from the production process which produces many defects and rejects. One way to reduce these negative impacts is by measuring performance that is integrated with the environment (Green Supply Chain Management). The researcher uses the green SCOR model which refers to the SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference) model from the Supply Chain Council to identify green supply chain management performance indicators. Then use AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) to determine the level of importance of green supply chain management performance indicators. There are six categories of processes used in measuring the performance of green supply chain management, namely plan, source, make, deliver, return and waste management, but research is focused on the make process that focuses on the salt production process. The results of measurements indicate that the value of the performance of green supply chain management of PT. XYZ in 2017 amounted to 75.4 and 2018 amounted to 72.3 is still below 80 even though it is nearing the target but is still being controlled and efforts are made to improve. But when in 2019 it decreased to 46.6 which shows far below the target and needs to be done immediately. As for the 17 performance indicators measured, there are 9 performance indicators that need to be improved, namely reusable material, the number of machine troubles, the number of process rejects, recycleable rejects, the amount of waste, the amount of product defects, recycleable defects, production costs and waste handling costs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>At present, China has a developing natural gas market, and ensuring the security of gas supply is an issue of high concern. Gas supply reliability, the natural gas pipeline system’s ability to satisfy the market demand, is determined by both supply side and demand side, and is usually adopted by the researches to measure the security of gas supply. In the previous study, the demand side is usually simplified by using load duration curve (LDC) to describe the demand, which neglects the effect of demand side management. The simplification leads to the inaccurate and unreasonable assessment of the gas supply reliability, especially in high demand situation. To overcome this deficiency and achieve a more reasonable result of gas supply reliability, this paper extends the previous study on demand side by proposing a novel method of management on natural gas demand side, and the effects of demand side management on gas supply reliability is analyzed. The management includes natural gas prediction models for different types of users, the user classification rule, and the demand adjustment model based on user classification. Firstly, An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and a support vector machine (SVM) model are applied to predict the natural gas demand for different types of users, such as urban gas distributor (including residential customer, commercial customer, small industrial customer), power plant, large industrial customer, and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) station. Then, the user classification rule is built based on users’ attribute and impact of supplied gas’s interruption or reduction. Natural gas users are classified into four levels. (1) Demand Fully Satisfied; (2) Demand Slightly Reduced; (3) Demand Reduced; (4) Demand Interrupted. The user classification rule also provides the demand reduction range of different users. Moreover, the optimization model of demand adjustment is built, and the objective of the model is to maximize the amount of gas supply for each user based on the classification rule. The constraints of the model are determined by the classification rule, including the demand reduction range of different users. Finally, the improved method of gas supply reliability assessment is developed, and is applied to the case study of our previous study derived from a realistic natural gas pipeline system operated by PetroChina to analyze the effects of demand side management on natural gas pipeline system’s gas supply reliability.</jats:p>",

The natural gas reforming hydrogen production plus distributed electrolysis water hydrogen production technology is a recoverable solution; there are many chemical and iron and steel enterprises in the eastern coast and the Bohai Rim region, and the industrial by-product hydrogen purification technology It is a better choice; there are abundant renewable resources such as photovoltaic and wind energy in Northeast, North China, and Northwest, and can use renewable energy electrolytic hydrogen production technology; Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other places have excellent coal resources, and the potential of coal hydrogen production technology is huge. The establishment of the layout of the downstream hydrogen refuelling station and the establishment of the application market are also crucial to the upstream hydrogen production enterprises. Areas where the front-end hydrogen production link and the back-end application link are well integrated can gain a favourable position.</jats:p>",

Under the power market reform of direct power purchase transactions, this paper focuses on the channel selection and emission reduction decisions of power supply chain. From the theoretical perspective, this paper develops the decision-making models of centralized and decentralized power supply chain, which consist of one renewable energy power generation enterprise, one coal-fired power plant and one power grid enterprise. The optimal strategies of power quantities and profits for power supply chain members and their corresponding numerical experiments are analyzed in different cases. The results show that there are qA1Nc*&lt;qA1Lc* for renewable energy power generation enterprise A, qB1Nc*&gt;qB1Lc* and eBNc*&gt;eBLc* for coal-fired power plant B, which indicate that the direct power purchase channel in the centralized scenario is conducive to promoting the transaction quantity of renewable energy power generation, as well as the on-grid power quantity and emission reduction efforts of coal-fired power plant B. Furthermore, the profit of whole power supply chain could be enhanced by the increasing on-grid power preference coefficient of coal-fired power generation, subsidy for renewable energy power generation and preference coefficient for clean production, and by the decreasing emission reduction cost coefficient of coal-fired power plant. Additionally, the emission reduction effort of coal-fired power plant is positively relevant with preference coefficient for clean production, whereas it is negatively relevant with power grid wheeling charge, emission reduction cost coefficient and subsidy for renewable energy power generation. Our findings can provide useful managerial insights for policymakers and enterprises in the sustainability of power supply chain.</jats:p>"

The manufacturer starts manufacturing the items at a lower rate to avoid a huge investment at the initial stage and reduce the products' holding cost. However, when the stock level reaches a prefixed level, he switches on to a higher production rate to avoid shortage caused by an insufficient stock of the items. Moreover, the impact of inflation and the time value of money on the manufacturing system’s cost is considered here, which harms any business by reducing the value of an investment with time. We determined the optimum production times at both the low and high production rates by minimizing the system's total cost. Numerical examples illustrated the applicability of this proposed model. Sensitivity analysis studied the effect of changes in the parameters associated with this model on the optimal decision variables. This numerical experiment was done in LINGO 18.0 software. Results showed that the production strategy taken by the manufacturer helped reduce his total cost.</jats:p>"

Based on previous studies, this paper abstracts mitigation policies into supply-control (resource tax as an example) and demand-control (carbon tax as an example). The effects of these policies have been divided into the direct and the indirect effects. A dynamic recursive computable general equilibrium model is applied to simulate different impact path of the two policies. The research shows that if there is no foreign trade and the market is completely market-oriented, the effect of the demand control and the supply control may be equivalent. But this is not the real case. Under the same level of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission, carbon tax can significantly reduce the energy demand of enterprises and restrain energy imports. However, resource tax can significantly increase domestic energy prices firstly, and then enterprises will be more willing to use cheaper imported energy. Regardless of energy security, relatively low energy use costs ease the economic costs of emission mitigation. Therefore, if every country in the world is required to reduce emissions compulsorily, resource tax may be a better policy of reducing emissions while obtaining “excess profits”.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the last compared family of short-circuit current waveforms was obtained using analytic calculations. As the presented comparison shows, the assumed method of selecting short-circuit waveforms impacted their values. However, the difference in energy related to short-circuit currents did not influence on the selection of the short-circuit protections, especially at low values of steady-state short-circuit currents and short time constants characteristic for the generators, performing the functions of an alternative power supply.

During the water diversion period, the results showed that the Northwest Area and Gong Bay are the most important pollution flux sources to the sensitive area. Under northwest wind condition, the pollution flux proportion from Northwest Area and Gong Bay is 65 and 17%, respectively. Under southeast wind condition, the pollution flux proportion from Northwest Area and Gong Bay is 48 and 27%, respectively. Namely, pollution control to the upstream watershed of the Northwest Area and improving the water quality (TP &amp;lt; 0.065 mg/L; TN &amp;lt; 1.2 mg/L) from the Wangyu river are the effective methods to reduce the pollution risks for the sensitive area.</jats:p>",

The port is a meeting point between land and sea so that makes the port very important in the economic growth of a region. So that the operation of ports for loading and unloading must not stop or be interrupted. In many cases, one of the most frequent disruptions experienced by ports is disruptions due to electricity supply. The purpose of this study is to find the main cause of power supply disruptions in one of the container terminals as research objects. There are two factors that influence electrical supply disruption, namely external factors and internal factors. Within these factors there are several categories such as weather based, flow of transmission line, lack of maintenance, electrical current stability and lack of human resources or standard operating procedures. By analyzing the flow of electricity supply distribution in the power plants to the terminal, author can find out the main agents that cause disruption of electricity supply and the impact to the terminal. This research is expected to be used as a reference to open up insights to see all the agent that have the potential to cause disruption to the electricity supply in the terminal, so that later they can take further action.</jats:p>",

The new design of air-gap–water-gap membrane distillation (AG-WG)MD was evaluated experimentally by comparing with an AGMD system under different operating conditions. In theory, mass and heat transfer in the new (AG-WG)MD and imitative AGMD systems were analyzed. Experimental outcomes showed that a new (AG-WG)MD design profoundly enhanced flux (Pd) and gained output ratio (GOR), and greatly decreased energy consumption (STEC) and heat input (EH.I). At a concentration of 5,000 mg/L, coolant temperature of 20 °C, and flow rate of 18 L/h, Pd was promoted by 76.26%, 40.84%, 35.45%, 30.91%, and GOR by 46.38%, 33.46%, 31.27%, 26.65%, in addition to STEC being reduced about 55.63%, 46.81%, 43.66%, 38.30%, and EH.I around 31.31%, 25.84%, 23.53%, 20.55%, from the AGMD to (AG-WG)MD system at feed temperatures of 50 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C, and 80 °C, respectively. The outcomes proved that the AGMD performance could be significantly promoted by integrating with WGMD in a combined MD system. This combination increased the temperature difference across the membrane and decreased thermal-concentration boundary layers for the AGMD system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background\n A remarkable decline in fertility rates has been observed in many countries, with a primary determinant being an increase in the use of contraceptives. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effect of demand and supply-side factors associated with the use of contraceptive measures in Pakistan.\nMethod:\n Secondary data analysis of four data series of the Pakistan Demographic and Health Surveys (PDHS 1990–91, 2006–07, 2012–13, and 2017–18) were used. The data includes ever-married women aged 15–49 years who had given birth in the previous five years and participated in the family-planning module of the PDHS. A total number of 25,318 women were included in the analysis. Data was analysed by investigating the associations between independent variables (demand and supply-side factors) and the use of contraceptive measures through unadjusted Odds Ratios (OR) and adjusted OR (AOR).\nResults\n A majority of the women were illiterate and not in employment. There was an increase in the number of women who did not use contraceptive methods in rural areas over time. Among demand-side factors, the results indicated that, in 2012–13, women without media exposure were less likely to use contraceptives (OR 0.396, 95% CI 0.353–0.442), and the trend remains almost constant for 2017–18 (OR 0.432, 95% CI 0.391–0.477). These findings change slightly in the adjusted analysis (AOR 0.664, 95% CI 0.562–0.784) in 2012–13 and (AOR 0.654, 95% CI 0.483–0.885) in 2017–18; however, they still show a lower likelihood of using contraceptives without media exposure. Among supply-side factors, the results indicated that absence of transport (2012–13) and limited visits by family-planning workers over the previous 12 months (2006–07, 2012–13, and 2017–18) remained significant factors for not using contraceptive methods.\nConclusion\n The results of the study indicate that certain demand and supply-side factors are associated with the use of contraceptive measures in Pakistan. It highlights the need for the provision of family-planning resources and further structural factors, particularly in remote areas.</jats:p>"

In response to the needs and the peculiarities of the construction industry, this paper proposes an innovative model that merges temporal and project-based supply chains into a sustainable network with repetitive flows, large scope contracts, strategic alliances and economies of scale. It is a dynamic mixed-integer linear programming model for cost minimization of a three-echelon supply chain serving multiple sites with multiple products over a time horizon. Its novelty lies in yielding optimal decisions on network design, product quantities to be purchased and transported, shipments and inventory levels in all echelons under any logistics system in a multi-period, multi-product and multi-project environment with discount schemes and strategic preferences. The model is general enough to be implemented by any general contractor acting as a system integrator but also allows customization with logical constraints. All these features constitute an innovative, versatile and flexible managerial decision making tool. Model implementation is based on a spreadsheet optimization software and is followed by post-solution analysis, sensitivity analysis and multiple parameterized optimizations.</jats:p>"

However, fundamental studies under the influence of variable NOM characteristics and inorganic anions have often been overlooked. This is important given NOM characteristics (such as charge density and molecular weight) and inorganic anions concentrations are geographically and seasonally variable. We examined the performance of a strongly basic IX resin for the simultaneous removal of NOM, inorganic ions and micropollutants (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and algal toxins), from different surface and recycled waters. The results indicated &amp;gt;70% removal of NOM for ∼20,000 Bed Volumes (BV) with an uptake of NOM fractions following the order of their respective charge densities. IX pore blockage and consequent site reduction was observed in the presence of higher molecular weight NOM fractions (breakthrough ∼7,000 BV). Moreover, NOM and inorganic ions breakthrough corresponded to ∼85–90% site occupancy (in meq) in the absence of pore blocking compounds. IX also provided simultaneous removal of inorganic ions (&amp;gt;90%) and charged micropollutants. Complete removals of Microcystin-LR and multiple long- and short-chained PFAS were achieved at environmentally relevant concentrations with dosages of 1,000 mg/L (or 4.5 mL/L) or higher.</jats:p>",

In contrast, production-side theorists emphasise the movement of capital into previously disinvested neighbourhoods and contend that profit-seeking development increases property values and sparks gentrification. Hybrid theorists argue that consumption and production occur simultaneously. This article operationalises arguments made by each approach, and asks: Do gentrifiers precede rising home values or do rising home values precede gentrifiers? To answer this question of sequence, we build a dataset of census and property tax assessment data for 2192 New York City census tracts between 2009 and 2016. Using cross-lagged regression models with tract and year fixed effects, we find neighbourhoods that experienced an increase in White, middle-class residents had related housing price spikes in each of the subsequent two years. A 1% increase in gentrifiers was associated with a subsequent 2.7% increase in property values. However, housing market growth did not predict future increases in gentrifiers. This suggests that consumption leads production during neighbourhood gentrification, and that developers are reactive, not proactive, in their investment decisions. Focusing on the sequence of gentrification’s subsidiary elements enables city officials, non-profits and social movements to better anticipate gentrification and develop more targeted policies. </jats:p>",

During the course of article writing, the authors set themselves as a goal is an analytical understanding of the methodology for managing the differentiation of package tours and services in order to solve the problem of ensuring high consumer value based on their differentiation by consumer characteristics, regardless of the type of services package and the purpose of travel. The article substantiates the feasibility of managing the differentiation of package tours as a source of increasing their consumer value in the dynamics of consumer expectations, and also presents a new author’s methodology for studying the process of differentiation of package tours. The results of study are of theoretical and practical significance. They can be used as a basis for further scientific research, and they can also be used in the practical activities of tour operators to differentiate their offer in the market and thereby increase their competitiveness and increase profits.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Preselling strategies have been a common marketing tool, but research on this selection is limited. Thus, we examine three pre-sale strategies of a manufacturer who produces and sells a seasonal product to a retailer: (1) supplier pre-sale strategy—the supplier carries out preselling by opening a direct channel; (2) retailer pre-sale strategy—the retailer purchases pre-sale products from the supplier and sells them in online and offline channels; and (3) joint pre-sale strategy—the retailer acts as a pre-sale platform, providing order information and pre-sale services. For each preselling mode, we construct the Stackelberg game model aiming to maximize profits and obtain optimal service levels and pricing decisions. We find that the two latter scenarios, that is, to cooperate with the retailer (retailer pre-sale and joint pre-sale strategies), could highly gain more profit for the supplier compared with the former. For the supplier, the joint pre-sale strategy will likely be the dominant strategy because of its wide-range applicability. On the contrary, the retailer is swaying between retailer pre-sale and joint pre-sale strategies under different conditions. For the supplier, leadership always guarantees a high profit, but if the joint pre-sale strategy is adopted, then the existence of a profit-sharing ratio will narrow the profit gap between the two players.</jats:p>"

This paper focuses on the possibility of CPS implementation in FPSC, as well as reviewing a holistic understanding of CPS in the FPSC.&#x0D;\nMethodology: This systematic review was conducted by analyzing selected articles and categorization to identify potentially relevant articles referring to peer-reviewed journals, thesis Ph.D., and proceedings. Using four steps, the first step found 161 articles. The second step obtained 56 articles. The third step, 17 articles were selected as topics of importance. The fourth step was designated to categorize and analyze the 17 articles.&#x0D;\nMain Findings: Research results show a comprehensive review of the description of the CPS classification model in FPSC by categorizing previous literatures on different collaborative structures and different levels of planning. This paper also shows the relevant solution methods used in each level of planning. A review of the current state of CPS in the FPSC model is conducted by highlighting areas that have not been addressed or gaps in the literature and by suggesting directions for further study.&#x0D;\nThe implication of this study: Intended for CPS in FPSC, by reviewing CPS implementation in FPSC, it can develop and become the basis for seeing the benefits of a collaborative performance system in the field of fresh produce, this field still rarely applied, and it could be further identified what kind of collaboration should be carried out from the existing collaboration structure.&#x0D;\nNovelty/Originality of this study: This study is considered as our best knowledge to observe the CPS system in the FPSC, which is an attempt to introduce it by exploring and evaluating the values that could be shared among collaborative partners under classification model of a collaborative structure, general characteristic, level collaboration and solution of the method. It also provides information for interested parties in the collaboration of supply chain to improve the performance based on CPS.</jats:p>"

Measurements of pH, electrolytic conductivity, oxygenation, and water temperature were performed in the field. The concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-, NH4+, NO3-, PO43- was measured in the laboratory. Also, the atmospheric precipitation was determined using automatic precipitation stations. Climate conditions served as the primary determinants of seasonal change in the supply of dissolved matter to basins without outlets in the drainage basin. This is especially true of atmospheric precipitation and the effects of vegetation in the contact zone between precipitation and the biosphere. In the case of biogenic substances, one of the main factors was the length of the vegetation season. The main determinant of the hydrochemical state of kettle ponds was land use.</jats:p>",

To examine market adjustments, we assessed the relationship between PCP supply and whether PCPs offered night and weekend hours, how many patients PCPs saw per day, and how frequently individual adults had office visits.

Specifically, PCPs in these areas were more likely to offer night and weekend hours and saw more patients per day (elasticity at mean = −0.19), while adults in these areas had fewer office visits (elasticity at mean = 0.07). Taken together, the latter two adjustments compensate for more than one‐fourth of the lost capacity to see different patients where there are fewer PCPs.

The riverine water quality was evaluated to check the suitability of water for drinking, livestock and irrigation purposes. Water samples (n = 54) were collected across the river, over a period of three years (2012–2014) and subjected to physicochemical analysis. Water quality index rating revealed that the water of River Chenab fell under the marginal category for drinking and livestock watering, due to the presence of heavy metals pollution above safe limits. Irrigation suitability parameters, such as the sodium absorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Na (%), Kelley's ratio (KR), magnesium hazard (MH) and the permeability index (PI) were measured, and most of the samples were within the safe limit. The piper classification of hydro-chemical parameters revealed that the alkaline-earth metals and strong acids exceed the alkali metals and weak acids, respectively. A Wilcox diagram indicated the alkali hazard was low while salinity hazard has an increasing trend. Spatiotemporal distribution of the pollutants highlighted minimal pollution until Qadirabad site (S4) which gradually keeps worsening at the downstream sites. Two factors of water quality deterioration were identified as pollution addition from the point and nonpoint sources, and diversion of the water through canals. It is inevitable to manage water quality of the Chenab River by reducing point sources pollution, through law enforcement.</jats:p>",

Determining the hazard level rapidly after a hazard occurs plays a critical role in improving the efficiency of emergency response and recovering the water supply capacity of the projects. Through in-depth analysis of the factors that affect the severity of open-channel landslides, an indicator system for hazard assessment of open-channel landslides was established and the criteria for evaluation of different hazard levels were identified. Based on the hierarchy of the indicator system, a two-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model was established to assess the impact of indicators in the model on the hazard level of open-channel landslides, and the weight of each indicator was determined by the analysis hierarchy process. The linear function was used to calculate the membership degree of each indicator to determine the hazard level. A hazard scenario was created with the water diversion project from the Irtysh River to Urumqi as an example, and the two-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model was applied to conduct hazard assessment. The proposed method was confirmed to be reasonable and practical.</jats:p>",

To incorporate the existing stochasticity in our dynamic problem, we develop a multi‐stage stochastic program to specify the optimal location, capacity, inventory, and allocation decisions. Further, a data‐driven rolling horizon approach is developed to use observations of the random parameters in the stochastic optimization problem. In contrast to traditional stochastic programming approaches that are valid only for a limited number of scenarios, the rolling horizon approach makes the determined decisions by the stochastic program implementable in practice and evaluates them. The stochastic program is presented as a quadratic conic optimization, and to generate an efficient scenario tree, a forward scenario tree construction technique is employed. An extensive numerical study is carried out to investigate the applicability of the presented model and rolling horizon procedure, the efficiency of risk‐measurement policies, and the performance of the scenario tree construction technique. Several key practical and managerial insights related to the dynamic supply chain network design under uncertainty are gained based on the computational results.</jats:p>",

The erroneous data as inputs in the prediction process may produce inaccurate predictions. We aim to use machine learning models in the area of the business decision process by predicting products’ backorder while providing flexibility to the decision authority, better clarity of the process, and maintaining higher accuracy. A ranged method is used for specifying different levels of predicting features to cope with the diverse characteristics of real-time data which may happen by machine or human errors. The range is tunable that gives flexibility to the decision managers. The tree-based machine learning is chosen for better explainability of the model. The backorders of products are predicted in this study using Distributed Random Forest (DRF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). We have observed that the performances of the machine learning models have been improved by 20% using this ranged approach when the dataset is highly biased with random error. We have utilized a five-level metric to indicate the inventory level, sales level, forecasted sales level, and a four-level metric for the lead time. A decision tree from one of the constructed models is analyzed to understand the effects of the ranged approach. As a part of this analysis, we list major probable backorder scenarios to facilitate business decisions. We show how this model can be used to predict the probable backorder products before actual sales take place. The mentioned methods in this research can be utilized in other supply chain cases to forecast backorders.</jats:p>",

Manufacturers nowadays are inclined toward product differentiation strategies and more customer-focused approaches to stay competitive in the Industry 4.0 environment, and mass customization and product diversification are among the most commonly implemented business models. Under such circumstances, an economical material supply to assembly lines has become a significant concern for manufacturers. Consequently, the present study deals with optimizing the material supply to mixed-model assembly lines that contribute to the overall production cost efficiency, mainly via the reduction of both the material transportation and material holding costs across production lines, while satisfying certain constraints. Given the complexity of the problem, a novel two-stage heuristic algorithm is developed in this study to enable a cost-efficient delivery. To assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed heuristic algorithm, a set of test problems are solved and compared against the best solution found by a commercial solver. The results of the comparison reveal that the suggested heuristic provides reasonable solutions, thus offering immense opportunities for production cost efficiency and manufacturing sustainability under the mass customization philosophy.</jats:p>"

A choice modeling approach was employed. The result indicates that, on average, households' willingness to pay for the improvement of water quality is three times higher than their monthly payment. Households are willing to pay more for reduction in calcium than for reduction in nitrate and improvement of other attributes. The education level of households influences willingness to pay for the improvement of water quality more than the income level of households. There is high potential to finance for the improvement of the water quality from the households.

Prominent challenges are the integration of the environmental, the economic, and the social dimension of sustainability as well as the consideration of spatial heterogeneity with regard to technology, environment, markets, and society. This paper proposes a novel modeling approach based on activity analysis to facilitate spatially differentiated sustainability assessments of global supply chains. The production and transportation activities in the supply chain and the exchanges between activities and their natural, economic, and social environments are formalized by means of activity vectors. Linking the activities and exchanges to specific locations allows for the calculation of regionalized sustainability indicators. The approach is used to analyze the environmental, economic, and social impacts of lithium-ion batteries. The comparison of alternative supply chain configurations with the spatially differentiated approach reveals that the assessment results differ significantly from those of the global average supply chain. These insights offer new opportunities to advance the design of sustainable supply chains.</jats:p>",

Numerous shootings in recent years, terrorist and otherwise, have sparked heated debates about gun control policy, particularly with regard to Second Amendment issues. Such discussions are more often than not driven by political and philosophical ideology, rather than empirical data. The self‐imposed ban on the dissemination of gun‐related statistics on the part of the Centers for Disease Control has created difficulty in obtaining data, particularly at the sub‐state level. Furthermore, the majority of previous research has not examined the effect on crimes that are gun specific, that is, homicides or robberies committed using guns versus all homicides or robberies. The objective of this research is to examine the multiple relationships between gun ownership and gun crimes at the sub‐state level and to then examine the effect of state‐level gun laws on the sub‐state relationships via multilevel modeling.</jats:p><jats:p>This research involves two separate units of analysis, counties and states. Initial multivariate regression was conducted on a subset of counties in the United States examining the relationship between the percentage of all households with at least one gun, and both the gun homicide rate as well as the gun robbery rate. Data on gun ownership were obtained from the CDC's BRFSS SMART County‐level data files from the mid‐2000s. These data are sampled and weighted to be representative of the entire county. A total of 218 weighted, aggregated counties were used from two separate non‐overlapping years combined. Gun crime data were obtained from the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, which provides total universe data on crimes, including the number committed with a gun. State gun law rankings were obtained from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which quantifies state gun laws into a numeric index. Standard county‐level control variables such as race, income, poverty, region of the country, level of education, and population density were employed. Multilevel models were then run overlaying state gun laws with county‐level data.</jats:p><jats:p>The population studied included adults age 18 and older who responded to the Centers for Disease Control's BRFSS survey questions, as well as all gun crimes known to the police.</jats:p><jats:p>In traditional multivariate analysis, a higher percentage of households with guns was associated with lower gun robbery rates as well as lower gun homicide rates. Multilevel modeling using state gun laws indicated that more restrictive gun laws were also associated with lower gun robbery and homicide rates. The percentage of households with guns remained negative and significant in the multilevel models. Moreover, restrictive state gun laws were associated with lower gun ownership rates at the county level.</jats:p><jats:p>Both legal gun ownership and more restrictive state gun laws are associated with lower rates of violent gun crimes (robbery and homicide).</jats:p><jats:p>The results unexpectedly provide support for both pro‐ and anti‐gun positions.

These have led individuals, families, and organisations to supply housing either on their own or on a rental basis. Although several scholars have attempted to investigate the problem, none has found a realistic solution. Only a few scholars have also used the confirmatory factor analysis to investigate and isolate and the critical factors influencing housing production and supply to the low and medium-income groups in the country. This research attempts to bridge this gap. Ekiti, Lagos and Oyo States were used as case study for the research. Two hundred and ten (210) survey questionnaires were administered on real estate developers using the purposive sampling technique. The data was analysed in SPSS. The study revealed that land accessibility, funding and demographics were found to be the significant factors influencing the supply of low and medium-income housing in the study area. The study recommends direct government intervention in housing supply in favour of an enabling environment for the housing sector in the country</jats:p>"

Their loss may impact reef ecosystems in different ways, including the collapse of small canopy-dwelling invertebrates, and thus the decline of juvenile reef fish that prey on them. To evaluate this potential loss, we assessed (1) the differences between the mobile invertebrate assemblages associated with turf-forming (filamentous and articulated coralline turf) and canopy-forming (<jats:italic>Sargassum</jats:italic>spp. and<jats:italic>Dichotomaria marginata</jats:italic>) algae, and (2) the mechanisms underlying those contrasts by examining the invertebrate community assembly of filamentous turf and<jats:italic>Sargassum</jats:italic>spp. over the main canopy season. Abundance, biomass and diversity almost always differed between canopies and turfs (although not in a consistent way across sampling sites), while differences within canopy and turf algal types were nearly absent. The structure of invertebrate assemblages differed more consistently between canopies and turfs, with certain hard-bodied and soft-bodied invertebrates characterizing canopies and turfs, respectively. This divergence increased as the canopy season advanced. While no temporal changes occurred in turf invertebrate assemblages, clear temporal dynamics occurred in the invertebrate fauna associated with<jats:italic>Sargassum.</jats:italic>Brittle stars and amphipods were most abundant as early colonizers, followed by hard-shelled gastropods, bivalves and ostracods. By the end of the season, these groups became dominant and decreased diversity in the canopy habitat. As hard-shelled prey are preferred items for the main invertivore fish species in the area, results suggest that canopies may play an important role in the provisioning of trophic resources to pelagic consumers.</jats:p>",

From nine sites, a comprehensive sampling campaign was executed during October 2018 to January 2019. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson correlation and multiple regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between water quality characteristics and land use types at the sub-basin and buffer-zone scales. The one-way ANOVA test indicated that most of the parameters are significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.05) among the sampling sites with the exception of pH, total hardness (TH), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and iron (Fe). Agriculture and built-up/bare land had a positive relationship with turbidity, TSS, conductivity and Fe within 50 m and 150 m buffer zones. Built-up/bare land showed a positive relationship with turbidity, TSS and Cl at the sub-basin scale. Forest cover correlated negatively with water quality although not significantly. Grassland correlated significantly with temperature, Cl and total hardness. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicate that land use types within the riparian buffer zones had greater impact on water quality than at the sub-basin scale.

Monocacy River and Antietam Creek data, which were collected by USGS with different reach lengths and discharge conditions, have been used in the current study. It was found that the multilinear discrete lag-cascade (MDLC) model is capable of reconstructing contaminant breakthrough curves. A complete study was performed to estimate the reach length for use in the accurate simulation, and it was concluded that by assuming a uniform flow through the reach, the length unit should be obtained by applying Pe = 12. Moreover, by using temporal moment matching, explicit relationships for MDLC model parameters (k, n, and τ) and based on conventional advection-dispersion equation (ADE) parameters (D, u, x) were extracted. MDLC parameters of the field breakthrough curves were extracted, and it was found that the increase of Pe number caused an increase in delay time and the number of cascades. However, the residence time was obtained to be fixed. Additionally, by assuming the dispersivity parameter (D/u) is constant, the changes in the MDLC parameters were investigated by velocity variation, and new relationships were proposed to estimate the parameters under different hydraulic conditions. Using presented equations provided in this study for residence time (k), cascade number (n), and delay time (τ), the sensitivity analysis was performed, and it was found that the parameters of velocity (u), dispersion coefficient (D), and velocity (u) have the most important effect in calculation of them, respectively.</jats:p>",

In order to maintain sustainability in this field, companies need to see areas where they can improve by performing performance evaluation. For this purpose, in this study, it is aimed to determine the criteria to be used in the performance evaluation of sustainable supply chain management. In this respect, firstly, the performance criteria of supply chain management and reverse supply chain management studied in the literature are examined separately; these main criteria have been defined by taking into account economic, social and environmental factors. As a result of the literature review, 46 sub-criteria are determined which are in line with the main economic, social and environmental criteria. It is planned to make priority ranking of these criteria and to use the criteria which are obtained at a high rate according to their importance levels in performance evaluation. Representatives and academicians from the sector are asked to score 46 performance evaluation criteria according to their importance level. With the findings obtained, it is aimed to determine the criteria of high importance by performing Pareto Analysis. As a result of the studies carried out, nine new criteria can be added to the literature and a total of 33 criteria have been determined for performance evaluation. The criteria that companies can use for performance evaluation in the field of sustainable supply chain management are finalized and it is aimed to gain value for the sectors to improve themselves.</jats:p>"

This study sought to assess sustainability of community managed piped water schemes developed under the rural WASH program as a model for rural water supply. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in the collection of data. The program developed 33 schemes out of which 36.4% have since broken down. System failure is high amongst diesel and electricity powered schemes compared to solar powered. Alarmingly, all the schemes have water point committees set up and trained with support from the project. The current status-quo therefore reflects a capacity gap amongst the set water point committees. In many cases they have failed to operationalize the water fund, institute water demand management, support and retain pump operatives. Moving forward, the sector therefore needs to adopt a demand responsive approach when targeting schemes for rehabilitation. This will help address structural issues in the management of the schemes like social capital, ownership of the investment and cost recovery. Government should also consider going to scale with the solar powered schemes which are seemingly resilient and compatible with the community based management system.</jats:p>",

It aims to estimate the water needs by 2030, and propose scenarios to move out of the scarce water region classification defined by international organizations. A population of 4.1 million people was defined for year 2030 as a target to provide at least 1,000 m3 of water per capita. As agriculture is the main water consumer in the region, empirical decomposition and optimization methods were used to define the trend line of the principal crops production and to establish the optimum conditions for planted surface reduction and water gain. The results show that by 2030, BC will need a total of 4,105 hm3 of water to be classified as a non-water scarcity region; in 2018, BC had 3,045 hm3 of renewable water per year, therefore 1,060 m3 will be needed. The best option in economic terms to attain this goal was the reduction of croplands in Mexicali with a cost of around 82 million US dollars. Although this option is the best quantitatively, the political and social implications of it are enormous; however, the correct management of the resource in critical conditions will require difficult decisions.</jats:p>",

Nonetheless, this process has become overly complicated due to environmental concerns that lead to policy changes, customer preferences, and business activities. Reverse logistics is an environmentally friendly practice that can be critical in improving the environmental performance of construction operations. This paper examines the perceived role of reverse logistics practices on supply chain performance criteria—for example, cost, quality, time, flexibility, and environment. Semistructured in‐depth interviews were conducted with 15 senior industry experts from South East Queensland, Australia. Interview transcripts were analyzed by coding, categorizing, and identifying the interconnected relationships among concepts. In general, the experts perceive that reverse logistics practices significantly reduce the sourcing cost of materials compared with new materials. When used materials meet industry specifications, they are expected to have a similar performance without affecting the construction time or the overall quality of the project while protecting the environment. Nevertheless, the flexibility is found to be somewhat difficult. It is likely that reverse logistics can be instrumental in construction should the industry uptake be substantial with an emphasis on used material quality and acceptance criteria. Hence, a quantitative analysis is encouraged for future research.</jats:p>",

The analytical tool used is the analysis of supply chain conditions, risks and consequences of dogol shrimp supply chains. The results of this study showed that the process of product flow of the dogol shrimp supply chain in KUD Minasari, Pangandaran Regency involving fishermen, wholesalers, small traders, restaurants and end consumers is quite well related to channeling from fishermen who have not been supported by fishermen's knowledge related to shrimp quality. The dogol shrimp supply chain distribution channel is divided into 8 types of marketing with a significant difference in whether the fish market is involved or not. The marketing channel of dogol shrimp catches in Pangandaran Regency shows that the structure of the second chain with business actors is fishermen → fish auction → large traders → small traders → consumers are more efficient with a marketing margin of Rp. 35,000 / kg or 31.81%, farmer share by 75.87%. The largest market share value of 59.25% is on the 8th channel with restaurants as a marketing agent.</jats:p>"

It is found that while sharing information with a nondisclosure agreement is always valuable, this might not be the case for a disclosure one. In addition, the conditions, where information sharing with the disclosure agreement is beneficial, have been analytically determined.

The physicochemical characteristics of adsorbents were determined using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and specific surface area and the number of hydroxyl groups were calculated. The adsorption behaviors and mechanism of fluoride ions were assessed. The adsorption capability of fluoride ions using Mg-Fe-CH3.0 was greater than that using Mg-Fe-CH5.0. In addition, the amount adsorbed depended on the adsorption temperatures; the adsorption was comparatively less at 5 °C than at 25 °C. Adsorption mechanism of fluoride ions was evaluated by elemental distribution analysis and binding energy. The binding energy of fluorine onto Mg-Fe-CH3.0 and Mg-Fe-CH5.0 could be detected after adsorption. Additionally, it was clear that one of the adsorption mechanisms was related to the ion exchange between fluoride ions and chloride ions in the interlayer space of the Mg-Fe-CH3.0 and Mg-Fe-CH5.0 (correlation coefficient 0.923–0.965). This study illustrates that both Mg-Fe-CH3.0 and Mg-Fe-CH5.0 have a high potential for fluoride ion adsorption from the aqueous phase.</jats:p>",

By doing so, the findings may allow us to identify specific structures and processes that could be improved to facilitate higher quality and more timely care. Methods: Ten hospitals were purposively selected using results from a previously performed national trauma care capacity assessment of hospitals of all levels in Ghana. Five hospitals with low resource availability and 5 hospitals with high resource availability were assessed using the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Logistics Indicators Assessment Tool and stock ledger review. Data were described and stock management practices were correlated with resource availability. Results: There were differences in stock management practices between low and high resource availability hospitals, including frequency of reporting and audit, number of stock-outs on day of assessment (median 9 vs 2 stock-outs, range 3 – 57 vs 0 – 9 stock-outs, respectively; p=0.05), duration of stock-outs (median 171 vs 8 days, range 51 – 1,268 vs 0 – 182 days, respectively; p=0.02), and fewer of up-to-date stock cards (24 vs 31 up-to-date stock cards, respectively; p=0.07). Stock-outs were common even among low-cost, essential resources (e.g., nasal cannulas and oxygen masks, endotracheal tubes, syringes, sutures, sterile gloves). Increased adherence to stock management guidelines and higher percentage of up-to-date stock cards were correlated with higher trauma resource availability scores. However, the variance in trauma resource availability scores was poorly explained by these individual factors or when analyzed in a multivariate regression model (r<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>=0.72; p value for each covariate between 0.17 – 0.34). Conclusions: Good supply chain and stock management practices are correlated with high trauma care resource availability. The findings from this study demonstrate several opportunities to improve stock management practices, particularly at low resource availability hospitals.</jats:p>"

Random utility models are applied to model the choice among three care arrangements: receiving inpatient care in an institutional setting (e.g., nursing home), receiving outpatient care in the community, and living in the community without receiving inpatient or outpatient care. The main findings are: Higher inpatient service supply increases the probability that older persons leave the community and enter institutional LTC. Higher outpatient service supply increases the probability that older persons choose to receive outpatient care in the community instead of entering institutional LTC. The results suggest that policy makers must consider the county-level LTC service supply when designing equitable LTC systems that meet the needs of older persons in a cost-effective way.</jats:p>",

The characterization of raw biomasses and also biochars were performed using TGA-DTG, FT-IR, BET, SEM, partial and elemental analysis techniques. The optimum conditions were determined by investigating the effect of adsorption parameters (initial concentration, temperature, adsorbent amount, pH, contact time and mixing speed) for efficient removal of copper ions from aqueous solution by batch adsorption experiments carried out under different conditions. The highest adsorption efficiencies were recorded as 82 and 86% respectively for hazelnut and walnut shell biochars at pH 4, Co = 15 ppm, adsorbent dosage = 3 g/L and mixing speed = 600 rpm. Experimental results showed that the adsorption efficiency for copper ions increased with the increase of temperature (T = 45 °C) in studies only using biochar obtained from hazelnut shell. While the time of equilibrium in the aqueous solution containing copper ions was determined to be 75 min for walnut shell char, this duration was 30 min for hazelnut shell char. The experimental results were investigated in terms of Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models. Together with the calculated thermodynamic parameters, the adsorption mechanism was explained. In order to determine the kinetic model of the adsorption process, the experimental data were applied to pseudo first-order, pseudo second-order and intra-particle diffusion models, and the model constants were investigated.</jats:p>",

The experiment was conducted in September and October 2016, in the Experimental Apiary of the Study Group on Bees of the Piaui Semiarid, located in Picos (PI). The hives were standardized in terms of population size and amount of food. To that end, a data sheet was filled out and the brood area measured (cm²) at the beginning and end of the experiment. Graduated 500 mL Boardman entrance feeders filled with potable water were installed to measure daily water consumption during the experiment. There was a significant variation in water use by the bees, with average daily consumption of 74.6 mL ± 25.5. With respect to colony development, there was an increase in the number of frames and brood area. Internal water supply can be recommended as a suitable management technique for bee colonies during the dry season in the semiarid.</jats:p>"

The system is designed to develop an optimal system to reduce the noise levels in a classroom which are far above the recommended value of 35dB by WHO in an engineering institution designed according to the Common Public Works Department(CPWD) norms while also bridging the gap between the industry and the consumer. The iterations were designed on fusion 360 and tetrahedron meshing was done in ANSYS after defining the boundaries of geometry of CAD design. The inlet velocities varied as per the different diffuser size, shape and angles. The inlet velocity lies in the range of 1.5m/s to 3m/s. After setting up the solver and choosing k-omega SST model for solving, calculation was performed for 3000 iterations using hybrid initialization to reduce the residuals as much as possible for the results to converge for accurate results. Material properties of aluminum and properties of the fluid were set. Among different groups, results based on different shapes showed that circular duct displayed gradual pressure and velocity drop at the lower bend of the wall than in the case of rectangle or square. While, in case of duct with different sizes, as size of duct increased, frictional losses increased, while pressure drop, noise levels and eddy current formation significantly reduced. In case of different bend radius to width ratio(r/W), as r/W increased, eddy formation and boundary layer separation, pressure drop, turbulence and noise levels decreased. Therefore, the study showed that a circular duct, with a diameter of 15in having r/W ratio of 2 would significantly reduce the sound levels and be the optimum solution for the classroom and adding 2-3 vanes would further improve the performance of the system and maximize the required effort.</jats:p>"

Taking Zhengzhou’s central city as an example, we combine the real-time human movement data provided by the Baidu Heat Map, which indicates the density of mobile phones, with vector overlays of different kinds of green space. We used the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to estimate differentials in green space usage between weekdays and weekends, utilizing the location and the density of the aggregation of people with powered-up mobile phones. Compared with weekends, the aggregation of people in urban green spaces on workdays tends to vary more in time and be more concentrated in space, while the highest usage is more stable on weekends. More importantly, the percentage of weekday green space utilization is higher in small parks and green strips in the city, with the density increasing in those small areas, while the green space at a greater distance to the city center is underutilized. This study validates the potential of applying Baidu Heat Map data to provide a dynamic perspective of green space use, and highlights the need for more green space in city centers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The challenges of global economies foster supply chains to have to increase their processes of collaboration and dependence between their nodes, generating an increase in the level of vulnerability to possible impacts and interruptions in their operations that may affect their sustainability. This has developed an emerging area of interest in supply chain management, considering resilience management as a strategic capability of companies, and causing an increase in this area of research. Additionally, supply chains should deal with the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social dimensions) by incorporating the three types of objectives in their strategy. Thus, there is a need to integrate both resilience and sustainability in supply chain management to increase competitiveness. In this paper, a systematic literature review is undertaken to analyze resilience management and its connection to increase supply chain sustainability. In the review, 232 articles published from 2000 to February 2020 in peer-reviewed journals in the Scopus and ScienceDirect databases are analyzed, classified, and synthesized. With the results, this paper develops a conceptual framework that integrates the fundamental elements for analyzing, measuring, and managing resilience to increase sustainability in the supply chain. Finally, conclusions, limitations, and future research lines are exposed.</jats:p>"

The profit level of manufacturer under the manufacturer-led structure is not conducive to the manufacturer-led structure due to other structures, but is conducive to the improvement of the profit level of manufacturer under other structures. Manufacturer’s equity concern behaviour is beneficial to the improvement of manufacturer’s utility, in which the equity concern factor should be kept at a certain level under Nash vertical structure.

The aim is to analyze the trade-off between the objectives of cost, time, and emissions and how these decisions are impacted by the selection of different available machines. A number of solution approaches are tested on a case study from the tire industry. The results suggest the improved performance of the hybrid heuristic and the importance of controlling disruption in a closed-loop supply chain network.

While a movement towards agile, networked supply chain models had been in consideration for many firms prior to the outbreak, the pandemic highlights issues inherent in supply chains that employ concentrated production. We examined the current state of fashion supply chains, risks that have arisen historically and recently, and existing risk mitigation methods. We found that while lean supply chain management is primarily favored for its cost and waste reduction advantages, the structure is limited by the lack of supply chain transparency that results as well as the increasing demand volatility observed even before the COVID-19 outbreak. Although this problem might exist in the agile supply chain, agile supply chains combat this by focusing on enhancing communication and buyer-supplier relationships to improve information exchange. However, this structure also entails an associated increase in inventory and inventory costs. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused supply and demand disruptions which have resonating effects on supply chain activities and management, indicating a need to build flexibility to mitigate epidemic and demand risks. To address this, several strategies that firms can adopt to control for such risks are outlined and key areas for further research are identified which consider parties both upstream and downstream of the fashion supply chain.</jats:p>"

Emerging processing technologies (high-pressure, pulsed electric fields, ohmic heating, ultrasound) and novel food systems (cultured biomass, 3-D bioprinting, cyber-physical chains) try to challenge the existing chains by developing potentially more nutritious and sustainable food solutions. However, new food systems rely on low technology readiness levels and estimation of their potential future benefits or drawbacks is a complex task mostly due to the lack of integrated data. The research is aimed for the development of conceptual guidelines of food production system structuring as cyber-physical systems. The study indicates that cyber-physical nature of modern food is a key for the engineering of more nutritious and sustainable paths for novel food systems. Implementation of machine learning methods for the collection, integration, and analysis of data associated with biomass production and processing on different levels from molecular to global, leads to the precise analysis of food systems and estimation of upscaling benefits, as well as possible negative rebound effects associated with societal attitude. Moreover, such data-integrated assessment systems allow transparency of chains, integration of nutritional and environmental properties, and construction of personalized nutrition technologies.</jats:p>",

For this aim, we propose a network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) model to reflect the internal structure of networks in efficiency evaluation. For many of the real-world performance evaluation problems, data of inputs and outputs are available, and their ratio conveys important messages to managers. However, conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models are no longer able to deal with ratio data. This paper aims to extend the NDEA models with the ratio data (NDEA-R) to evaluate the performance of SCs. Therefore, given the internal structure of a supply chain, relationships among different divisions of an SC are determined under two assumptions of free-links and fixed-links. Applicability of the proposed models is illustrated by evaluating supply chain of 19 hospitals in Iran over 6 months. By performing sensitivity analysis, we find out that the overall efficiency score of decision-making units (DMUs) under the fixed link assumption is greater than or equal to the overall efficiency of DMUs under free link assumption. Our proposed model overcomes the underestimation of efficiency and pseudo-inefficiency scores.</jats:p>",

During rifting and partial breakup sedimentary basins formed that record the changing regional sediment supply. The onshore and offshore stratigraphy of Central West Greenland outlines the presence of a major fluvial system that existed during the Cretaceous and was later redirected in the Early Cenozoic by the formation of the West Greenland Igneous Province. Hydrological analysis of Greenland's isostatically balanced basement topography outlines two major drainage systems that likely flowed across Greenland prior to the onset of glaciation and emptied into the Sisimiut Basin within the Davis Strait, offshore West Greenland. The course of the northern drainage system suggests that it initially flowed NW into the Cretaceous/Palaeocene Nuussuaq Basin, before being redirected SW around the West Greenland Igneous Province in the Mid-Palaeocene. Moreover, characteristics of these two drainage systems suggest they acted as a single larger fluvial system, prior to the onset of glaciation, that was likely the primary source of sediment across Central West Greenland throughout the Cretaceous and Palaeogene. This scenario provides a greater understanding of the West Greenland margin's late Cenozoic evolution, which differs from previous interpretations that hypothesize a period of considerable post-rift tectonism and uplift. This work highlights the importance of large pre-glacial drainage systems across North Atlantic passive margins and their relevance when studying post-rift stratigraphy in rifted margin settings.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p content-type=\"supplementary-material\">\n            <jats:bold>Supplementary material:</jats:bold>\n            Isostatic modelling, hydrological analysis and chi mapping is available at:\n            <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" specific-use=\"dataset is-supplemented-by\" xlink:href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5050146\">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5050146</jats:ext-link>\n          </jats:p>",

However, concerns have been increasingly raised that relying on the potential of BECCS to achieve negative emissions could result in delayed reductions in gross CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions, with consequent high risk of overshooting global temperature targets. We focus on two particular issues: the carbon efficiency and payback time of bioenergy use in BECCS and the potential constraints on the supply of bioenergy. The simplistic vision of BECCS is that 1 tonne of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> captured in the growth of biomass equates to 1 tonne of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> sequestered geologically, but this cannot be the case as CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is emitted by variable amounts during the lifecycle from crop establishment to sequestration below ground in geological formations. The deployment of BECCS is ultimately reliant on the availability of sufficient, sustainably sourced, biomass. The two most important factors determining this supply are land availability and land productivity. The upper bounds of the area estimates required correspond to more than the world's harvested land for cereal production. To achieve these estimates of biomass availability requires the rapid evolution of a multitude of technological, social, political and economic factors. Here, we question whether, because of the limited sustainable supply of biomass, BECCS should continue to be considered the dominant NET in IPCC and other scenarios achieving the Paris targets, or should it be deemed no longer fit for purpose?</jats:p>",

This study aims at describing the precedence between the VHS graduates and the businesses/industrial sector (BS/IS) portraying from the regional potential perspectives. The research data was collected from documents and survey forms distributed to (BS/IS) within the research population. The document analysis was employed to collect information on programs offered at VHS, existing VHS students enrollment, and the value of Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) in studied provinces. An online survey was distributed to all VHS graduates and BS/IS employers. The content validity was carried out prior actual study to ensure the validity of the instrument. A descriptive analysis was performed to gather information pertaining to developed research objectives. The precedence of the academic programs with the GRDP was determined based on 5% of criteria differences. The results found that there is a misalignment between the academic programs and the VHS students enrollment towards the region job potentials in each province in Indonesia. In addition, the research also found that the competency of VHS graduates related to the theoretical knowledge, the job characteristics, and the workforce skills were at moderate level. The implication of the study offers salient notion on minimizing the precedence that occurs between the supply and demand in the form of graduates supply to workforce and at the same time, fulfilling the workforce requirements demand by the industries. It is suggested on the capabilities of educational institutions in tweaking into demand-driven approach in making sure the academic program is relevant and sustainable.</jats:p>"

This interest lies primarily in understanding the trends, benefits, and implications of AM technology on supply chain (SC) and logistics, as it requires reconfiguring the supply chain based on a distributed manufacturing strategy, closer to the consumer market, with shorter lead times and less raw materials. It still is an emerging field, and needs further study. Therefore, a better understanding of main trends will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge about AM technology and its consolidation. This article seeks to investigate the implications of AM, as an advanced manufacturing model, on SC and logistics. A four-step research method was used to develop a systematic literature review and a bibliometric analysis on the AM implications in SC and logistics. The main implications of AM on SC and logistics were classified in seven key issues gathered as result of the literature review. Additionally, bibliometric study allowed understanding researches major trends in this field. The key aspects highlighted and characterized as major implications of AM on SC and logistic are: supply chain complexity reduction; more flexible logistics and inventory management; better spreading and popularization of mass customization; decentralization of manufacturing; greater design freedom and rapid prototyping; increasing of resource efficiency and sustainability, and the need to have clearly defined legal and safety aspects.</jats:p>"

The two case-study villages (Pongluek and Bangkloy) have experienced severe draughts in recent decades, and, therefore, water supply has become a major issue. A stand-alone 15.36 kW solar power and a 15 kW solar submersible pump were installed along with the input power generated by solar panels supported by four solar trackers. The aim is to lift water at the static head of 64 and 48 m via a piping length of 400 m for each village to be stored in 1000 and 1800 m3 reservoirs at an average of 300 and 400 m3 per day, respectively, for Pongluek and Bangkloy villages. The case study results show that the real costs of electricity generated by SWSS using solar photovoltaic (PV) systems intergraded with the solar tracking system yield better performance and are more advantageous compared with the non-tracking system. This study illustrates how system integration has been employed. System design and commercially available simulation predictions are elaborated. Construction, installation, and field tests for SWSS are discussed and highlighted. Performances of the SWSS in different weather conditions, such as sunny, cloudy, and rainy days, were analysed to make valuable suggestions for higher efficiency of the integrated solar water supply systems.</jats:p>"

Besides the design of new networks according to the principles of the 4th and 5th generation district heating, operational aspects may significantly contribute to improve the efficiency of existing networks from both economic and environmental standpoints. In the present work, computer simulations using a district heating network model (NeMo) were carried out to investigate the load shifting potential offered by the thermal capacitance of the water volume enclosed in the network pipelines. The average return temperature is increased before the occurrence of the peak load by adjusting the flow rate according to the forecasted heat demand for the upcoming hours. The effectiveness of this control strategy was demonstrated for the district heating network of Verona, proving that the peak load can be significantly reduced, especially during middle season. Finally, the load shifting strategy was used to allow a change in the heat production mix, thereby reducing the primary energy consumption of the main heat supply station during the considered period.</jats:p>",

To accomplish this vision, female labour participation is needed  as the female population constitutes almost  half  of Malaysia’s total population. However, female labour participation rate is way lower than Malaysia’s overall labour force participation rate.The relatively low female labour participation rate can be a barrier to Malaysia’s economic development and thus the realization of its goal of a high income nation.Therefore, this paper makes an attempt to examine empirically the  long-run causal association  among female  labour  force  participation, economic growth,  education,  and  fertility  rate.  The  interrelationships  among  the  variables  are examined   using   the   bounds   test   and Toda-Yamamoto    granger    non-causality methodology. The result of the study indicates a strong evidence of long-run relationship among the variables. Besides, we have found a significant inverted-U-shaped association linking the female labour force participation to the economic  growth in Malaysia. The results  of  Granger  causality  tests further  confirm  that  there  is  a strong  evidence  of bidirectional  causality  from  education  to  economic  growth as  well  as female  labour participation.

The development of energy supply networks is strongly correlated with the economics of energy sources as well as ecological and socio-political issues. However, the energy supply network is often distant from the social perspective. This paper therefore combines examination of perceptions and awareness of general public (web-based questionnaire) and top energy experts (a Delphi survey) on the energy supply network and identifies their potential integration in energy supply decision making processes. The results showed that public should be better informed as well as integrated into designing energy supply network as the prosumers gain power and the energy suppliers will no longer dominate the market. Public actors are ready to shape sustainable energy supply and also willing to pay 5.8% more for a sustainable energy supply. The majority are prepared to invest in renewable energy supply network close to their place of residence. Another result is that the public is calling for a shift in priority towards more sustainable and socially friendlier energy supply rather than focusing mainly on the economic and technical perspectives.</jats:p>"

The tendencies of researches of rough set theory and neural networks methods are generalized and potential spheres of their appliance in management of supply chains which haven’t been investigated yet are defined.  Conclusions. Despite the long history of AI, the potential of AI as a means of solving complex issues and finding info in the field of SC hasn’t been fully used in the past especially in the Ukrainian scientific literature. In particular, some groups of AI technologies, such as expert systems and GAs, are increasingly used to solve management issues, including inventory management, procurement, location planning, shipment coordination between contractors, and routing / planning issues. Further study of the issue requires consideration of the use of other AI methods in supply chain management, such as fuzzy logic and agent modeling and recognition of their practical aspects.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Timely delivery is the major issue in Fast Moving Consumer Good (FMCG) since it depends on the lead time which is stochastic and long due to several reasons; e.g., delay in processing orders and transportation. Stochastic lead time can cause inventory inaccuracy where echelons have to keep high product stocks. Such performance inefficiency reflects the existence of the bullwhip effect (BWE), which is a common challenge in supply chain networks. Thus, this paper studies the impact of stochastic lead time on the BWE in a multi-product and multi-echelon supply chain of FMCG industries under two information-sharing strategies; i.e., decentralized and centralized. The impact was measured using a discrete event simulation approach, where a simulation model of a four-tier supply chain whose echelons adopt the same lead time distribution and continuous review inventory policy was developed and simulated. Different lead time cases under the information-sharing strategies were experimented and the BWE was measured using the standard deviation of demand ratios between echelons. The results show that the BWE cannot be eliminated but can be reduced under centralized information sharing. All the research analyses help the practitioners in FMCG industries get insight into the impact of sharing demand information on the performance of a supply chain when lead time is stochastic.</jats:p>"

Background and Objectives: Scenario modeling can be used to provide harmonized and quantitative information on the impacts of various zoning decisions on the provision of various ecosystem services. In this study, we explored the effects of land-use zoning decisions on the provision of roundwood and energy wood, carbon stock of living tree components, berry yields, scenic beauty and recreation. Materials and Methods: Three alternative forest scenarios were formulated in terms of restrictions on forest management for already established land-use zones by the provinces in Finland. These data were integrated with the National Forest Inventory (NFI) plot data for forest dynamics modeling. Results: In Finland, 9% of the forest land was protected and 9% was under restricted forest management due to legislative decisions, forest owners’ decisions, or regional land use plans in 2016. These established zoning decisions resulted in an estimated 17% smaller roundwood and energy wood removals per year in 2016–2025 compared to the estimated wood removals in the scenario without any restrictions. The decrease in annual gross stumpage earnings was EUR 775 million per year. The carbon stock of living tree components in 2025 was 12% larger than in the scenario without any restrictions. Bilberry yield increased due to the restrictions considered in our study, while the restrictions had only a slight effect on cowberry yield at province and country levels. The restrictions increased the recreation value, particularly in Lapland, but only slightly affected scenic beauty at province and country levels. Conclusions: Scenario analyses support informed decision making and the balancing of different forest uses. Harmonized translation of restrictions and the use of standard indicators to model the impacts also support comparisons between the regions.</jats:p>"

A frazil ice jam assessment method was developed based on project design conditions to ensure the risk level of frazil ice jam. A frazil ice jam risk assessment indicator system was incorporated into the method that included three first-level indicators, such as ice production, special hydraulic structure and basic design parameters, and 17 third-level indicators for calculation analysis. Then, a standard assessment system was proposed, and an analytic hierarchy process method was used to determine the magnitude of the frazil ice jam risk. Finally, the method was used to study the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (MRSNWDP) from the Guyunhe to Beijumahe canals. The results showed that all of the canal pools had frazil ice jam risk levels between III and IV, of which approximately 15% of the pools have risk level IV, and the canal pools with risk level IV were reported to have ice jam incidents, and it suggested that the ice condition prediction, engineering operation process in winter, engineering measures for disaster reduction and emergency plan refinement need to be strengthened for the pools with risk level IV. Therefore, the method of frazil ice jam risk assessment based on project design conditions can perform well in both the built-operating stage and the design stage of water transfer projects. Frazil ice jam risk prevention is a task through the full life-cycle of water project construction, it is necessary to do risk assessment work at design stage, and the work should be written into the national standard.</jats:p>",

Special data processing has been carried out in the course of daily monitoring of concentration levels for ammonium, nitrogen, nitrites, and nitrates in the Siverskyi Donets river at the water intake site, and downstream, in the water mass having passed through the facilities of the water treatment complex \"Donets\". Based on the above studies, a positive correlation was revealed (with a correlation coefficient of 0.64-0.93) between the activity of nitrification processes in the natural reservoir and the activity of nitrification inside the water treatment facilities. The environmental outcomes of the nitrification processes inside the water treatment facilities might be dangerous. Experimental studies have proven that the zeolite backfill of the rapid filters installed at the water treatment complex is the most favorable medium for immobilization of the nitrifying bacteria in comparison with other backfills of silica sand or anthracite coal, therefore it is quite suitable for the development of nitrification process. The studies have shown that nitrites do not accumulate in water after water treatment procedures, therefore, the rate of phase I nitrification inside these facilities does not exceed the rate of the second phase. To clean the filtering backfill of these microorganisms, a conventional technological wash is fairly enough.</jats:p>"

This study aims to analyze the applicable conditions of incentive contract for knowledge sharing and provide guidance for core enterprises to formulate incentive contracts to promote knowledge sharing between member enterprises. Based on evolutionary game theory, an incentive model of knowledge sharing is developed. By solving the model, it is shown that the preconditions for applying incentive contract in industrial construction supply chain are that output capacity of knowledge sharing is higher than the cost, and incentive coefficient is more than the ratio of costs to outputs; and if knowledge sharing is implemented in industrial construction supply chain, the conditions should be satisfied, which are that the output capacity of knowledge sharing is higher than the sum of cost and risk, and the incentive intensity is higher than the ratio of the sum of cost and risk to the output capacity. These conclusions help us to formulate reasonable incentive mechanism.</jats:p>",

The research shows that the calculated results for the 7 types of methods differ greatly and considers that the cost and ecological service value methods are appropriate. Using this as the basic method to consider introducing market value of water resources, internal income of water source area, and government financial support for method improvement, the results show that the improved methods can reduce the gap between the per capita income of the water source area and the reference area, increase the satisfaction of both the water receiving area and the water source area, and provide support for overall socioeconomic development.</jats:p>",

For each domain, we summed all items and created a standardized state‐level stringency measure as: (X‐mean)/SD. For each state, the standardized values were added to create an overall stringency score. Psychometric properties of the individual and overall stringency measures were tested using factor analysis and Cronbach α.</jats:p><jats:p>Descriptive statistics, mapping, and OLS regression analyses were employed to examine 5 measures of stringency (overall and 4 domains). Based on literature reviews, we identified 5 state‐level independent variables: AL average monthly cost; number of AL beds/1000 people age 75+; % aged Medicaid beneficiaries using AL; Medicaid spending on AL services; and % nursing homes (NH) with 4‐5 star quality on deficiencies.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Population Studied</jats:title><jats:p>Descriptive analyses included data on 50 states and DC, while 47 states were included in OLS regressions.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Principal Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Overall, 10 states had high (&gt;1SD) and 5 states had low (&lt;1SD) stringency. While only 1/3 of states with high overall stringency exhibited similar levels of stringency across all domains, 2/3 of states with low stringency remained consistently low. State variations were highest in regulations for medication management (18 states scored high and 13 low), and lowest for staffing/training (8 high and 7 low). Regression results showed statistically significant (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) negative associations between AL cost and AL beds/1000 for all domains except staffing/training.

For example, in states with higher Medicaid AL spending, regulation on AL staffing/training is stronger. AL investors may react to overall state regulatory environment as lower AL bed supplies are found in states with stronger regulations. High stringency may influence AL providers to maintain lower case‐mix acuity among residents, which may be more congruent with the ALs’ ability to provide services, and in turn results in lower monthly costs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Implications for Policy or Practice</jats:title><jats:p>State variations in AL regulations may influence service supply and cost as well as resident case‐mix and care quality.

A water supply systems (WSS) assessment matrix was designed as a tool for assessing WSS in low-income countries; with selected urban, peri-urban and rural Nigerian communities as case studies. Sustainability of the WSS was assessed through established criteria against five sustainability factors. Sanitary surveys were conducted to evaluate the risks associated with the WSS using sanitary inspection forms, through which the sanitary risk scores (SRS) were derived. For sustainability, the WSS were ranked as Very High, High, Medium and Low Sustainability, and for SRS as Very High, High, Intermediate and Low Risk. A Sustainability and Risk Assessment Matrix (SRAM) was designed using sustainability evaluation and risk assessment for the WSS. The WSS in the rural areas are more ‘Secure’ than those in urban and peri-urban towns, and boreholes are more ‘Secure’ than hand-dug wells, but none of the public water points are scored ‘Secure’. The paper concludes that SRAM provides a cost-effective method of classification and may serve as a pre-water quality and source sustainability assessment tool, especially in low-income countries, as part of the measures to achieve water security.</jats:p>",

Thus, the adoption of the CE concept in the supply chain becomes critical. However, due to the complex nature of processes/activities in the circular supply chain (CSC), managing risk has become a priority to avoid disruption. In current literature, no discussion has been conducted on how to analyse the risks in the context of CSC. Therefore, to fill this literature gap, this study concentrates on identifying and analysing the risks to promote effective circular initiatives in supply chains in the context of the manufacturing industry, thus minimising the negative environmental impact. A total of 31 risks were identified through an extensive literature review and discussions with experts. A grey‐based decision‐making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is applied by incorporating the experts' knowledge to compute prominence and cause/effect scores to develop an interrelationship map. Finally, a vulnerability matrix for risk categories is developed using the average of prominence and cause/effect scores of risks. The results show that transparent process is the most prominent risk and branding is the least significant risk. By using the average prominence and cause/effect score, a risk category, namely, financial risk, is identified as most vulnerable to CSC. These findings will help industry managers not only to prepare business strategies in the adoption of CE initiatives in supply chains by eliminating risks but also in minimising negative environmental impact.</jats:p>",

However, previous studies on crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) requirements of pigs were mostly based on the diets with antibiotics. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of CP supply on growth performance, body composition and tissue deposition for piglets fed diets with or without antibiotics. <jats:bold>Methods: </jats:bold>A total of 250 newly weaned piglets were randomly assigned to 1 of 10 dietary treatments (5 replicate pens per treatment with 5 animals per pen) in a 5 × 2 factorial arrangement with 5 CP levels (16, 18, 20, 22, 24 %) and 2 antibiotic supplementations (with or without antibiotics). Treatment diets were fed for 14 d to test treatment effects, and then a nursery diet (19% CP) without antibiotics was fed to all piglets until they had an average body weight of 25 kg to determine if carryover effects of treatment diets existed. An additional 5 piglets at the start were slaughtered to determine initial body composition. At the end of each period, 1 pig close to the average BW of each pen was slaughtered to determine body composition and tissue deposition.<jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>Increasing dietary CP level linearly improved (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain:feed (G:F) during the treatment period, while antibiotics tended to improve ADG of piglets (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.10). The ADG during the carryover period tended to be improved (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.10) with the increase of dietary CP level, but there was no difference in ADG during the entire nursery period (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.10). Neither CP level nor antibiotic supplementation affected (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.10) the incidence of diarrhea in each period. With the increase of dietary CP level, weights of fasted body, empty body, eviscerated carcass, and organs at d 14 were linearly improved (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). Neither CP level nor antibiotic supplementation had a significant effect on the physical body composition of pigs at the end of the nursery period (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05). Body protein content at d 14 linearly improved (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) with increasing CP level, whereas body ash content, lipid:protein and ash:protein ratio linearly decreased (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). Increasing dietary CP level resulted in a greater (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) deposition rates of body water and protein during the treatment period, while antibiotics tended to increase (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.10). There was no effect (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05) of CP level or antibiotic supplementation on the chemical body composition at the end of the nursery period. However, increasing CP level quadratically improved (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) deposition rates of body water, protein and lipid during the carryover period as well as deposition rates of protein, lipid and ash during the entire nursery period. According to the model with the minimum AIC, the CP requirement based on ADG was 23.01 and 22.65%, and based on protein deposition (PD) was 24.00 and 23.29% for antibiotic-free diet and antibiotic diet, respectively. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Increasing dietary CP level increased the growth performance and protein deposition of piglets during either the treatment period or the carryover period. The CP requirement for piglets with high health status fed antibiotic-free diet was slightly higher than those fed antibiotic diet.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In lisianthus cultivars, the occurrence of tipburn is known to adversely affect quality and yield. However, information concerning the responses of tipburn incidence to different levels of Ca is limited. In addition, only a few studies have investigated the effect of potassium (K) concentration on Ca acquisition and distribution in lisianthus. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated tipburn incidence in three lisianthus cultivars (Umi honoka (UH), Reina white (RW), and Voyage peach (VP)) and the Ca and K concentrations in them under different concentrations of Ca supply (40, 80, and 120 ppm). These cultivars exhibited different responses to different concentrations of Ca supply. Tipburn was not observed in UH. In RW, tipburn incidence and severity significantly decreased with an increase in nutritional Ca concentration, because the Ca concentration in the tips of the top leaves significantly increased with Ca concentration. By contrast, in VP, tipburn incidence under all treatments was 100%, and there was no significant difference in the Ca concentration in the tips of the top leaves among the treatments, but the total Ca concentration significantly increased. VP was the only cultivar that significantly acquired and accumulated more Ca in the roots with an increase in nutritional Ca concentration. Overall, excessive Ca accumulation in the roots under high-Ca conditions inhibits the distribution of Ca to the tips of the top leaves and eventually manifests as tipburn in the cultivar. In addition, our results suggested that the content ratio of K in the nutrient solutions did not prevent Ca acquisition and distribution in lisianthus cultivars and that the K concentration has a negligible effect on the occurrence of tipburn.</jats:p>"

To improve the reliability of distribution systems with distributed generation, this paper proposes a two-stage network restoration reliability assessment method considering island division and network reconfiguration. In the process of network fault recovery, firstly, distributed generation is used to supply power to the load point of power loss, islanding of the network after fault with the aim of minimizing power loss. Then the residual network is reconstructed and optimized by considering the network loss and voltage quality. Finally, the improved ieee33 node network is simulated based on Monte Carlo simulation method. The results show that this method is superior and can realize real-time load transfer, reduce power loss, improve the reliability of DS and the economy of system operation, Considering the continuous change of the network structure, the running state of the system can be described more accurately.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To sustainably use water resources, it is important to quantify water availability in a certain region. Due to climate change, population increase, and economic development, water demand increases continuously. Consequently, the difference between supply and demand of water becomes a significant issue, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. In this research, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model has been applied to the Guadalupe river basin, to assess supply and demand analysis of water resources in this area, specifically for the irrigation of agricultural crops and municipal uses. From the land use, soil type, and terrain slope maps, 763 Hydrostatic Release Units (HRU) were estimated, distributed in the diverse relief types making up the basin, featured by mountains, hills, plateaus, plains, and valleys. For the crop area, 159 HRU were found with the three slope classification types, where 57 HRU represent 91% of the cultivated area on slopes, from 0 to 15%, located in the Ojos Negros and Guadalupe Valleys. The Soil Conservation Service method (SCS) was used to estimate the average monthly runoff and soil moisture content. As a result, water resource parameters related to the supply were determined with this, e.g., runoff, aquifer recharge, flow, infiltration, and others. Crop coefficient values (Kc) were used to determine crop evapotranspiration (ETc), to estimate the water demand of these for each month, using the multi-year monthly average reference evapotranspiration (ETo) calculated with the SWAT model. Overall good performance was obtained considering average monthly discharges data from the Agua Caliente gauging station. The model was calibrated, modifying the parameters chosen according to sensitivity analysis: SCS curve number, base-flow factor, ground-flow delay, and the threshold for return-flow occurrence. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool–Calibration and Uncertainty Programs SWAT-CUP has different goodness-of-fit indicators for the model e.g., determination coefficient (R2), standard deviation of the measured data (RSR), Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE), and others. Multiple iterations were performed, resulting in a ratio between the root mean square error and the standard deviation of the measured data (RSR) of 0.61, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.70, and a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 0.63. A supply–demand analysis of the volume generated by the runoff from the basin was performed using the method of estimating useful volume for a reservoir. It is observed in these results that only positive deviations were obtained, implying that runoff in this basin is not enough to meet monthly demand. Finally, the need to establish actions to ensure water management efficiency is highlighted, both for irrigation of agricultural crops and for supply to the region population.</jats:p>"

The results show that when the supply of electrical and construction engineers peaked, their earnings dropped relative to a comparison group of chemical engineers, which Aalborg University did not supply at the time. Hence, we conclude that even the earnings of engineers, who are in high demand, are susceptible to supply effects.</jats:p>",

Formal seed sector interventions alone are not delivering the crop portfolio or achieving the social and geographic breadth needed, and the paper argues for focus on informal seed channels and particularly on traders who move ‘potential seed’ (informal or local seed) even to high stress areas. This paper provides the first in-depth analysis on potential seed trader types and actions, drawing on data collected on 287 traders working in 10 African countries. The research delves into four themes: the types and hierarchies of traders; the technical ways traders manage seed using 11 core practices; the price differential of +50% of potential (local) seed over grain, and the pivotal roles which traders play in remote and crisis contexts. Traders are the backbone of smallholder seed security and need to be engaged, not ignored, in development and relief efforts. An action framework for leveraging seed trader skills is presented, with the paper addressing possible legal and donor constraints for engaging such market actors more fully.</jats:p>"

Four farms with established high <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> spp. seroprevalence were selected, and 16 sows in each farrowing group were selected over six farrowing cycles for the feeding experiment (n=368). One half (n=184) of the sows were fed a conventional feed following official nutrient recommendations concerning energy, amino acids and minerals when they entered the farrowing pen. The other half (n=184) received 1.25 kg of a test feed daily containing fibre rich cereals (barley, oats), a fibre component (soy husks) and potassium diformate in addition to the conventional feed until two days <jats:italic>post-partum</jats:italic>. Blood samples were taken from two light and two heavy piglets aged 2 d in each litter (n=1,469) and at the end of rearing (approximately nine weeks old; average body weight of 25 kg; n=588). In the test-fed group, piglet immunocrit value (as a measure of immunoglobulin transfer) was significantly improved (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.0219; K:0.1226±0.0437; V: 0.1278±0.0406). A moderate correlation (r=0.40935; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.0001) was found between immunocrit value and <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> spp. antibodies at 2 d old. There was no correlation between immunocrit value and <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> spp. antibodies at the end of the rearing period (r=0.09914), when the pigs were around nine weeks of age. Despite better colostrum supply, the animals in the test group did not show a significantly lower prevalence of <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> spp. seroprevalence (test group optical density (OD) 9.8000±17.4954%; control group OD 8.9486±14.2426%; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.5344) at nine weeks of age. It could be shown that the colostrum supply can be optimised by providing sows with extra feed. The moderate correlation between immunocrit and <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> spp. antibodies on the second day of life suggests that measuring antibodies by rapid, cost effective ELISA could be a practical tool to for the estimation of colostrum supply and the corresponding health of piglets. A suspected effect of reduced colostrum supply on the <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> spp. seroprevalence at the end of piglet rearing was not detectable. Other effects (e.g. hygiene) seem to be more significant.</jats:p>",

The main findings of the study underscore the relevance of the rural communities in developing a supply chain based on biodiversity as well as the importance of the relationships among the tiers to implement a sustainable business model. The company relies on high‐quality products associated with environmental development. Currently, biodiversity suppliers account for 80% circa of natural raw materials, the so‐called biodiversity asset, which represents the core of the sustainable business model of the company. The findings can be generalized by helping other supply chains to develop and implement sustainable business models supported by biodiversity. Such type of a model can help companies achieve expressive business performance and, at the same time, social relevance to peripheral or vulnerable rural communities.</jats:p>",

However, globalization affects various uncertainties and risks that may limit the performance of supply chains. Research indicates that models that incorporate uncertainties and risks will help to improve the resilience of global supply chains. In the era of technology, we experience the abundance of textual data from various web-media resources related to companies, which can be deployed to understand the impact of risks on the chain. Accordingly, this study aims to utilize textual data collected from news articles and earnings call transcripts to assess the vulnerability of the suppliers and the chain. Among many, we considered supply chain resource limits as a subcomponent of vulnerability and collected textual data associated with its sub-factors. Then, we proposed an integrated factor analysis and Analytical Network Process (ANP) method to model the company’s supply chain resource limits index. Specifically, factor analysis was used to determine the latent constructs of the variables that are grouped under resource limits and their correlations. This latent construct and correlations were then applied as the interdependencies among variables in the ANP to discover the final importance weights of the variables in terms of supply chain resource limits. The results of the study showed that the shortages of capacity, components, and energy supply are the most critical sub-factors. The company’s supply chain resource limits index (SCRLI) can be further calculated to assist decision-makers of an enterprise in supply chain configuration design, and improve the supply chain resilience.</jats:p>",

The observations were carried out monthly in the water area and in the closing section of the reservoir, located in the Zhigulevsky dam area. The estimation of temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of the reservoir water quality is given. It was established that in the summer, during the period of cyanobacteria mass development, biological pollution of the reservoir is observed, the water quality deteriorates by smell, color, pH, and dissolved oxygen content. The content of dissolved organic and toxic substances increases, and the concentration of nutrients, on the contrary, decreases. With a limited concentration of phosphates in the water of the reservoir, the cyanobacteria mass development process stops. In the period of water quality deterioration in the source of water supply in large Volga cities, the problems in the purification of natural water to the requirements of drinking water supply for the population arise. To solve the problem, the recommendations to improve the technological scheme of purification of the Volga water from organic and toxic substances were developed. Organic pollution can be reduced using ozone or activated carbon. Membrane technologies being capable of filtering water and cyanobacterial cells without mechanical damage can serve as a barrier against toxic substances entering drinking water.</jats:p>",

The stochastic parameter is modeled as a scenario tree and therefore the concerned problem is formulated as a multistage mixed‐integer stochastic program. To alleviate the computational complexity of the proposed model, it is decomposed into smaller scenario cluster submodels associated with a number of subtrees that share a certain number of predecessor nodes in the original scenario tree. The submodels are coordinated into an implementable solution via a Lagrangian‐progressive hedging‐based method that employs a viable Benders decomposition based algorithm for solving each scenario cluster submodel. Based on a realistic scale case, computational results indicate the superiority of the proposed flexible dynamic RSC design model compared to the existing models.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Asia’s first surface-water-based supply system became operational in 1868 to quench the increasing demand of Calcutta, India, an emerging commercial hub of the nineteenth century. Although the city was next to the River Hooghly, its original supply was framed to draw water from 22 km upstream at Pulta. Raw water was treated and then transferred to Tallah, near the northern fringe of the city, for subsequent distribution by pumping. Thus, the Pulta–Tallah system started operation with a 27·3 million litres per day (mld) capacity with slow sand filters. Later, a giant 41 million litre overhead reservoir with 29·6 m staging was introduced at Tallah in 1911, the largest in the world. It acted as a balancing reservoir, receiving water during off-peak hours, storing and then supplying during maximum demand, to insulate the pumps against fluctuating downstream demand. There are six transmission mains transferring water from Pulta to Tallah. Now, this water system has an installed capacity of 1182 mld and employs advanced treatment technologies. This paper summarises the history of the inception and progressive development of the Pulta–Tallah system, which still serves more than half of Calcutta and stands out as an epitome of a sustainable urban supply system. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Tributary junctions are regarded as ecologically important due to unique habitat present; however, there is limited understanding of the drivers of habitat attributes at these locations. Using six sites across two mainstem rivers, we tested whether tributary size relative to main stem governs the strength and direction of response of substrate size, stream temperature, and nutrient and coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) concentration. We found that only phosphorus and CPOM concentration showed a significant relationship with relative tributary size. Small tributaries contributed high concentrations, whereas concentrations in larger tributaries resembled the main stem. Often, tributary exports were enough to increase the resource concentration in the main stem by 40%. Substrate coarsened by ∼60% downstream of tributaries. Temperature asynchrony was observed, where tributaries contributed water between 2.8 °C cooler to 1.9 °C warmer than the main stem within one diel period. Our results highlight the importance of small tributaries for whole network functioning. However, large spatiotemporal variability revealed how habitat attributes are highly context-dependent in these locations and may be difficult to predict in both scientific and management settings. </jats:p>",

The industrial dynamics of mercury was modelled and included in the integrated assessment model WORLD7. The simulated mercury losses were used as input for a simplified global model for environmental pollution. The outputs were analysed and used to assess mercury pollution amounts and supply to society. In fossil fuels, there are a potential stock of 2 million tons in coal and other hydrocarbons, and 450,000 tons of that could be released to the environment if the fossil fuels are all to be burned. Such release would potentially cause major environmental damage and a significant human health risk. The simulations suggest that environmental mercury flows may peak in 2025, and slowly decline as mercury gets immobilized in nature. The simulations show that the pollution from technical use is eliminated by putting the 2013 Minimata Convention into effect, but that environmental pollution from fossil fuels combustion and from environmental re-emissions will remain a significant problem for the next decades.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the study is to search for technical solutions and justification of optimal parameters for increasing the energy efficiency of a biogas plant used in the thermal energy generation to create a favorable microclimate in livestock buildings. The design and technological features of a biogas plant depend on the process stages, the shape of the reactor, and the types of mixing. The criteria for energy efficiency are the lowest cost of energy consumed by a biogas plant for its own needs. A comparison of the insulating materials’ energy indicators made it possible to establish that cellulose wool and polystyrene foam have the lowest heat transfer coefficients.</jats:p>",

Spatial availability is the amount of demand at the given location that can be satisfied by the supply of services at a facility, after discounting the intervening demand among other populations that are located nearer to a facility location than the given population location. This differs from spatial accessibility measures which treat absolute distance or travel time as the factor that impedes utilization. The SCDA is illustrated using pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), which is a treatment for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The spatial availability of PR was estimated for each Census block group in Georgia using the 1105 residents who utilized one of 45 PR facilities located in or around Georgia. Data was provided by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. The geographic patterns of the SCDA spatial availability index and the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) spatial accessibility index were compared with the observed PR utilization rate using bivariate local indicators of spatial association. The SCDA index was more associated with PR utilization (Morans I = 0.607, P &lt; 0.001) than was the 2SFCA (Morans I = 0.321, P &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that the measures of spatial availability may be a better way to estimate the health care utilization potential than measures of spatial accessibility.</jats:p>",

In the production units of intra-supply chain systems, random scraps are inevitable due to various unforeseen factors. Also, since the in-house capacity is limited, implementing a partial outsourcing plan can help release machine workloads, smooth production schedule, and reduce fabrication uptime. Inspired by these facts, this study explores an intra-supply chain system with random scraps and an external source. We build a mathematical model to portray the characteristics of the studied problem. Model analyses and the renewal reward theorem help us to obtain the expected system cost function. Optimization techniques and Hessian matrix equations are used to jointly decide the optimal cycle time and shipment policy that minimize the expected system cost. Through numerical illustration, we expose the individual and joint impact of diverse system features on the optimal operating policies and other crucial parameters of the studied problem, thus, facilitate managerial decision makings.</jats:p>"

Special attention is paid to the determination of mixing intensity and the purpose of different mixing intensities with respect to the subsequent separation.

To handle these uncertain factors and achieve a compromise between the two conflicting objectives of maximizing company profit and improving customer satisfaction, a fuzzy bi-objective programming model and a corresponding two-stage fuzzy interactive solution method are presented. Applying the fuzzy expected value operator and fuzzy ranking method, the fuzzy model is transformed into a deterministic counterpart. Subsequently, Pareto optimal solutions are determined by employing the fuzzy interactive solution method to deal with the conflicting objectives. Numerical experiments address the efficiency of the proposed model and its solution approach. Furthermore, by comparing these results with the CLSC network design in deterministic environments, the benefits of modeling the CLSC network design problem with fuzzy information are highlighted.</jats:p>"

We used a mixed-methods approach: 1) Joinpoint analysis of hos­pitalizations and in-hospital mortality trends between 2005 and 2017; 2) a nation-wide cross-sectional MOH hospital survey. Results. AMI hospitalizations are increasing among men and patients aged &gt;60 years; women have higher mortal­ity rates. The survey included 527 hospitals (2nd level =471; 3rd level =56). We identified insufficient competence to diagnose AMI (2nd level 37%, 3rd level 51%), perform pharmacological perfusion (2nd level 8.7%, 3rd level 26.8%), and mechanical reperfusion (2nd level 2.8%, 3rd level 17.9%). Conclusions. There are wide disparities in demand, supply, and health outcomes of AMI in Mexico.

However, most of these considered the factors independently but in the real world, these factors have a mutually influential relationship. This study purposes a hybrid multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) model to provide decision makers with a comprehensive framework to evaluate the best strategies to solve relocation problems, which also considers the interdependency between criteria. The model incorporates the DANP (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory-based Analytic Network Process) model (subjective weight) and entropy method (objective weight) to determine the weights of the criteria. Then, the modified VIKOR (VIšekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje) method is applied to select the optimal alternative for relocation. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated by taking an electronics manufacturing company with a global supply chain as an example.

In addition, the forward and reverse flow of materials, information, human resources, and finance occurs among different stakeholders in closing the loop of supply chains. Reverse logistics (RL) activities are gaining importance in terms of size and quantity due to both economic and environmental concerns. These flows in RL in supply chains are both dynamic and complex in nature. Further, the environmental impact of RL activities has barely been considered in holistic way in available literature. In this study, a system dynamics model has been developed to analyze and comprehend the green performance of RL activities by predicting the environmental impact of RL activities. The proposed model has been validated by a case study in the context of a food supply chain. In the company where the case study is carried out, the environmental effects of RL activities have been analyzed. These activities in a food supply chain in terms of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (carbon dioxide), NO<jats:sub><jats:italic>x</jats:italic></jats:sub> (nitrogen oxide), SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (sulfur dioxide), and PM (particulate matter) emissions have been predicted through a system dynamics model for the years 2020 to 2024. The proposed methodology is applied in a food supply context, a major player in retail business, especially in emerging economies. According to our findings, the RL activities in a food supply chain can significantly contribute to green performance management by minimizing food waste and loss; hence, the environmental impacts of such activities should be closely examined from a managerial perspective.</jats:p>",

The study used patent applications and trademark applications to analyze the technological progress, whereas LPIs—i.e., LPI-1 for assessing quality and competence services, and LPI-2 for trade and transport infrastructure—are used to determine supply chain management process across countries. The results show that carbon damages follow a U-shaped structure with technology-induced LPIs (TI-LPIs) and GDP per capita. The country’s GDP per capita and TI-LPIs decrease carbon damages up to US$15,000,000, while the moderation of patents application (and trademark applications) with LPI1 and LPI2 substantially decreases carbon damages up to US$13,800,000 (US$34,100,000) and US$6,100,000 (US$20,200,000), respectively.

Response of different species to either stresses is well documented but information on the response of the same genotypes to both stresses in chickpea (<jats:italic>Cicer arietinum</jats:italic>L.) is limited. We aimed to determine whether previously noted heat‐stress‐tolerant genotype (Acc#7) is drought tolerant, that heat‐sensitive genotype (Acc#8) is drought sensitive, and whether intermittent moisture supply at vegetative stage would induce priming effect to later drought at flowering. At vegetative stage, plants were divided into three groups, nonstressed (watered to 75% field capacity [FC], severe water stress (moisture withholding for 14 d), and treated to 40% FC throughout the experiment (mild stress), with recovery for the severely stressed plants after which they were stressed (double stress) at flowering. Drought treatments at vegetative and flowering growth stages decreased physiological parameters and biomass accumulation in both genotypes except low water supply at 40% FC that decreased biomass in Acc#7 but not Acc#8. Double‐drought stress resulted in priming effect in Acc#7, having higher biomass, chlorophyll fluorescence, stomatal conductance (<jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub>), net photosynthesis, and relative water content (RWC) vs. the introduction of stress only at flowering growth stage as well as in comparison with Acc#8. These results showed that both Acc#7 and Acc#8 are sensitive to drought, whereas after priming, Acc#7 is better acclimated to drought than Acc#8 associated with osmotic adjustment on leaf RWC and higher capacity to protect photosynthetic activity, making Acc#7 potentially ideal for areas associated with intermittent drought spells.</jats:p>",

To achieve a better understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms, field experiments were conducted over two years to investigate the dynamics of growth and N capture in an oilseed rape hybrid and its parental lines under both low (0 kg ha−1) and high (180 kg ha−1) N supply. The results showed that the dynamic trajectories of crop growth and N capture could be accurately characterized by logistic equation using growing degree days as the independent variable. At both N rates, the oilseed rape hybrid outperformed the parental lines in seed yield and aboveground biomass accumulation, which was more closely associated with the longer duration (td) of the rapid growth period (RGP), than with the higher maximum growth rate (vm). N uptake was the main factor driving genotypic variation in seed yield, with an increasing importance of N utilization efficiency at high N supply. The hybrid had significantly higher N uptake than the parental lines at both low and high N supply, because of larger vm for N accumulation during the RGP, which may present a scope for genetically improving NUE in oilseed rape. High N application enhanced crop biomass production and N accumulation, as a result of prolonged td and larger vm during the RGP. The initiation of RGP for N accumulation occurred after overwinter period, which could not be accelerated by high N supply, suggesting rational distribution of N fertilizer with reduced basal dose. However, larger amounts in spring would be beneficial for a better synchronization to crop N demand with lower environmental risks.</jats:p>"

Materials and methods: The study was conducted on six territories of\nthe Perm Region constituting an observation area where drinking water was noncompliant with hygienic standards\nby a number of indices, and a comparison area. The analysis of trihalomethanes in drinking water samples was carried\nout in accordance with the requirements of sanitary regulations SanPiN 2.1.4.1074–01. The levels of trihalomethanes\n(chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dibromochloromethane, dichlorobromethane, and 1,2-dichloroethane) in children’s\nblood samples were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography in combination with a specific detector to increase\nselectivity and sensitivity of determination.

We observed significant differences (р&lt;0.005) between two groups in the blood levels of chloroform, carbon\ntetrachloride, and 1,2-dichloroethane that were 5.6, 6 and 24 times higher in children of the test group compared to\nthe controls. Conclusion: We revealed a statistically significant causal relationship between the increase in chloroform\nconcentrations in drinking water and the increase in blood levels of chloroform in children described by the equation\nу=0.00188+0.01782х (R2=0.263, p=0.0018).</jats:p>",

The electrical performance of the V-shaped PEMFC stack was investigated under constant and variable electrical load. It was found that the PEMFC stack was capable of supplying the required 10 kW of electrical power. An optimised purification process via ‘purge’ or humidification, implemented by means of a short-circuit unit (SCU) control strategy, enabled slightly improved performance. Online monitoring of the utilisation of the hydrogen system was developed and tested during the operation of the stack, especially under variable electrical load. The air-cooling subsystem consisting of a common channel connecting two 5 kW PEMFC modules and two cascade axial fans was designed, manufactured using 3D printing technology, and tested with respect to the electrical performance of the device. The dependence of total partial-pressure drop vs. ratio of air volumetric flow for the integrated PEMFC stack with cooling devices was also determined. An algorithm of stack operation involving thermal, humidity, and energy management was elaborated. The safety operation and fault diagnosis of the PEMFC stack was also tested.</jats:p>"

Water Supply Systems Sustainability Index (WSSI), a field assessment tool, was designed for rapid appraisal of drinking water systems in selected urban, peri-urban and rural Nigerian communities. The systems were classified into Highly Sustainable, Sustainable, Averagely Sustainable, and Unsustainable WSSI categories. Sanitary Risk Score (SRS) was assigned, classifying drinking water systems into Very High, High, Intermediate (Medium) and Low-Risk categories. WSSI results revealed that for urban systems, 90 are Highly Sustainable, 27 are Sustainable and 12 are Averagely Sustainable. For peri-urban systems, 13 are Highly Sustainable, 7 Sustainable and 1 Averagely Sustainable. Only urban hand-dug wells are in the Very High-Risk category. Public water supplies occurred only in the Low-Risk (17) and Intermediate-Risk (6) categories. Urban and rural boreholes had better quality than peri-urban boreholes. WSSI and SRS correlation result indicated strong positive correlation for urban hand-dug wells' (R2 = 0.5688, at p &amp;lt; 0.05) and weak positive correlation between peri-urban hand-dug wells' (R2 = 0.1847, at p &amp;lt; 0.05) and urban boreholes' WSSI and SRS (R2 = 0.2032, at p &amp;lt; 0.05).

Using a Ugandan case study, we highlight the impact that one policy change in the energy system will have on other resource systems. We focus on deforestation, long term electricity supply planning, crop production, water consumption, land-use change and climate impacting greenhouse gas (GHG) trajectories. In this study, an open-source integrated modelling framework is used to map the ripple effects of a policy change related to reducing biomass consumption. We find that, despite the reduction in deforestation of woodlands and forests, the GHG emissions in the power sector are expected to increase in between 2040–2050, owing to higher fossil fuel usage. This policy change is also likely to increase the cost of electricity generation, which in turn affects the agricultural land types. There is an unforeseen shift from irrigated to rainfed type land due to higher electricity costs. With this integrated model setup for Uganda, we highlight the need for integrated policy planning that takes into consideration the interlinkages between the resource systems and cross propagation effects.</jats:p>",

In order to avoid inappropriate solutions, i.e. spills occurring when the reservoir is not full, a modified method is proposed that can adjust the trajectories of the particles, using the particle swarm algorithm, according to the operation rule of the reservoir. The method was tested in a case study, and was compared to two commonly used methods for generating particle position vectors. These included the direct method, which uses water supply and water spills as the iteration variables, and the indirect method, which uses water storages (water levels) as the iteration variables. The results showed that the three methods could achieve similar solutions at the 75% probability of exceedance. There was no difference in the convergence speeds or the final objective function values of the three models. However, at the 50% probability of exceedance, the modified method produced results that followed the operation rule of the reservoir, whereas the other two methods could lead to inappropriate water spills. This new method may provide a reference for other meta-heuristic algorithms in models of the optimal operation of reservoirs.</jats:p>",

The input structures for conventional DPC has been modified with a three simpler sequence networks instead of coupled by a detailed Three-Phase system method. The imbalance voltage can be resolved by separating from the individual elements of voltage and current into symmetrical components called Sequence Network. Consequently, the input power relatively improved during unbalanced condition almost 70% through the measurement of Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) from the conventional Direct Power Control (DPC) in individual elements which is higher compared to separate components.

The glass flume experiment was carried out in the vegetation-water flow-sediment environment. In the experiment, natural straight holly in the early growth stage was selected as the experimental vegetation, and erect type vegetation with uniform distribution of the upper and lower branches and leaves was simulated, and a total of 14 experimental groups were set in different combinations with fixed bed, movable bed, submerged and non-submerged conditions. The measured data of flow quantity, flow velocity and suspended load concentration were achieved in the experiment. The experimental results show that: (1) as to the influence of vegetation on the water flow environment, the vegetation canopy density directly affects the turbulent environment of the water flow, and the greater the density, the greater the disturbance to the water flow environment, and the flow velocity near the canopy will be decreased sharply; (2) in the fixed bed, under submerged conditions, the maximum turbulence intensity appears near z/h = 0.6; under non-submerged conditions, the turbulence intensity near the water surface is largest. In the movable bed, under submerged conditions, the maximum turbulence intensity reaches the maximum in the top and upper locations of the top of the plant, and the turbulence intensity reaches the maximum at the top of the plant under non-submerged conditions. (3) In terms of the influence of vegetation on the sediment suspended load movement environment, the concentration of suspended sediment decreases with the increase of plant height, the sediment content in the tail of the plant belt is reduced to some degree. When the relative water depth is z/h &amp;gt; 0.5, almost no suspended sediment exists. And the sediment-retaining effect under non-submerged conditions is better than that under submerged conditions.</jats:p>",

This paper proposed a decision-making model based on generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets and TOPSIS. First, an evaluation index system was comprehensively identified and constructed. Then, generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets were used to describe the index attribute values of emergency plans to fully reflect the certainty, uncertainty, and hesitancy of indexes, and their weights were calculated by Fuzzy Ordered Weighted Averaging (FOWA) to adequately consider the ambiguity of experts' judgment. Finally, the TOPSIS method was extended via the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets to the sequencing of emergency plans. In addition, the Wangjiazhou Reservoir Project in China was selected as a case study. The case study demonstrated that full use of emergency materials and personnel was the most important factor, and the plan of the overflow rock-fill dam was the optimal flood prevention emergency plan. Compared with the classical TOPSIS, the new model proposed in this paper was found to have improved feasibility and effectiveness, and its evaluation results were more objective and reasonable. Therefore, the proposed method could provide both theoretical and practical reference.</jats:p>",

This study investigated the association between child length and WASH conditions using the recently revised WHO and UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) indicators. Data from households with infants and young children aged 6–23 months from the Demographic and Health Surveys in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia were used. Associations for each country between WASH conditions and length-for-age z-scores (LAZ) were analyzed using linear regression. Stunting rates were high (&gt;20%) reaching 45% in Burundi. At the time of the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), more than half of the households in most countries did not have basic or safely managed WASH indicators. Models predicted significantly higher LAZ for children living in households with safely managed drinking water compared to those living in households drinking from surface water in Kenya (β = 0.13, p &lt; 0.01) and Tanzania (β = 0.08, p &lt; 0.05) after adjustment with child, maternal, and household covariates. Children living in households with improved sanitation facilities not shared with other households were also taller than children living in households practicing open defecation in Ethiopia (β = 0.07, p &lt; 0.01) and Tanzania (β = 0.08, p &lt; 0.01) in the adjusted models. All countries need improved WASH conditions to reduce pathogen and helminth contamination. Targeting adherence to the highest JMP indicators would support efforts to reduce child stunting in East Africa.</jats:p>"

However, this leads to the risk of an excess of coagulant residue in the clean water. In this study, sequential coagulation with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) and FeCl3 was proposed to improve the removal of NOM as well as to minimize residual Al. Single dosing with either PACl or FeCl3 in particular was compared with sequential coagulation, with different dosing sequences of PACl–FeCl3 (P–F) or FeCl3–PACl (F–P). At optimum dosage, sequential coagulation P–F showed twice as much dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal from water containing algogenic organic matter, compared to single dosing of PACl and sequential coagulation F–P. However, sequential coagulation F–P was the most effective approach for humic substance removal that improved DOC removal up to &amp;gt;70% compared to other dosing approaches (&amp;lt;60%). Practical treatment with real water also showed the advantages of sequential coagulation with P–F in improving the removal of low SUVA NOM by 18% compared to the traditional single dosing of PACl. As expected, the Al residues found in both sequential coagulation (0.07 mg/L) were significantly reduced compared to single dosing with PACl (0.15 mg/L), indicating the promising application of sequential coagulation for future safe water treatment.</jats:p>",

To ensure continued quality of service, organisations involved in water infrastructure asset management (WIAM) need to deal with a number of issues related to global change. This paper presents the results of an original interdisciplinary foresight approach carried out by a group of engineering and social scientists, in partnership with a number of stakeholders. The purpose was to examine various possible pathways for the future of a French territory. The full title of our foresight study is: ‘Supplying water destined for human consumption in Nouvelle-Aquitaine (France) up until 2070’. Four scenarios, as contrasted as possible, were designed based on five components: organisation and operation of the water supply service, social demands in terms of drinking water, the governance context, territorial dynamics, and the overall context. We then ran further simulations to visualise what a given infrastructure network would look like under each set of assumptions, and under different territorial configurations. One significant advantage of our foresight approach is the educational value it has for stakeholders and water managers. Foresight makes the future potentially visible and provides an opportunity to discuss it, in order to able to inform decision-making.</jats:p>",

This is important when estimating the contamination propagation rate in an operational WDS. Because the inner surface geometry of old rough pipes is complex, real velocities cannot be estimated by conventional WDS models. Therefore, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used to analyse the flow dynamics in old rough pipes with even and uneven roughness build-up. The developed equations for the velocity correction coefficients derive from the results of numerical simulations. Numerically obtained velocity fields show that in some cases, pipe wall build-up can affect the effective flow section significantly and the flow velocity can be underestimated by more than two times. Therefore, different velocity correction equations have to be used for different types of pipe wall build-up.</jats:p>",

Aside from the inherent challenges of coordinating a supply chain, animal husbandry systems face additional complex tasks. The lack of integrated decisions within the poultry chain could lead to a production plan that (a) does not comply with the biosecurity standards required in meat production for human consumption at the farms; (b) violates the production and inventory capacities at the slaughterhouses; and (c) does not meet the demand of customers. To streamline the supply chain, we propose a mixed‐integer linear programming model that supports production planning and scheduling decisions in broiler chicken production facilities. In addition, we embedded the mixed‐integer programming model in a rolling‐horizon scheme to improve scalability and to avoid the myopic effect of time‐indexed optimization models that put too much emphasis on a specific time period. We present the results of a case study in a poultry company in Santa Marta (Colombia), where we reach profit improvements that range from 7% to 57% with a reduction in inventory costs that range from 30% to 60%, while simultaneously meeting stringent technical, tactical, and biosecurity constraints.</jats:p>",

There are many factors affecting the modernization of reservoir management, and there is a certain degree of ambiguity, randomness and uncertainty among the factors. It is difficult to evaluate the modernization of reservoir management comprehensively by traditional methods. This study first studies the connotation of reservoir management modernization under the concept of coordinated development; that is, securitization, economization, scientificalization and greenization. On this basis, a modernization evaluation system and AHP-Fuzzy evaluation model for reservoir management are constructed. Then, an empirical study is conducted with six large reservoirs in Jiangxi Province of China. The results show that the modernization level of large-scale reservoir management in Jiangxi Province is generally above the middle level, and the economic management and engineering management level of some reservoirs is relatively low, resulting in a low scientific and economic level of reservoir management, which is a key factor restricting the process of reservoir management modernization.</jats:p>",

The novel three-stage air-gap–water-gap membrane distillation (AG-AG-WG)MD system reduced energy consumption and increased flux due to efficient internal heat recycling by virtue of a water-gap module. Heat and mass transfer in novel and conventional three-stage systems were analyzed theoretically. Under a feed temperature of 45 °C, flow rate of 20 l/h, cooling temperature of 20 °C, and concentration of 340 ppm, the (AG-AG-WG)MD promoted flux by 17.59% and 211.69%, and gained output ratio (GOR) by 60.57% and 204.33% compared with two-stage (AG-WG)MD and one-stage AGMD, respectively. This work demonstrated the important role of a water gap in changing the heat and mass transfer where convection heat transfer across the water gap is faster by 24.17 times than conduction heat transfer through the air gap. The increase in flux and GOR economized the heating energy and decreased waste heat input into the system. Additionally, the number of MD stages could increase the achieving of a high flux with operation stability.</jats:p>",

To regulate the hypoxia environment and improve the comfort of workers engaged in intense physical labor like tunnel excavation operations in plateau mines, an individual oxygen-supply device for tunnel of plateau mine was proposed to create local oxygen enrichment in the area around the human nose. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method was used to judge the application’s effect of the individual oxygen-supply device in plateau mine, revealing the oxygen diffusion law under the influence of different oxygen enrichment factors. The orthogonal design and range analysis were used to measure the degree of influence of major factors such as oxygen-supply velocity, oxygen-supply concentration, and tunnel airflow velocity. The results demonstrate that the oxygen mass fraction of the air inhaled by the human had a positive correlation exponential function, a positive correlation linear function, and a negative correlation exponential function, respectively, concerning oxygen-supply velocity, oxygen-supply concentration, and tunnel airflow velocity. The range analysis revealed that the major influencing factors of oxygen enrichment in the tunnel of the plateau mine were, in a descending sequence, as follows: oxygen-supply concentration, tunnel airflow velocity, and oxygen-supply velocity, and the corresponding ranges were 2.86, 2.63, and 1.83, respectively. The individual oxygen-supply device achieved the best oxygen enrichment effect when the oxygen-supply velocity was 5 m/s, the oxygen-supply concentration was 60%, and the tunnel airflow velocity was 0.2 m/s, which increased the oxygen mass fraction of air inhaled by the human to 30.42%. This study has a positive guiding significance for the improvement of the respiration environment in the tunnel of plateau mine.</jats:p>"

In this article, we take an in-depth look into one such attack, called the “Big Hack,” that was recently reported by Bloomberg Buisnessweek. The article provides background on the Big Hack from three perspectives: an attacker, a security investigator, and the societal impacts. This study provides details on vulnerabilities in the modern PCB supply chain, the possible attacks, and the existing and emerging countermeasures. The necessity for novel visual inspection techniques for PCB assurance is emphasized throughout the article.

The objective of the study is to indicate the appropriate timing of nitrogen supply on the yield and industrial quality of oat grains, considering the use of low and high dose of nitrogen at sowing and favorable and unfavorable years for cereal growing in soybean/oat system. The experiment was conducted in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, in Augusto Pestana, RS, Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications in a 2 x 4 factorial, for two doses of nitrogen at sowing (5 and 25 kg ha-1), changing the top dressing dose by the total supplied of 70 kg ha-1, in the expectation grain yield of 4000 kg ha-1, with time of supply at 0, 10, 30 and 60 days after emergence. In an unfavorable and intermediate year for the growing of oats, it is necessary to increase the dose of the nutrient at sowing in order to favor greater amplitude of the time of application in top dressing. In a favorable year, whether low or high, this range of application is guaranteed. Regardless of the reduced and high dose of nitrogen at sowing, the greatest expression of grain and industry yield occurs with the nutrient applied at 30 and 35 days after emergence in an unfavorable year, 35 days in an intermediate year and 40 to 45 days in a favorable year, respectively.</jats:p>"

It accurately reproduces nitrate concentrations with Willmott skill scores, root‐mean‐square error, and bias ranging from 0.84–0.95, 4.02–6.5 μM, and −2.33–1.84 μM, respectively, compared to three independent discrete sample data sets. A prominent feature of the model output is a tidal jet emanating from Discovery Passage producing a downstream plume of elevated surface nitrate. The signal is present from April to September, when surface nitrate is otherwise drawn down. It has a weak but statistically significant correlation to Discovery Passage tidal velocity (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>=0.37, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt;0.01). Within the turbulent jet and associated plume, the average rate of vertical nitrate supply due to mixing and advection across a depth of roughly 6 m is 0.46 μmol m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> between 15 May and 20 August 2015, compared to 0.10 μmol m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for the northern Strait of Georgia as a whole. Close to Discovery Passage, where velocities and shear are strongest, the majority of the vertical nitrate flux is due to mixing. As velocities weaken downstream, vertical advection becomes more important relative to mixing, but vertical velocities also decrease. The tidal pulses out of Discovery Passage drive waves that contribute net upward nitrate flux as far south as Cape Lazo, 40 km away. The nitrate supply drives new production, consistent with existing observations. Similar dynamics have been described in many other tidally influenced coastal systems.</jats:p>",

To improve beach conservation efforts, current and future shoreline hardening patterns on sandy beaches need deeper analysis. A shoreline change model driven by incremental SLR (0.25, 0.46, 0.74 m) is used to simulate future changes in the position of an administrative hazard zone, as a proxy for risk of hardening at all sandy beaches on the island of O‘ahu, Hawai ‘i. In Hawai ‘i, hardening can be triggered when evidence of erosion is within 6.1 m (“20 ft”) of certain structures, allowing an applicant to request emergency protection. Results show an increase in shoreline vulnerability to hardening with SLR governed by backshore land use patterns. The largest increase (+ 7.6%) occurred between modern-day and 0.25 m of SLR (very likely by year 2050) with half of all beachfront shoreline at risk by 0.74 m of SLR. Maximum risk of shoreline hardening and beach loss is projected to occur from modern-day and near-term hardening because of the heavily developed aspect of some shoreline segments. Adaptation to SLR should be considered an immediate need—not solely a future issue.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we build a two-echelon supply chain in which a manufacturer produces limit quality products and sells them to a retailer. To promote sales, the manufacturer or retailer offers a free-replacement warranty to the customers. Customer’s demand is affected by the warranty length. We investigate the game relationships between the supply chain members. We find that the warranty length negatively relates to the product quality in both the manufacturer offering warranty case and the retailer offering warranty case. When retailer’s profit margin is not low, the retailer offers a longer warranty than the manufacturer and vice versa. Profit of the supply chain is also analyzed along with a numerical study.</jats:p>",

Thirty-six pregnant non-lactating Holstein-Friesian cows were randomly assigned to three isoenergetic diets: (1) low Ca: 0.24% Ca, DCAD: +86 mEq/kg; (2) high Ca: 1.23% Ca, DCAD: +95 mEq/kg; and (3) low DCAD: 1.28% Ca, DCAD: −115 mEq/kg (all dry matter (DM) basis). While colostrum quality was not affected, low Ca supply prepartum tended to increase the colostrum yield compared to high Ca (low Ca = 8.81 vs. high Ca = 5.39 kg). However, calves from cows fed low DCAD showed higher serum concentrations of K, lower body weight (BW), starter feed intake and average daily weight gain before weaning compared to low Ca and high Ca calves (53.12 vs. 57.68 and 57.32 kg) but BW was similar postweaning (d 70). In addition, calves from dams fed low DCAD were more likely to develop diarrhea and had increased number of days with abnormal fecal scores. Consequently, calves from low DCAD dams had to be treated more frequently.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nutrient supply to the surface ocean is a key factor regulating primary production in the Arctic Ocean under current conditions and with ongoing warming and sea ice losses. Here we present seasonal nitrate concentration and hydrographic data from two oceanographic moorings on the northern Barents shelf between autumn 2017 and summer 2018. The eastern mooring was sea ice-covered to varying degrees during autumn, winter and spring, and was characterized by more Arctic-like oceanographic conditions, while the western mooring was ice-free year-round and showed a greater influence of Atlantic water masses. The seasonal cycle in nitrate dynamics was similar under ice-influenced and ice-free conditions, with biological nitrate uptake beginning near-synchronously in early May, but important differences between the moorings were observed. Nitrate supply to the surface ocean preceding and during the period of rapid drawdown was greater at the ice-free more Atlantic-like western mooring, and nitrate drawdown occurred more slowly over a longer period of time. This suggests that with ongoing sea ice losses and Atlantification, the expected shift from more Arctic-like ice-influenced conditions to more Atlantic-like ice-free conditions is likely to increase nutrient availability and the duration of seasonal drawdown in this Arctic shelf region. The extent to which this increased nutrient availability and longer drawdown periods will lead to increases in total nitrate uptake, and support the projected increases in primary production, will depend on changes in upper ocean stratification and their effect on light availability to phytoplankton as changes in climate and the physical environment proceed.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>This article is part of the theme issue ‘The changing Arctic Ocean: consequences for biological communities, biogeochemical processes and ecosystem functioning'.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Space Plasma Environment Research Facility (SPERF) is a new ground-based experimental device for fundamental research studies on space plasma currently under construction at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. Scientific objectives of the SPERF include studying the asymmetric reconnection dynamics relevant to the interaction between the interplanetary and magnetospheric plasmas, reproducing the inner magnetosphere to simulate the processes of trapping, acceleration, and transport of energetic charged particles restrained in a dipole magnetic field configuration, and revealing the physical mechanism of the dipolarization front in the magnetotail. The device comprises a vacuum chamber, 11 coils consisting of 18 groups of sub-coils that are independently programmablely energized, and the plasma source system to provide the magnetic field and the plasma required by the physical experiments. Thus, each of these 18 groups of sub-coils requires a separate pulsed power supply; furthermore, the 18 pulsed power supplies constitute the pulsed power supply system of the SPERF of which the total storage energy is up to 18.3 MJ, and the technical challenges have to be overcome. The power supply energizing a dipole field coil (labeled OJC coil) wired by the copper wire to provide a dipole magnetic field is the most energetic power supply (labeled OJC power supply) with a 2.42 MJ, 16.8 mF capacitor bank charged to 20 kV. The OJC power supply delivers a current with a peak of 18 kA for a rise time of ∼26.69 ms, and the duration of the current is not less than 95% of the peak over 10 ms to the OJC coil. Meanwhile, the most challenging power supply is the power supply labeled poloidal field power supply with a 5.04 mF capacitor bank charged to 20 kV, which provides the excitation current for the load coil set with the current not less than 360 kA at the typical time of 0.11 ms to produce the sufficient growth of the magnetic field that the experiments need. In this paper, the overall design of the pulsed power supply system, the design concept of the modularization, and the principle selection basis of the key components are presented. The technical details of each power supply will be demonstrated in the future.</jats:p>",

Improving the understanding of the integrated reaeration processes is beneficial to optimize the reaeration capacity of the aeration or oxygenation system. In this study, the discrete bubble model was first employed to design an oxygenation system for a sub-deep reservoir (the Aha Reservoir, southwest China, with water depths of 10–30 m). A new approach involving the discrete bubble model was used to determine the initial bubble size of the bubble plume applied. The intrusion models were demonstrated to be useful for designing the gas flow rate of the reaeration system. Using the intrusion models, we predicted the intrusion thickness and intrusion distance during operation for the first time. Subsequently, we verified the predictions and produced more realistic empirical formulas. At present, reports about recommendations on initial bubble size and gas flow rate are rare, and practical verification is absent. Taking the Aha Reservoir as an example, the initial bubble radius of 1 mm and the gas flow rate of 20 m3·h−1 were recommended for bubble plume oxygenation and were found to be successful in the field. Our understanding of the reaeration processes during the operation of the bubble plume system is far from comprehensive, but this study serves to highlight the potential of the discrete bubble model and the intrusion models for designing a bubble plume system in an individual lake.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Silicon (Si) is not categorized as a biologically essential element for plants, yet a great number of scientific reports have shown its significant effects in various crop plants and environmental variables. Plant Si plays biologically active role in plant life cycle, and the significant impact depends on its bioaccumulation in plant tissues or parts. In particular, it has been investigated for its involvement in limited irrigation management. Therefore, this experiment was conducted to examine the effect of Si application in eco-physiological, enzymatic and non-enzymatic activities of sugarcane plants against water stress. Four irrigation levels, i.e., normal (100–95% of soil moisture), 80–75, 55–50, and 35–30% of soil moisture were treated for the sugarcane cultivar GT 42 plants supplied with 0, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg Si L−1 and exposed for 60 days after Si application. Under stress, reduction in plant length (~26–67%), leaf area-expansion (~7–51%), relative water content (~18–57%), leaf greenness (~12–35%), photosynthetic pigments (~12–67%), physiological responses such as photosynthesis (22–63%), stomatal conductance (~25–61%), and transpiration rate (~32–63%), and biomass production were observed in the plants without Si application. The drought condition also inhibited the activities of antioxidant enzymes like catalase (~10–52%), peroxidase (ca. 4–35), superoxide dismutase (10–44%) and enhanced proline (~73–410%), and malondialdehyde content (ca. 15–158%), respectively. However, addition of Si ameliorated drought induced damage in sugarcane plants. The findings suggest that the active involvement of Si in sugarcane responsive to water stress ranges from plant performance and physiological processes, to antioxidant defense systems.</jats:p>"

The photodegradation performance of A-DOM extracted from Chaohu Lake was tested and characterized under UV-A, UV-C irradiation, and dark condition, and the photochemical degradation characteristics and molecular weight changes of A-DOM during degradation were analyzed. A-DOM mainly includes four EEM-PARAFAC components, namely, C1 (protein-like tryptophan), C2 (protein-like tyrosine), C3 (long-wave humus), and C4 (short-wave humus). After irradiation for 168 h under UV-C, the protein-like components C1 and C2 had the highest fluorescence intensity reduction of 95.4% and 100%, respectively. The fluorescence intensities of fulvic-like components, namely C3 and C4, increased. The absorption coefficients (A355) of A-DOM were decreased by 84.46%, 70.83%, and 52.98% with UV-A, UV-C irradiation, and dark condition, respectively. The degradation reaction of C1 and C2 fitted with the first-order kinetic equation with a half-life of 21.59–83.51 h. The SUVA254 value decreased under UV irradiation and increased under dark condition, which is in accordance with the change of molecular weight results.

Governments consider encouraging the manufacturer’s initiative of producing low-carbon products by providing subsidies. However, when the manufacturer sells low-carbon products through the e-commerce platform, fairness concerns arise because of the profit difference. So, this paper builds game models to study decision behavior in the low-carbon e-commerce supply chain when the manufacturer receives government carbon subsidies and has fairness concerns. Our findings show that consumers’ preference for low-carbon products will be conducive to the operation of the supply chain. So it is necessary to popularize low-carbon products. The effect of government subsidies on supply chain decisions is different from fairness concerns. Government subsidies are positive factors in the supply chain operation, which can stimulate the manufacturer to make low-carbon products as expected and choose the high quality-high price development mode. This will help improve the profit of enterprises in the supply chain but cannot effectively stimulate the e-commerce platform to increase its service level. By contrast, the manufacturer’s fairness concerns are negative factors, which make the manufacturer prefer to adopt a low quality-low price development mode to improve their utility. This offsets the positive effect of government subsidies. It turns out that the profit of both node enterprises and the supply chain system has declined. But, fairness concerns are an important way to express the manufacturer’s demand. Finally, the joint allocation contract of cost and profit designed by comprehensively considering the effect of government subsidies and fairness concerns can make the supply chain coordinated. However, even as positive factors, only within a specific range do government subsidies help coordinate the supply chain, but not the more, the better.</jats:p>",

Under the circumstance, the retailer is likely to procure products from two suppliers to effectively alleviate the demand-supply mismatches. Thus, under supply disruption and stochastic demand, this paper develops both backup sourcing and simultaneous sourcing (SS) strategies to analyze the retailer’s performance, where backup sourcing includes wholesale price priority (WPP) and supply reliability priority (SRP). Specifically, (1) under WPP, when the selling price is relatively lower (higher), the retailer is suggested to activate the reliable backup supplier after the realization of supply disruption (demand uncertainty). (2) Under SRP, two scenarios including minor disruption and major disruption can be identified, where the retailer’s order quantity from the reliable (unreliable) supplier under minor disruption scenario is more (less) than that under major. (3) Finally, this paper systematically compares the retailer’s preferences among WPP, SRP, and SS via theoretical results and numerical examples. That is, when the unreliable supplier is more likely to work normally or shortage cost (selling price) is relatively lower, the retailer prefers SPR regarding the unreliable supplier as backup sourcing due to its lower wholesale price and acceptable supply disruption. Otherwise, the retailer is inclined to WPP regarding the reliable supplier as backup sourcing for ensuring all market demand to be satisfied. In addition, unless the emergency prices of two suppliers are extremely higher, backup sourcing strategies could perform better than simultaneous sourcing strategy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The mismatch between the supply and demand of online-listed rental housing (ORH) is an important factor restricting the operational efficiency of online rental service platforms. However, extant literature pays little attention to this problem. This study proposes an ORH multiattribute supply and demand matching decision model based on the perceived utility of matching both sides of this market. The model considers the multiattribute information of ORH, such as area, transportation, rent, room, and interior decoration, and quantifies their perceived utility values based on the theory of disappointment. Thereafter, we construct the matching decision model and verify it for feasibility by applying it to Shanghai’s ORH supply and demand information—our empirical case. The results show that this method can be applied to online rental housing platforms and meet the supply and demand matching requirements to the greatest extent. The constructed model takes into account the perceptions of both supply and demand parties, may promote the effective matching of ORH supply and demand, and bears theoretical implications for the improvement of rental housing matching in ORH platforms.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper aims to identify the root causes that exacerbated the economic damage from the 2011 Chao Phraya river flood disaster in central Thailand industrial complex area. Finding root causes is crucial for learning from disasters; however, there has not been much investigation of the economic damage root causes with regard to the 2011 Chao Phraya river flood disaster. This paper seeks to investigate the root causes of the economic damage by organizing the existing analytical frameworks, tools and approaches to clarify why industrial parks and estates experienced such substantial economic devastation that resonated worldwide. The study’s research design includes a social background survey, in-depth interview surveys and an investigation of the disaster’s root causes. Through the research, inadequate urban and land use planning facilitated by a decentralization policy, foreign companies settlement in the country, which involved urbanization and relocation without proper risk assessment, information, and knowledge, and supplier’s responsibility based on the supply chain’s structure, are detected as root causes for the high economic damage in the industrial complex area. This study also provides key lessons essential to building regional resilience in industrial complex areas: 1) considering the potential risks of regional planning, which include both socio-economic and climate changes; 2) clarifying the roles of companies, regions, and nations in sharing risk information with related stakeholders before, during, and after a disaster; and 3) building horizontal and vertical collaborations among all related stakeholders.</jats:p>",

Hence, productivity is the main target area to be improved. Previously, one of the contributed costs for manufacturing cost is the direct labor cost. But, since productivity improvement effort is done actively, no clear measurement method used because labor cost was calculated using a fix predetermined standard time. Therefore, the main objective is to verify whether the predetermined standard time is accurate enough to measure the productivity improvement effort where it was set higher to its actual tact time by 19%. By conducting a standard time study with actual manual production line which consist of eleven work stations and twelve operators, there are 5 revision items selected to be revised to a new series of standard time based on its actual time and 15% human factor allowance, which is the second objective of the study. The objectives of this study were accomplished by using an action research where it consists of specific video recording activity which was analyzed using an industrial software called OTRS. From here, data comparison was done and it shows a total of 1.96min is saved from the original predetermined standard time. Ultimate result of this study is; there were five processes that have been revised its standard time which has big difference between its predetermined standard time and its actual production time. Indirectly resulting to actual labor cost reduction of USD$846,615.</jats:p>"
