Important questions addressed in this chapter include: what the European countries get for their resource investments, that is, what skills are provided by these schooling systems; how these general skills have evolved over time; and the implication of the evolution of skills for wage inequality. The US is used as a benchmark, and data from a selection of European countries are presented. IT should be noted that the actual selection of European countries is mostly determined by the availability of data. Skills are first analysed in the oldest cohort and then for successively younger cohorts. Basic skills brought to the labour market by successive cohorts born from 1935 until 1970 are explored, along with skills for those still in schools. Finally, the relationship between skills and wage inequality across countries is examined.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In a variety of industries ranging from agriculture to electronics and oil, procurement takes place through a combination of bilateral fixed-price contracts and open market trading among supply chain participants, which allows them to improve supply chain performance by utilizing new demand and cost information. The strategic behavior of the participants in these markets interacts with the way fixed-price contracts are formulated and significantly affects supply chain efficiency. In this paper, we develop a strategic model that allows endogenous price formation in an industrial spot market where supply chain participants have private information. Utilizing the model, we analyze the equilibrium of a dynamic game between a single supplier and multiple manufacturers who first contract with the supplier at a fixed price and then trade on a spot market. We study how such trading affects supply chain performance and show that it does not eliminate fixed-price contracting even though the fixed price is determined under inferior information. We find that it reduces prices, increases the quantities produced, and improves supply chain profits and consumer surplus. However, depending on the information structure of the supply chain, spot trading may make either the supplier or the manufacturers worse off. Our results show how the informational regime affects the profitability of supply chain participants and the allocation of quantities between the procurement venues. We show that beyond a threshold level, the effect of increasing supply uncertainty, or decreasing either the demand uncertainty or the information asymmetry among the manufacturers, is to increase the percentage procured on the spot market as well as the overall quantity procured and sold, and to decrease prices. As the number of manufacturers increases, procurement shifts from fixed-price contracting to spot trading and in the limit, the supply chain is both fully coordinated and informationally efficient. We also show that in many cases, the supplier may gain strategic advantage by sharing some of her cost information with the manufacturers. </jats:p>",

In particular, we demonstrate that a firm can actually glean benefits from often-discussed transfer-pricing problems in dealing with an external supplier. Though transfer prices above marginal cost introduce inter-division coordination problems, they also introduce a lower willingness to pay to outside suppliers. Knowing that costly internal transfers will eat into demand, the supplier is more willing to set lower prices. Such supplier discounts can make decentralization worthwhile for the firm. This benefit of decentralization is shown to be robust to variations in both downstream and upstream competition.</jats:p>",

In the plasma fractionation and manufacturing industry, pathogen inactivation technologies have been successfully implemented resulting in no transmission of human immunodeficiency, hepatitis C, or hepatitis B viruses by US-licensed plasma derivatives since 1985. However, these technologies cannot be used to pathogen inactivate cellular blood components. Although current blood donor screening and disease testing has drastically reduced the incidence of transfusion-transmitted diseases, there still looms the threat to the blood supply of a new or reemerging pathogen. Of particular concern is the silent emergence of a new agent with a prolonged latent period in which asymptomatic infected carriers would donate and spread infection.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Objective.—To review and summarize the principles, challenges, achievements, prospective technologies, and future goals of pathogen inactivation of the blood supply.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Sources.—The current published English-language literature from 1968 through 2006 and a historical landmark article from 1943 are integrated into a review of this subject.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions.—The ultimate goal of pathogen inactivation is to maximally reduce the transmission of potential pathogens without significantly compromising the therapeutic efficacy of the cellular and protein constituents of blood. This must be accomplished without introducing toxicities into the blood supply and without causing neoantigen formation and subsequent antibody production. Several promising pathogen inactivation technologies are being developed and clinically tested, and others are currently in use. Pathogen inactivation offers additional layers of protection from infectious agents that threaten the blood supply and has the potential to impact the safety of blood transfusions worldwide.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this study was to estimate the economic benefits and costs of a range of interventions to improve access to water supply and sanitation facilities in the developing world. Results are presented for eleven developing country WHO sub-regions as well as at the global level, in United States Dollars (US$) for the year 2000. Five different types of water supply and sanitation improvement were modelled: achieving the water millennium development goal of reducing by half in 2015 those without improved water supply in the year 1990; achieving the combined water supply and sanitation MDG; universal basic access to water supply and sanitation; universal basic access plus water purification at the point-of-use; and regulated piped water supply and sewer connection. Predicted reductions in the incidence of diarrhoeal disease were calculated based on the expected population receiving these interventions. The costs of the interventions included estimations of the full investment and annual running costs. The benefits of the interventions included time savings due to easier access, gain in productive time and reduced health care costs saved due to less illness, and prevented deaths. The results show that all water and sanitation improvements are cost-beneficial in all developing world sub-regions. In developing regions, the return on a US$1 investment was in the range US$5 to US$46, depending on the intervention. For the least developed regions, investing every US$1 to meet the combined water supply and sanitation MDG lead to a return of at least US$5 (AFR-D, AFR-E, SEAR-D) or US$12 (AMR-B; EMR-B; WPR-B). The main contributor to economic benefits was time savings associated with better access to water and sanitation services, contributing at least 80% to overall economic benefits. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that even under pessimistic data assumptions the potential economic benefits outweighed the costs in all developing world regions. Further country case-studies are recommended as a follow up to this global analysis.</jats:p>",

The SMEs have been involved in such a green supply chain only to the extent of their participation as suppliers, distributors and in other capacities as business partners complementing the world‐class companies. All the same, in many regions, the environmental initiatives taken by the SMEs do conform to the different phases of the green supply chain. This study investigates if in the Philippine context this postulate is indeed true, and with the help of an empirical survey, establishes that the SME population in the Philippines do indeed carry out different phases of the green supply chain, though in a heterogeneous manner. This would be indeed expected given the heterogeneity in size and nature of business for SMEs in this region.</jats:p>",

Especially the requirements obtained from industrial partners were used to optimise the hydrogen generator to meet the demands of residential applications. Sometimes not all of these demands can be fulfilled and compromises are necessary. For example high efficiency requires heat integration which leads to high complexity of the system, higher volume/weight and finally elevated production costs or short start-up time requires a radical temperature gradient which has a negative impact on life time (2).

A Stackelberg game is constructed to analyze the price and lead time decisions by the supplier as the leader and the retailer as the follower. The equilibrium strategies of the two players are obtained. Using the performance of the corresponding centralized system as a benchmark, we show that decentralized decisions in general are inefficient and lead to inferior performance due to the double marginalization effect. However, further analysis shows that the decision inefficiency is strongly influenced by market and operational factors, and if the operational factors are dominating, it may not be significant. This shows that before pursuing a coordination strategy with retailers, a supplier should first improve his or her own internal operations. </jats:p>",

Given that the role of NOCs is poorly understood largely due to prevailing economic and political clichés that substitute for analysis, this paper takes an institutional economics perspective to analyse the issue of NOC governance and related issues.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The paper adopts an integrative approach. First, it introduces the language of institutional economics to broadly structure a review of NOC governance. It then links the theoretical discussion to an assessment of the macro‐economic imperatives to which the NOC and its governance may need to respond. Finally, an audit trail is used for assessing cases in their particular institutional, cultural and physical conditions.

They constitute an institutional response to failing market coordination with international oil companies and a means for producer countries to align political and economic interests. Yet, overriding the market and creating powerful stand‐alone, state‐owned, state‐run enterprises raise efficiency and broader regulatory concerns. The paper shows how institutional economics offers a conceptual apparatus to identify options for regulating NOCs at interrelated levels of control and suggests the need for case‐by‐case assessment.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>Applying the conceptual apparatus outlined in the paper may allow future research to systematically discuss particular features of NOC governance, generate more general pattern models, and thereby improve the base for decisions on NOC's strategies and regulation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The originality of the paper lies in its integrated approach of analysis and employing the institutional economics approach to the case studies to reveal the role of NOCs in the energy scene.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

It is argued that the regulatory environment impacts on the prices paid by both users and owners of retail space. This assertion is tested empirically. A range of measures of the complex and, at times, conflicting supply-side policies are incorporated into models of retail market values. The models are estimated using data for a cross-section of British cities and cover the period from 1998 to 2003. The results show that planning policy intervention has a more pronounced impact on the investor market than the user market. It seems that a proactive policy environment, with a strong emphasis on towncentre management and improvements to the shopping environment, will exert a significant influence on retail capital values and yields. These factors are less likely to impact on the rents paid by retailers who appear to be more concerned with representation across major markets and are less sensitive to differences in local policy stance. </jats:p>",

More recently, the focus of this research has broadened to examine women and venture capital. This article extends the focus further by examining the role of women in the business angel market, which is more important than the formal venture capital market in terms of both the number of ventures supported and total capital flows. Based on a detailed analysis of business angels in the U.K., the study concludes that women investors who are active in the market differ from their male counterparts in only limited respects. Future research into women business angels, and the possible existence of gender differences, needs to be based on more fully elaborated standpoint epistemologies that focus on the experience of the woman angel investor per se, and center on the examination of the role of homophily, social capital, networking, and competition in investment behavior. </jats:p>",

However, unnoticed by marketing, a quiet revolution has taken place in supply chain management (SCM), where the traditional emphasis on least-cost transactions has given way to a focus on long-term relationships with a few key suppliers. It is thus apparent that the two disciplines are converging. This article uses a cross-disciplinary approach to explore whether these developments from the field of SCM provide insights into key business-to-business relationships. A detailed case study of a long-term relationship between a business-to-business services provider and a key customer in the construction industry suggests there is a definable overlap. The supply chain model illuminates five important elements of KAM and offers a promising method for the evaluation of such relationships. As a result of the research, both supplier and customer companies implemented actions to improve and strengthen this important relationship. </jats:p>",

This gram-negative bacterium uses multiple cell-to-cell signals to control numerous cellular functions and virulence. One of these signals is 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone, which is referred to as the<jats:italic>Pseudomonas</jats:italic>quinolone signal (PQS). This signal functions as a coinducer for a transcriptional regulator (PqsR) to positively control multiple virulence genes and its own synthesis. PQS production is required for virulence in multiple models of infection, and it has been shown to be produced in the lungs of CF patients infected by<jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>. One of the precursor compounds from which PQS is synthesized is the metabolite anthranilate. This compound can be derived from the conversion of chorismate to anthranilate by an anthranilate synthase or through the degradation of tryptophan via the anthranilate branch of the kynurenine pathway. In this study, we present data which help to define the kynurenine pathway in<jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>and show that the kynurenine pathway serves as a critical source of anthranilate for PQS synthesis. We also show that the<jats:italic>kyn</jats:italic>pathway genes are induced during growth with tryptophan and that they are autoregulated by kynurenine. This study provides solid foundations for the understanding of how<jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>produces the anthranilate that serves as a precursor to PQS and other 4-quinolones.</jats:p>",

While such bundles are used in offline purchase negotiations, their criticality is heightened in online auctions due to their usual short duration and constrained bidding environment. Despite this importance, little systematic discussion or evaluation has taken place concerning bundling practice, especially as it relates to the individual items included in the bundle, the overall bundle composition, and the resulting supply base and ultimate bundle performance. This study investigates these issues by developing a conceptual model and testing it with a large‐scale survey completed by purchasing professionals practicing bundling in B2B online auctions. Results indicate that crafting a more homogeneous bundle is most important in achieving a successful outcome. Furthermore, more complex or difficult‐to‐specify items do not impact perceived bundle performance, but do influence the supply base that is willing and able to bid on the business.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Throughout flood and ebb tides, larvae that sink in turbulence have higher near‐bed concentrations than passive larvae. This high supply of larvae enables behaving larvae to settle more successfully than passive larvae in strong currents characteristic of tidal inlets. Unlike passive larvae, those that sink in turbulence settle more successfully in stronger currents than in weaker ones and would concentrate their settlement in energetic tidal zones. Turbulence‐mediated behavior may give intertidal larvae a greater ability to select habitats and may reduce larval mortality rates due to settlement failure.</jats:p>",

Drawing on the resource‐based view and theory from the organizational learning and information‐processing literatures, this study uses a sample of 201 firms to examine the influence of a culture of competitiveness and knowledge development on supply chain performance in varied market turbulence conditions. We found that synergies exist between a culture of competitiveness and knowledge development: their interaction has a positive association with performance. In addition, based on behavioral and contingency theories, we found that market turbulence moderates these relationships, having a positive influence on the knowledge development–performance link and a negative influence on the culture of competitiveness–performance link. Managers who are confident about the level of market turbulence they will face can use this sense to decide whether to emphasize developing either a culture of competitiveness or knowledge development in their supply chains. For those firms whose managers are unlikely to be able to predict the degree of turbulence they will face over time, a focus on both a culture of competitiveness and knowledge development is critical to ensuring success.

Data for the study were generated through a combination of primary and secondary sources in three villages. Results of the study indicate that while community‐based rural water supply is a positive step in responding to the needs of rural Malians, the installation of boreholes with hand pumps informed merely by consultative participatory approaches and limited extension involvement will not necessarily proffer sustainable rural water supply in the region. A “platform” approach to rural water supply management that can mobilize the assets and insights of different social actors to influence decision making at all stages, including the design and choice‐of‐technology stages, in water supply interventions is instead advocated.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

The buyer has two procurement opportunities with the second one after observing a market signal, which updates the demand forecast. He also commits to a service level after observing the market signal. We derive his optimal ordering decisions and show that the critical market signal, the optimal first‐stage order quantity, and the optimal expected profit are monotone with respect to the target service level. We also discuss the impact of the forecast quality on the optimal decisions. We show that the optimal first‐stage order quantity may not be monotone with respect to information accuracy, as is in the case without the service constraint. In addition, we extend our analysis to the situation when an order cancellation is allowed upon the observation of the market signal. We also compare the results obtained for the problems with and without an order cancelation. Finally, we discuss the supply chain coordination issue and find that a buyback contract can also coordinate the supply chain in the presence of the service constraint. </jats:p>",

The particular service supply chain simulated in the exercise is a wireless telecommunications firm. In this exercise, students perform simulations to experience managing the supply chain of the telecommunications firm with and without an enterprise system. The simulator tracks their business performance. Then the results are used as the basis of discussion in a subsequent debriefing session. We describe the educational goals of the simulation exercise and how the exercise can be structured in order to achieve these goals. The latter is illustrated by the use of the simulation exercise in a master's level supply chain management course in the Red McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. The simulator includes realistic details. In fact, it is based on the extensive consulting experiences of the first author with two North American telecommunications firms. We describe the simulator in detail under the various scenarios, explain how it was validated, and provide the simulator equations in system dynamics format in Appendix B. </jats:p>",

The study was conducted in an area of high agricultural land use, characterised by small field size, a more mosaic habitat and low use of mineral fertilisers in comparison to Western European countries. The influence of habitat structure and composition in the territory on the date of clutch initiation, nest predation and clutch size in the Red‐backed Shrike was not found, but such an influence on the number of nestlings was shown. The minimum adequate model explained 18.3% of the variation between territories in nestling's number. The number of fledglings was positively correlated with the area of pastures, meadows, orchards and fallows within territories, and negatively correlated with length of overhead transmission lines. The number of fledglings was correlated with food abundance within territories, based on to the results from pitfall traps. There was no correlation between territory food abundance and the size of clutch. The presence of pastures, meadows and fallows, which are foraging places, thus seems to be crucial for the protection of the Red‐backed Shrike.</jats:p>",

Deterioration of cardiac function in AS is currently assessed by symptomatology and echocardiography to determine the optimal time point for surgery. We investigated whether BNP or NT‐proBNP may help to estimate the individual risk of patients for subendocardial ischaemia in patients with moderate and severe AS.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Design </jats:bold> In 71 patients with AS and 24 controls, the association of plasma natriuretic peptides with invasively measured haemodynamic parameters, including the myocardial oxygen supply‐to‐demand ratio [diastolic pressure time index/systolic pressure time index (DPTI/SPTI)] was cross‐sectionally assessed.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> Levels of natriuretic peptides increased with severity of AS. In patients with moderate AS (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 30), natriuretic peptides differentiated between symptomatic and asymptomatic status (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0·01).

DPTI/SPTI correlated with aortic valve area (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·0001) but not with EF.
