      "abstract": "<jats:p>The British Library Lending Division came into being in 1973 when the National Central Library was integrated with the stock and services of the National Lending Library for Science and Technology at Boston Spa. The original buildings have been added to by specially designed accommodation. The loan/photocopy service, based on the use of a pre‐paid three‐part request form, has been supplemented by computer requesting, links through database operators such as DIALOG, and the telephone for urgent requests. Road/rail transport links with many parts of the country have been introduced and now account for over half of all items dispatched. A rapid growth in demand in the first seven years was followed by a decline and then a levelling off in 1982/83. The proportion of demand accounted for by International Services increased from 9% in 1973/74 to 21% in 1982/83. The Division has developed close connections with IFLA and the European Communities. As a result of a British Library Ad hoc Working Party on Union Catalogues, which reported in 1982, the Division's stock records and union catalogues are being automated. The British Union Catalogue of Periodicals ceased to be issued and its bibliographic function was replaced by Serials in the British Library, issued by the Bibliographic Services Division from 1981. Certain libraries with large or important stocks were designated to serve as backup collections; from 1979 more requests went to backups than were provided with locations. The British Library Reference Division has not only supplied photocopies as a backup but begun to lend items held in the Department of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books and the Science Reference Library. Close relations have been maintained with users and with relevant organizations. The acquisitions policy established in 1973 has changed little, though music scores were added in 1974, and rationalization of resources with Reference Division has resulted in a small drop in the number of serials acquired. The British National Book Centre activities of the NCL were merged with the donations activities of the NLLST to form the Gift and Exchange Section. Until 1982 the service was free but economies on staff and resources led to a restricted and priced service. Courses in the use of the scientific literature were extended to other subjects but had to be terminated as an economy measure in 1980. For similar reasons the ad hoc translating service was discontinued at the end of 1981. The cover‐to‐cover translations of (mainly Russian) scientific and technical journals sponsored by the NLLST have continued as part of the Division's extensive publication programme, which now recovers all its costs. Cost recovery increased from a quarter to a half of all expenditure over the period. The Division has kept up with relevant developments in automation and electronic publishing.</jats:p>",

A study of the availability and use of official publications in libraries was carried out in 1981. 565 libraries in 50 countries were sent questionnaires; the response rate was 35%. Most respondents reported a growing volume of official publications and had ambitious collection development policies. Heavy reliance was placed on deposit but purchase was used as the main tool of collection building. Bibliographic control is seriously deficient and presents problems for tracing new publications. The organization of official publications varies between different parts of the world, from complete integration in the main library stock to wholly separate collections — the latter is most common in North America and Africa. Little information was available about the use of official publications. Interlending arrangements did not appear to be a major issue.</jats:p>",

Compactin, (-)-hydroxycitrate and dexamethasone gave rise to a decrease in the rate of cholesterol production in hepatocytes from fed rats by interfering with the flow of substrate into the sterol biosynthetic pathway. The cells responded to the deficit of biosynthetic sterol by increasing the activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase). 2. Compactin and (-)-hydroxycitrate gave similar results in hepatocytes from rats starved for 24 h but in this case dexamethasone had no significant effect. 3. Exogenous oleate interferes with the production of carbohydrate-derived acetyl-CoA and also gives rise initially to opposing effects on the rate of sterol synthesis and HMG-CoA reductase activity. Over a longer period, however, oleate itself was capable of replacing carbohydrate as the major source of carbon for sterol synthesis. 4. The increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity observed when liver cells were incubated in the presence of compactin, (-)-hydroxycitrate or oleate could be partially reversed by the simultaneous presence of glucagon. 5. Under some physiological conditions, a deficiency of biosynthetic cholesterol or of a related precursor may lead to an increase in the activity of HMG-CoA reductase.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1979 a computerized interlending link between Chalmers University of Technology and the British Library Lending Division was developed, based on a system already in operation between the British Library Lending Division and a number of US libraries. A successful pilot evaluation at Chalmers University of Technology led to the decision to test DOCLINE in different Swedish libraries. A comparative study between requests sent via DOCLINE and those sent via the Swedish interlending network showed a satisfaction rate of 83% for the former and 64% for the latter. The main reason for the difference was the greater coverage of material held by the Lending Division. The speed of delivery via DOCLINE was six days and eight days via the Swedish network, however for the latter, requests from smaller institutions are frequently sent via the main library thus involving a delay. The costs for the DOCLINE interlending requests total £3.42 compared with between £5.42 and £6.42 for the Swedish interlending manual procedures. The DOCLINE system is being developed to provide users with statistical and administrative information and as the number of libraries using the system grows, a DOCLINE newsletter is planned. Experiments with telefacsimile transmission between Chalmers University of Technology and the Lending Division have also been operating since November 1982. There is considerable interest from Swedish libraries of many types in the use of the DOCLINE link.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The country is currently experiencing a severe crisis in rental housing, characterized by chronic shortages of units that are available at prices affordable to most renters. Rapidly rising rents, declining construction of new units, and conversion of existing units to nonrental uses are all indicators of this crisis. In this paper we explore three approaches to the problem, finding difficulties with each. Rent control, advocated by tenant groups, is at best a stop-gap measure that eliminates large increases in rents; it fails, however, to provide additional housing. Public sector programs, including both housing allowances and public housing, are especially costly during inflationary periods and therefore are being severely curtailed. Finally, the private sector approach-summed up as \"build more housing\"-is examined in detail, in light of data obtainedfrom 115 self-contained U.S. housing markets in 1970. It is found that contrary to the predictions of supply-side theorists, housing markets characterized by a large amount of new rental housing construction do not have lower rents. Nor is vacancy rate, another indicator of relative supply, found to be associated with rent levels. These findings seriously question the wisdom of housing policies that callfor an end to local land-use and building regulations, under the false belief that such regulations are responsible for artificially restricted supply and hence higher prices and rents. We conclude with some policy suggestions of our own, including the development of such nonmarketplace alternatives to rental housing as limited-equity cooperatives and public utility housing. </jats:p>",

These data were analyzed by using computerized statistical packages. In raw water, densities of acid‐fast organisms correlated with concentrations of total coliforms and the level of turbidity. Sand filtration removed acid‐fast organisms, and the densities of acid‐fast organisms decreased with increasing distance from the treatment plant. Conventional terminal chlorination appeared to have no statistically significant effect on the density of the organisms leaving the plant. Overall, chlorine residuals had a negative effect on densities of acid‐fast organisms, whereas turbidity and TOC had positive effects on microbial concentrations.</jats:p>",
