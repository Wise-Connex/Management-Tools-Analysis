It then discusses the nature of the \"income effect\" and the issues of complementarity and substitutability that arise when government goods are not valued as equivalent income. Finally, it proves that there is no income effect associated with a cut in the income tax rate if and only if preferences are weakly separable between private and government goods and linear in nonleisure private goods. </jats:p>",

Gibb (Lack 1966, Perrins 1979)‐ These results could only have been obtained from a long‐term study and emphasize the value of such studies for our understanding of certain aspects of ecology. In addition, they could not have been obtained by a study of the birds alone, being dependent on a knowledge of their insect food; most of this information was made available as a result of a parallel long‐term study of the insect fauna of the oak trees, made by a number of people from the Hope Department of Entomology, University of Oxford.</jats:p>",

Availability of planktonic cyprid larvae also was measured at site A. There was a strong concordance between cyprid availability and settler density over the main settlement period among intertidal heights, where each was inversely related to intertidal height. Differences in cyprid availability with intertidal height were related to immersion time as the larvae, in general, were uniformly distributed at the water—substratum interface. Settlement rate was strongly correlated with cyprid availability in the low intertidal zone at site A, where most settlement occurred. In all zones at both sites, recruit density at the end of the main settlement period was a positive function of settler density over this period: on average, 79% of the variation in recruit density was explained by settler density over the main settlement period. Adult density and total settler density also tended to be strongly related: 86% (mid zone at site A) and 73% (high zone at site B) of the variation in adult density was explained by total settler density, except where postrecruitment mortality (i.e., predation) was high (e.g., only 1% of the variation in adult density was explained by total settler density in the low zone at site A). Local hydrodynamics, which influences supply and distribution of planktonic larvae, may dictate the distribution of settlers and, ultimately, adults on this shore.</jats:p>",

The nitrogenase activities of these mutants on nitrogen-free minimal medium were two to three times higher than the nitrogenase activity of the wild type. The mutants excreted substantial amounts of ammonia when they were grown either under oxygen-limiting conditions (1 kPa of O\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            ) or aerobically on nitrate or glutamate. The mutants grew well on glutamate as a sole nitrogen source but only poorly on NH\n            <jats:sub>4</jats:sub>\n            Cl. Both mutants failed to incorporate [\n            <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>\n            C]methylamine. We demonstrated that nitrite ammonification occurs in the mutants. Wild-type\n            <jats:italic>A. brasilense</jats:italic>\n            , as well as the mutants, became established in the rhizospheres of axenically grown wheat plants at levels of &gt; 10\n            <jats:sup>7</jats:sup>\n            cells per g of root. The rhizosphere acetylene reduction activity was highest in the preparations containing the mutants. When plants were grown on a nitrogen-free nutritional medium, both mutants were responsible for significant increases in root and shoot dry matter compared with wild-type-treated plants or with noninoculated controls. Total plant nitrogen accumulation increased as well. When they were exposed to a\n            <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>\n            N\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            -enriched atmosphere, both\n            <jats:italic>A. brasilense</jats:italic>\n            mutants incorporated significantly higher amounts of\n            <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>\n            N inside root and shoot material than the wild type did.
