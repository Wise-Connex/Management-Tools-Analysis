      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Environmental management systems and practices have become a necessity in wine supply chains, given their vulnerability to climate change. Climate change could lead to a 55% loss of wine-cultivating land in South Africa by 2050, which would harm the first two tiers of the wine supply chain.Objectives: The objective was to investigate the current environmental systems and practices applied in the first two tiers of the Northern Cape wine supply chain.Method: This qualitative exploratory study was conducted by semi-structured interviews to determine the various environmental management systems and practices adopted by role players. The data collected were analysed by thematic analysis.Results: The results indicated the implementation of an environmental management tool, namely the Integrated Production of Wine scheme. Supportive practices such as water- and energy-wise approaches, soil management and waste management were also identified. Furthermore, a sincere relationship between farmers, cellars and viticulturists results in collaboration based on mutual information sharing and cooperation between role players to reduce their environmental impact.Conclusion: The various environmental management practices and the collaborative approach between role players can serve as an example to other agricultural supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: There is currently a skills mismatch between what the third-party logistics (3PL) industry expects from new supply chain management graduates and what the educational system supplies. As the traditional roles of 3PLs are changing, subsequently increasing their importance within the supply chain industry, supplying graduates with the necessary skills becomes even more critical.Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine what the South African 3PL industry expects from new graduates with a bachelor’s degree in supply chain management or related fields in relation to skills, personal attributes and knowledge.Method: A generic qualitative research design was used to collect data from 12 participants using semi-structured interviews.Results: It was found that academic institutions equip new graduates adequately with knowledge, but not with the expected skills. Furthermore, the findings confirmed the current literature, while also identifying additional expectations. 3PLs expect new graduates to perform various activities throughout the supply chain, such as warehousing and transport activities, while simultaneously using their technological knowledge and abilities to improve different processes within the supply chain. This requires new graduates to be creative, innovative and analytical and to have advanced communication skills. Therefore, supply chain management programmes should provide graduates with more exposure and experiences in real-life supply chain settings.Conclusion: The findings allow for academic institutions to revise and adapt their curricula to meet the need of more practical skills development.</jats:p>"

However, previous literature has mixed results on the relationship between quantity growth and service supply effect of cooperatives. By conducting multiple correspondence analysis, descriptive statistics, and Pearson’s chi-square test on survey data of 785 farmers, this paper aims to describe the characteristics of cooperatives’ members and evaluate the current state of cooperatives’ service supply from a demand-supply perspective. The results of the survey show that male, middle-aged, and middle-class farmers or farmers who plant local optimal crops are more likely to become the members of cooperatives. There is a huge gap between service supply and demand of farmers; cooperatives have a positive effect on reducing the degree of service demand. This effect is only significant when concerning sale, pest control, and mechanization. On the whole, there is a weak correlative relationship between the current service supply of cooperatives and the service demand of farmers in China.</jats:p>"

The marginal distributions of rainfall, reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) and irrigation water are simulated by the corresponding best-fitting cumulative distribution functions. Furthermore, the correlations between every pair of variables are quantified. On this basis, the two-dimensional joint distributions of rainfall and (ET0) (representing natural WSD), and irrigation water and (ET0) (representing man-made WSD), and the three-dimensional joint distribution of rainfall, irrigation water, and (ET0) (representing natural–man-made WSD) are established. The results reveal that the best-fitting marginal distributions for rainfall and (ET0) and irrigation water are the normal distribution and the Weibull distribution. Moreover, for rainfall and (ET0), the Student's t copula is applied to obtain the joint distribution, while the corresponding copula for (ET0) and irrigation water is the Clayton copula. Finally, the three-dimensional Student's t copula is selected to explore the dependence structure among rainfall, irrigation water, and (ET0). Therefore, these joint distributions provide an efficient approach to assess water shortage risks in the irrigation district.</jats:p>",

This is implemented through the implementation of different platforms such as their computer or mobile application − known as omnichannel retailing. Omnichannel grocery retailers are facing several challenges with the last mile of their online supply chain, especially with relation to the home delivery of groceries.Objectives: The purpose of the article was to gain an understanding of the nature of last-mile logistical challenges hindering the efficiency of an omnichannel grocery retailer in South Africa.Method: A qualitative methodology was employed; data were collected through an interview with the e-commerce operation manager of a well-known omnichannel grocery retailer in South Africa as well as through two focus group discussions conducted with consumers who regularly purchase items online and those who have never purchased any item online. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.Results: The findings suggested that there are four major last-mile logistical challenges facing the South African omnichannel grocery retailer considered in this study. The challenges are reliable order fulfilment, cold distribution chain requirements, physical distribution and reverse logistics.Conclusion: The findings of this article suggest that many of the last-mile challenges experienced by the omnichannel grocery retailer stem from the inefficient management of information (data) along the supply chain.

There is no evidence that promoting alternative development as part of global drug control strategy has a noticeable effect on use. Other interventions far up the distribution chain have produced transient market disruptions sufficient to affect drug use and related health outcomes The little evidence that exists suggests that policies focused on apprehension and extended periods of incarceration for high-level drug dealers have diminishing returns. Nor is local or street-level enforcement a viable strategy for reducing drug use because of the large numbers drug dealers involved. Nevertheless, supply-control interventions absorb the bulk of drug control spending in most nations.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Managing supply chain volatility (SCV) is often identified as one of the major challenges of modern supply chain management. While research has predominantly focused on describing the multidimensional areas of SCV and its negative impacts, clear guidelines on how to manage SCV for efficiency, and prioritize the areas on which to focus, are sparse. This study seeks to fill this gap in the research by: (1) assessing the relative impact of SCV sources, and (2) proposing means to deal with them. Based on an Analytical Hierarchy Process conducted with 17 SCM practitioners, the paper assesses the relative impact of sources of SCV, and further contextualizes them according to factors such as product lead time and production strategy, providing more fine-grained insights for SC managers seeking to manage SCV. Subsequently, the paper applies the Nominal Group Technique with the same group of practitioners in order to identify and condense strategies for dealing with the most impactful sources of SCV (intra-organizational misalignment, inaccurate forecasting, long lead times, erratic behavior of decision makers in the supply chain, erratic behavior of customers, and high level of competition), leading to a set of 44 SCV-management strategies.</jats:p>"

This study aims to identify opportunities for improving supply chain performance by quantifying the impact of suppliers on the supply chain. An analysis was conducted in two phases. First, the efficiency of 139 partners that supply automobile components to the Hyundai Motor Company was measured using the Charnes–Cooper–Rhodes model, while the efficiency of Hyundai Motor Company’s 540 supply chains comprising partners, subsidiaries, and parent companies was measured using the network epsilon-based measure model. Second, the relationship between the partner efficiency and the supply chain efficiency was analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test and the Tobit regression model. The results showed that efficient operation of partners hampers the efficiency of the total supply chain. Thus, there may be several partners that are not committed to quality improvement, while the Hyundai Motor Company seeks to promote quality management through win–win cooperation with partners. Consequently, automakers must review their partner management system, including their performance measurement and incentive systems.</jats:p>"

Proper asset management and efficient rehabilitation planning require monitoring, condition assessment, degradation risk analysis and a data-based model for degradation forecasting to support investment decision-making and significantly reduce the infrastructure rehabilitation cost. This paper presents a statistical and stochastic spatial data analysis of failure records of the WDS of the City of Wattrelos, France. The research objective is to develop and demo-illustrate the application of an operator's experience-based Risk Assessment Method (RAM) for network micro-zone prioritization of rehabilitation/replacement works to optimize preemptive asset management. The data used is a 74-year historical dataset from Wattrelos, France. The database includes approximately 424 observed failures for the period of 1991–2004. The data analysis demonstrates that understanding and using stochastic modeling to characterize the pattern of relationship between Failure Rate (FR), Age (T) and the Probability (or Risk) of exceeding a specific Failure Rate (Pr(FR)) of a micro-zone can effectively support the operator's assessment, risk management and prioritization in the maintenance and rehabilitation of the WDS.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we provide a welfare ranking for the equilibria of the supply function and quantity competitions in a differentiated product duopoly with demand uncertainty. We prove that the expected consumer surplus is always higher under the supply function competition, irrespective of whether the (duopolistic) products are substitutes, complements, or independent. Numerical simulations suggest that if the products are either complements or independent, or if they have an extremely low degree of substitution, then the supply function competition can always be Pareto superior to the quantity competition in terms of the producers’ and consumers’ welfares. Moreover, if the degree of product substitution is not extremely low, then the supply function competition can be Pareto superior to the quantity competition if and only if the size of the demand uncertainty is sufficiently large to exceed a critical level. We find that this critical level of demand uncertainty becomes higher when the duopolistic products are less differentiated. Additionally, this critical level is nonincreasing both in the marginal cost of producing a unit output and in the own-price sensitivity of each inverse demand curve when all other parameters are fixed. Our results imply that in electricity markets with differentiated products, the regulators should not intervene to impose the quantity competition in favor of the supply function competition unless the degree of product substitution is sufficiently high and the predicted demand fluctuations are sufficiently small.</jats:p>"

Appropriate habitat conditions for multiple and abundant incidence of flora and fauna are still missing. Existing water bodies, particularly in urban areas, are extremely affected by anthropogenic-induced pressures, resulting in reinforced river bottoms and river banks. In such regions, river rehabilitation is a challenging task and often requires a step by step approach to alter the given conditions. Nevertheless, work must be done and may create successful results as in the case of the Sprockhoevel creek. Over recent years this 11-km-long river in the western and industrialised part of the Ruhr River basin has partly been changed in shape to better resemble nature. Such change implies the widening of the river bed, the improvement of the river bottom by inserting natural gravel substrate, the removal of drop structures and the construction of a new river bed. Presently, this part of the river has again become a valuable habitat for aquatic life. Moreover, the area surrounding the rehabilitated Sprockhoevel creek is now also attractive for the neighbourhood community. Rehabilitation projects have the additional effects of reconnecting people to nature, encouraging public interest in near-natural aquatic systems, and catalysing further investments in similar projects.</jats:p>",

Computational analysis of the test rig was performed using two methods — the finite element method and a multi-body approach. The calculations of pressure distribution in journal bearings were also performed applying two methods — the finite difference method and the finite element method. The results of the analysis are properly introduced and discussed at the end of this paper. The results suggest that a yet unknown sub-synchronous component may appear under specific conditions. The component typically appears at frequency 0.9–0.98 of shaft speed and is likely caused by a location of a bore for oil supply.</jats:p>",

In this study, a water deficit event was assumed to be a rectangle composed of the deficit duration and deficit intensity whose occurrence probability was then estimated by the bivariate frequency analysis based on the copula method. This approach is different from the conventional one based on the assumption of the same occurrence probability for all events. This proposed method was applied to the Namgang dam in Korea as an example and the resulting estimate of the vulnerability was compared with the conventional method. First, the ‘OR’ concept was found to be better than the ‘AND’ concept in the calculation of the occurrence probability. Additionally, based on the consideration of multicollinearity, it could be concluded that the occurrence probability should be estimated by considering the water deficit intensity and duration. For the Namgang dam, the vulnerability was determined to be 9.11 × 106 m3, which is about 3% of the total storage capacity. This estimated vulnerability is also about 70% of the amount estimated by applying the conventional method with the same occurrence probability for all water deficit events.</jats:p>"

As such, the government resorts to private partnership to fund the gaps in the urban water supply in the country. The study adopted an integrative multi-stage critical review of relevant literature on public-private partnership in urban water supply. As such articles published between 2006 and 2017 were selected by specific inclusion criteria. Relevant articles on the topic were identified through references and citations. The paper examines the status and trend of water supply, reforms and management of urban water supply in Ghana. The study found problems like poor water supply system, inadequate human and economic resources as well as poor resource allocations and urban water management. </jats:p>"

In this sense, the goal of this study is to assess the vulnerability of the Campeche Aquifer (Florianopolis, Brazil), identifying potential areas of possible contamination by the direct infiltration of runoff in drainage compensatory techniques. To achieve this goal, the following methodological steps were used: (1) data collection and preparation, (2) application of the DRASTIC model, (3) sensitivity analysis and (4) analysis of potential contamination by compensatory techniques. The results show that approximately 33% of the aquifer area presented moderate vulnerability to contamination. However, 29% of the remaining areas had high and extremely high vulnerability. Analysing the potential of contamination with drainage compensatory structures we verified that approximately 95% of them are located in areas of vulnerability classified as moderate and high. The other 5% were identified in areas with extremely high vulnerability. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the removal of topography, soil type and the impact of the vadose zone caused a large variation in vulnerability index. It is evident that there is a high potential of contamination of groundwater by direct infiltration of drainage compensatory structures.</jats:p>",

This study offers a skill-centered, industry-level overview of this uneven landscape. Familiar data sources (input–output tables, industry–occupation matrices, and occupational skill profiles) are used to analyze skill demand across the U.S. automotive cluster. The author shows that the automotive industry depends on the high-level manufacturing skills of intermediate goods suppliers and highlights that the lower wages in these and lower-tier supply sectors may impede skill regeneration and upgrading. Economic and workforce development practitioners can use this analysis to begin or reinvigorate skill-centric conversations with employers in high- and low-skill sectors. Industry leaders can use it to demonstrate the extent to which larger firms rely on the skills of their supply network and to motivate investments in skill development across the supply chain. </jats:p>",

Thus, simultaneous design of the product family and the supply chain network is required. This design problem must be assessed in terms of strategic-level decision making under uncertainties without any detailed and fixed information on the design conditions. We therefore propose a mathematical framework by considering the optimal profitability and robustness against destructive incidences. This paper discusses the design problem structure and formulates it as a mixed-integer programming problem. A computational method is configured for solving the optimization problem, in which only profitability is considered as the objective. A procedure to assess the robustness of the profitability-oriented optimal solution is proposed by evaluating the Pareto optimality among the nominal optimal solution and its competitive solutions. A case study of a coffee maker product family design problem is demonstrated to verify the proposed framework.</jats:p>",

Numerous solutions are available to make the line current almost sinusoidal. This paper deals with the inclusion of passive PFC in the interleaved Fly back SMPS to improve the power factor.

Given the environmental and public health implications of poor water supply, there is a strong practical need to understand how and why intermittent supply occurs, and what strategies may be used to move utilities towards the provision of continuous water supply. Leveraging data from the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities, we discover 42 variables that have statistically significant associations with intermittent water supply at the utility scale across 2115 utilities. We categorized these under the following themes: Physical infrastructure system scale, coverage, consumer type, public water points, financial, and non-revenue water and metering. This research identifies globally relevant factors with high potential for cross-context, scaled impact. In addition, using insights from the analysis, we provide empirically grounded recommendations and data needs for improved global indicators of utility performance related to intermittent supply.</jats:p>"

The positions that they occupy in supply chain are susceptible to many forms of sustainability challenges that can obstruct and discourage them from efficiently participating in global supply chains. Despite the critical role of rural women entrepreneurs in the West African subregion has been acknowledged by many, yet the majority of them have not been participated in responsible and sustainable supply chains. In view of these issues, multi-stakeholders are required to collaborate and intervene by developing processes of enrolling rural women entrepreneurs into sustainable supply chain networks. This study presents a case study related to an exploration of the enrolment process utilizing the four moments of translation of the Actor Network Theory (ANT) in the context of the shea butter industry with a cross-border supply chain network. The research found that the enrolment process is shaped by the collaborative relationships within the external context which comprises of several influential stakeholders. Sustainability standards are found to have great potential to serve as an obligatory passage point to transmit sustainability principles to the women within and outside the traditional supply chain networks.</jats:p>"

The customers’ decisions on whether to wait or leave depend on the quotations. This is an assembly system with partial lost sales, where the interaction between the quotation policy and the inventory policy is complicated. We consider either a uniform or an adaptive quotation policy and either an independent or a modified S policy to control the inventory. Under the independent S policy, we show that the multiple-supplier system can be converted into a one-supplier system, which enables us to devise an efficient simulation algorithm to identify the optimal parameters of this policy. Under the modified S policy, the suppliers can be rearranged into a serial system, but given the tedious computational nature of the modified S policy, we propose a dynamic programming–based heuristic, which is efficient and accurate, to identify the optimal parameters of this policy. Finally, we consider the decentralized setting, for which we propose a coordination mechanism that requires the contractor to impose a penalty for the suppliers’ stockouts and to provide a subsidy for the suppliers’ inventory. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1704 . </jats:p>",

In this work, the effect of the position and the number of trays on the water productivity of a multi-effect still has been experimentally investigated for the first time. A plate was used, then placed in different heights, and then two and three and finally four trays were used. It is concluded that the effect of the tray position has a great influence on the production of distilled water in contrast to the number of trays, and when increasing the number of trays, the production of the distilled water is increased. The maximum production obtained from distilled water is 1 l/h.m². The use of a solar panel for the production of distilled water is unnecessary in oil-producing countries where energy is subsidized. These devices or their components are generally imported and their cost is very expensive. The damping time of these devices is very long.</jats:p>",

In the second experiment, soybean plants (BMX Ativa cultivar) were sprayed with calcium on the leaves and flowers at R1 or R3 growth stages. Subsequently, the plants were maintained or not under a 50-percent shade protection during flowering stage. Calcium spraying on soybean leaves or flowers during the flowering stage did not increase pod set, number of seeds, or grain yield. The calcium content in soybean flowers is not affected by foliar application thereof.</jats:p>"

Remarkably, these ascites tumor cells can transiently take up glucose an order of magnitude faster than the steady high rate measured by Warburg for hours.</ns4:p><ns4:p><ns4:bold>Methods:</ns4:bold>The purpose of the transiently very high glucose uptake is investigated here with a computational model of glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and ATP consumption which reproduces short kinetic experiments on the ascites tumor cells as well as the long-lasting Warburg, Crabtree and Pasteur effects. The model, extended with equations for glucose and O<ns4:sub>2</ns4:sub> transport in tissue, is subsequently used to predict metabolism in tumor cells during fluctuations of tissue blood flow resulting in cycling hypoxia.</ns4:p><ns4:p><ns4:bold>Results:</ns4:bold>The model analysis suggests that the head section of the glycolytic chain in the tumor cells is partially inhibited in about a minute when substantial amounts of glucose have been taken up intracellularly; this head section of the glycolytic chain is subsequently disinhibited slowly when concentrations of glycolytic intermediates are low. Based on these dynamic characteristics, simulations of tissue with fluctuating O<ns4:sub>2</ns4:sub>and glucose supply predict that tumor cells greedily take up glucose when this periodically becomes available, leaving very little for other cells. The glucose is stored as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and other glycolytic intermediates, which are used for ATP production during   O<ns4:sub>2</ns4:sub>and glucose shortages.</ns4:p><ns4:p><ns4:bold>Conclusions:</ns4:bold>The head section of glycolysis which phosphorylates glucose may be dynamically regulated and takes up glucose at rates exceeding the Warburg effect if glucose levels have been low for some time. The hypothesis is put forward here that dynamic regulation of the powerful glycolytic enzyme system in tumors is used to buffer oxygen and nutrient fluctuations in tissue.</ns4:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies sourcing decisions of firms in a multitier supply chain when procurement is subject to disruption risk. We argue that features of the production process that are commonly encountered in practice (including differential production technologies and financial constraints) may result in the formation of inefficient supply chains, owing to the misalignment of the sourcing incentives of firms at different tiers. We provide a characterization of the conditions under which upstream suppliers adopt sourcing strategies that are suboptimal from the perspective of firms further downstream. Our analysis highlights that a focus on optimizing procurement decisions in each tier of the supply chain in isolation may not be sufficient for mitigating risks at an aggregate level. Rather, we argue that a holistic view of the entire supply network is necessary to properly assess and secure against disruptive events. Importantly, the misalignment we identify does not originate from cost or reliability asymmetries. Rather, firms’ sourcing decisions are driven by the interplay of the firms’ risk considerations with nonconvexities in the production process. This implies that bilateral contracts that could involve under-delivery penalties may be insufficient to align incentives. </jats:p><jats:p> The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1708 . </jats:p>",

In this paper, polypropylene fibers, in lieu of the commonly used polyamide fibers, were tested for constructing filtration modules containing parallel fibers. The studied fibers were analyzed by means of scanning electronic microscopy and through solubility assays in hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide, aiming to evaluate the risks of using them as filtering media. Three polypropylene filters with different lengths (25, 60, and 100 cm) were constructed and fed with the same raw synthetic water. In-line coagulation was applied by addition of aluminum sulfate (22.5 mg·L−1) and filtration rates from 20 to 80 m·h−1 were evaluated. Filtrates with less than 0.5 NTU could be produced by both 60 and 100 cm filters, operating at 80 m·h−1. High filtration rates, as well as significant backwashing water and air flows, could be applied to flexible fiber filters made of polypropylene, which shows their promising applications.</jats:p>",

We use a difference-in-differences (DID) methodology, evaluated using county-level data, to empirically test whether New York’s recent business tax reforms significantly reduce unemployment, beyond what would exist in the absence of the reforms. We fail to find significant evidence that START-UP NY affects unemployment during the period studied, 2014-2017.  We do, however, find evidence suggesting that New York lowering its corporate tax rates in 2016 is associated with a large reduction in unemployment (by approximately 90,000 jobs) in 2016 and a smaller reduction (by approximately 25,000 jobs) in 2017.</jats:p>"

With rising greener customer expectations and increasingly stringent environmental regulations, green supply chains are now viewed as another competitive weapon. Green supply chains are characterized by higher complexity and turbulence. Green supply chain flexibility can aid organizations function in this complex and uncertain environment, yet investigation into this area is very limited. This paper aims contribute to this field by investigating green supply chain flexibility achievement through information systems. This paper introduces a green supply chain flexibility matrix framework. Given the large data needs, as described in the matrix, a novel probability evaluation methodology that can help predict rankings of projects and programs is introduced. The methodology extends a TOPSIS based three-parameter interval grey number (TpGN) approach by incorporating neighborhood rough set theory (RST) to evaluate IS programs’ green flexibility support capability. The results of this methodology are more objective and effective for two reasons. (1) The results are predictive rankings based on probability degree instead of the fixed deterministic ranks. (2) Neighborhood rough set theory used in this study can limit loss of information when compared to rough set theory, yet still simplify extensive data sets. This paper also identifies study limitations and future research directions for green supply chain flexibility.</jats:p>"

According to grain yields there have been identified such valuable for definite conditions hybrids as: ‘Ze 235’ with 5.0 t/ha and ‘Ze 428’ with 6.55 t/ha (ARC “Donskoy”, Zernograd); ‘Ze 182’ with 9.02 t/ha (ARRI of maize, Pyatigorsk); ‘Ze 286’ with 4.92 t/ha (RCG named after P.P. Lukiyanenko, Krasnodar); ‘Ze 428’ with 7.61 t/ha (RPE “Semenovodstvo Kubani”, v. of Ladozhskaya, Krasnodar Area); ‘Ze 331’ with 10.1 t/ha (Agrofirm “Otbor”, v. of Komsomolsky); ‘Ze 428’ with 6.55 t/ha (RusRC “Rossorgo”, Saratov). For the arid conditions there has been recommended the hybrid ‘Ze 428’ with 5.11 t/ha of grain on average at the points with insufficient moisture supply. For the conditions of sufficien moisture supply there has been recommended the hybrid ‘Ze 331’ with 8.06 t/ha at the points with high moisture supply. The new hybrids ‘Ze 182’, ‘Ze 236’, ‘Ze 285’, ‘Ze 286’, ‘Ze 331’, ‘Ze 332’, ‘Ze 333’, ‘Ze 427’, ‘Ze 428’ have been characterized with high responsiveness on the change of growing conditions, regression coefficient (bi) was 1.42–2.02; the hybrid ‘Ze 235’ is found to be an ecologically adaptable genotype (bi = 1). All hybrids belong to ecologically stable genotypes (σd2=0,13–0,74). The hybrids ‘Ze 235’ and ‘Ze 331’ showed the highest index of drought tolerance (72.7 and 67.3% respectively). The early ripening hybrid ‘Ze 182’ (FAO 180), the middle-ripening hybrid ‘Ze 286’ (FAO 250), the middle ripening hybrid ‘Ze 331’ (FAO 300) and the middle-late hybrid ‘Ze 428’ (FAO 400) are the most promising hybrids for practical use according to such their economic-valuable traits as grain productivity, harvesting moisture of grain, resistance to lodging, resistance to smut viruses and ear attachment height.</jats:p>"

It also uses paradigms of simulation modeling, which are suitable for risk assessment and management. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected through a literature review and details of specific construction projects, respectively. A dynamic modeling method was used, and the model was provided with an event-based simulation.

Using event-based simulation, it was found that construction delays influence both the magnitude and the probability of disruption. This method contributes to the existing theoretical foundations of risk management practices, since it also considers the time factor. This method supplements the Monte Carlo statistical simulation method, which has no time representation. Using empirical analysis, the study proposes increasing the safety stock of construction materials at the distribution center, so as to mitigate risks in the construction supply chain.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The research considers a single case of a hypothetical construction project.

Canada’s system of supply management in dairy, eggs, and poultry, however, remains intact despite being a polarizing topic both nationally and abroad. To better understand the ideological rift that exists between those who support and oppose the system, this article examines the creation of the Ontario Milk Marketing Board (OMMB) in 1965, which introduced fairer producer pricing and production discipline through the establishment of milk pools. Before the OMMB was created, chronic oversupplies of milk resulted in devastatingly low milk prices paid to farmers, which caused significant distress in the dairy community. This article examines the divisions between industry stakeholders during the implementation of the milk marketing board in order to better understand why some saw the board’s plans as rational and fair, while others believed OMMB policies infringed on their freedom and retarded the rationalization of the Ontario dairy industry.</jats:italic>\n        </jats:p>"

We examine the commercial charcoal commodity chain from its production in Ucayali, in the Peruvian Amazon, to its sale in the national market. Using a mixed-methods approach, we look at the actors involved in the commodity chain and their relationships, including the distribution of benefits along the chain. We outline the obstacles and opportunities for a more equitable charcoal supply chain within a multi-level governance context. The results show that charcoal provides an important livelihood for most of the actors along the supply chain, including rural poor and women. We find that the decentralisation process in Peru has implications for the formalisation of charcoal supply chains, a traditionally informal, particularly related to multi-level institutional obstacles to equitable commerce. This results in inequity in the supply chain, which persecutes the poorest participants and supports the most powerful actors.</jats:p>"

This literature review tries to highlight a possible framework for exploratory analyses that aim at associating sustainability with the geographical proximity of food supply chains. The purpose of the article is identifying a set of communicative and information-dense indicators for use by evaluators. Bread is the selected test food, given its importance in human nutrition and the relevance of some of its life cycle phases for land use (cereal farming) and trade (cereal commercialization). Article searching (including keyword selection, explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria, and computer-assisted screening using the NVivo® software) was carried out over the Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases, and returned 29 documents (refereed and non-refereed publications). The retrieved literature shows varied research focus, methods, and depth of analyses. The review highlighted 39 environmental, 36 economic, and 27 social indicators, along the food chain. Indicators’ reporting chains are heterogeneous; even the comparison of standard procedures, e.g., Life Cycle Assessment, is not straightforward. Holistic approaches are missing.</jats:p>"

Based on game theory, the decision-making behavior and profits of a competitive supply chain consisting of a green manufacturer, a regular manufacturer, and a retailer are analyzed under both funding schemes. The results show that while both government subsidy and greening cost-sharing contract can achieve the goals of increasing a product’s degree of greenness and increasing the sales of green products, there are differences between these two methods in reaching these goals. Further, both via theoretical and numerical analysis, we find that although both the green manufacturer and the retailer can greatly benefit from government subsidy and greening cost-sharing contract, they may have different preferences regarding these two methods, which are mainly related to the size of the government subsidy, the fraction of greening cost-sharing with the retailer, the Research and Development (R&amp;D) cost coefficient, the greenness sensitivity coefficient, and price sensitivity coefficient. Finally, the supply chain members’ behaviors (including the production and pricing decisions and, the choice of funds investment) are largely affected by the government subsidy mechanism.</jats:p>"

As women shift their hours from the home sector to the market sector, goods that were previously produced in the home may be replaced by market services. This paper uses the Panel Study for Income Dynamics, Consumer Expenditure Survey, and the American Time Use Survey to analyze the extent to which households replace home production with purchased market services, and how the relationship between men’s and women’s labor supplies affects these decisions. We show that women who are employed spend less time on home production activities that have close market alternatives than women who are not employed. Additionally, expenditures on market services that can replace home production are higher for married households in which the woman is employed compared to those with nonworking women.</jats:p>",

Although there has been no significant change in India's rainfall pattern in the last 100 years, there is a spatial non-uniformity in the rainfall events that occur which makes it difficult to pre-plan large-scale water storage at different locations. This study highlights the fact that there is enough water available but the deficiency is in storage. A large portion of freshwater from river systems, groundwater and wetlands drains into the sea due to insufficient storage facilities. Coastal reservoirs enable the storage of excess river flood waters near the coast for future use. This paper discusses current water supply solutions available in the country, and the efficacy of coastal reservoirs along with feasibility implications. The associated rewards and challenges are also discussed. The paper presents details of existing coastal reservoirs worldwide and recent feasibility studies envisaging coastal reservoirs in India.</jats:p>",

This paper applies the set pair theory of entropy weight to evaluate the uncertainty involved. A preliminary classification of samples is conducted by calculating the connection degree of each evaluation index, and then uniform, differential and confrontational analyses of set pairs are carried out on the samples to identify their level. In identifying the weight of each evaluation index, the entropy value theory of information theory is introduced into the model. Combined with Tarim 2004 to 2007 water resource data, an evaluation of the sustainable water resource utilization in this region is made from the social and economic, water resource and ecological environmental water resource evaluation index system. The results show that the development and utilization of water resources in the Sanyuanliu region of Tarim are saturated, and the utilization of water resources in the Hotan region (III), Aksu region (III) and Kashgar region (III) appears to be unsustainable. After a comparison with other methods, it is concluded that the evaluation result provided by the method is reasonable and objective.</jats:p>",

The adoption of farm innovations in these countries has proven to be quintessential to the attainment of self-sufficiency in supply food including rice. Nonetheless, the adoption of farm innovations has been challenging. This paper, therefore, analyses the factors that influence the number of farm innovations adopted by rice farmers in two districts of the Upper East Region of Ghana using the Poisson model. The result indicated that the adoption of individual farm innovations was low. The study showed that farm size, labour input, experience in rice farming, access to extension services, and access to credit exerted significant positive effects on the number of farm innovations adopted, whereas farmer age and distance to market tended to decrease the number of farm innovations used by rice farmers. The study concludes that increasing the number of farm innovations adopted tends to promote a sustainable supply of rice output; therefore, food policy should aim at promoting the adoption of different farm innovations in developing countries including Ghana.</jats:p>"

The paper begins by reviewing and proposing an analysis of the definition and characterization of intermittent water supply (IWS), highlighting some important findings. The diversity of approaches used to address the issue and the difficulty of defining a precise and detailed history of water supply in the affected systems broadens the spectrum of intermittency characterization and the problems it raises. The underlined results are then used to structure an evaluation framework for the water service and to develop improvement paths defined in the intermittent networks. The resulting framework highlights the means available to water stakeholders to assess their operational and management performance in achieving the improvement objectives defined by the environmental and socio-economic contexts in which the network operates. Practical examples of intermittent system management are collected from water system operators and presented for illustration purposes (Jeddah, Algiers, Port-au-Prince, Amman, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Mexico, Cancun, Saltillo, Mumbai, Delhi, Coimbatore …).</jats:p>"

The new technologies have led to swiftly expanding markets for REE products, in which China has achieved a monopolistic role in all segments of the REE value chains. Political strategies aimed to establish REE supplies outside China are currently being implemented within the EU and in other Western countries in order to ensure an adequate future REE supply. However, new REE value chains outside China have not yet materialised. The aim of this paper is to assess whether the global REE supply from present and potential mines can keep pace with the REE demand for the expanding offshore wind energy sector (Fig. 1). A successful development of this sector outside China relies on an adequate supply of particularly neodymium (Nd) and to some extent praseodymium (Pr), terbium (Tb) and dysprosium (Dy), used in permanent magnets for windmill generators. In 2015, about 82% of the global Nd-oxide production was used in the permanent magnets production (Adamas 2016). Here we evaluate the future supply and demand situations for Nd, Pr, Tb and Dy in the global wind energy sector in the form of three scenarios, one for 2020 and two for 2030 based on high and low demand. The balance is discussed. Our assessment reflects the challenge caused by limited insight into the REE supply chains inside China, and the figures presented in this paper are therefore only indicative.</jats:p>"

In the presence of bankruptcy risk for the retailer, we model their strategic interaction as a Stackelberg game with the supplier as the leader and analyze the optimal decisions for each participant. Regardless of which financing mode is chosen, the capital-constrained retailer orders fewer goods if the financing cost is relatively high. In addition, when the market demand obeys the uniform distribution, if the retailer possesses more collateral assets, he will enjoy a lower loan interest rate and increase order quantity gradually. Moreover, compared with the internal financing mode, each participant obtains the larger expected profits under the external financing mode.</jats:p>"

Water-treatment plants have large ecological footprints and operational costs, making the availability of high-quality water in developing areas almost impossible, due to lack of resources and infrastructure. Indeed, &gt;2 billion people are exposed to diseases caused by contaminated water. Clearly, bringing safe, clean drinking water to people’s homes is essential to a good quality of life. Clay minerals may offer technologies and innovative practices which would help to develop a reliable, low-maintenance device with a small environmental footprint that processes stream, lake, or pond water into high-quality potable water. The basis for such technologies has already been established and improved approaches are being introduced on an ongoing basis by clay scientists: nanocomposite pre-treatment and disinfection, photodegradation of organic pollutants using clay-based catalysts, polishing of inorganic contaminants, and removal of biological pathogens by adsorption or deactivation onto specifically designed clay-based filters, <jats:italic>etc</jats:italic>.

Choice of marketing relationship is the bane of most agricultural commodity supply chains in Northern Ghana.  The type of relationship agreed between farmers and buyers determines the form of delivery of a commodity. Buyers identified included retailers, itinerant traders and wholesalers. Identified marketing relationship was either on contract or spot buying with access to credit, membership to farmer association, experience and price as drivers of marketing relationship. In terms of marketing relationships, 57% of the farmers’ commodities are based on agreed contract while 43% commodities are without any binding contract. Age, price, access to credit, membership of farmer association, education and farmers’ experience are the factors influencing contracting or otherwise in established commodity supply chain in Northern Ghana. Soybean production and utilization has the potential to draw the youth into agriculture and government and private partners should intervene with the commercialization supply chains with strong contract relationships in the supply chain. </jats:p>"

The proposed technique integrates together a self-tuning-filter (STF) and direct-quadrature-zero (dq0) principle (referred here as STF-dq0), allowing the controlled shunt active power filter (SAPF) to perform effectively under distorted source voltages and unbalanced load conditions. Unlike the previous technique developed based on the standard dq0 principle, the proposed technique does not require any service from a phase-locked loop (PLL) where two STFs are applied to separate harmonic and fundamental elements for the purpose of generating synchronization phases and reference current, respectively. Simulation work which includes connection of the SAPF circuits, design of control techniques and all the necessary assessments are conducted in MATLAB-Simulink platform. Performance achieved by the SAPF while utilizing the proposed technique is thoroughly investigated and benchmarked with that demonstrated by the SAPF while using the standard dq0 technique, to evaluate the inherent advantages. Exhaustive simulation results are provided and thoroughly discussed to support design concept, effectiveness, and benefits of the proposed technique.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study a hybrid strategy that uses both process flexibility and finished goods inventory for supply chain risk mitigation. The interplay between process flexibility and inventory is modeled as a two‐stage robust optimization problem. In the first stage, the firm allocates inventory before disruption happens; in the second stage, after a disruption happens, the firm determines production quantities at each plant to minimize demand loss. Our robust optimization model can be solved efficiently using constraint generation, and under some stylized assumptions, can be solved in closed form. For a canonical family of flexibility designs known as the K‐chains, we provide an analytical expression for the optimal inventory solution, which allows us to study the effectiveness of different degrees of flexibilities. Moreover, we find that firms should allocate more inventory to high variability products when its level of flexibility is low, but as flexibility increases, the inventory allocation pattern “flips” and firms should allocate more inventory to low variability products. These observations are further verified through a numerical case study of an automobile supply chain. Finally, we extend our robust optimization model to the time‐to‐survive metric, a metric that computes the longest time a supply chain can guarantee a predetermined service level under disruption. </jats:p>",

The success of fast-moving consumer goods companies (FMCGs) has a direct relationship with the performance of the leading retailers, which are their main channel of distribution. The supply chain of the leading South African food FMCGs and the corresponding retail chain stores was studied with the aim of establishing that collaboration and integration enhanced the response to the customers’ requirements. The study was grounded on collaboration and integration theory, and a qualitative research methodology was used. Non-probability sampling was used, and senior managers selected from the two types of firms were interviewed. The data collected was transcribed, coded and thematically interpreted using content analysis. The outcome of the study indicated that supply chain collaboration and integration of the FMCG retailers, enhanced response to the customers’ requirements.</jats:p>"

Gold Coin Indonesia-Medan merupakan perusahaan yang bergerak dalam industri pakan ternakmemiliki rantai distribusi dari Central Supply Facilities (CSF) di Medan ke Distribution Center (DC) yangberada di Aceh, Sumatera Utara, Sumatera Barat dan Riau serta Kepulauan Riau. Proses pendistribusianmengalami kendala dalam proyeksi permintaan pada masing-masing DC pada masa yang akan datang sebabmasih cenderung menggunakan metode estimasi dan trial and error. Hal ini menyebabkan terjadinyaketerlambatan pengiriman dan kekurangan jumlah produk pada DC sehingga tidak terpenuhinya permintaanpelanggan. Manajemen rantai pasok (Supply Chain Management) yang ada tidak berjalan lancar karenamengalami kendala pada rantai pasok manufaktur dan distribusi tersebut. Oleh karena itu, penulis mengambiljudul penelitian “Perancangan Konsep Distribution Resource Planning (DRP) Dalam Mendukung Sistem SupplyChain Management (SCM) Pada PT. Gold Coin Indonesia – Medan.”Penyelesaian permasalahan pendistribusiandilakukan dengan melakukan peramalan (forecasting) data permintaan pada setiap DC, melakukan perhitunganorder quantity, perhitungan frekuensi pemesanan, perhitungan safety stock, dan penyusunan DRP worksheet.Konsep DRP memberikan aliran produk dari CSF ke setiap DC pada waktu dan jumlah yang sudah terintegrasi,sehingga dapat menjaga kelancaran pengiriman produk dalam memenuhi kebutuhan atau permintaan sertameningkatkan pelayanan terhadap pelanggan melalui perencanaan pendistribusian yang memproyeksikankebutuhan yang akan datang sehingga dapat mengurangi stock out. Penggunaan Distribution Resource Planning(DRP) menyebakan penurunan biaya distribusi sebesar Rp. 58,443,442;- atau 10 % dari kondisi aktualperusahaan selama ini. Perhitungan safety stock dilakukan sebagai acuan pemesanan kembali pada masingmasingDC. Hasil perhitungan safety stock untuk masing-masing DC adalah DC 1 sebanyak 46 ton, DC 2sebanyak 58 ton, DC 3 sebanyak 58 ton, dan DC 4 sebanyak 120 ton. Sedangkan untuk order quantity yangdiperoleh untuk masing-masing DC adalah DC 1 sebanyak 852 ton, DC 2 sebanyak 504 ton, DC 3 sebanyak 470ton, dan DC 4 sebanyak 360 ton. Dengan jumlah pemesanan sebagai berikut Jumlah pemesanan untuk masingmasingDC selama 13 periode yaitu DC 1 sebanyak 4 kali, DC 2 sebanyak 4 kali, DC 3 sebanyak 4 kali, dan DC4 sebanyak 8 kali. Hal ini dapat meminimalkan biaya distribusi.</jats:p>"

We assume that each water supply chain consists of a risk-neutral water supplier and a risk-neutral water distributor. We build different decision models for two competitive water resources supply chains, derive the optimal decision strategies for the water supply chain members, and analyze how competition intensity affects these decisions. Analytical results show that when the supplier is the leader, its water wholesale price is always higher than that when the distributor serves as the leader. On the other hand, the retail price and the two supply chains’ channel profits depend on the competition intensity, but are independent of the power structure. To illustrate the proposed models, we apply them to examine the water pricing strategies in the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China. The results showed significant insights into the pricing strategies of water resources in different routes of this massive water diversion project.</jats:p>"

Through assessing the degree of thermal stratification by calculating the dimensionless parameter of thermal resistance to mixing (RTRM) indices from 2008 to 2010, it indicated that the water body of Xiangxi River was stratified strongly in the summer months. The analysis of the degree of thermal stratification with both the meteorological and hydrodynamic factors showed thermal stratification intensity was more sensitive to meteorological factors in Xiangxi River. Through the analysis of the relationship between thermal stratification and water quality, the results indicated that the concentration of Chlorophyll a was higher in the epilimnion affected by the thermal stratification, which could cause algal bloom. The results may further help to evaluate the thermal stratification role in eutrophication process and algal bloom formation in Xiangxi River.</jats:p>",

The results shows that the price of dual-channel of retailer decreased with the increase of retailers’ risk- aversion coefficient and the standard deviation of the fluctuation of market demand, while the wholesale price changes is on the contrary; in addition, when the market demand is greater than a certain value, the prices of dual channel are correspondingly higher in decentralized supply chain than in centralized supply chain, and vice versa. In addition, when the retailer’s risk aversion is in a certain interval, the expected utility of the whole supply chain is greater in centralized supply chain than in decentralized decision, and vice versa.

The concept of the reverse supply chain provides an opportunity to recover value from discarded products. The potential for recovery and the improvement of value in the reverse supply chain of apparel has been barely studied. In this research, a novel modularized redesign model is developed and applied to the garment redesign process. The concept of modularization is used to extract parts from the end-of-use or end-of-life of products. The extracted parts are reassembled or reconstructed with the help of a proposed group genetic algorithm by using domain and industry-specific knowledge. Design fitness is calculated to achieve the optimal redesign. Subsequently, the practical relevance of the model is investigated with the help of an industrial case in Sweden. The case study finding reveals that the proposed method and model to calculate the design fitness could simplify the redesign process. The design fitness calculation is illustrated with the example of a polo t-shirt. The redesigned system-based modularization is in accordance with the practical situations because of its flexibility and viability to formulate redesign decisions. The grouping genetic algorithm could enable fast redesign decisions for designers.</jats:p>"

This infrastructure is often subject to a high degree of risk due to a variety of factors, and supply chain risk management is an active research area. While extant literature has identified several risk factors and approaches to managing risks in supply chains, there is need for a more integrated approach. Prior research has recognized some relationships between risk management strategies and risk. However, there is scope for additional analysis, understanding, and integration of the relationships between risks, risk management strategies and supply chain value. This article considers a variety of relationships between supply chain risks, risk management strategies, and supply chain value in an integrated manner. It proposes a measure of supply chain value based on finance theory and analyzes its relationship with risks and risk management strategies. It develops an analytical model to understand the above‐mentioned relationships, proposes a measure of synergy associated with a portfolio of risk management strategies, and develops a more general simulation model to analyze the value of such a portfolio. The simulation model can be used to understand the value of individual supply chain risk management portfolio components, as well as to compare alternate portfolios of risk management strategies.</jats:p>",

Treatment of fluctuating runoffs and contaminant influxes before mixing with the lake's water by conventional methods would require a large land footprint, which is a big constraint in the Nainital because of the hilly region. Ballasted sand flocculation (BSF) technology requires much less land footprint; a full-scale 1 MLD capacity pilot plant was applied for treatment of stormwater runoffs of the Nainital Lake. Twenty-eight storm events were monitored for runoff characterization and for evaluating the performance of BSF technology. The runoff water showed marked variation especially for total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total coliform (TC) and fecal coliform (FC) with maximum concentrations of 964 mg/l, 2.35 mg/l, 520 mg/l, 299 mg/l, 21 × 105 MPN/100 ml and 14 × 104 MPN/100 ml. The performance analyses results of the pilot plant revealed that the contaminants including trace metals in the stormwater runoff were reduced appreciably and the pollutant removal efficiencies were found to be largely unaffected by fluctuation of the influent contaminants' concentration.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this study demonstrates pathways to sustainable supply chain triple bottom line performance derived from linkages of institutional pressures (IP) and organizational identity (OI) to environment and social sustainable practices. It shows that the superordinate goal of sustainable supply chain management is met in spite of unyielding external pressures and desirable OI driving the unequivocal environmental and responsible social practices of firms. A survey approach was adopted to gather the data required for this study. A total of 118 completed questionnaires were received from respondents, who were managers and senior executives in supply chain management (SCM) in Malaysia. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling with partial least squares (PLS-SEM) version 3.0. Our findings showed that all hypothesized relationships are significant except both process- and market-based social practices could not directly impact economic performance. This is in sharp contrast to environmental practices. However, the significant linkage between social practices and social performance is a pathway for the former to economic performance. Therefore, the economic benefits derived from social practices are salvaged through its performance outcomes. The novel and useful impact of institutional pressures on sustainable supply chain practices are also unearthed.</jats:p>"

According to a new voluntary survey of 190 Belgian CSC members, more than three quarters are male, Belgian, and more than half work full- or part-time. About 44% of respondents have completed university studies. Securing cannabis was the primary reason to adhere to a CSC, and most are (near-)daily users. Our results revealed that the CSC was the sole supplier for most respondents of cannabis-producing CSCs, who obtained almost exclusively (dried) herbal cannabis.

Anatomical variations in hepatic arterial supply to the liver are very common and seen in nearly half the population. Identifying anomalous origin of segment 4 hepatic artery is vital since this vessel can cross the transection plane and can result in liver ischemia and liver failure. The purpose of our study is to study the variations in hepatic arterial anatomy to segment 4 of the liver in the Indian population.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"st2\">\n<jats:title>Materials and Methods:</jats:title>\n<jats:p>A retrospective evaluation of 637 consecutive computed tomography (CT) angiograms over a period of 1 year was performed, and we analyzed the arterial supply to segment 4 of the liver.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"st3\">\n<jats:title>Results:</jats:title>\n<jats:p>We found that the arterial supply to segment 4 of the liver originated from left hepatic artery (LHA) in majority of cases, 76.3%. LHA along with the accessory LHA supplied this segment in 6.4%, whereas the accessory LHA solely supplied this segment in 0.4%. The right hepatic artery (RHA) was seen to supply this segment in 10.2%. Dual supply with branches from the RHA and LHA was seen in 6.6% of patients.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"st4\">\n<jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Preoperative mapping of segment 4 hepatic arterial supply using CT angiography will act as a roadmap to surgeons as they attempt to carefully dissect and preserve this segments' arterial supply. Depending on the anatomical variation, surgical techniques will vary to ensure safety of segment 4 arterial supply.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

There is wide agreement that China should merge the three schemes into a universal and uniform SHI. However, data on the medical expenses of all inpatients in 2014 at a public Tier-three hospital suggests that supply-induced demand (SID) is a serious concern and that, under the design of the current schemes, a higher benefit level has a greater impact on the total expenses of insured patients. Thus, if SID is not effectively controlled, a universal and uniform SHI may be more harmful than beneficial in China. Finally, we suggest that China should substitute the existing fee-for-service design with a suite of bundled provider payment methods; furthermore, China should replace its current system of pricing drugs that encourages hospitals and doctors to use costlier medications.</jats:p>",

A solid electrical analysis based on the working mechanisms of the nominal I/O buffer information specification- (IBIS-) like model is presented to support the derivation of an accurate and computationally efficient behavioral model that captures the essential effects of the power supply bouncing under temperature variation. The formulation and extraction of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial are investigated to extend the nominal equivalent circuit model. The generated behavioral model is implemented using the Newton-Neville’s formula and validated in simultaneous switching output buffers (SSO) scenario under temperature variation. The numerical results show a good prediction accuracy of the time domain voltage and current waveforms as well as the eye diagram of the high-speed communication I/O link while speeding-up the transient simulation compared to the transistor level model.</jats:p>",

There were significant interactions between positive and negative word-of-mouth.  Conclusions:  This type of model becomes a decision support tool for businesses to evaluate their mid-to-long term performance taking into account their customers’ long-term behaviors and the relationships between potential customers in repetitive and competitive environments.</jats:p>"

Yet, digital confidentiality has received vastly less research attention from operations and supply chain management (OSCM) scholars than cost, quality, flexibility, delivery, and innovation. We contend that this lack of attention has, at least partly, produced recommendations that ultimately could harm digital confidentiality performance. To guide future research, we synthesize relevant gaps across the OSCM and information systems literatures and discuss relevant OSCM research opportunities. Many of these opportunities are articulated as propositions. We also discuss contemporary industry practices aimed at upholding digital confidentiality. We call for the OSCM community to consistently and explicitly examine digital confidentiality as a performance dimension, and argue that failure to heed this call will be detrimental to our field's influence and relevance as digital assets continue to increase in value relative to physical ones. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reduced oil supply flow rates in fluid film bearings can cause cavitation, or lack of a fully developed film layer, over one or more of the pads due to starvation. Reduced oil flow has the well-documented effects of higher bearing operating temperatures and decreased power losses; however, little experimental data are available on its effects on system stability and dynamic performance. The study looks at the effects of oil supply flow rate on dynamic bearing performance by comparing experimentally identified damped natural frequencies and damping ratios to predictive models. A test rig consisting of a flexible rotor and supported by two tilting pad bearings in flooded housings is utilized in this study. Tests are conducted over a range of supercritical operating speeds and bearing loads while systematically reducing the oil supply flow rates provided to the bearings. Shaft response measured as a magnetic actuator is used to perform sine sweep excitations of the rotor. A single-input, multiple-output system identification technique is then used to obtain frequency response functions (FRFs) and modal parameters. All experimental results are compared to predicted results obtained from bearing models based on thermoelastohydrodynamic (TEHD) lubrication theory. Both flooded and starved model flow assumptions are considered and compared to the data. Differences in the predicted trends of the models and the experimental data across varying operating conditions are examined. Predicted pressure profiles and dynamic coefficients from the models are presented to help explain any differences in trends.</jats:p>",

By using a fully dynamic air distribution model, it is possible to understand the relationships between aeration equipment, control algorithms, process performance, and energy consumption, thus leading to a significantly more realistic prediction of water resource recovery facility (WRRF) performance. Consequently, this leads to an improved design of aeration control strategies and equipment. A model-based audit has been performed for the Girona WRRF with the goal of providing a more objective evaluation of energy reduction strategies. Currently, the Girona plant uses dissolved oxygen control and has been manually optimised for energy consumption. Results from a detailed integrated model show that the implementation of an ammonia-based aeration controller, a redistribution of the diffusers, and the installation of a smaller blower lead to energy savings between 12 and 21%, depending on wastewater temperature. The model supported the development of control strategies that counter the effects of current equipment limitations, such as tapered diffuser distribution, or over-sized blowers. The latter causes an intermittent aeration pattern with blowers switching on and off, increasing wear of the equipment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At present, specialists of foreign and domestic research organizations and industrial firms pay much attention to the use of steam compression heat pump plants (HPP) as an energy-saving technology. Modern compressor units allow receiving 3-4 kW for 1 kW of power consumed by HPP, and under certain conditions up to 5-6 kW of useful power. Today HPPs are most used in heat supply systems for residential and office buildings, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, USA, Japan, China. The paper discusses features of the operation of steam compressor heat pump plants as systems for improving energy efficiency with a description of the device of a heat pump plant; its main components are also listed. Review of the existing practice of introducing such systems in foreign countries is presented, including in Minsk - the Minsk metro, and in Russia - the Moscow Metro. The project, performed by specialists of JSC “VNIIZhT” and MIIT, is considered for the Moscow Metro (with reference to the heating systems of the Nagatinskaya and Pushkinskaya metro stations) for the use of dumping heat of ventilation shafts for heating and hot water supply, proposed by scientists of JSC “VNIIZhT” in 2012 within the framework of the exhibition of technical achievements. Authors presented information on the implementation of the pilot project at the station “Salar’yevo” (Moscow Metro) on the use of HPP in the heat and cooling supply system of the station for further comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of the HPP application in the operating conditions of the metro. From the analysis of the data given in the work, it is concluded that metro systems are significant sources of low-potential heat, which can be used for the heat supply of stations and/or nearby urban sites by means of HPP. By now, there is a lot of experience (especially abroad) of the practical application of HPP in the heat supply systems of facilities. Nevertheless, for a reliable and comprehensive assessment of the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of projects using low-potential heat of metro systems as an energy-saving technology, a complex of studies is needed, including operational tests of currently implemented pilot projects.</jats:p>"

In this way, the objective is to determine the volume of water (1000m³/year) wasted in SAA (Water Supply System), based on the amount of water produced and consumed in the North and Central-West region of Brazil and, from this, compare the losses in those regions, for the year 2015. Based on the analysis of the datas, it was verified that the water supply in the North and Central-West regions presented high losses rates, 43% and 37%, respectively. Actions such as maintenance of sanitary fittings and elimination of leaks in the residence, more efficient operation and maintenance of the system and improvement in the commercial management of service providers, are measures to combat and reduce water losses.\n</jats:p>",

We reviewed two non-profit regulatory options, private clubs and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration Special Access Scheme (SAS) that have been applied to other controlled substances (such as cannabis) as a potential model for regulating VNPs as an alternative to prohibition. The legal status of private cannabis clubs varies between the United States, Canada, Belgium, Spain, and Uruguay. Legal frameworks exist for cannabis clubs in some countries, but most operate in a legal grey area. Kava social clubs existed in the Northern Territory, Australia, until the federal government banned importation of kava. Access to medical cannabis in Australia is allowed as an unapproved therapeutic good via the SAS. In Australia, the SAS Category C appears to be the most feasible option to widen access to VNPs, but it may have limited acceptability to vapers and smokers. The private club model would require new legislation but could be potentially more acceptable if clubs were permitted to operate outside a medical framework. Consumer and regulator support for these models is currently unknown. Without similar restrictions applied to smoked tobacco products, these models may have only a limited impact on smoking prevalence. Further research could explore whether these models could be options for regulating smoked tobacco products.</jats:p>"

In this research primary sources from German Naval War Command have been consulted. Among the main conclusions, it should be pointed out, on the one hand, the intense activity to support the Kriegsmarine during the first years of the war, despite the distance from mainland Spain and the British pressure, which finally stopped the supply operations. On the other hand, we have confirmed the active role of the Spanish government in relation to the Etappendienst: Spanish authorities allowed the supply operations, but pressure from the Allies forced the Spanish government to impede these activities. </jats:p>",

Traditionally, a pull supply chain generates a higher optimal order quantity and hence higher supply chain profit than a push supply chain when firms are risk neutral. Extended from the classic push and pull newsvendor models, this study investigates the impact of firms’ risk‐averse attitudes on supply chain performance. Based on firms’ conditional value‐at‐risk ( CVaR), our analysis indicates that push can lead to a higher optimal order quantity than pull when the supplier is sufficiently more risk averse than the retailer. Meanwhile, pull contracts cannot always survive push challenge like in risk‐neutral supply chains. We demonstrate that three‐part tariff revenue sharing and buy‐back contracts can coordinate both the push and the pull supply chains to achieve the Pareto optimality maximizing combined supply chain CVaR. </jats:p>",

This means an IHO's asset supply network must perform the challenging task of supporting a fast disaster response while simultaneously maintaining cost‐effective ROW development programs. We study how supply network asset flows are impacted during a mega disaster response and find that resource fluidity, the capability to reallocate resources quickly, impacts both mega disaster and ROW program asset flows within these supply networks. Using data from a large IHO's response to a mega disaster and econometric models, we find a dependency between ROW asset flow and mega disaster asset flow in IHOs with resource fluidity. As mega disaster flow increases, there is a decrease in hub‐to‐hub ROW asset flows and an increase in other ROW asset flows. This is contrary to most humanitarian operations research, which typically assumes independent asset flows. Because of resource fluidity, the combination of these flows does not compromise ROW operations. We use these empirical results to feed a simulation analysis that extends our research to IHOs without resource fluidity and provides actionable insights for varying types of IHOs in various demand scenarios. Simulation insights illustrate that resource fluidity impacts IHO asset supply network costs and optimal configurations.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The limestone particle sizes incorporated into the distroferric red Oxisol were: 0.20 mm to 0.30 mm; 0.30 mm to 0.56 mm; 0.56 mm to 0.82 mm and 0.82 mm to 2.00 mm, at doses of 1.3 t ha-1; 2.6 t ha-1; 3.9 t ha-1 and 6.6 t ha-1 respectively, and a control respectively, and a control (no lime incorporation in the soil). The soil chemical characteristics pH, H+Al3+, Al3+, Ca2+ e Mg2+ were evaluated at 6 months and 18 months after the lime application. The corn yields were evaluated during the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 crop years. Higher limestone contents and lower particle size resulted in the same effect on soil acidity correction, reducing Al3+ and increasing Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the soil when the 0.30 mm limestone was incorporated, with residual effect at 18 months. Highest corn yield was obtained when the 0.82 mm to 2.00 mm particle size was incorporated in the first crop year, when compared to the lowest limestone particle size used.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Although the channel morphology of upland fluvial systems is known to be strongly controlled by sediment supply from hillslopes, it is still difficult to isolate this effect from the other controlling factors of channel forms, such as the sediment transport capacity (depending notably on the size of the catchment) and local conditions (e.g. confinement, riparian vegetation, valley‐floor slope). The rivers in New Caledonia offer an interesting field laboratory to isolate the morphological effect of contrasted sediment supply conditions. Some of these rivers are known to be highly impacted by the coarse sediment waves induced by the mining of nickel deposits that started in the early 1870s, which was particularly intensive between the 1940s and 1970s. The propagation of the sediment pulses from the mining sites can be traced by the presence of wide and aggraded active channels along the stream network of nickel‐rich peridotite massifs. A first set of 63 undisturbed catchments in peridotite massifs distributed across the Grande Terre was used to fit a classic scaling law between active channel width and drainage area. A second set of 86 impacted sites, where the presence of sediment waves was clearly attested by recent aerial imagery, showed systematically wider active channels, with a width ratio around 5 (established from the intercept ratio of width–area power laws). More importantly, this second set of disturbed sites confirmed that the residual of active channel widths, computed from the scaling law of undisturbed sites, is statistically positively related to the catchment‐scale relative area of major mining sediment sources. It is therefore confirmed that the characterization of sediment supply conditions is crucial for the understanding of spatial patterns of active channel width, and this should be more thoroughly considered in morphological studies of rivers draining environments with contrasted geomorphic activities on hillslopes. © 2018 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Recounting the history of the Melamchi Water Supply Project through interviews, project documentation, and media reports, this article argues that an analysis of unfinished infrastructure has to take into account the recalcitrance of more-than-human forms, in particular matter like water and rock, as well as institutions like government ministries and international donor agencies. In the case of Melamchi, the lack of control over both matter and such institutional actors delayed the completion of the project – as is the case with a number of large-scale hydropower projects in the country. Despite this obvious inability to complete infrastructures, elites have built the promise of a prosperous future for Nepal on its water resources and the export of electricity. By conceptualizing Melamchi as an infrastructural meshwork in Ingold’s understanding and Nepal as an unfinished hydraulic state, I aim to contribute to the growing literature complicating Wittfogel’s idea of the hydrosocial. </jats:p>",

It is achieved by expanding the minimum pulse length of the multi‐level supply voltage. Also, by comparing the maximum voltage of the minimum pulse with the designed chopped voltage, the minimum pulse is reserved in an optimised way to maximise the PA efficiency. To validate the proposed technique, a four‐level supply modulated PA is fabricated, which is excited by a wideband modulated signal, that is 40‐MHz long‐term evolution signal. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the switching frequencies and achieve higher efficiency than state‐of‐the‐art bandwidth reduction methods, which is very promising for the wideband supply modulated PA design.</jats:p>",

While near-threshold computing is a promising technique to improve energy efficiency, optimal supply demands from logic core and on-chip memory are conflicting. In this paper, we perform static reliability analysis of 6T SRAM and discover the variance among different sizing configuration and asymmetric minimum voltage requirements between read and write operations. We leverage this asymmetric property i n near-threshold processors equipped with voltage boosting capability by proposing an opportunistic dual-supply switching scheme with a write aggregation buffer. Our results show that proposed technique improves energy efficiency by more than 21.45% with approximate 10.19% performance speed-up.</jats:p>"

Together with increasing demands for water, this is putting many water users under increasing water security risk. The mines of the high Andes are one user group experiencing increased water stress. This paper illustrates the climate change problem using a 40 year hydro-climate data set from the headwaters of the Aconcagua basin in central Chile and describes the integration of climate, hydrology, mine water system and financial risk models to evaluate potential water supply solutions. It is concluded that existing water supplies are not sufficiently secure under baseline conditions and less secure under future climate scenarios. Recirculating water from the tailings storage facility, despite the large capital and operations costs involved, is considered the optimal climate-resilient solution and also offers social and environmental advantages. However, considerable modelling uncertainties exist, primarily related to spatial precipitation. </jats:p>",

A fuzzy logic system is designed to approximate and compensate the unknown nonlinear friction influences of the electro‐hydraulic‐system. To achieve a precise approximation, the prediction error of a designed serial‐parallel estimation model and the compensated tracking error are both used to develop the composite adaptive law. Comparative simulation and experimental results are obtained to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.</jats:p>",

Therefore, optimizing the allocation of water resources has become an important research topic in water resources planning and management. An essential step in improving the utilization efficiency of water resources is the prediction of water supply and demand. Because it has a great number of merits, the grey prediction method has been widely used in population prediction and temperature prediction. However, it also has limitations such as low prediction precision since original data seriously fluctuates. This paper aims to handle the sample values by an innovative method utilizing moving-average technique (MA) model and optimizing the background values to make them more typical. Results proved that the prediction accuracy of the traditional model was effectively improved by the proposed method. The proposed model was then applied in the multi-objective planning to establish an optimal water resources allocation model for Beijing in the short-term (2020) planning timeframe, including local water resources, transfer water volumes, and other water supplies. The results indicated that industrial and agricultural water use could be well met, while domestic and environmental water resources may face a shortage.</jats:p>",

The data included the numbers of cattle slaughtered, local live cattle prices, price and amount of exported beef, and the prices of the Brazilian beef futures market. Data were collected on the beef supply from January 1997 to March 2014. Climate data included El Niño (EN), La Niña (LN), South Atlantic Sub-tropical Dipole (SASD), Negative and Positive Atlantic Dipole (−AD and +AD), Tropical South and North Atlantic indices. Statistical analysis was performed by a multivariate regression of time series. It was observed that EN and SASD climatic variables increased the numbers of beef cattle slaughtered, with a 1 and 4-month lag, respectively. On the other hand, LN and -AD decreased the number of animals slaughtered, with 4 and 0 months’ lag, respectively, meaning that there was an immediate response to −AD, while there was a 4-month delay for LN. The amount of exported beef and live beef cattle prices were explained by the number of animals slaughtered in the state. Data suggested that the beef cattle market in RS was more strongly influenced by the occurrence of climate phenomena with LN and −AD than by economic variables such as the price paid to the producer for beef and the amount exported. The climate changes evaluated in the current study affect the livestock production system and consequently the beef market industry in Southern Brazil.</jats:p>",

Using the Netherlands as a case study, this paper evaluates the most economic and environmentally optimal supply chain for the production of biomass based SNG (so‐called bio‐SNG) for different biomass production regions and location of final conversion facilities, with final delivery of compressed natural gas at refueling stations servicing the transport sector. At a scale of 100 MW<jats:sub>th, in</jats:sub>, delivered bioSNG costs range from 18.6 to 25.9$/GJ<jats:sub>delivered CNG</jats:sub>while energy efficiency ranges from 46.8–61.9%. If production capacities are scaled up to 1000 MW<jats:sub>th, in</jats:sub>, SNG costs decrease by about 30% to 12.6–17.4$ GJ<jats:sub>delivered CNG</jats:sub><jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. BioSNG production in Ukraine and transportation of the gas by pipeline to the Netherlands results in the lowest delivered cost in all cases and the highest energy efficiency pathway (61.9%). This is mainly due to low pipeline transport costs and energy losses compared to long‐distance Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) transport. However, synthetic natural gas production from torrefied pellets (TOPs) results in the lowest GHG emissions (17 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e GJ<jats:sub>CNG</jats:sub><jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) while the Ukraine routes results in 25 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e GJ<jats:sub>CNG</jats:sub><jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Production costs at 100 MW<jats:sub>th</jats:sub>are higher than the current natural gas price range, but lower than the oil prices and biodiesel prices. BioSNG costs could converge with natural gas market prices in the coming decades, estimated to be 18.2$ GJ<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. At 1000 MW<jats:sub>th</jats:sub>, bioSNG becomes competitive with natural gas (especially if attractive CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>prices are considered) and very competitive with oil and biodiesel. It is clear that scaling of SNG production to the GW<jats:sub>th</jats:sub>scale is key to cost reduction and could result in competitive SNG costs. For regions like Brazil, it is more cost‐effective to densify biomass into pellets or TOPS and undertake final conversion near the import harbor. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

In this paper we analyze the evolution of food retail by building a store choice equilibrium model and providing an illustrated discussion. The patterns in retail in any given time and place of different types of stores (such as traditional shops, supermarkets, and online e‐commerce) depend on two main factors. The first are consumers’ characteristics such as income, tastes, and travel costs of going to different stores and/or shipping costs if purchasing online. The second are the stores’ cost structures, which include item costs from upstream producers, the costs of procurement supply chains (beyond the cost of the item) for perishable items, and the costs of in‐store storage. We show under what conditions in equilibrium the different retail types exist and which can become dominant, and what types of goods (dry packaged foods versus perishables) are distributed by what type of retailers.</jats:p>",

Methods: search on the platform of the Sistema de Indicadores das Graduações em Saúde (SIGRAS - Health Under-graduation Indicator System) to obtain the number of courses, vacancies and first and final year students. From these data, the ratios of applicants to vacancy and of final-year students to million inhabitants were calculated, considering the demographic census. The data were analyzed according to the region of Brazil and to the legal nature of the institution.  Results: the number of courses, vacancies, first and final year students was higher in the Southeast region and in private institutions in all historical series. Since 2008, there has been a decrease in the number of courses and vacancies in the Southeast and a progressive increase in the Northeast and in the South of the country. The Northeast presented the largest ratio of applicants to vacancy in the historical series. There was an increase in the number of final year students per million inhabitants in the first decade analyzed, followed by a decrease.  Conclusion: regional inequality in the distribution of Speech-Language Pathology/Audiology courses in Brazil, greater participation of the private sector and a progressive increase of the public sector are verified.</jats:p>"

However, firms are struggling to make use of their disjointed and unintegrated data streams. Despite this, academics with the analytic tools and training to pursue such research often face difficulty gaining access to corporate data. We explore the divergent goals of practitioners and academics and how the gap that exists between the communities can be overcome to derive mutual value from big data. We describe a practical roadmap for collaboration between academics and practitioners pursuing big data research. Then we detail a case example of how, by following this roadmap, researchers can provide insight to a firm on a specific supply chain problem while developing a replicable template for effective analysis of big data. In our case study, we demonstrate the value of effectively pairing management theory with big data exploration, describe unique challenges involved in big data research, and develop a novel and replicable hierarchical regression‐based process for analyzing big data.</jats:p>",

Laboratory analyses were coupled with on-site, continuous measurements to assess the impact of pollutants on water quality based on both conventional and surrogate parameters. Laboratory data included total suspended solids, caffeine, total phosphorus and nitrogen, and their dissolved forms. Screening of trace metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cd) and PBDEs (polybromodiphenylethers) was carried out. Continuous measurements included water level, physico-chemical variables and turbidity. Nutrient concentrations were generally high (e.g. average total phosphorus &amp;gt; 1,000 μg/L) indicating strong sewage contributions. Among monitored pollutants Cr, Cu, Pb, and Cd concentrations were well correlated to TSS, turbidity and discharge, being bound mostly to suspended particulate matter. A different behavior was found for Ni, that showed an early peak occurring before the flow peak, as a result of first flush events. PBDEs correlated well to nutrient concentrations, showing the highest peaks soon after activation of the combined sewer overflows, likely because of its accumulation in sewers. In addition to showing the existing correlations between quality parameters, the paper highlights the importance of surrogate parameters as indicators of anthropic pollution inputs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Variable speed limit (VSL) is becoming recognized as an effective way to improve traffic throughput and road safety. In particular, methods based on traffic state prediction exhibit promising potential to prevent future traffic congestion and collisions. However, field observations indicate that the traffic state prediction model results in nonnegligible error that impacts the next step decision making of VSL. Thus, this paper investigates how to eliminate this prediction error within a VSL environment. In this study, the traffic state prediction model is a second-order traffic flow model named METANET, while the VSL control is model predictive control (MPC) based, and the VSL decision is discrete optimized choice. A simplified version of the switching mode stochastic cell transmission model (SCTM) is integrated with the METANET model to eliminate the prediction error. The performance of the proposed method is assessed using field data from a VSL pilot test in Edmonton, Canada, and is compared with the prediction results of the baseline METANET model during the road test. The results show that during the most congested period the proposed SCTM-METANET model significantly improves the prediction accuracy of regular METANET model.</jats:p>",

Here we consider the morphodynamics of 1‐D mixed bedrock‐alluvial rivers with temporally varying sediment supply rates. We use a periodic sedimentograph, characterized by short periods of high sediment feed rate and longer periods of low sediment feed rate. We study the problem with a corrected Macroroughness Saltation‐Abrasion‐Alluviation model. In this model, incision is driven by bedload colliding with bedrock, but incision can be turned off by either zero sediment transport or complete alluviation. The formulation is advective‐diffusive, the former capturing upstream‐migrating knickpoints and the latter capturing smearing of the sedimentograph downstream. The steady state balance between incision and uplift is characterized by a bedrock slope that varies downstream, exhibiting low values at the upstream end of the domain and higher values farther downstream. Sufficiently far downstream, the bedrock slope approaches that predicted for constant feed rates. The zone of low slope near the feed point corresponds to a <jats:italic>pocket</jats:italic> (zone of locally depressed bedrock slope) in the longitudinal profile, which is repeatedly drowned in and flushed of sediment. The steady state slope profile of a shorter reach is a truncated version of that of a longer reach. A limiting reach length including the pocket defines a sedimentograph boundary layer, where the effects of sediment feed fluctuation are felt.</jats:p>",

Others have suggested that the meth-induced memory deficits may promote a cyclical pattern of drug use, abstinence, and relapse, although preclinical evidence for this relationship is somewhat lacking. The memory deficits in preclinical models manifest as a loss of novel object recognition (NOR) memory. These deficits occur one to two weeks after cessation of meth use and involve the perirhinal cortex, a parahippocampal region essential to NOR memory. We hypothesized that a loss of perirhinal cortex function contributes to both the NOR memory deficits and increased vulnerability to relapse in a novel-cue reinstatement model. To test this, we attempted to restore NOR memory in meth rats using an excitatory Gq-DREADD in perirhinal neurons. Activation of these neurons not only reversed the meth-induced deficit in NOR memory, but also restored novelty salience in a novel-cue reinstatement model. Thus, perirhinal cortex functionality contributes to both memory deficits in relapse in a long-access model of meth self-administration in rats, and chemogenetic restoration of perirhinal function restores memory and reduces relapse.</jats:p>",

Aso caldera contains numerous postcaldera volcanoes, with Naka‐dake cone recently experiencing eruptions at the first crater, including an explosive eruption that ejected volcanic ash 11,000 m into the air in October 2016. The magma supply system imaged by the resistivity model consists of four key components: a magma reservoir at ~17 km depth that corresponds to the Conrad discontinuity, a magma‐filled crack‐propagation zone that extends obliquely from the magma reservoir, another magma reservoir centered at 6 km depth, and an upright crack‐intrusion zone at 2–4 km depth. The shape of the conductive anomaly is consistent with the regional stress regime, with the locations of the low‐velocity anomalies and a deformation source found beneath the caldera. This anomaly is therefore defined as the magma supply system, which feeds magma to the first crater of the Naka‐dake eruptions. The averaged melt fractions of the upper magma reservoir are estimated to be 3%–4% for 89.3 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> of the reservoir and 96%–99% for 6.3 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, with resistivity thresholds of &lt;40 and &lt;1 Ωm, respectively. Furthermore, the resistivity model detects three conductive anomalies in Aso caldera that are associated with an aqueous fluid‐flow system in the region. The resistivity model also suggests that the resistivity distribution can play an important role in characterizing the stress regime based on the distribution of earthquake clusters in the upper crust beneath the caldera.</jats:p>",

The impacts of the supply of road and rail infrastructure are estimated with a data set that combines records of large-scale household travel surveys in the Tokyo metropolitan area conducted in 1978, 1988, 1998, and 2008. Linear and Tobit models of individual TTEs are estimated by following the behavior of birth cohorts over the 30-year period. The models incorporate the changes in transportation infrastructure, measured as lane kilometers of two levels of major road stock and vehicle kilometers of urban rail service. The results show significant negative effects of lane kilometers for higher-level and lower-level major roads on the TTEs for all travel purposes and for commuting, after controlling for socioeconomic backgrounds and generations of individuals. This study discusses that, in Tokyo, the estimated effect is more likely to reflect the effect of a major road network per se on individual TTEs than the (indirect) effect of major road supply on individual TTEs working through land development activities (i.e., induced car travel demand). For example, the caveat is that actual road investment decisions still need to consider the induced component of road traffic in addition to the (direct) effect that is estimated in this study. </jats:p>",

This integration algorithm was developed in patients with prostate cancer receiving hypoxia marker pimonidazole prior to prostatectomy. We exploited the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) signal in diagnostic diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) images to generate separate images of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional blood volume (fBV). ADC and fBV correlated with cell density (CD) and blood vessel density (BVD) in histology and whole-mount sections from 35 patients, thus linking ADC to oxygen consumption and fBV to oxygen supply. Pixel-wise plots of ADC versus fBV were utilized to predict the hypoxia status of each pixel in a tumor and to visualize the predicted value in a single image. The hypoxic fraction (HFDWI) of CSH images correlated strongly (R2 = 0.66; n = 41) with pimonidazole immunoscore (HSPimo); this relationship was validated in a second pimonidazole cohort (R2 = 0.54; n = 54). We observed good agreement between CSH images and pimonidazole staining in whole-mount sections. HFDWI correlated with tumor stage and lymph node status, consistent with findings for HSPimo. Moreover, CSH imaging could be applied on histologic CD and BVD images, demonstrating transferability to a histopathology assay. Thus, CSH represents a robust approach for hypoxia imaging in prostate cancer that could easily be translated into clinical practice.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Significance: These findings present a novel imaging strategy that indirectly measures tumor hypoxia and has potential application in a wide variety of solid tumors and other imaging modalities.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/16/4774/F1.large.jpg.

We use multivariate statistical partitioning techniques (Q‐mode factor analysis, multiple linear regression) to identify and quantify five crustal source components (Upper Continental Crust (UCC), Luochuan Loess, Xiashu Loess, Southern Japanese Islands, Kyushu Volcanics), and model their mass accumulation rates (MARs). UCC (35–79% of terrigenous contribution) and Luochuan Loess (16–55% contribution) are the most abundant end‐members through time, while Xiashu Loess, Southern Japanese Islands, and Kyushu Volcanics (1–22% contribution) are the lowest in abundance when present. Cycles in UCC and Luochuan Loess MARs may indicate continental and loess‐like material transported by major rivers into the Okinawa Trough. Increases in sea level and grain size proxy (e.g., SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) are coincident with increased flux of Southern Japanese Islands, indicating localized sediment supply from Japan. Increases in total terrigenous MAR precede minimum relative sea levels by several thousand years and may indicate remobilization of continental shelf material. Changes in the relative contribution of these end‐members are decoupled from total MAR, indicating compositional changes in the sediment are distinct from accumulation rate changes but may be linked to variations in sea level, riverine and eolian fluxes, and shelf‐bypass processes over glacial‐interglacials, complicating accurate monsoon reconstructions from fluvial dominated sediment.</jats:p>",

However, how poplars balance growth and nitrogen deficiency remains to be elucidated. In the present study, changes in root development, carbon and nitrogen physiology, and the transcript abundance of associated genes were investigated in slow-growing Populus simonii (Ps) and fast-growing Populus euramericana (Pe) saplings treated with low, medium, and high nitrogen supply. The slow-growing Ps showed a flourishing system, higher δ15N, accelerated C export, lower N uptake and assimilation, and less sensitive transcriptional regulation in response to low N supply. The slow-growing Ps also had greater resistance to N deficiency due to the transport of photosynthate to the roots and the stimulation of root development, which allows survival. To support its rapid metabolism and growth, compared with the slow-growing Ps, the fast-growing Pe showed greater root development, C/N uptake and assimilation capacity, and more responsive transcriptional regulation with greater N supply. These data suggest that poplars can differentially manage C/N metabolism and photosynthate allocation under different N supply conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In large Chinese cities, inefficient logistics organization, a rapid increase in freight demand, and the spreading of city logistics space have jointly contributed to the urban problems related to goods movement, such as spatial conflicts, traffic congestion, and air pollution. To address these problems and improve urban sustainability, we proposed a new spatial organization model of supply–demand coordination. We used the data from the Third China Economic Census and online point-of-interest (POI) for China’s four direct-controlled municipalities and 13 sub-provincial cities. We found that: (1) the freight supply and demand in China’s large cities are both spatially decentralized and clustered. However, there is a significant spatial mismatch between freight supply and demand in most of the studied cities. (2) The 17 studied cities can be divided into three types—highly unbalanced, unbalanced, and balanced—in light of the spatial mismatch between freight supply and demand. (3) The capacities of road surface and logistics nodes spatially differ. The supply capacity of the road systems in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou can only accommodate 18.4%, 35.5%, and 32.2% of the demand, respectively, while the supply capacity of the logistics nodes is more than twice that of the actual demand in these cities. Based on the findings, this paper proposed a differentiated method of demand management in different areas of the cities. To achieve the goals of low-carbon and sustainable development in logistics distribution, policy makers may consider planning urban freight activities along metro lines and intercity rail lines. Thus, this paper will provide a new perspective for understanding the urban freight distribution and management in large Chinese cities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aimed to assess the effect of using forage cactus silage in the diet of sheep under intermittent water supply on its ingestive behavior and thermoregulation. We used in the experiment thirty-six intact male sheep of undefined genotype with an initial average weight of 19.8 ± 2.1 kg and age of approximately six months. The experimental design was a randomized block design in a 3 × 3 factorial scheme composed of three levels of forage cactus silage in the diet (0, 21, and 42%), three water supply periods (0, 24, and 48 hours), and four replications. For the ingestive behavior, observations were carried out every 5 minutes for 2 periods of 24 hours. Thermoregulatory responses were taken at 7:00 and 15:00 h on days other than those intended for ingestive behavior tests. Intermittent water supply did not affect any of the studied variables (P &gt; 0.05). The use of forage cactus silage significantly influenced the ingestive behavior of animals (P &lt; 0.05). Sheep fed forage cactus silage in the diet presented an average feeding efficiency of 255.77 g DM h?1 and an average rumination efficiency of 102.16 g DM h?1, while animals fed control diet showed values of 198.63 and 78.45 g DM h?1, respectively. Urinary frequency increased according to the levels of forage cactus silage in the diet, with 23.60 urination per day in animals fed diets with 42% of forage cactus silage and 10.83 urination per day in animals fed control diet. However, the search for water reduced, with averages of 2.73 and 0.54 per day for animals fed 0 and 42% forage cactus silage, respectively. The use of forage cactus silage also increased thermoregulatory responses of sheep, with an average respiratory rate of 103.35 mov. min?1 and heart rate of 140.08 mov. min?1 in the warmest period of the day (in the afternoon). Thus, sheep fed forage cactus silage increases its feeding and rumination efficiencies, decreases its search for water, and increases its thermoregulatory responses. The intermittent water supply within 48 hours does not influence the ingestive behavior and thermoregulation of confined sheep.</jats:p>"

However, the potential for energy conservation assessment is still limited because of the complexity of the process. The aim of this paper is to propose an energy conservation potential assessment method in order to increase energy consumption transparency and help managers take appropriate energy conservation measures to reduce the energy consumption in the table grapes supply chain. The conservation potential assessment in three kinds of the supply chain modes (the normal chain, the cold insulation chain and the cold chain), were realized by integrating the actual energy consumption investigated with the unified energy consumption per unit energy factor that represents the energy consumption throughout the entire product lifecycle. According to the comprehensive analysis of the energy consumption compared with the energy conservation potential in actual supply chain of table grapes, the proposed energy conservation potential assessment method could provide a unified method for evaluating the energy conservation potential in different supply chain mode of table grapes. The energy conversation potential in cold insulation chain, which was about 0.985, was the highest and that in cold chain, which was about 0.935, was the smallest. However, the cold chain was still the optimal supply chain for the table grapes because of the characteristics of the longest storage shelf life and the lowest quality decay, and the cold chain energy consumption would be further reduced by adopting the more advanced refrigeration and preservation technologies. The proposed energy conservation potential assessment method could be extended for other supply chain applications to evaluate their own energy conservation potential, and thus, reduce their energy consumption.</jats:p>"

The system gathers credit evaluation text from traders by smart contracts on the blockchain. Then the gathered text is analyzed directly by a deep learning network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Finally traders’ credit results are used as a reference for the supervision and management of regulators. By applying blockchain, traders can be held accountable for their actions in the process of transaction and credit evaluation. Regulators can gather more reliable, authentic and sufficient information about traders. The results of experiments show that adopting LSTM results in better performance than traditional machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Navie Bayes (NB) to analyze the credit evaluation text. The system provides a friendly interface for the convenience of users.</jats:p>"

The proposed pattern was designed for green investment under cap-and-trade systems and to promote low-carbon economies characterized by bilateral capital restricted supply chains. The basic conditions for supply chain coordination of low-carbon buy-back contracts are derived through a basic model with no funding support. The joint-financing decisions model is analyzed according to the decision-making behavior of all parties and coordination among components of the supply chain system. The risk to which the bank is subjected under low-carbon transactions is also discussed. The proposed model not only reduces the carbon emissions of unit products, but also expands the scale of production. There are negative correlations between unit emissions reduction with the sharing coefficient of reduction costs, the loan rate, and the wholesale price. To minimize environmental effects while maximizing societal benefits, the government is recommended to ensure a reasonable trade-off between green-innovation subsidies and penalties.</jats:p>",

Here, two types of tobacco transformants, overexpressing Triticum aestivum GS1 (TaGS1) or GS2 (TaGS2), were analysed. Four independent transformed lines, GS1-TR1, GS1-TR2, GS2-TR1 and GS2-TR2, were used for the nitrogen treatment. Under nitrogen-sufficient conditions, the leaves of GS2-TR showed high accumulation of the TaGS2 transcript, while those of GS1-TR showed a low TaGS1 transcript levels. However, compared with nitrogen-sufficient conditions, the TaGS1 transcript level increased in the leaves under nitrogen starvation, but the TaGS2 transcript level decreased. In addition, the TaGS1 and TaGS2 transcript levels were highest in the middle leaves under nitrogen-sufficient and starvation conditions. These results show that nitrogen supply and leaf age regulate TaGS expression, even when they are driven by a super-promoter. Additionally, in regard to nitrogen metabolism level, the lower leaves of the GS1-TR exhibited lower NH4+ and higher amino acid contents, while the upper leaves exhibited higher amino acid, soluble protein and chlorophyll contents. The leaves of the GS2-TR exhibited lower NH4+ but higher amino acid, soluble protein and chlorophyll contents. Given the role that GS isoforms play in nitrogen metabolism, these data suggest that TaGS1 overexpression may improve nitrogen transport, and that TaGS2 overexpression may improve nitrogen assimilation under nitrogen stress.</jats:p>"

Iron emanating from its shelf\nsystem fuels large phytoplankton blooms downstream of the island, but the\nactual supply mechanisms are unclear. To address this, we present an\ninventory of Fe, manganese (Mn), and aluminium (Al) in shelf sediments, pore\nwaters, and the water column in the vicinity of South Georgia, alongside data\non zooplankton-mediated Fe cycling processes, and provide estimates of the\nrelative dissolved Fe (DFe) fluxes from these sources. Seafloor sediments,\nmodified by authigenic Fe precipitation, were the main particulate Fe source\nto shelf bottom waters as indicated by the similar Fe ∕ Mn and Fe ∕ Al ratios for\nshelf sediments and suspended particles in the water column. Less than 1 %\nof the total particulate Fe pool was leachable surface-adsorbed (labile) Fe\nand therefore potentially available to organisms. Pore waters formed the\nprimary DFe source to shelf bottom waters, supplying 0.1–44 µmol DFe m−2 d−1.\nHowever, we estimate that only 0.41±0.26 µmol DFe m−2 d−1 was transferred to the surface mixed layer by vertical\ndiffusive and advective mixing. Other trace metal sources to surface waters\nincluded glacial flour released by melting glaciers and via zooplankton\negestion and excretion processes. On average 6.5±8.2 µmol m−2 d−1 of labile particulate Fe was supplied to the surface\nmixed layer via faecal pellets formed by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), with a further 1.1±2.2 µmol DFe m−2 d−1\nreleased directly by the krill. The faecal pellets released by krill included\nseafloor-derived lithogenic and authigenic material and settled algal debris,\nin addition to freshly ingested suspended phytoplankton cells. The Fe requirement of the phytoplankton blooms ∼ 1250 km\ndownstream of South Georgia was estimated as 0.33±0.11 µmol m−2 d−1, with the DFe supply by horizontal/vertical mixing, deep\nwinter mixing, and aeolian dust estimated as ∼0.12 µmol m−2 d−1. We hypothesize that a substantial contribution of DFe was\nprovided through recycling of biogenically stored Fe following luxury Fe\nuptake by phytoplankton on the Fe-rich shelf. This process would allow Fe to\nbe retained in the surface mixed layer of waters downstream of South Georgia\nthrough continuous recycling and biological uptake, supplying the large\ndownstream phytoplankton blooms.\n                    </jats:p>"

The fast rotation of Jupiter and the outward transport of ionized gasses are responsible for forming a huge and rotationally dominant magnetosphere. The plasma supply from the satellite has a key role in the characterization of the Jovian magnetosphere. In fact, significant variations of the plasma population in the inner magnetosphere caused by the volcanic eruptions in Io were found in early 2015, using a continuous data set of the Io plasma torus obtained from an extreme ultraviolet spectroscope onboard the Hisaki satellite. The time evolution of the Io plasma torus radial distribution showed that the outward transport of plasma through 8 <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>J</jats:italic></jats:sub> from Jupiter was enhanced for approximately 2 months (from the end of January to the beginning of April 2015). Intense short‐lived auroral brightenings––which represent transient energy releases in the outer part of the magnetosphere—occurred frequently during this period. The short‐lived auroral brightenings accompanied well‐defined sporadic enhancements of the ion brightness in the plasma torus, indicating a rapid inward transport of energy from the outer part of the magnetosphere and the resultant enhancement of hot electron population in the inner magnetosphere. This evidently shows that the change in a plasma source in the inner magnetosphere affects a large‐scale radial circulation of mass and energy in a rotationally dominant magnetosphere.</jats:p>",

Case studies suggest that Mexican smallholder family farmers, known as<jats:italic>campesinos</jats:italic>, contribute importantly to this, but their significance has not been explicitly quantified and analysed as a whole. Here, we examine the evolutionary and food security implications of the scale and scope under which<jats:italic>campesinos</jats:italic>produce maize. We gathered official municipal-level data on maize production under rainfed conditions and identified<jats:italic>campesino</jats:italic>agriculture as occurring in municipalities with average yields of less than or equal to 3 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Environmental conditions vary widely in those municipalities and are associated with a great diversity of maize races, representing 85.3% of native maize samples collected in the country. We estimate that in those municipalities, around 1.38 × 10<jats:sup>11</jats:sup>genetically different individual plants are subjected to evolution under domestication each season. This implies that 5.24 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup>mother plants contribute to the next generation with their standing genetic diversity and rare alleles. Such a large breeding population size also increases the total number of adaptive mutations that may appear and be selected for.

Based on the establishment of the control unit water environmental model, the most unfavorable hydrological condition has been set up. The model comprehensively considers the effects of boundary water quality and the response relationship between the water quality of a cross-section and the general population. The allowable discharge of each generalization outfall can be calculated by the response relationship, and the chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH3-N, and total phosphorus (TP) water environment capacity of the control unit can be obtained. As shown in the results: in the near future (2017–2019) with 35% sewage interception and 30 m3/s water diversion; in the long term (after 2020) with 82% sewage interception, the water quality can reach the standard. Combined with the measured calculation, the paper also has made a quantitative analysis of the sharing rate of the main tributary and sewage pump station pollutant flux in the control unit and the whole basin within the administrative district.</jats:p>",
