      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents a secondary analysis of the literature, supplemented by case studies to determine if large companies increase their exposure to risk by having small‐ and medium‐size enterprises (SMEs) as partners in business critical positions in the supply chain, and to make recommendations concerning best practice. A framework defining the information systems (IS) environment is used to structure the review. The review found that large companies’ exposure to risk appeared to be increased by inter‐organisational networking. Having SMEs as partners in the supply chain further increased the risk exposure. SMEs increased their own exposure to risk by becoming partners in a supply chain. These findings indicate the importance of undertaking risk assessments and considering the need for business continuity planning when a company is exposed to inter‐organisational networking.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain design is frequently performed from the perspective of a single supplier‐customer relationship. However, as a supplier provides value to different supply chains, it becomes increasingly difficult to optimize each supply chain. Each supply chain has different requirements, procedures, and formats. A member may have requirements placed upon them by one member that contradicts another member. The competitive success of a supplier depends  on its ability to participate in different supply chains. This, in turn, affects the competitiveness of each of the other supply chains. This paper presents a generic prescriptive methodology for mitigating risks in an aerospace supply chain and proposes five activities. The methodology provides a mechanism to minimize conflicting objectives. A hypothetical case study is then presented on how the methodology can be applied.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the role of physical processes in larval transport to estuarine nursery areas in the Aransas Pass region, Texas, is examined using a circulation model coupled with a fixed‐depth particle transport model. Two phases of transport are examined: transport on the shelf to the tidal inlet and transport through the inlet to estuarine nursery areas. Observed pulsing in the supply of red drum (<jats:italic>Sciaenops ocellatus</jats:italic>) larvae to the tidal inlet is significantly correlated with modeled particle supply. This pulsing is not correlated with a specific physical process, but results from the interaction of several factors affecting water movement, including low‐frequency variations in water level and wind forcing. Simulations suggest that the primary spawning region for red drum larvae that utilize nursery habitat in the Aransas Pass region is located north of the inlet. Patterns in the trajectories of particles that successfully enter the inlet reveal that they move alongshelf in the nearshore region and then move into the inlet, rather than moving directly across the shelf to the inlet. The approach path of particles outside the inlet determines the spatial transport patterns for inlets with branched channels and multiple bays. This study demonstrates that physical processes play an important role in determining larval supply to a tidal inlet.</jats:p>",

There are approximately 1400 groundwater plants in Finland that are microbiologically at a high risk level because in most cases they do not use any disinfection treatment. Campylobacter jejuni has caused waterborne epidemics in several countries. Since the middle of the 1980s, C. jejuni has been identified as the causative agent in several waterborne outbreaks in Finland. Between 1998 and 2001, C. jejuni or C. upsaliensis caused seven reported waterborne epidemics. In these epidemics approximately 4000 people acquired the illness. Most of the outbreaks occurred in July, August , September or October. In four of them source water and net water samples were analysed for total coliforms or fecal coliforms, E. coli and campylobacters. We showed that large volumes of water samples in studies of indicator organisms (up to 5000 ml) and campylobacters (4000–20,000 ml) increased the possibility to identify faecal contamination and to detect the causative agent from suspected sources.</jats:p>",

Funded and supported by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, the Alberta Provincial government, SAP and IBM, this project is focused on developing an online model of a fully data integrated supply chain. A simulation model is being used to help us learn how the business community will best use this supply chain environment of the future. Networked private communications between supply team members, data visibility, push versus pull systems, post-simulation performance analysis, group strategy formulation, strategy delivery and team discipline in networked environment are all aspects of research under consideration. A fully functional simulator of a data integrated supply chain environment supported by a complete range of online collaboration tools is currently being field tested and may be demonstrated at this symposium.

Therefore, developing and evaluating methods for assessing the infectivity and inactivation of C. parvum oocysts are of paramount importance. Infectivity assays based on in-vitro cell culture have been developed as alternatives to human and animal-based assays to overcome ethical, cost, and practicality issues. Data obtained over a two-year period with an HCT-8 cell culture/RT-PCR infectivity assay generated an ID50 of 99 oocysts (95% CI: 84-117) and demonstrated that the cell culture assay was equivalent to the standard CD-1 mouse model for measuring infectivity of C. parvum oocysts. Aggregate data generated over two years using the HCT-8 cell culture/RT-PCR assay to measure UV disinfection of C. parvum demonstrated that 2.4 mJ/cm2 and 4.9 mJ/cm2 were necessary to achieve 1-log10 and 2-log10 inactivation, respectively. This work demonstrated that an HCT-8 cell culture-based infectivity coupled with RT-PCR for detecting C. parvum infections is a practical tool that can provide valuable information about the efficacy of disinfectants and the infectivity of oocysts in environmental waters.</jats:p>",

There are no evidence-based guidelines currently available to dentists for the control of DUWS contamination in Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial load of water from DUWS, especially the presence of microbial pathogens which can be a source of cross-contamination between patients. Water and tube samples were obtained from 40 dental surgeries in Barcelona. The samples were taken from turbine and from air/water syringe. Twelve of these DUWS were fed with hard water from mains (with chlorine) and 28 dental units with bottle or tank deionized water. Microbial load was ranged from 0 to 3.6 × 103 colony-forming units/mL. Legionella sp., Mycobacterium sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida sp. were found in 4, 8, 6, and 2 different surgeries, respectively.

Food supply generally decreased from 1995 to 1996, and tended to increase from 1996 to 1997. Within a year, food supply generally increased over the breeding season. Mean egg volume followed the food supply pattern, i.e. egg volume decreased between 1995 and 1996, and increased between 1996 and 1997. However, within a year there was no change in egg volume over the season despite an increased food supply. The latter result may be a consequence of later breeding females investing less in their clutches, or that a seasonal increase in food supply compensated a lower potential for egg volume in late females (that may be of lower quality).</jats:p>"

These processes can be described in terms of stocks (pathogens) and flows (movement of stocks). In south-eastern Australia, the majority of pathogen loading to major tributaries was predicted to occur during and after high intensity rainfall events where in-stream resuspension was not of great relative importance. In contrast, during dry weather the transit time within the studied catchment was sufficiently long that in-stream processes became relatively important. Total pathogen unit (TPU) budgets were constructed for the parasitic protozoa Cryptosporidium and Giardia. This approach enables water utility managers to identify those catchment segments and processes that are contributing or removing the greatest load of pathogens, and thus where management options will be most effective. With improved knowledge of pathogen ecology this approach can be further refined to provide budgets of infectious pathogen units (IPU), more directed to public health risk endpoints.</jats:p>",

With the pilot plant at a flow of 180 m3/h a challenge test was conducted to compare the susceptibility of environmental SSRC and lab-cultured spores of C. perfringens, MS2 bacteriophages and Bacillus subtilis. The latter was dosed as a biodosimeter with a calibrated UV253.7nm sensitivity to confirm the germicidal fluence. This test demonstrated that environmental SSRC were a factor of 1.6 more resistant against UV than the lab-cultured spores of C. perfringens. Furthermore, the results of these environmental SSRC indicated that they are more resistant to UV than other relevant micro-organisms for drinking water safety. Environmental SSRC calibrated with biodosimetry and determined with large volumes sampling is a potential parameter for on-site verification of the efficacy of UV-systems. Further research is necessary to determine to what extent the UV susceptibility of SSRC is consistent in the water and to find the cause of the increased resistance of environmental micro-organisms.</jats:p>",

The presence of Legionella sp. and L. pneumophila in water and air samples at different sewage installations was determined by cultivation, Direct Fluorescence Assay and PCR. Simultaneously, coliforms, F-RNA phages and spores of sulphite reducing clostridia (SSRC) were enumerated in water and air. For enteric pathogens, the aerosolisation efficiency of coliforms, F-RNA phages and SSRC were combined with published data on the concentration of Campylobacter, enteroviruses and Cryptosporidium parvum, respectively, in wastewater to calculate the concentration of these pathogens in the air. The frequency and duration of the presence of sewage workers at or in the different installations was determined by a questionnaire. The concentration of micro-organisms in the air and the data on the presence of workers at these locations were combined into an estimate of the exposure to Legionella and the enteric pathogens. Legionella was detected in all wastewater samples (n=7) with PCR, in concentrations of approximately 105 per ml, but not with the culture method (&amp;lt;20–&amp;lt;200 /ml). Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila were detected in air samples of 10 m3 with PCR at 3 of the 5 sewage treatment plants tested. Samples of air above trickling filters (2/2), aeration tanks (2/2), the screen (1/1) and the belt press (1/1) were positive for Legionella. The concentration ranged from 0.56–56 per m3 of air with PCR, but again no Legionella were detected in any of the air samples with the culture method. The Legionella-concentration (determined by PCR) in the air were low compared to published data on Legionella concentrations in the air at outbreak sites (determined by culture). Hence, the risk of legionellosis to sewage workers was considered low. The calculated concentrations in air ranged from very low (&amp;lt;0.001/m3 up to 0.3–17/m3 at sites with high aerosolisation). During cleaning activities, the concentrations rose up to 100/m3. These concentrations were translated into the probability of infection using published dose-response models. The annual probability of infection for sewage workers was high (worker with average exposure 19%, high exposure worker (95-percentile) 100%). Therefore, measures to reduce aerosol formation or exposure to aerosols (both technical and protective) should be considered. Reduction of exposure to aerosols will not only reduce the risk due to enteric pathogens, but also to endotoxins, Legionella and other pathogens.</jats:p>",

While it is determined that, in some cases, female committee members are nominal, or token, participants, there is evidence that being on a local water committee helps women develop skills and confidence.

In two short-periods in winter and summer, information was collected about the elimination of Coli44 and SSRC by the overall treatment, the contribution of the unit processes and the variability in elimination. Coli44 concentrations in the source waters were reduced by 3.2 to 6.3 log to an average concentration sufficiently low to achieve more than 99% compliance with the drinking water standard. The elimination of SSRC was lower (1.4 to 4.2) and SSRC were observed occasionally (&amp;gt;1%) in finished water by the routine weekly sampling of 100 ml samples. The study also yielded much information about the elimination efficacy of unit processes at the different locations, which enables process optimization and improved process control. Moreover, it is demonstrated that this quantitative information on removal of indicator bacteria by full-scale treatment systems can be used as input for quantitative microbial risk assessment. Further research will be focussed on comparative studies on the removal of faecal indicators and pathogens by unit processes and the improvement of the enumeration methods of pathogens in the source water (recovery efficiencies, specificity).</jats:p>",

In the third study an array for Helicobacter pylori was tested for simultaneous SNP discrimination and presence or absence of virulence factor genes. Results from this study showed that both SNP discrimination for some conserved genes, and the presence or absence of virulence factor genes was possible.

Some children have illnesses that require expensive medicine or treatment, but demand little parental time. Others require extraordinary amounts of time; and still others require care at unpredictable times of the day. I construct a theoretical model of mother's labor supply that explicitly incorporates the financial and time costs associated with the presence of unhealthy children. The model predicts that children with time‐intensive illnesses and those with unpredictable illnesses negatively influence mother's labor supply, whereas children with illnesses with a strong financial component have a positive effect on mother's labor supply. In order to empirically test this, I organize a focus group of doctors to categorize illnesses and disabilities by the type of resources they require. Using the 1997 PSID Child Development Supplement, I estimate the effects of these requirements on mother's decision to work and work hours. After controlling for the financial burden of the illness, single mothers work fewer hours if their child has a time‐intensive illness and married mothers are less likely to work and work fewer hours if their child has a severe condition with an unpredictable time component. These findings are consistent with the theoretical model and highlight the need to decompose the effects of child health on mother's work status. Model specifications that aggregate across illnesses are incapable of disentangling these effects and may therefore underestimate the welfare costs of having a sick child in the family.

The standardization and validation process used for the seven most recent USEPA 1600-series pathogen monitoring methods has begun to address these challenges. A staged development process was used to ensure that methods were adequately tested and standardized before resources were dedicated to interlaboratory validation. The interlaboratory validation studies for USEPA Method 1622, for Cryptosporidium, USEPA Method 1601 for coliphage, and USEPA Method 1605 for Aeromonas assessed method performance using different approaches, due the differences in the nature of the target analytes and the data quality needs of each study.

We study both the lost sales and backlogging cases under both strict convex and linear raw material purchasing/selling costs. Convexity of the purchasing/selling cost implies that the more the firm purchases from or sells to the outside market, the more expensive or less valuable the raw material becomes. For all cases, we find the partial characterizations for the optimal policies, which all turn out to be very intuitively appealing. In particular, for each of the linear-cost cases, the optimal policy degenerates into a combination of two base-stock policies: one for the raw material inventory and the other for the finished product inventory. </jats:p>",

Most efforts are dyadic, focusing on a buyer/supplier relationship. Few examples of multi‐tier implementation efforts have been documented. This paper looks at the challenges encountered in the implementation of a quality initiative in the semiconductor industry. The focus is on the challenges encountered as a successful first‐tier implementation was driven back to the second tier. Initial efforts failed and responsibility for second‐tier implementation was passed back to the first‐tier suppliers. Efforts at this level continued to stall because the leverage dynamics of the supply chain was very different as smaller, second‐tier suppliers were engaged and encouraged to adopt the new quality standard.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Effective distribution using collaborative fulfillment networks requires coordination among the multiple participating firms at different stages of the supply chain. Acting independently, supply chain partners fail to weigh the cost burden they impose on upstream suppliers when their replenishment order quantities vary from period to period. This paper explores a new approach to coordinate multiple stages in the supply chain by controlling, through appropriate downstream inventory management, the demand variability that is propagated to upstream stages. We propose and analyze a coordinated inventory replenishment policy that uses \"order smoothing\" to reduce order-size variability and thus reduce overall system costs, including both inventory and transportation costs. We characterize the optimal parameter values for smoothing alternatives (such as exponential smoothing and moving weighted average policies), assess their economic benefits, and develop insights regarding supply chain contexts that might benefit most significantly from reducing the variability of orders to upstream stages. Using the distribution network for specialty brand appliances as an illustrative example, we demonstrate the potential cost savings that order-smoothing strategies can yield compared to the uncoordinated case when individual firms separately minimize their costs. The magnitude of savings depends on several factors, including the variability in consumer demand, level of product variety, and degree of inventory aggregation in the distribution system. Based on our analytical results, we develop a framework to assess cost reduction opportunities through variability control for different supply chain scenarios. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the last decade the use of titanium dioxide has been the focus of water purification studies for photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds. Various studies have shown that TiO2 photocatalysis is a very efficient process for removal (by mineralization) of a large variety of hazardous chemicals. However, the potential use of this technology for water disinfection has been essentially unexplored. Only a few papers have described the photocatalytic destruction of microbial cells, such as E. coli bacteria, MS2 bacteriophages and recently B. fragilis phages, D. radiophilus. The mechanism of photocatalysis in the presence of TiO2 is the enhanced formation of hydroxyl (HO·) radicals, active in oxidation processes. The HO· radicals have a significant effect on chemical oxidation of anthropogenic organic compounds in the environment. Complete mineralization of many organic substances is possible in aqueous systems, when sufficient HO· radical flux can be generated in situ. Various water treatment technologies inherently produce HO· radicals in relatively minuscule quantities (i.e., &amp;lt; 10−12 M). Examples of such processes include ozonation, direct photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, and radiolysis. In contrast to the above system, steady-state HO· concentrations of the order of 10−9 M can be generated in UV-irradiated aqueous suspensions of immobilised particles of titanium dioxide. The use of TiO2 for microbial inactivation and disinfection of potable water is suggested, since free radicals such as HO· might act as a strong biocide, because of its high oxidation potential and nonselective reactivity. In the present study, two bacilli strain spores (B. subtilis and B. cereus) were tested for photocatalytic inactivation in water as simulators of B. anthracis spores. B. subtilis was selected for its high resistance to disinfection and B. cereus for its phylogenetic proximity to B. anthracis. Two UV sources were used: 1) monochromatic UV lamp with irradiation intensity of 7mW/cm2 at 365nm; and 2) Natural sunlight (irradiation intensity at 365nm of ∼4 mW/cm2 between 12:00 and 14:00 hours). TiO2 at 0.25g/L was found to be the optimal concentration needed for the reduction of four orders of magnitude in B. subtilis spores viability after irradiation for 300 minutes. B. cereus subjected to similar photocatalysis conditions was reduced by five orders of magnitude revealing lower endurance to this process. Comparison of artificial and natural (sunlight) UV irradiation source on B. subtilis resulted in increased inactivation of 5 orders of magnitude in favour of sunlight. Combined inactivation by photocatalytic process (UV 365nm) and detrimental activity of UV at 265nm can explain this result. There was no difference between the two irradiation sources when B. cereus was tested. Under both irradiation types, B. cereus was reduced by four orders of magnitude during 300 minutes time interval. Additional experiments including TiO2 concentration, irradiation intensity, water depth, initial spore number, etc. were performed. Taking into account that B. anthracis spores have hydrophobic properties, the photocatalytic process seems to be the method of choice in water disinfection eliminating the possibility of by products formation such as halogens.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Managers often engage in forecast updating with the expectation that forecast updating reduces expected shortage and inventory costs. One undesirable effect of forecast updating is that it may lead to the bullwhip effect, a phenomenon where the variability of demand increases as one moves up the supply chain. The bullwhip effect can be undesirable for the supplier because more volatile orders from the downstream stage can be very costly to the supplier. It can make it more difficult for the supplier to forecast demand, and it can lead to large fluctuations in supplier production levels from period to period. Using \"stale\" or old forecasts may sound foolish, but their judicious use in a two-stage supply chain can improve fulfillment from the upstream stage to the downstream stage and reduce the fluctuations in production levels. We study a two-stage supply chain where the demand process is nonstationary and both stages use an adaptive base stock policy. We propose a policy that uses old forecasts to set base stock levels at the downstream stage while using current forecasts to communicate upcoming orders from the downstream stage to the upstream stage. We study a decentralized supply chain setting, and we find that our policy can reduce the expected supply chain inventory and shortage costs and significantly reduce the fluctuations in production levels compared to that of using current information. We also study a cooperative supply chain setting and, surprisingly, we find in numerical examples that our proposed policy results in very small increases in the expected systemwide inventory and shortage costs compared to a systemwide optimal policy, while reducing the fluctuations in production levels. </jats:p>",

The levels of total coliforms and fecal coliforms ranged from 40 to 68000 (cfu/100ml) and from 2 to 32000 (cfu/100ml), respectively. The F-specific phages were not detected from 5 ml of 53 samples out of 61 tested. The levels of indicator microbes were not found to be related to the tide in Tokyo bay. Enteroviruses were not detected by cell culture RTÐPCR, but detected by direct RTÐPCR from approximately 10% of the samples. Noroviruses were found positive from approx. 31% of the winter samples (n=29), whereas only 3% from the summer samples (n=32). These results of direct RTÐPCR were equivalent to determination of Norwalk viruses occuring in 50 ml of seawater. These results suggested that the levels of noroviruses in Tokyo bay were higher in winter than those of enteroviruses The virus concentration method used was proved to be useful for determination of naturally occurring viruses in seawater, especially when applied prior to PCR detection of nonculturable viruses.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditionally, transnational subsidiaries in peripheral regions were labelled ‘cathedrals in the desert’ as they did not establish significant links with local or regional producers and did not control the decisionmaking process. The work of economists and geographers has tended to be heavily influenced by the branch plant stereotype. However, this rather basic vision of reality is now changing as inward investments promoted by transnational corporations (TNCs) become more embedded in the region. It seems there is a new strategy of foreign firms in relation to local firms and institutions, as evidenced by the technological knowledge governance and learning processes in supply chains polarized by some TNC subsidiaries. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper we first assess the role of technological externalities as a new industrial location factor in the era of globalization. These externalities reinforce localization of innovative firms rather than stimulate spatial dispersion. Even TNC subsidiaries are more embedded in the host regions as globalization accelerates. Second, we analyse the features of the Autoeuropa (AE) supply chain in Portugal, namely the type of suppliers (firm size, origin of capital, markets and so forth) and their position in the hierarchical supply chain of AE. Finally, we assess external knowledge and innovation driven by Autoeuropa itself among suppliers, and we discuss the main benefits as well as the basic problems of such a form of knowledge creation and diffusion. </jats:p>",

We find that speeding up cycle time is beneficial, but the sharing of POS information is not necessarily so. Whether or not the sharing of POS information is beneficial depends on the nature of the demand pattern represented by the POS information. If the demand pattern conveys continual change in ultimate downstream customer demand (as does an S-shaped demand pattern), the POS information can distract the upstream decision maker from what is perhaps more immediately relevant information, orders placed by the proximate downstream agent and the supply line. </jats:p>",

ROSS cockerels and New Zealand White female rabbits were fed a diet containing Ni in concentrations of 0, 50 and 500 mg/kg in dry matter (DM). Dietary supplementation of 50 mg Ni/kg slightly improved the body weight gain (BWG) and had a beneficial effect on the feed conversion efficiency (FCE) in broiler chickens. However, Ni added at a level of 500 mg/kg significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced the BWG by 10% and resulted in significantly (P &lt; 0.05) worse (2.3 ± 0.2 kg/kg) FCE. The relative weight of the liver in cockerels was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased by Ni as compared to the control group (1.7 and 2.1% <jats:italic>vs.</jats:italic> 2.6%). The activity of AST and CHE enzymes was increased insignificantly by dietary supplementation of 500 mg Ni/kg, indicating damage of the liver parenchyma. The results of serum biochemistry were confirmed by a mild or moderate form of pathological focal fatty infiltration of the liver in broilers. Supplemental Ni of 50 mg/kg concentration resulted in non-significantly increased BWG in rabbits. Ni added to the diet at a level of 500 mg/kg reduced the digestibility of crude protein by 3-4% and that of crude fibre by 20-25% in rabbits. Approx. 98% of the ingested Ni was lost from the body via the faeces, 0.5-1.5% via the urine and approx. 1% was incorporated into the organs of rabbits. As a result of dietary supplementation of 50 and 500 mg Ni/kg, Ni accumulated in the kidneys (4.9 ± 0.5 and 17.1 ± 3.1 <jats:italic>vs.</jats:italic> 1.9 ± 0.3 mg/kg DM), ribs (10.3 ± 0.4 and 10.4 ± 0.6 <jats:italic>vs.</jats:italic> 9.1 ± 0.6 mg/kg DM), heart (1.4 ± 0.2 and 2.5 ± 0.4 <jats:italic>vs.</jats:italic> 1.0 ± 0.1 mg/kg DM) and liver (1.3 ± 0.1 and 2.2 ± 0.2 <jats:italic>vs.</jats:italic> 0.9 ± 0.05 mg/kg DM), as compared to the control animals.

Our aim was to evaluate the occurrence of human adenovirus, especially F species (HAdV-40 and HAdV-41), in sewage and creek water in São Paulo city. A total of 95 water samples were collected from July 1998 to June 1999 and from September 2000 to December 2001 at Sewage Pumping Station Edu Chaves and Creek Pirajussara. Four-litre samples were concentrated by a two-step procedure based on filtration through electropositive filter membrane and ultracentrifugation. Adenoviruses were detected in 69 samples (72.6%) after amplification of a sequence of the hexon gene by PCR. The discrimination of human adenovirus F was done by RFLP. A first screening was performed by restriction of PCR product with TaqI, followed by the discrimination of HAdV-40 and HAdV-41 by RsaI restriction. Sixty-two (89.8%) samples showed F species viruses. Among them, human adenovirus, serotype 41, was the most frequently detected in 17 (62.9%) out of 27 samples and serotype 40 was identified only in 7 (25.9%) samples. No seasonal distribution of adenoviruses was observed.</jats:p>",

High densities of Giardia and Cryptosporidium were detected in two source waters, ranging from 2.0–140 cysts/L and 4.0–510 oocysts/L. Giardia and Cryptosporidium (oo)cyst concentration was not consistently associated with most of the parameters analysed, turbidity being the most promising indicator. It also seems that Giardia and Cryptosporidium concentration was influenced by rainfall. Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts were significantly associated in both waters, suggesting a similar pattern of occurrence and common contamination sources. In two of the three water treatment plants analyzed, Giardia and Cryptosporidium were detected in filtered effluents, also in high densities, ranging from 0.066 to 5.5 cysts/L and 0.066 to 13.2 oocysts/L, respectively.

Using empirical results from 186 respondents on GSCM practice in Chinese manufacturing enterprises, we examine the relationships between GSCM practice and environmental and economic performance. Using moderated hierarchical regression analysis, we evaluate the general relationships between specific GSCM practices and performance. We then investigate how two primary types of management operations philosophies, quality management and just‐in‐time (or lean) manufacturing principles, influence the relationship between GSCM practices and performance. Significant findings were determined for a number of relationships. Managerial implications are also identified.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Participating members in a manufacturing supply chain usually make use of an information system like enterprise resources planning (ERP) for planning and scheduling activities independently. Recent research indicates that there is a need to handle such distributed activities in an integrated manner, especially under uncertain and fast changing environments. A multiagent system, a branch of distributed artificial intelligence, is a contemporary modelling technique for a distributed system in the manufacturing domain. This distributed modelling technique is suitable for integrating supply chain networks, which have distributed entities within the system, and each of them makes decision locally, i.e. a local information system. By adopting a multiagent modelling technique, supply chain networks can be built efficiently based on an information system. However, with reference to the reported research, which involves distributed modelling of a supply chain, a higher level coordination mechanism is not specified. This paper aims to propose a framework that utilizes a multiagent system with a corresponding coordination mechanism dedicated to manufacturing supply chain networks. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) has been linked to vascular central nervous system damage, although the pathophysiology of the mechanism has never been perfectly understood. Indeed, the vascular system of human pituitary gland has rarely been the subject of rigorous investigation except at postmortem. Recently, studies of pituitary gland blood supply have been carried out by means of a time evaluation of pituitary gland enhancement with noninvasive dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging after contrast medium injection. In the present study, we decided to investigate the status of posterior pituitary blood supply by evaluating vascular pituitary patterns in a group of 19 patients with idiopathic CDI in whom previous standard MR imaging had failed to identify causal specific lesions. The control group was composed of 55 subjects with a median age of 12 yr (range, 4.2–17 yr) who had idiopathic isolated GH deficiency and normal pituitary morphology and 15 young adults (18–25 yr) who had normal pituitary gland and no endocrine dysfunction.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Nineteen patients (12 females and seven males), ranging in age at the time of diagnosis of CDI from 0.5–14.9 yr (median, 5 yr), were examined with dynamic MR imaging between 1990 and 1997 at a median age of 14.1 yr (range, 5.0–26.3 yr). CDI was diagnosed according to clinical findings of polyuria and polydipsia, water deprivation test, and desmopressin acetate therapeutic trial. All of the patients had permanent CDI and were being treated with satisfactory results with desmopressin, two to three times daily, either intranasally or orally. The previous MR imaging findings of the 19 CDI patients had shown the absence of posterior pituitary hyperintensity, normal pituitary stalk, and normal anterior pituitary size.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Enhancement of the straight sinus, representing a temporal reference point and occurring in normal subjects simultaneously to that of the posterior pituitary gland, was observed in all subjects after iv gadopentetate dimeglumine administration, with no substantial differences between patients and controls. However, the enhancement of the posterior pituitary lobe occurred simultaneously with the enhancement of the straight sinus in all of the controls but in only 14 of the 19 patients with CDI. In the remaining five patients, the enhancement of the straight sinus was not associated with the expected contrast enhancement of the posterior pituitary gland, suggesting abnormal blood supply to the posterior pituitary lobe. This is in keeping with vascular impairment of the inferior hypophyseal artery system and suggests that abnormal blood supply to the posterior pituitary gland is associated with what, until now, has been considered idiopathic CDI.</jats:p>",
