      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global supply networks are becoming increasingly fragmented and complex. At the same time, societal pressures surrounding the environmental accountability of firms are growing, with an increasing number of environmental scandals related to supply networks. Traditional governance frameworks of green supply chain management (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSCM</jats:styled-content>) may be insufficient to deal with this new reality, because they do not consider supply network structure/complexity, and how these factors interact with different governance mechanisms. Our study takes into account the complex interplay between <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSCM</jats:styled-content> governance mechanisms, supply network structure/complexity, and environmental performance. We introduce a series of theoretical propositions grounded in an extensive review of the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSCM</jats:styled-content>, supply networks, network complexity, and organizational design literatures. In particular, we argue that supply network structure and complexity directly affect <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSCM</jats:styled-content> effectiveness, but that these effects will be contingent upon the type of governance mechanism applied (formal or informal).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The automotive industry is characterised by a network of long term collaborative agreements between component suppliers and assemblers. For collaboration to be successful trust between the supply chain partners is vital. Although many variables influence the efficiency of collaborative relationships, the human behaviour issues related to culture and trust are often much more difficult to solve. Trust is singled out in this article as a contributor to value in the supply chain relationships. Increased trust leads to more confidence resulting in better collaboration.Objectives: The purpose of the study was to explore collaborative relationships between first and second tier suppliers (component manufacturers) in automotive supply chains in South Africa and the role of trust in the relationship value.Method: This quantitative study had been conducted amongst members of the National Association for Automobile Component and Allied Manufacturers of South Africa (NAACAM), who are suppliers to the large automotive assemblers. The research utilised closed ended questions to obtain the perceptions of managers in automotive component manufacture regarding trust and relationship value with their best suppliers.Results: With a linear regression model it was found that there is a high degree of trust in the collaborative relationships between first and second tier suppliers of components in the automotive industry in South Africa.Conclusion: The automotive industry is one of the most successful industries in South Africa. They compete globally and apply best practices, particularly those in supply chain management. The industry is characterised by networks of collaborative relationships on different levels. These relationships seem to be successful as they are based on trust.</jats:p>"

Two major trends over the last few years are the growing importance of ‘big data’ and analysing these data though ‘analytics’. The data contain much value and companies need to capitalise on the variety of data sources by in-depth and proper analysis through the use of ‘big data’ analytics.Objective: This article endeavours to highlight the evolving nature of the supply chain management (SCM) environment, to identify how the two major trends (‘big data’ and analytics) will impact SCM in future, to show the benefits that can be derived if these trends are embraced and to make recommendations to supply chain managers.Method: The importance of extracting value from the huge amounts of data available in the SCM area is stated. ‘Big data’ and analytics are defined and the impact of these in various SCM applications clearly illustrated.Results: It is shown, through examples, how the SCM area can be impacted by these new trends and developments. In these examples ‘big data’ analytics have already been embraced, used and implemented successfully. Big data is a reality and using analytics to extract value from the data has the potential to make a huge impact.Conclusion: It is strongly recommended that supply chain managers take note of these two trends, since better use of ‘big data’ analytics can ensure that they keep abreast with developments and changes which can assist in enhancing business competitiveness.</jats:p>"

A number of these frameworks exist internationally but have to be used within the context of knowing the relative strengths and weaknesses of potential benchmarking frameworks. Two such frameworks were identified in the research and a case was made to use one such framework, the Global Supply Chain Forum (GSCF) framework, to measure the effectiveness of the supply chain practices of a leading confectionery manufacturing company in South Africa.Objective of the research: The purpose of the research was to identify an international best practice framework, which could be used by South African manufacturing organisations to benchmark their supply chain management (SCM) practices.Methodology: The methodology followed was a literature review of the existing SCM frameworks to identify a framework, which would be the most suited to the objective of the study, followed by a case study of a leading manufacturing organisation’s SCM practices benchmarked against those found in the framework.Results and conclusions: The main finding of the case study was that there is a high degree of adherence between the case study organisation’s SCM practices and those found in the SCM framework. There was also generally a high level of importance ascribed by respondents to the best practices contained by the GSCF framework. It was therefore concluded that the GSCF framework proved to be a useful instrument for a comprehensive analysis of supply chain management processes and practices for a manufacturer in the fast moving consumer goods industry, with potential for applications by organisations in the supply chains of other industries.</jats:p>"

Despite this, only a few studies have been conducted on SC cost reduction in South Africa and globally.Objective: This study seeks to understand the perceptions of managers regarding cost reduction in the South African mobile phone SC.Method: A qualitative case study was conducted, involving eight willing managers and using semi-structured interviews, observation and documents. Interviews transcripts were analysed thematically with the help of Atlas.ti and a threefold process was followed, comprising data reduction, data display and data interpretation and conclusion drawing.Results: The findings suggest that mobile phone companies should consolidate their strategic relationships and be efficient, in order to effectively reduce costs in the South African mobile phone SC. To achieve this, whilst South African mobile network operators have to share more and more infrastructure and outsource their operations, other mobile phone companies should re-engineer their operational processes and their reduce costs across the SC.Conclusion: The knowledge generated from this study should assist South African mobile phone companies to reduce their SC costs and address high-priced mobile services. On the other hand, this study should assist regulating authorities (the Department of Communications and the Independent Communication Authority of South Africa) to gain insights into the challenges faced by the mobile phone industry in South Africa and, therefore, to make appropriate and adequate mobile telecommunication policies.</jats:p>"

This environment influences the efficiency and effectiveness of South African businesses and supply chains. These factors further influence the competitiveness of products produced in the country, the economic growth and development of South Africa.Objectives: The purpose of this study was two-fold: Firstly, to obtain insight into the main business environment risks and other factors, from a logistics perspective; and secondly, to demonstrate the use of methodology not often used in logistics research − the sequential mixed method.Method: The explorative study was conducted amongst logistics service providers and cargo owners in 2013 by means of a sequential mixed method study, consisting of a survey to determine the importance of risk factors in the business environment, followed by a qualitative study in the form of a focus group discussion to obtain richer data and insight into these risks and factors. The results of these two methods were integrated with industry literature.Results: It was found that increasing transportation costs, operational management of infrastructure and human resources-related problems pose the biggest challenges in the logistics industry. In addition, it was found that the mixed method research study has application possibilities in logistics research.Conclusion: The factors identified as particularly problematic for the logistics industry, namely ineffective operational management of infrastructure, the general conditions in the labour market and increasing costs (to some extent) are outside the control of individual organisations. However, organisations can control how they react and mitigate these risk factors. It is shown that these factors and risks can change overnight. The use of the explorative mixed method in obtaining qualitative and quantitative inputs and integrating it with existing literature proved to be a workable and usable methodology.</jats:p>"

Human reliance on ecosystem services is a function of ecosystems' capacity to supply and societal demand for these benefits. However, considerably more attention has been devoted to the supply side than to the demand for them. Sustainable land management depends on reconciling supply of and demand for ecosystem services among different stakeholders. The emphasis is now shifting from the supply of ecosystem services to attaining a balance between supply and demand. Here, we illustrate the demand for rangeland ecosystem services, describe current changes in societal demand, and present a specific provisioning service to exemplify the dynamic nature of reconciling ecosystem‐service supply and demand.</jats:p>",

He reverses earlier findings in that owners give managers incentives to act in an accommodating way. That is, optimal delegation reduces per-firm output and increases profits to above-Cournot profits. Moreover, in supply function equilibrium, the mode of competition is endogenous. This means that the author avoids results that are sensitive with respect to assuming either Cournot or Bertrand competition.</jats:p>",

However, literature suggests a general shortage of educated and skilled logistics and supply chain managers worldwide.Objectives: The purpose of this article was to benchmark an in-house training programme in logistics management in the beverage industry of Zimbabwe with international best practice.Method: A case study approach was followed focusing on the programme curriculum, content and delivery. The article reports on the nature and effectiveness of the programme. The curriculum was benchmarked with skills requirements identified in literature. Relevance was evaluated based on participant perceptions over a period of 3 years using questionnaires with both closed- and open-ended questions.Results: Findings suggested that the programme offering is in line with international practice whilst it also addresses particular issues in Third World countries. Participants perceived the programme as being practical and valuable for enhancing their job performance and career development.Conclusion: The article provides a framework for evaluating logistics training programmes. Future research could include an evaluation that measures changes in on-the-job behaviour of participants.</jats:p>"

Nepal Water for Health (NEWAH) is a Nepali non-government organisation that has implemented several rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS) in the rural hilly regions of Nepal. Hydrological modelling and analysis of NEWAH’s RWHS allowed for the development of a strategy to improve the effectiveness of the systems. RWHS will always be limited in Nepal due to monsoonal rainfall patterns however this high quality water supply should be prioritised for cooking and drinking. Increasing catchment areas to at least 30 m² instead of increasing tank volumes can efficiently increase the water supply. A literature review on the quality of harvested rainwater was completed, and recommendations were made for maintaining the high quality of water throughout collection, conveyance, storage and use. Monitoring and evaluation of installed systems is necessary and recommendations need to be further investigated and considered in Nepal where the social and cultural context can be fully understood. Appropriate use of this technology can provide a high quality supplementary water supply that can directly improve the health of consumers and provide those living in the hilly regions of Nepal with the foundations for further development.</jats:p>"

Article concluded that under the service-oriented manufacturing model of the traditional supply chain integration and optimization, there are two ways: hybrid supply chain model based on endogenous and hybrid supply chain model based on symbiosis. When manufacturing enterprises selected hybrid supply chain model based on endogenous, value evaluation has become a key issue for its optimization; when the selection is hybrid supply chain model based on symbiosis, effective choice of partners will become a key problem for its optimization. Either endogenous or symbiotic hybrid supply chain model will eventually encourage manufacturing companies to build a supply chain optimization model to adapt to their own development, achieve a successful transition to the service-oriented manufacturing.</jats:p>"

La demande pour ces services est tout d’abord venue des besoins en eau pour lutter contre les incendies, mais ils ont aussi permis d’assurer une meilleure qualité d’eau et d’améliorer les conditions de santé et d’hygiène. Après que les villes finlandaises ont opté pour la propriété et la responsabilité municipales vers 1880, trois autres options techniques ont été rapidement adoptées: la facturation sur des volumes de consommation au compteur, une interdiction des tuyaux en plomb et l’acceptation de chasses d’eau dans les toilettes. L’éternelle question du choix de la source d’eau brute s’est posée – eau souterraine ou de surface. Certaines villes ont introduit le traitement des eaux usées dès les années 1910, mais sa diffusion n’a pas réellement commencé avant 1962, lorsque le Water Act l’a rendu obligatoire.</jats:p>",

A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess psychometric properties of the measurement instrument. Hypotheses were tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM).Findings: Transformational leadership had positive and significant relationships with organisational citizenship behaviour and quality of work life. Quality of work life exerted a greater influence of job performance than organisational citizenship behaviour.Value of research: The study provides current evidence of the influence of transformational leadership on organisational citizenship behaviour and quality of work life, as well as the influence of organisational citizenship behaviour and quality of work life on job performance amongst supply management professionals.Conclusion: Transformational leadership has a positive influence on organisational citizenship behaviour and quality of work life amongst supply management professionals in the government. Both organisational citizenship behaviour and quality of work life exerta positive influence on the job performance of supply management professionals in the government. Future studies should be extended to other professional cohorts in both the private and the government sectors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose and objective: The purpose of this research is to determine what managers regard as important critical success factors in ensuring a memorable visitor experience at a live music performance.Problem investigated: When organising a live music performance, it is evident that the various characteristics that form part of the visitor experience have to be considered. The critical success factors of live music performances from the supply side are fundamental, since the costs of organising live music performances are high, the needs of the visitors are constantly changing and competition plays a major role in the success of such events. Management furthermore constantly needs to be aware of the ever-changing external environment by determining what factors visitors consider to be vital for a rewarding experience at a major music event. This is extremely important since the concept of experience has become more pervasive, mainly given that the event sector, such as live music performances, has adopted experience as a tool to make individual businesses more competitive, as the organisations operating within this sector exist to provide consumers with an experience.Design and/or methodology and/or approach: A qualitative research method, by means of interviews, was used to obtain the relevant information from the selected participants. All the data collected in the process were transcribed into text and presented in narrative form. The six steps of data analysis and interpretation were applied to analyse the data.Findings and impications: The following four major themes emerged from the analysis; each theme was differentiated in terms of various categories and subcategories. Theme 1:The most important aspects for a memorable visitor experience; Theme 2:Main purpose when organising a live music performance; Theme 3:Important aspects regarding the management of a live music performance; Theme 4:Timing of event management. Based on the research conducted on the critical success factors from a supply side, the following findings emerged. Firstly, it is evident that the critical success factors differ significantly from one tourism sector to another. Therefore, more qualitative research should be applied with regard to critical success factors in other tourism operations. Secondly, comparing the results of the qualitative research reveals significantly more in-depth information than those of the various quantitative research studies conducted on critical success factors. Thirdly, it is evident that the pre-event, during-event and post-event planning phases differ from event to event. Lastly, it is evident that there is no common guideline with regard to creating a memorable visitor experience.Conclusion: Determining the critical success factors for memorable live music performances (from the supply side) in South Africa enables management to improve the current management plans in order to ensure an outstanding memorable visitor experience whilst also improving the overall success rate. </jats:p>"

Both aeolian and fluvial sediment supplies regulate sediment transport and deposition in such a cross-dune braided river. Here we show a significant selective deposition in response to both aeolian and fluvial sediment supplies in the Ulan Buh desert braided channel. This selective deposition developed by the interaction between the flows and the Aeolian-fluvial sediment supplies, making the coarser sediments (&gt; 0.08 mm) from aeolian sand supply and bank erosion to accumulate in the channel center and the finer fluvial sediments (&lt; 0.08 mm) to be deposited on the bar and floodplain surfaces and forming a coarser-grained thalweg bed bounded by finer-grained floodplain surfaces. This lateral selective deposition reduces the downstream sediment transport and is a primary reason for the formation of \"above-ground river\" in the braided reach of the Upper Yellow River in response to aeolian and fluvial sediment supplies.\n                        </jats:p>"

Coagulants chosen for the analysis were aluminum(VI)sulfate and two pre-hydrolyzed coagulants – FLOKOR 1.2A and FLOKOR 1ASW/B. Water samples subjected to coagulation were collected from selected water treatment plants following the pre-ozonation process. Tested coagulants were dosed at optimal doses (1.2; and 1.8 mg Al3+/L). The process was carried out at optimum parameters: rapid mixing – 3 min at the rotational speed of 200 rpm; slow mixing – 10 min at 30 rpm; sedimentation – 60 min. Summary concentration of six priority hazardous PAHs in water after pre-ozonation amounted to 12.6 ng/L; after volumetric coagulation using selected coagulants it was in the range 6.8–8.3 ng/L. The highest efficiency in the removal of priority hazardous aromatic hydrocarbons was obtained after application of the preparation FLOKOR 1 ASW/B. Decrease in the summary concentration amounted to 46.4%. For the removal of individual priority PAHs, FLOKOR 1ASW/B was also more effective using lower coagulant dose than was aluminum(VI)sulfate (decrease in the range 23.6%–56.1%).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Ethiopia, less than 40% of farmers use fertilizer and those who do, apply rates signi cantly be- low those recommended. This low fertilizer use is primarily due to prices being two to three times higher than prices on the world markets. Reducing the price of fertilizer requires a sound un- derstanding of the product ́s supply chain. This study investigates whether fertilizer is delivered to farmers in an ef cient way and at the lowest possible costs using an institutional economics framework. It was conducted in the Arsi zone and relied on secondary data as well as primary data collected through interviews. The ndings point out the presence of several formal and informal institutions regulating the market. A market monopoly at each stage of the supply chain and a striking correspondence between the central organization of the chain and the rise in left-over stocks were observed. This pinpoints the imperfect structure of the chain and a misallocation of resources locked up in fertilizer stockholding. In order to improve the demand estimation pro- cedure, this study suggests that incentives should be instituted to enhance the reliability of the information transferred along the process. Additionally, expert knowledge used in the process should be well documented, stock inventories should not be limited to central warehouses and stockholding needs to be reduced. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Ethiopia, less than 40% of farmers use fertilizer and those who do, apply rates significantly below those recommended. This low fertilizer use is primarily due to prices being two to three times higher than prices on the world markets. Reducing the price of fertilizer requires a sound understanding of the product´s supply chain. This study investigates whether fertilizer is delivered to farmers in an efficient way and at the lowest possible costs using an institutional economics framework. It was conducted in the <jats:italic>Arsi zone</jats:italic> and relied on secondary data as well as primary data collected through interviews. The findings point out the presence of several formal and informal institutions regulating the market. A market monopoly at each stage of the supply chain and a striking correspondence between the central organization of the chain and the rise in left-over stocks were observed. This pinpoints the imperfect structure of the chain and a misallocation of resources locked up in fertilizer stockholding. In order to improve the demand estimation procedure, this study suggests that incentives should be instituted to enhance the reliability of the information transferred along the process. Additionally, expert knowledge used in the process should be well documented, stock inventories should not be limited to central warehouses and stockholding needs to be reduced.</jats:p>",

Two models are developed, both of which forecast influences of PM regimes for different types of carrier.Results: The findings of the study suggest that the reliability of the straddle fleet decreases with increased intervals of PM services. The study also finds that three factors – namely resources, number of new straddles, and the number of new lifting work centres – influence the performances of straddles.Conclusion: The authors argue that this collaborative research exercise makes a significant contribution to existing supply chain management literature, particularly in the area of operations efficiency. The study also serves as an avenue to enhance relevant management practice.</jats:p>"

The small cryostat placed inside the cryogenic distribution manifold located at the basement of the superconducting cyclotron building supplies liquid helium in parallel branches to three cold heads, used for cooling their associated cryopanels. The level in the cryostat has to be maintained at an optimum value to ensure uninterrupted flow of liquid helium to these three cold heads.

The research paradigm adopted for the study was therefore a combination of constructivism and post-positivism paradigms, which entailed the exploration and understanding of the various stakeholders in the port value chain. The epistemology of the research relied on the use of the exploratory sequential mixed method research technique (i.e. the qualitative approach followed by the quantitative approach) at the operational level of port operations.Results: The result of the research showed that significant challenges exist and that some of these challenges cut across all functions of port operations. Challenges are experienced in the areas of corruption, trade fraud, transport infrastructure deficits, the absence of a supply chain culture and shortcomings in the execution of the ‘contract of customs’. Additionally, these factors include the deficiencies in services and facilities provided by state agencies and government-appointed service providers and private sector companies such as truckers, inland container depots, Inland Container Depots (ICDs) and terminal operators.Conclusion: Specific recommendations are made to address the issues identified which, if implemented, could significantly address the current inefficiencies observed in the Lagos seaport’s operations.</jats:p>"

In irrigated areas the subsurface drainage can be an effective technique to lower the depth of the groundwater table and reduce soil salinity. In drainage systems, lateral pipes are designed to collect the free water from soil and convey it into collectors. In other words, collectors are commonly designed to convey drainage water from laterals downstream, while the laterals play an additional role in removing excess water from irrigated land. The present research was conducted to investigate the effects of collectors in discharging excess water from soil using a laboratory-tank model. The results indicated that on average 24% of drainage water was directly discharged through the collector pipe when the hydraulic gradient of the flow was sloped toward the collector pipe. Hence, it was concluded that, with proper monitoring, collectors were capable of reducing the drainage coefficient from an average of 32.5 to 24.5 mm/day, while drain spacing of the laterals can increase the results by about 15% in comparison with the present situation.</jats:p>",

In fact, in many developing economies the profession is still being treated as a ‘back-office’ function. However, not much has been done to explore and address challenges facing procurement professionals in developing economies.Objectives: The purpose of this article was to examine the critical role played by the procurement function in business and to reveal the challenges faced by procurement professionals in developing economies as well as to suggest solutions to these challenges.Method: A sequential literary analysis was used, complemented by cross-country qualitative data gathered from one hundred diverse procurement practitioners from Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe. These were primarily participants in a series of procurement workshops run by the researchers from January to June 2014.Results: Findings suggested that limited recognition, increasing unethical behaviour, poor supplier service delivery, poor regulatory environment, varying supplier standards and poor corporate governance are the main challenges faced by the procurement profession in these countries.Conclusion: The study’s findings imply that there is limited understanding regarding the role procurement plays in both government and non-government institutions in developing economies. The article suggests solutions which procurement professionals and organisations can implement in order to unlock the potential value in the procurement function.</jats:p>"

The findings suggest that both D1 and M1 are identical, given the perfect substitutability of the monetary components within those aggregates.

The capacitors used in these pulsed power drivers have low inductance, low internal resistance, and less dc life, so it has to be charged rapidly and immediately discharged into the load. A series resonant converter based 45 kV compact power supply is designed and developed for rapid charging of the capacitor bank with constant charging current up to 150 mA. It is short circuit proof, and zero current switching technique is used to commute the semiconductor switch. A high frequency resonant inverter switching at 10 kHz makes the overall size small and reduces the switching losses. The output current of the power supply is limited by constant on-time and variable frequency switching control technique. The power supply is tested by charging the 45 kV/1.67 μF and 15 kV/356 μF capacitor banks. It has charged the capacitor bank up to rated voltage with maximum charging current of 150 mA and the average charging rate of 3.4 kJ/s. The output current of the power supply is limited by reducing the switching frequency at 5 kHz, 3.3 kHz, and 1.7 kHz and tested with 45 kV/1.67 μF capacitor bank. The protection circuit is included in the power supply for over current, under voltage, and over temperature. The design details and the experimental testing results of the power supply for resonant current, output current, and voltage traces of the power supply with capacitive, resistive, and short circuited load are presented and discussed.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, many manufacturers nowadays sell products via indirect retailer channels and direct Internet channels. This paper models a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain to improve the sustainability of products. We apply the two-stage optimization technique and the Nash game to examine the impacts of the retail services and the degree of customer loyalty to the retail channel on the pricing of players in a centralized and a decentralized dual-channel supply chain. Our results show that the retail services have a great impact on the manufacturer and the retailer’s pricing strategies. We also compare the differences of pricing strategies between a centralized and a decentralized dual-channel supply chain and suggest the optimal retail services and pricing decisions for the players in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Arab region is characterized by arid and semi-arid conditions with very limited renewable water resources. Most of the surface water comes from transboundary streams and most of the groundwater resources are fossil in nature. Water quality degradation and excessive use of pesticides and herbicides in agriculture pose severe environmental and health risks. The underlying research is a joint effort between Cairo University and the Technical University of Berlin to develop technologies and strategies for sustainable pesticide-free agriculture using saline or brackish water. This project builds on a previously implemented project in Spain by the German research partner that introduced the concept of Watergy, which presents an integrated desalination horticulture solar greenhouse. In this current research, the Watergy greenhouse is further developed to meet more arid climate requirements, reduce construction costs, and increase resource utilization efficiency. Several lab-scale experiments and a 100 m2 prototype were built in Egypt to optimize the process and answer research questions. Lessons learned from this project provided guidelines on the development of the most efficient approach of desalination and water management in the system, devised a cost-effective and efficient heat exchanger using low-cost local material, and established the feasibility of the system in the arid climate together with prospects for wider applications. The proposed greenhouse was estimated to be able to save in irrigation water 40% for cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, and 50% for bell peppers. Maximum crop yield can be achieved at extended upper salinity levels using the proposed greenhouse as follows: from 1,000 to 1,700 mg/L for cherry tomatoes; from 960 to 2,000 mg/L for bell peppers; and from 1,600 to 2,700 mg/L for cucumbers.</jats:p>",

The logistics outsourcing problem consisted of a make-or-buy decision as well as a supplier selection process. The purpose of the study was to determine the most suitable method in the case of logistics outsourcing.Method: The decision-making methods were applied to a South African case study within the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. The logistics functions considered in the case study included secondary distribution and warehousing of finished goods. Each method considered the same evaluation criteria and the results were analysed and compared.Results: Each method produced different results to the logistics outsourcing problem. The method developed by Platts, Probert and Canez (2000) suggested that the logistics functions be insourced. The decision tree method suggested outsourcing both functions, with a unit rate cost model. The results from the linear programming (LP) method indicated that the secondary distribution function should be insourced and the warehousing function outsourced, with a fixed and variable cost model pending further analysis of the demand trends.Conclusion: The study provides empirical evidence that proven outsourcing decision-making methods, such as the method developed by Platts et al. (2000), the LP method and the decision tree method traditionally applied to a manufacturing outsourcing decision problem, can be adapted and applied to a logistics outsourcing decision problem of a South African FMCG company.</jats:p>"

Five individual reactive materials (zeolite, diatomaceous earth, brown coal, compost, and zero-valent iron as control) and four mixtures (compost:brown coal, compost:zeolite, compost:mulch, and mulch:diatomaceous earth) in different ratios were investigated. Benzene and Pb2+ were investigated separately using Pb2+/benzene spiked deionized water. Zeolite and brown coal were selected as individual materials for Pb and benzene based on their removal efficiencies. For the material mixtures, compost:brown coal (1:3) and compost:zeolite mixtures (1:3) were selected for Pb, whereas compost:zeolite (1:1) and compost:brown coal (1:5) were selected for benzene. The sequential extraction of Pb from these selected reactive materials showed that Pb was held mainly in the exchangeable fraction (52%–76%). Benzene was removed by biodegradation and sorption, with the latter contributing most to its removal (60%–99%). The selected materials were compatible with the environment considering the amounts of toxic metals leached from them, and their permeabilities were in the range of 4.2 × 10−5–2.14 × 10−3 m s−1.</jats:p>",

It causes water deficiency in majority of countries in the world, including Poland. Due to the water pollution advanced technologies for its treatment are in demand, what leads to increase of water price. In this connection, there are more often taken actions to reduce water consumption by using rainwater to flush toilets, wash cars, do laundry or water green areas. This publication presents results of Life Cycle Cost analysis of two variants of water supply systems designed for multi-family residential building situated in Rzeszow. In line with LCC methodology the calculations were made throughout the whole life-cycle of the building considering initial investment outlays intended for construction of water supply system as well as operation and maintenance costs. In the first of analyzed variants it was assumed that the system would be fed by municipal water supply network. In the second variant rainwater harvesting system for domestic use was additionally applied. Rainwater stored in the tank would be used in sanitary installation to flush toilets, what leads to lowering the costs of municipal water purchase, reducing fees for rainwater discharge to sewage system and consequently is beneficial for financial standing of the examined building.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We analyze a dynamic bargaining game in which a seller and a buyer negotiate over quantity and payment to trade for a product. Both firms are impatient, and they make alternating offers until an agreement is reached. The buyer is privately informed about his type, which can be high or low: the high type's demand is stochastically larger than the low type's. In the dynamic negotiation process, the seller can screen, whereas the buyer can signal information through their offers, and the buyer has an endogenous and type-dependent reservation profit. With rational assumptions on the seller's belief structure, we characterize the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the bargaining game. Interestingly, we find that both quantity distortion and information rent may be avoided depending on the firms' relative patience, and the seller may reach an agreement with either the high type or the low type first, or with both simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore our model to characterize the effect of demand forecasting accuracy on firm profitability. We find that improved demand forecast benefits the buyer but hurts the seller when the buyer's forecasting accuracy is low. However, once the buyer's forecasting accuracy exceeds a threshold, both firms will benefit from further improvement of the forecast. This observation makes an interesting contrast to previous findings based on the one-shot principal–agent model, in which improvement of forecasting accuracy mostly leads to a win–lose outcome for the two firms, and the buyer has an incentive to improve his forecasting accuracy only when it is extremely low.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Supply chains provide the critical infrastructure for the production and distribution of goods and services in our network economy and serve as the conduits for the manufacturing, transportation, and consumption of products ranging from food, clothing, automobiles, and high-technology products, to healthcare products. Cities as major population centers serve not only as the principal demand points but also as the locations of many of the distribution and storage facilities, transportation providers, and even manufacturers. In this paper a new model is developed for the design of sustainable supply chains with a focus on cities that captures the frequency of network link operations, which is especially relevant to cities due to frequent freight deliveries. The model is also related to recent literature on this subject. The goal is to demonstrate how, through the proper design (and operation) of these complex networks, waste can be reduced, along with the environmental impacts, while minimizing operational and frequency costs, and meeting demand. </jats:p>",

As a novelty, both cases, hysteresis in supply and demand, are analysed separately as an explicit part of a supply and demand model. Explicitly modelling supply versus demand side hysteresis has two advantages. (1) Since (hysteretic) supply or demand is only a subsystem of the entire market, persistent endogenous feedback effects on price and quantity are addressed. (2) Differences in the remanent effects of transient shocks between demand and supply hysteresis become obvious.</jats:p>",

I also compare the effects of fatherhood between different cohorts by dividing the JPSC sample into two birth-year cohorts (those born in or before 1960 and those born after 1960). The results show that the birth of children significantly increases hourly wage rates by 2.3% and annual work by 69 hours. Comparing these results to those of studies based in the United States and Germany shows that while the effect of childbirth on the Japanese male labor supply is large, it is relatively small on wage rates. The study also shows that childbirth has different impacts on labor market outcomes for the two cohorts. In the early cohort, the birth of children significantly increases wage rates, but has no significant effect on the labor supply. On the contrary, for the later cohort, the birth of children does not increase wage rates and there is a significant increase in the labor supply. Finally, I examine how the gender difference of children impacts labor market outcomes. Although its impact is not so large, the birth of sons has a larger effect than the birth of daughters.</jats:p>",

Descriptive statistics and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed to analyse the data.Results: The study results showed that a limited number of polytechnics had internal policies to operationalise statutory procurement legislation. Top management demonstrated very clear understanding of procurement legislation whilst senior-level managers displayed mixed levels of understanding. The section of the legislation dealing with disposals and the procedures pertaining thereto is perceived to be difficult to implement and does not promote value for money. Top management’s interference in auctions was the toughest challenge in the process, whilst public auction was the predominant method used in assets disposal.Research limitations: The research was carried out in only five polytechnics. This study could be replicated in other tertiary institutions or in other sectors outside higher education.</jats:p>"

This review evaluates data from physiological experiments at hippocampal CA3 to CA1 synapses and the calyx of Held synapse in the brainstem to analyze quantitatively the rates of release and resupply of glutamate required to sustain neurotransmission. We calculate that, without efficient recycling, the presynaptic glutamate supply will be exhausted within about a minute of normal synaptic activity. We also discuss replenishment of the presynaptic pool by diffusion from the soma, direct uptake of glutamate back into the presynaptic terminal, and uptake of glutamate precursor molecules. Diffusion of glutamate from the soma is calculated to be fast enough to resupply presynaptic glutamate in the hippocampus but not at the calyx of Held. However, because the somatic cytoplasm will also quickly run out of glutamate and synapses can function continually even if the presynaptic axon is severed, mechanisms other than diffusion must be present to resupply glutamate for release. Direct presynaptic uptake of glutamate is not present at the calyx of Held but may play a role in glutamate recycling in the hippocampus. Alternatively, glutamine or tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates released from glia can serve as a precursor for glutamate in synaptic terminals, and we calculate that the magnitude of presynaptic glutamine uptake is sufficient to supply enough glutamate to sustain neurotransmission. The nature of these mechanisms, their relative abundance, and the co‐ordination between them remain areas of intensive investigation. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

In the complicated measurement system, it includes various quantitative and qualitative indices with uncertain problems. However, classical measurement methods were based on subjective suggestion to weigh each index in the measurement system; moreover, there is no well-established performance measurement system (PMS) for evaluation of LSSC. For those reasons, this paper aims to present Bijective soft set approach to deal with the performance measurement of LSSC, which ensures the objective of the weight of each index and gets the core indices of the PMS. Based on the overall LSSC operation, customer service, and corporate management — the three parts in the proposed system of LSSC — the indices, and consistency of the metrics have been selected. Finally, an empirical analysis of developed framework for performance measurement is conducted and tested. </jats:p>",

To ensure a water resource system is productive in coastal areas, holistic and comprehensive management approaches are required. To address the aforementioned issues, a combined methodology which considers anthropogenic activities, together with environmental problems defined as the Overall Susceptibility Socio-Ecological System Environmental Management (OSSEM) has been investigated. The OSSEM model has been applied successfully in Spain based upon daily time series data. This research is ground breaking in that it integrates the OSSEM model in a geographic information system (GIS) environment to assess the groundwater contamination based on annual time series data and the assessment of system management by means of an overall susceptibility index (OSI). Centered on OSI indicators, the renewal, salinization and water deficit potentials in the Talar aquifer were estimated to be 4.89%, 4.61%, and 3.99%, respectively. This data demonstrates a high susceptibility in terms of environmental pollution, salinization, and water deficit.</jats:p>",

To support informed decision-making in Mexico City, a comprehensive study was conducted to assess the potential effects of climate change and the vulnerability of water sources. The infrastructural, environmental and administrative factors affecting the water available from each source were identified and evaluated, and then combined with the likely impacts in regional water availability estimated using results from two global circulation models and two emission scenarios. The results obtained indicate that the water sources outside Mexico City, such as the Cutzamala and Lerma systems, are the most vulnerable. The current situation is likely to become worse as a result of climate change, as projections suggest a 10–17% reduction in water availability by 2050. When responsible agencies decide the strategies to secure and increase water supply, they will have to consider the prevailing and potential conflicts, the local water demand, the contribution to the city's greenhouse gas emissions and future changes in water availability.</jats:p>",

This article shows how to match demand and supply effectively by means of two‐segment demand forecasting and supply contracts. We find that demand depends on the path of past retail prices, which leads to only a limited number of reachable demand states. However, forecast errors cannot be entirely eliminated because competitive promotions entail some degree of random (i.e., last‐minute) pricing. A hedging approach can be deployed to distribute demand risk efficiently over multiple promotional campaigns and within the supply chain. A retailer that employs a portfolio of forward, option, and spot contracts can avoid both stockouts and excess inventories while achieving the first‐best solution and Pareto improvements. We provide an improved forecasting method as well as stochastic programs to solve for optimal production and purchasing policies such that the right amount of inventory is available at the right time. By connecting a stockpiling model of demand with the supply side, we derive insights on optimal risk management strategies for both manufacturers and retailers in a market environment characterized by frequent price promotions and multiple discount levels. We employ a data set of the German retail market for a key generator of store traffic—namely, diapers. </jats:p>",

The approach consists of three steps: first, the compilation of a site-specific source file, second, the performance of a risk analysis for every catchment area, and third, the development of a monitoring strategy and action plans. The general goals are to lower the level of purification and to enhance the sustainability of groundwater extraction.

The programme is using as input: geographical data, population distribution, and groundwater availability (for a given area), to calculate the qualitative localised water needs, and to estimate the sizes and locations of water and wastewater management infrastructure, so as to minimise the relative annualised total cost (capital and operating). The programme is used to calculate the optimum water and wastewater infrastructure (and the relative annualised water and wastewater management cost), with and without the option for water reclamation and reuse. One case study is presented for the Greek islands of Santorini and Thirasia. The proposed model has showed significant computational benefit, compared with previous models. Thus, for Santorini–Thirasia Islands, the total annualised cost for optimum water and wastewater management infrastructures, with water reclamation, has been calculated as $2,153,694, while the above cost has been calculated as 19% higher, if water reclamation is not an option. It is obvious from the computational results that water reuse can reduce significantly the total water and wastewater management cost.</jats:p>",

The analysis focuses on business services, while household services are also considered. It is argued that differences in returns to scale between the two sectors and employment frictions in manufacturing explain why the growth rate of the service sector may be higher. The model also features that within the service sector the business services sub‐sector may grow faster than household services.</jats:p>",

Moreover, having multiple unions in the workplace does not appear to improve labour conditions.</jats:p>",

Additionally, the proposed cascade-stage delay measurement circuit can enhance immunity to supply-voltage variations of the delay measurement resolution without extra self-biasing or calibration circuits. Simulation results show that the delay measurement resolution can be improved to 1.2 ps; the average delay resolution variation is 0.55% with supply-voltage variations of ±10%.

The simulation results show that the power dissipation of the proposed voltage generator is 10.8 μW at a 100 nA load, and that of the proposed sinusoidal supply circuit is 35.5 μW at 100 kHz. The power dissipation values of the adiabatic/nonadiabatic 16‐bit MPU decoders are also compared. At transition frequencies of 10 kHz to 1 MHz, the proposed decoder with a sinusoidal supply circuit shows a maximum reduction of 75% in power dissipation from to that of a static CMOS.</jats:p>",

This article is based on a systematic literature review on medication loss, the objectives of which were to identify the extent and implications of medication loss, to identify the burden of prescription refill, and to make recommendations on effective preparedness. The review revealed that medication loss, prescription loss and refills, and the loss of medical aids are a significant burden on the medical relief teams. The medical aids are not limited to drugs, but include routine medications, medical/allergy records, devices for specific care and daily life, and emergency medications. One possible solution is to make a personal emergency pack and for people to carry this with them at all times. To ensure that patients are adequately prepared, stakeholders, especially health professionals, need to be actively involved in the preparation plans. Since our findings have little impact on disaster risk reduction unless shared broadly, we are now taking actions to spread our findings, such as presenting in conferences and via posters, in order to raise awareness among patients and healthcare professionals. As part of these activities, our findings were presented at the Evidence Aid Symposium on 20 September 2014, at Hyderabad, India.</jats:p>",

At the early stage, thoroughly fresh and in-depth information, theoretical and practical, in local infrastructure sustainability development, was gathered through literature review, a semi-structure interview and a focussed group meeting. For the pilot project, all crucial attributes were assigned to items of a questionnaire by a representative sample, Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Centre, one of the most important sources in community development in Thailand. Afterward, the improved questionnaires were surveyed for exact data by all target respondents: local infrastructure project managers/representatives plus the working staff. These accumulated data were analysed by SPSS and finally produced the expected outcome. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – They are categorised into 25 factors of 6 dimensions: management and administration, information and knowledge, policy and plan, environmental and natural resources, facility and infrastructure and finance and budget. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – With regard to a valid analysis reference, the study outcome can be applied to be the deciding factor in choosing the proper local development projects or the model measuring the sustainability level of community projects in a real-life context.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

The inventory information misalignment between them contributes to the failure of order fulfillment and demand satisfaction, and hence the associated penalties are incurred. In this article, we first analyze the penalties of ignoring such information discrepancy on both the drop‐shipper and the online retailer. We then assess the impact of information discrepancy on both parties when the drop‐shipper understands the existence of the information discrepancy but is not able to eliminate the errors. The numerical experiments indicate that both parties can have significant amount of the percentage cost reductions if the information discrepancy can be eliminated, and the potential savings are substantial especially when the errors have large variability. Furthermore, we observe that the online retailer is more vulnerable to information discrepancy than the drop‐shipper, and the drop‐shipper is likely to suffer from the online retailer's underestimation of the physical inventory level more than the problem of its overestimation. Moreover, even if eliminating errors is not possible, both parties could still benefit from taking the possibility of errors into consideration in decision making.</jats:p>",

Most of the criterions/attributes being intangible in nature; SCP appraisement relies on the subjective judgment of the decision makers. Moreover, quantitative appraisement of SCP appears to be very difficult due to involvement of ill-defined (vague) performance measures as well as metrics. The purpose of this paper is to develop an efficient decision support system (DSS) to facilitate SCP appraisement, benchmarking and related decision making. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This study explores the concept of fuzzy logic in order to tackle incomplete and inconsistent subjective judgment of the decision makers’ whilst evaluating supply chain’s overall performance.

Combining the concepts of fuzzy set theory, entropy, ideal and grey relation analysis, a fuzzy grey relation method for SCP benchmarking problem has been presented. First, triangular fuzzy numbers and linguistic evaluation information characterized by triangular fuzzy numbers have been used to evaluate the importance weights of all criteria and the superiority of all alternatives vs various criteria above the alternative level. Then, the concept of entropy has been utilized to solve the adjusted integration weight of all objective criteria above the alternative level. Moreover, using the concept of the grey ration grades, various alternatives have been ranked accordingly. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Finally, an empirical example of selecting most appropriate company has been used to demonstrate the ease of applicability of the aforesaid approach.

The present study was conducted for the crop maize (Zea mays), grown mainly in the rabi-season (July–October), to evaluate the irrigation water requirements in the temperate region of Kashmir Valley, India during the last 20 years from 1993 to 2012. The crop evapotranspiration values have been determined using the universally accepted Penman–Monteith method. The reference evapotranspiration varied by 93 mm, which accounts for variation of 20.12% for a temperature change of 1.61 °C. Net irrigation requirement of the crop is influenced greatly due to the possible effect of climate change, observed through varying temperature in different crop periods. The number of irrigations required in sandy loam soil is much more than the required number of irrigations in clay loam soil. The irrigation scheduling was analyzed using meteorological data through FAO-56 Penman–Monteith method as a guiding force for irrigation water management in order to save water and increase crop water use efficiency. The time series analysis reveals that maize crop in sandy loam and clay loam needs to be advanced by 5 days and 4 days in order to adapt for the climate change.</jats:p>",

Prediction functions based on simple kinetic models can be used to estimate soil N mineralization as an aid to improved fertilizer N management, but require long-term incubations to obtain the necessary parameters. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of predicting the mineralizable N parameters necessary to implement prediction functions and in addition to verify their efficiency in modeling soil N supply (SNS) over a growing season. To implement a prediction function based on a first-order (F) kinetic model, a regression equation was developed using a data base of 92 soils, which accounted for 65% of the variance in potentially mineralizable N (N <jats:sub>0</jats:sub>) using soil total N (STN) and Pool I, a labile mineralizable N pool. However, the F prediction function did not provide satisfactory prediction (R <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>=0.17–0.18) of SNS when compared with a field-based measure of SNS (PASNS) if values of N <jats:sub>0</jats:sub> were predicted from the regression equation. We also examined a two-pool zero- plus first-order (ZF) prediction function. A regression model was developed including soil organic C and Pool I and explained 66% of the variance in k <jats:sub> S </jats:sub>, the rate constant of the zero-order pool. In addition, a regression equation was developed which explained 86% of the variance in the size of the first-order pool, N <jats:sub> L </jats:sub>, from Pool I. The ZF prediction function provided satisfactory prediction of SNS (R <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>=0.41–0.49) using both measured and predicted values of k <jats:sub> S </jats:sub> and N <jats:sub> L </jats:sub>. This study demonstrated a simple prediction function can be used to estimate SNS over a growing season where the mineralizable N parameters are predicted from simple soil properties using regression equations. </jats:p>",

Implementation of near-natural mitigation zones such as reactive swales or wetlands have been proven to be promising measures to reduce nitrate loads in agricultural drainage waters. However, the behavior of these systems at low temperatures and its dependence on system design has not been well known until now. In this study, the behavior of a full-scale (length: 45 m) reactive swale treating drainage water from an agricultural watershed in Brittany (France), with high nitrate concentrations in the receiving river, was monitored for one season (6 months). As flow in this full-size field system is usually restricted to winter and spring months (December–May), it usually operates at low water temperatures of 5–10 °C. Tracer tests revealed shorter than designed retention times due to high inflows and preferential flow in the swale. Results show a correlation between residence time and nitrate reduction with low removal (&amp;lt;10%) for short residence times (&amp;lt;0.1 day), increasing to &amp;gt;25% at residence times &amp;gt;10 h (0.4 day). Performance was compared to results of two technical-scale reactive swales (length: 8 m) operated for 1.5 years with two different residence times (0.4 and 2.5 days), situated at a test site of the German Federal Environmental Agency in Berlin (Germany). Similar nitrate reduction was observed for comparable temperature and residence time, showing that up-scaling is a suitable approach to transferring knowledge gathered from technical-scale experiments to field conditions. For the design of new mitigation systems, one recommendation is to investigate carefully the expected inflow volumes in advance to ensure a sufficient residence time for effective nitrate reduction at low temperatures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Improved operational efficiency is important to role players in cross-border logistics and trade corridors. Cargo owners and cargo forwarders have been particularly concerned about long delays in the processing and clearing of cargo at border posts. Field studies suggest that these delays are due to a combination of factors, such as a lack of optimum system configurations and non-optimised human-dependent operations, which make the operations prone to corruption and other malpractices.Objectives: This article presents possible strategies for improving some of the operations in this sector. The research hinges on two key questions: (1) what is the impact of information interchange between stakeholders on the cargo transit time and (2) how will cargo transit time be impacted upon by automatic identification of cargo and the status of cargo seals on arriving vehicles at the border?Method: The use of information communication systems enabled by automatic identification systems (incorporating radio-frequency identification technology) is suggested.Results: Results obtained by the described simulation model indicate that improvements of  up to 82% with regard to transit time are possible using these techniques.Conclusion: The findings therefore demonstrate how operations at border posts can be improved through the use of appropriate technology and configuration of the operations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Logistics costs are most commonly measured on a national level. An understanding of the provincial logistics landscape can add significant value both to provincial and national policy interventions; such measurements are however scarce. South Africa’s national freight logistics survey points to significant challenges in the structure of the freight transport market, most importantly the dominance of road freight transport on dense, longdistance corridors. The Cape Town-Gauteng corridor is the main economic artery linking the Western Cape province to the rest of the country.Objectives: The provincial government commissioned this research to develop an understanding of the province’s contribution to the national logistics challenges in order to alleviate both provincial and national logistics challenges.Results: The research results provide a distinct description of the key action required – to provide an intermodal solution for the dense flows of fast-moving consumer goods on the Cape Town-Gauteng corridor in order to reduce the significant transport and externality costs related to these flows and reduce exposure to exogenous cost drivers.Conclusion: Collaborative research between government and private industry into appropriate intermodal technologies must be prioritised within the ambit of South Africa’s socioeconomic environment. This shift can be further supported through the internalisation of road transport externalities to enable a total cost decision between modes, as well as through appropriate regulation of the freight transport industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, an improved performance three‐phase neutral‐point clamped bidirectional rectifier with modified control scheme is proposed. The proposed control strategy takes into consideration the amount/degree of deviation of source voltage from desired rated value during supply perturbation and accordingly modifies the reference current template for each phase individually which is termed as compensated reference current. In other words, magnitude, shape and phase of compensated reference current waveform for each phase are different depending on amount of deviation of that phase. A complete mathematical model of rectifier using pulse width modulation technique is developed. The performance of the converter is evaluated in terms of near unity input power factor, low input current total harmonic distortion, reduced ripple factor of the regulated DC output voltage and particularly the neutral‐point voltage balance under different load conditions both for rectification and inversion modes of operation. It is shown that the three‐level AC to DC converter with the proposed control scheme displays better performance under source voltage perturbations such as voltage sag, swell, unbalance, harmonics, frequency variations as well as phase angle deviations which are regularly encountered in practical environment.</jats:p>",

The CSC converter at the front end of this single‐phase fed SMPS operates in discontinuous conduction mode that offers inherent PFC for wide range of varying input voltages. It is cascaded to an isolated half‐bridge multi output dc–dc converter for obtaining multiple dc voltages that are stiffly regulated and isolated from each other as per the requirement of the PC. The proposed SMPS is designed, modelled and its performance is investigated under steady state and dynamic operating conditions for varying input voltages and loads. It is found that the proposed design is able to offer excellent power factor and low total harmonics distortion at the utility interface as shown in investigations carried on simulation and experimental studies. A comparison of conventional SMPS with proposed PFC‐based SMPS vividly brings out the merits of the latter. Further, a comparison is made with other types of front end converters to investigate the relative merits and demerits of the CSC converter over other front end converters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The assessment of supplier performance is an important activity for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) as they adopt and implement plans and policies aimed at enhancing their performance in order to achieve sustainable competitive advantages.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of information sharing, supplier trust and supplier synergy on supplier performance in SMEs.Method: A quantitative research design was adopted in which a survey questionnaire was administered to a sample of 309 owners and managers of SMEs based in southern Gauteng, South Africa. A confirmatory factor analysis was undertaken to assess the properties of the measurement scale. Hypotheses were tested using the path modelling technique.Results: Information sharing exerted a moderate positive and significant influence on supplier trust and a weak but sigificant influence on supplier synergy. Supplier synergy had a strong positive and significant influence on supplier performance. However, the influence of supplier trust on supplier performance was weak and insignificant.Conclusion: The study provides a useful framework for analysing the interplay between information sharing, supplier trust, supplier synergy and supplier performance in SMEs.</jats:p>"

Most developed methodologies have been provided by consulting companies and are restricted in their publication and use. This article presents a methodology for evaluating companies’ degree of adherence to a SCM conceptual model. The methodology is based on Cooper, Lambert and Pagh’s original contribution and involves analysis of eleven referential axes established from key business processes, horizontal structures, and initiatives &amp; practices. We analyze the applicability of the proposed model based on findings from interviews with experts - academics and practitioners - as well as from case studies of three focal firms and their supply chains. In general terms, the methodology can be considered a diagnostic instrument that allows companies to evaluate their maturity regarding SCM practices. From this diagnosis, firms can identify and implement activities to improve degree of adherence to the reference model and achieve SCM benefits. The methodology aims to contribute to SCM theory development. It is an initial, but structured, reference for translating a theoretical approach into practical aspects.</jats:p>",

Forty nine (49) primary schools were selected for this purpose. The study revealed that, about 86% school had shallow tube well as a source for their drinking water supply and sanitation. About 18% schools had no sanitation facility or inactive sanitation unit. Separate toilet facility for girls and teachers was found in about 69 and 55% schools respectively but only one school has separate toilet facility for male and female teacher. Availability of water, soap and hand washing facility inside girls and boys latrine is in average amount but in teachers toilet it was satisfactory. Most of the schools (69%) have active drainage system at water point where 41% schools have basket in all classes for dumping of solid wastes. In this regard, the proper management and monitoring of existing facilities are required to improve the present water supply and sanitation situation in primary schools of Bangladesh.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/jesnr.v6i1.22050 J.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this study, I investigate supply chain contracts in a setting where a supplier uses its inventory to directly satisfy a retailer's demand. These “pull” contracts have increased in popularity in practice but have not been studied experimentally. In a controlled laboratory setting, I evaluate a wholesale price contract and two coordinating contracts. The data suggest that the benefit of the two coordinating contracts over the wholesale price contract is less than the standard theory predicts, and that retailers, in the two coordinating contracts, exhibit a systematic bias of setting the coordinating parameter too low, and the wholesale price too high, relative to the normative benchmarks. In an effort to explain this deviation, I explore three behavioral models and find that loss aversion and reference dependence fit the data well. I empirically test this result in a follow‐up experiment, which directly controls for loss aversion and reference dependence, and observe that retailers make significantly better decisions. Lastly, I administer a number of experiments which reduce the complexity of the problem, curtail the amount of risk, and increase the level of decision support, and find that none improve decisions relative to the treatment that controls for loss aversion and reference dependence. </jats:p>",

Our empirical observations highlight that focal firms do not necessarily transfer their own corporate sustainability agendas into control mechanisms for managing the sustainability of their suppliers. Based on this insight, we develop a new theory that explains how intra‐ and interorganizational sustainability management is affected by a firm's business case for promoting sustainability, control mechanisms, trade‐offs, trust and market liberalization. The theory offers new insights into drivers and barriers for effective interorganizational sustainability management, whereas previous theories could not fully explain the reasons for diverging sustainability management practices in supply chains.

The soil was Inceptisol from Kaliwining Experimental Station, Jember, East Java, collected from top soil of  a  productive  cocoa  farm.  A  closed  trap  system  was  designed  to  measurevolatilized  NH 3 from  soil  and  SFC  mixture  incubated  for  14  days.  For  the  pot experiment,  cocoa  clone  of  Scavina  6  seedlings  were  grown  for  six  months  withtreatments  involving  series  level  of  SFC  and  series  level  of  urea.  Soil  moisture content influenced volatilized NH3 by reducing 50% emission in where it was more obvious in higher level of urea applied. It was more than 90% in average for the increase in volatilized NH 3roduced by increasing in level of urea from 0 to 0.4 g kg -1 in  overall  level  of  combinations. An increase in urea  level  had  resulted in increase in  soil  pH, and  Parson correlation suggested a direct  link  with  volatilized  NH 3  We found  a  relationship  between  SFC  and volatilized  NH 3 and  their combinations  with soil  moisture  and  urea  content  were  able  to  inhibit  the  emission.  Emission decrease  up  to  28%  was  observed  from  0  to  100  g  SFC  kg-1.  This  inhibition may  have contributed to  the increase in  N cocoa  plant uptake  by  more  than  70% compared  to  control  and  subsequent  increase  in  N  fertilizer  supply  efficiency up to 86%  in the combination with 0.2  g urea  kg-1.  The absence of SFC had made a decline in urea efficiency about 20 times.Keywords: ammonia volatilization, sugarcane filter cake, urea, soil moisture, cocoa</jats:p>"

We first propose and test a model that describes the role of relationship‐level factors (trust and asymmetric dependence) and project‐level factors (between‐firm communication and within‐firm commitment) in determining supply chain project success. We find that project‐level factors completely mediate the effect of trust on project success. We conclude that trust, despite being a stronger predictor compared to asymmetric dependence, is necessary but not sufficient for supply chain project success. We then proceed to further explore the role of these factors by introducing a categorical scheme that differentiates supply chain projects based on the decision rights configuration of each project. This categorization enables us to explore how relationship‐level and project‐level factors can have different impact on performance based on the characteristics of a supply chain project. The findings offer insights into how to effectively manage supply chain projects and inter‐firm alliances. </jats:p>",

Living weight losses occur between the farm to slaughterhouses, and the main cause of these losses is the pre-slaughter handling, especially during animal transportation. In this research, we analyzed the pre-slaughter handling in a swine farm in Brasilândia, MS, Brazil. Analyzed data were provided by five slaughterhouses (farm clients) from the studied region, in which it was considered living weight losses, carcass bruising, animal injury, and death rate.

Natural gas will be transported across considerable distances from regions of gas reserves to European consumers. This raises security of gas supply concerns especially for EU countries that depend heavily on a single supply source or major transit route. A linear programming model of the European gas supplies was developed and used to investigate the impact of loss of the Ukraine transit capacity on gas supply from Russia to Europe. Two demand scenarios – that is a reference case and a high demand case in the winter of 2014/2015 were investigated. The results have shown that gas flows on interconnectors and from storage and liquefied natural gas import terminals compensated for the supply shortfall. Furthermore, to mitigate the effect of the supply shortage, the impact of increasing the capacities of selected pipelines within the EU was compared against increasing the maximum storage withdrawal rates in southeast Europe. Higher storage withdrawal rates achieved lower demand curtailment than the additional interconnector capacity in both scenarios.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Stakeholders’ demands for product sustainability redefine the focus of corporate purchasing strategies from the traditional concern with financial performance to considerations of ‘triple bottom line’ viability. This adds to the complexity of managing interorganizational relationships and poses a question regarding corporate ability to effectively leverage suppliers over environmental and social performance of supplied goods. Since it is not clear what type of purchasing relationship is more favorable for greening a product supply, the current paper aims to investigate how food retailers manage their relationships with suppliers in order to influence the environmental and social performance of procured goods and improve the availability of sustainably produced supply. The research is based on two case studies of Swedish supermarkets and supplementary semi‐structured interviews with Swedish, British and Danish supermarkets. The results of the study contribute to the existing body of academic knowledge in the field of sustainable supply chain management by developing a typology of sustainable purchasing relationships with detailed insights into the nature of collaborative practices, structure of incentives, sustainability ambition, and approaches to verification of compliance. The study has also revealed the dependence of sustainable purchasing relationships on the characteristics of the procurement context, namely the presence of well‐established sustainability certification schemes, perceived by purchaser's situation with availability of sustainability certified supply and purchaser's interpretation of the state of power dependence in relationships with suppliers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: South Africa exports a large variety of different fruit types and cultivars worldwide. Yet, there is concern in the South African fruit industry that too much fruit and money is lost each year due to breaks along the fresh fruit export cold chain.Objective: The objective of this article was to identify the influence of logistics activities on breaks along the South African fruit export cold chain. The focus is specifically on temperature sensitive fruit, exported in refrigerated containers to Europe and the United Kingdom through the Port of Cape Town. This supply chain was selected as this was the most accessible supply chain in terms of retrieving the necessary temperature data.Method: The cold chain was investigated from the cold store, through all segments, until the Port of Cape Town. Temperature data collected with temperature monitoring devices from different fruit export supply chains of grapes, plums and pome fruit (apples and pears) were analysed to identify the percentage of temperature breaks and the length of temperature breaks that occur at each segment of the cold chain.Results: The results show that a large number of breaks are experienced along South Africa’s fruit export cold chain, specifically at the interface between the cold store and the truck. In addition, the findings also show that there has been an improvement in the number of breaks experienced in the Port of Cape Town following the implementation of the NAVIS and Refcon systems.Conclusion: This article concludes by providing the fruit industry with areas that require addressing to improve operational procedures along the fruit export cold chain to help ensure that the fruit arrives at its final destination at optimal quality.</jats:p>"

Statistical trend analyses were performed on 90‐year regional indicator time series for annual conditions in observed temperature, precipitation, and streamflow reflecting the three major <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SIE</jats:styled-content> river basins: the Thompson, and transboundary Okanagan and Similkameen. Results suggest that regional climate has grown warmer and wetter, but with little net impact on total water supply availability. The outcome might reflect mutual cancellation of increases in precipitation inputs <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic>. evapotranspiration losses. Conclusions appeared largely insensitive to low‐pass data filtering, Pacific Decadal Oscillation effects, or solar output variability. Ensemble historical global climate model runs over the same time interval support this absence of appreciable trend in regionally integrated annual runoff volume, but a possible mismatch in precipitation results suggests a direction for further study. Overall, while important changes in hydrologic timing and extremes are likely occurring here, there is limited evidence for a net change in overall water supply availability over the last century.</jats:p>",

Using aggregated annual data from 1987 to 2012 in a simultaneous equations framework we show that the rapid increase in the urban residential housing price can be well explained by the forces of demand and supply, with income determining demand and cost of construction affecting supply. We find the income elasticity of demand for urban housing to be approximately 1, the price elasticity of demand to be approximately −1.1 and the price elasticity of supply of the total housing stock to be approximately 0.5. The resulting long‐run effect of income on urban housing prices in elasticity terms is approximately 0.7, because the increase in income has shifted the demand curve outward more rapidly than the supply curve.</jats:p>",

Cellulosic biofuels carry a lot of risk, because conversion technology is expensive. As a result, incentives are needed to reduce the risk for private investors. Government can implement policies to reduce the risk in investment in aviation biofuels. The issue is deciding which policy will provide the most reduction in risk, while providing a lowest cost to the government. This analysis focuses on aviation biofuel production using fast pyrolysis from corn stover. Cost benefit analysis is used to calculate the net present value, internal rate of return, and benefit‐cost ratio for a plant. Uncertainty is added to fuel price and four technical variables: capital cost, final fuel yield, hydrogen cost, and feedstock cost using @Risk, a Palisade Corporation software. We look at the impact of two policies: reverse auction and capital subsidy. For the reverse auction and capital subsidy, we used contract lengths of 5, 10, and 15 years to see the impact a longer contract could have on probability of loss. Both policies reduced risk in investment of aviation biofuels. A reverse auction reduced risk of investment more. As the contract length increased, the probability of loss and coefficient of variation in net present value were reduced substantially. When fuel price increased stochastically and a contract length of 15 years was used, probability of loss was reduced to 18.4%.</jats:p>",

We present results from an experiment designed to identify when plants control fluvial processes and to investigate the sensitivity of fluvial processes to changes in plant characteristics versus changes in flow rate or sediment supply. Live seedlings of two species with distinct morphologies, tamarisk (<jats:italic>Tamarix</jats:italic> spp.) and cottonwood (<jats:italic>Populus fremontii</jats:italic>), were placed in different configurations in a mobile sand‐bed flume. We measured the hydraulic and sediment flux responses of the channel at different flow rates and sediment supply conditions representing equilibrium (sediment supply = transport rate) and deficit (sediment supply &lt; transport rate). We found that the hydraulic and sediment flux responses during sediment equilibrium represented a balance between abiotic and biotic factors and was sensitive to increasing flow rates and plant species and configuration. Species‐specific traits controlled the hydraulic response: compared to cottonwood, which has a more tree‐like morphology, the shrubby morphology of tamarisk resulted in less pronation and greater reductions in near‐bed velocities, Reynolds stress, and sediment flux rates. Under sediment‐deficit conditions, on the other hand, abiotic factors dampened the effect of variations in plant characteristics on the hydraulic response. We identified scenarios for which the highest stem‐density patch, independent of abiotic factors, dominated the fluvial response. These results provide insight into how and when plants influence fluvial processes in natural systems.</jats:p>",

Both impairments contribute to the development of insulin resistance, obesity and chronic age‐related diseases. A physically active lifestyle keeps both the vasodilator response and microvascular density high. Intravital microscopy has shown that microvascular units (MVUs) are the smallest functional elements to adjust blood flow in response to physiological signals and metabolic demands on muscle fibres. The luminal diameter of a common terminal arteriole (TA) controls blood flow through up to 20 capillaries belonging to a single MVU. Increases in plasma insulin and exercise/muscle contraction lead to recruitment of additional MVUs. Insulin also increases arteriolar vasomotion. Both mechanisms increase the endothelial surface area and therefore transendothelial transport of glucose, fatty acids (FAs) and insulin by specific transporters, present in high concentrations in the capillary endothelium. Future studies should quantify transporter concentration differences between healthy and at risk populations as they may limit nutrient supply and oxidation in muscle and impair glucose and lipid homeostasis. An important recent discovery is that VEGF‐B produced by skeletal muscle controls the expression of FA transporter proteins in the capillary endothelium and thus links endothelial FA uptake to the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle, potentially preventing lipotoxic FA accumulation, the dominant cause of insulin resistance in muscle fibres.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Cortical oxyhemoglobin levels dropped by 35-40% in the activated S1 immediately before a PID (p=0.004) confirming increased O2 demand. Cortical foci from which PIDs originated during tactile stimulation had 27-32% residual CBF, indicating the presence of a critical range of ischemia vulnerable to PID initiation upon increased demand. Consistently, activation of non-ischemic cortex (hindpaw S1) or severely ischemic cortex (whisker S1) did not significantly increase the PID rate. Both tetrodotoxin (1 μM topical) and normobaric hyperoxia prevented somatosensory triggering of PIDs.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold>\n            PIDs are triggered upon O2 supply-demand mismatch transients in metastable peri-infarct hot zones due to increased demand or reduced supply.

For this purpose, a bi-level programming model is developed in which supply chain network design problem is considered as a strategic decision in the upper-level model, while the lower-level model contains the assembly line balancing as a tactical decision. In addition, the problem is extended to include push–pull strategy where decisions such as production amount and inventory level of each component in manufacturers are made. Based on the special structure of the model, a heuristic method is proposed to solve the developed bi-level model. A numerical example is employed to show the performance of proposed method in terms of feasibility and convergence. Finally, computational experiments on several problem instances are presented to demonstrate the applications of developed model and the solution method. </jats:p>",

The absence in synapsin knockouts indicates that the phenotypic target intersects with the biochemical pathway that is altered in synapsin knockouts. The results from synapsin knockouts additionally suggest that development of functional analogs with increased potency might be possible because induction of supply rate depression is faster in synapsin knockouts compared to wild‐type synapses treated with LEV.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

A pesquisa permitiu constatar que as comunidades não dispõem de água potável, o que tem gerado comportamentos de risco, tais como demanda por fontes inadequadas.

The cause for ‘collateral failure’ is unknown. We recently showed that intracranial pressure (ICP) rises dramatically but transiently 24 hours after even minor experimental stroke. We hypothesized that ICP elevation would reduce collateral blood flow. First, we investigated the regulation of flow through collateral vessels and the penetrating arterioles arising from them during stroke reperfusion. Wistar rats were subjected to intraluminal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAo). Individual pial collateral and associated penetrating arteriole blood flow was quantified using fluorescent microspheres. Baseline bidirectional flow changed to MCA-directed flow and increased by 4450% immediately after MCAo. Collateral diameter changed minimally. Second, we determined the effect of ICP elevation on collateral and watershed penetrating arteriole flow. Intracranial pressure was artificially raised in stepwise increments during MCAo. The ICP increase was strongly correlated with collateral and penetrating arteriole flow reductions. Changes in collateral flow post-stroke appear to be primarily driven by the pressure drop across the collateral vessel, not vessel diameter. The ICP elevation reduces cerebral perfusion pressure and collateral flow, and is the possible explanation for ‘collateral failure’ in stroke-in-progression. </jats:p>",

The allocation model is based on each supplier's production capacity, product quality, production cost, as well as possible decision maker's preferences. As a performance measure for rerouting strategy, we use the total outflow of the supply chain. We propose an optimization model and its solution determines the rerouting strategy for product flow through the supply chain under disruptions.
