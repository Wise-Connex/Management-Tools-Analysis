By means of a <jats:sup>125</jats:sup>I equilibration technique as well as by direct measurement of cold T<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, it was demonstrated that the level of circulating PB<jats:sup>125</jats:sup>I (representing iodothyronines as confirmed by column chromatography) increased by a mean of 40% within 24 h following the first iodide injection. The serum TSH concentration (measured by radioimmunoassay) was simultaneously depressed.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Thus, in stimulated thyroid glands, a biologically significant fraction of an iodide load escapes autoregulatory control of iodothyronine synthesis. A small, transient increase of hormone release is likely to represent the physiological response of a normal gland to a sudden supplement of iodide supply. The ensuing depression of TSH secretion may be necessary for final adjustment of thyroid function. It is considered to be the last step in a cascade of mechanisms whose interaction keeps the thyroidal hormone output within narrow limits in the face of a fluctuating iodide supply. Failure of one or several of these mechanisms in the goitrous human gland could conceivable explain the phenomenon of \"Jod Basedow\".</jats:p>",
