Target costing is an emerging process whereby organizations calculate the allowable cost (i.e., target cost) for buying/producing the product or service they offer for sale by first determining the acceptable selling price in the marketplace and the organization's required internal margin on the product. Based on case studies of organizations that use target costing, this research is both descriptive and prescriptive in nature.

This grouping is based on the varying economic conditions amongst the members of each, both historically and in terms of their diversification. The conclusion reached is that, whilst economic conditions are important in influencing the ability to pay for document supply services, they are more importantly a deciding factor in determining the perception of their usefulness. This perception in turn influences a society’s willingness to incorporate document supply within its policies and plans on research information access and infrastructure.</jats:p>",

For anyone concerned with publishing and document supply, whether as a supplier or customer, this trend cannot be ignored. The British Library ran a wide programme of projects (“Initiatives for Access”) to develop an understanding of how digital technologies might be used to support and enhance its operations and some of those particularly relevant to document supply are described. These projects were valuable in highlighting many of the issues to be considered in the use of electronic documents in document supply and an overview of these is given from four perspectives, namely business management, operational, technical and customer. Finally, the library’s current “Digital Library” programme is mentioned, together with two recent additions to the library’s remote service operations: Ariel® for electronic delivery and an integrated electronic journal store.</jats:p>",

The evaluation element typically consists of identifying the attributes, criteria, or factors relevant to the decision and then measuring or rating each vendor by considering each of the relevant factors. A critical part of the overall supplier selection process is the determination of the relative importance of each of the factors. This article presents an alternative decision model to evaluate the relative performance of suppliers that have multiple outputs and inputs. This approach is based on a multivariate statistical method, principal component analysis, that uses information obtained from eigenvalues to combine different ratio measures defined by every input and every output. The method has been employed to aggregate multiple performance measures for a real‐world data set of suppliers of a medium‐sized firm operating in the bottling machinery industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>The ISO 14000 series of environmental standards is a relatively recent development in environmentally responsible manufacturing (ERM). It applies to environmental systems and processes the same approach used by its predecessor, the ISO 9000 quality standards. Being relatively new, numerous questions have arisen regarding the impact of these new standards on both the corporate environmental management system and corporate performance. This article addresses some of these questions by drawing on data generated by a large‐scale survey of American managers. The results indicate that, even though ISO 14000 has achieved relatively limited acceptance, there is strong evidence to indicate that this series of standards can positively impact both the performance of the environmental management system as well as overall corporate performance. Further, it was found to outperform other ERM initiatives such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 33/50 program.</jats:p>",

Five primary results emerged, first, organizations with more successful TQM programs were more likely to stress formal performance evaluations of purchasing employees. Second, purchasing employees at successful TQM firms were more involved in key decisionmaking processes that impact their jobs than their counterparts in less successful TQM firms. Third, purchasing employees in organizations with more successful TQM programs had a greater level of perceived support through job security and less fear of failure when taking a risk. Fourth, purchasing employees in more successful TQM firms had more TQM‐related training. Fifth, purchasing employees in more successful TQM organizations were more likely to be rewarded for individual goal attainment than purchasing employees in less successful TQM organizations.</jats:p>",

In particular it means that standard approaches to assessing consumer benefits and the presence or absence of anti‐competitive behaviour may not be appropriate. It is argued that UK supermarkets are delivering a quite different offering to the marketplace from a simple “basket of goods” with a specific price and quality. The issues of product range, innovation potential, and associated convenience factors are all part of the package. This leads to a consideration of the questions of “What is competing with what?” and “Who is competing with whom?”: the issue of comparing like with like. From there we arrive at the question of how competition policy in this field needs to consider long‐term innovation potential as well as short‐term price issues.</jats:p>",

In combination, the three standards will allow end‐users to search for items, find a location for the item, order it, and receive the item electronically, without the intervention of an intermediary. This paper gives a brief overview of the history and development of the three standards. The two protocols and the important role played by two implementation groups, the ZIG and the IPIG, are discussed. The electronic delivery recommendation was developed by an international group in the early 1990s and has recently been submitted as an international standard. The paper concludes with a description of one major project (UNIverse) that is looking at the integration of all aspects of searching and delivery using these standards.</jats:p>",

The potential for outsourcing has moved from peripheral activities such as cleaning and catering to critical activities such as design and manufacturing. However, there is evidence to suggest that organisations are not achieving the desired benefits from outsourcing. Outsourcing decisions are rarely taken within a thoroughly strategic perspective with many firms adopting a short‐term perspective and being motivated primarily by the search for short‐term cost reductions. The aim is to illustrate that outsourcing should be carried out from a strategic perspective and integrated into the overall strategy of the organisation by proposing an outsourcing framework.  The framework attempts to overcome some of the problems associated with outsourcing by integrating a number of key strands related to outsourcing including a value chain perspective, core competency thinking and supply base influences into the decision‐making process.</jats:p>",

The intention is to monitor the changing landscape of the commercial world over a period of time and this study provides grounding to this process, drawing some important conclusions that will have an effect across a large section of UK business. The paper charts the advent of the e‐commerce revolution and how business is adapting to this new paradigm.  Examples include the Co‐operative Bank, Waterstones and RS Components.  Legal aspects of the Internet and commerce on it are also interpreted with ramifications for organisations that are protecting their data as well as positioning themselves to exploit the commercial opportunities that the Internet offers.</jats:p>",

Only three weeks previously he had been a normal, healthy teenager attending high school. Then he was struck down by a bout of nausea and vomiting, accompanied by a slight fever, which his parents initially put down to something he had eaten. After three or four days, when he showed no improvement, he was taken to his doctor, a rural primary-care physician, who, to his everlasting credit, noted an irregular heartbeat. The young boy was admitted to the local hospital, and transferred from there to the nearest university medical center, where he was diagnosed as being in heart failure. Only one week had passed since he had last played basketball. No definite cause for his heart failure could be found, which many might consider surprising in this day and age of advanced medical technology. But a lack of a confirmed diagnosis is unfortunately common with this condition, dilated cardiomyopathy-indeed, confirmation is a relative rarity. The disease is not confined to teenagers, but occurs in all age groups. It has many known causes-and even more unknown ones. In the case of this young boy, his clinical history suggested it was associated with a viral infection, and so he was diagnosed as suffering heart failure caused by a viral inflammation of the heart-viral myocarditis.</jats:p>",

A new ideal type of commodity chain, the “marketing-driven” chain, is proposed to describe the emerging pattern of supply of globalized beer brands, and evidence is presented from Malaysia to illustrate how the commodity chain operates. What distinguishes marketing-driven commodity chains is their reliance on the downstream activities of marketing and brand establishment. Such a chain has two important implications: It places substantial power over the alcohol supply in the hands of transnational brand owners, and it relies on an intentional process of cultural change directed by the brand owners to alter and embed exogenous patterns of drinking in developing societies. </jats:p>",

The cost of international interlibrary loan including document delivery and the journal subscription policies to foreign periodicals existing in a large academic library in Russia are examined. Results are similar to the results found in the Kingma study of the Library Centres for the State University of New York.

A theoretically relevant set of quality variables is identified from the literature. The results of a factor analysis show that quality is a two dimensional construct in the automotive supply industry. The core dimensions of quality are: product quality, which is primarily focused on design superiority and performance of the physical product; and service quality, which comprises both pre‐ and post‐sale service. The study reveals that both product quality and service quality are related to overall firm performance, regardless of whether asset based, investment based, or market based measures are used.</jats:p>",

After 2 weeks of exposure in a first-order stream, maple leaf disks had low levels of fungal biomass and species diversity. Spore production by aquatic hyphomycetes also was low. Subsets of these disks were left in the stream for another 3 weeks or incubated in defined mineral solutions with one of three levels of nitrate and phosphate. Stream disks lost mass, increased ergosterol levels and spore production, and were colonized by additional fungal species. External N and P significantly stimulated mass loss, ergosterol accumulation, and spore production of laboratory disks. On disks incubated without added N and P, ergosterol levels declined while conidium production continued, suggesting conversion of existing hyphal biomass to propagules. In all other treatments, approximately equal amounts of newly synthesized biomass were invested in hyphae and conidia. Net yield (fungal biomass per leaf mass lost) varied between 1% (in the laboratory, without added N or P) and 31% (decay in stream). In most treatments, the three aquatic hyphomycete species that dominated spore production during the first 2 weeks in the stream also produced the largest numbers of conidia in the following 3 weeks. Principal-component analysis suggested two divergent trends from the initial fungal community established after 2 weeks in the stream. One culminated in the community of the second phase of stream exposure, and the other culminated in the laboratory treatment with the highest levels of N and P. The results suggest that fungal production in streams, and, by extension, production of invertebrates and higher tropic levels, is stimulated by inorganic N and P.</jats:p>",

The results of the exit rate analysis of specialist organizations in a period of resource depletion confirm the reversibility of the resource partitioning process. In the case of post-socialist foundings spurred by deregulation, decreasing overall industry concentration is interpreted to conceal increasing concentration at the sub-industry level and points to the emergence of a second market centre. The formation of such polycentrist resource space accounts for the unexpected effect of overall diminishing industry concentration, which deters the entry of generalists and favours the start-up of specialists. </jats:p>",

Yet, most of these studies are either conceptual in nature or actual case studies. The primary objective of this research is to test the impact of a supply management orientation (SMO) on the suppliers' operational performance and buyers' competitive priorities (cost, quality, delivery, flexibility). Three major research hypotheses associated with SMO, Supplier Performance (SP), and Buyer Performance (BP) are tested using a confirmatory structural equation modeling approach. The results of this research support the conclusion that an improvement (increase) in the SMO improves both the suppliers' and buyers' performance (i.e., a win–win situation for the supply chain). In addition, the influence of SMO on delivery‐ and quality‐related performance is more statistically significant than on cost or flexibility performance. In fact, when volume and process flexibility are top competitive priorities, a supply chain management orientation may not be an effective way to achieve the desired flexibility. The article ends by discussing other conclusions and suggests directions for future research.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Using purified maize (Zea mays L.) SiR and isoproteins of Fd and Fd-NADP+reductase (FNR), we reconstituted illuminated thylakoid membrane- and NADPH-dependent sulfite reduction systems. Fd I and L-FNR were distributed in leaves and Fd III and R-FNR in roots. The stromal concentrations of SiR and Fd I were estimated at 1.2 and 37 μm, respectively. The molar ratio of Fd III to SiR in root plastids was approximately 3:1. Photoreduced Fd I and Fd III showed a comparable ability to donate electrons to SiR. In contrast, when being reduced with NADPH via FNRs, Fd III showed a several-fold higher activity than Fd I. Fd III and R-FNR showed the highest rate of sulfite reduction among all combinations tested. NADP+decreased the rate of sulfite reduction in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that the participation of Fd III and high NADPH/NADP+ ratio are crucial for non-photosynthetic sulfite reduction. In accordance with this view, a cysteine-auxotrophicEscherichia coli mutant defective for NADPH-dependent SiR was rescued by co-expression of maize SiR with Fd III but not with Fd I.</jats:p>",

The distributions of iron supply by upwelling/mixing and aeolian deposition were obtained by applying (Fe:NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>)<jats:sub>dissolved</jats:sub> ratios to the nitrate supply and by assuming the soluble fraction of mineral aerosols. A lower bound on the rate of iron recycling in the photic zone was estimated as the difference between iron assimilation and supply. Global iron assimilation by phytoplankton for the open ocean was estimated to be 12 × 10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> mol Fe yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Atmospheric deposition of total Fe is estimated to be 96×10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> mol Fe yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the open ocean, with the soluble Fe fraction ranging between 1 and 10% (or 1‐10 ×10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> mol Fe yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). By comparison, the upwelling/entrainment supply of dissolved Fe to the upper ocean is small, ∼0.7×10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> mol Fe yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Uncertainties in the aeolian flux and assimilation may be as large as a factor of 5‐10 but remain difficult to quantify, as information is limited about the form and transformation of iron from the soil to phytoplankton incorporation. An iron stress index, relating the (Fe:N) demand to the (Fe :N) supply, confirms the production in the high‐nitrate low‐chlorophyll regions is indeed limited by iron availability.</jats:p>",

Experimental results showed that oxygen supply methods have significant effects on SBR performance for high ammonium nitrification. With the controlled oxygen supply method, ammonium and nitrite oxidations took place simultaneously. With the uncontrolled oxygen supply method, ammonium oxidation proceeded smoothly during the low DO period of a cycle; however, nitrite oxidation was at first completely inhibited at low‐DO but recovered during the high DO period of the same cycle. Ammonium and nitrite were oxidized sequentially during a cycle in SBR. Ammonium oxidizers developed an ability to endure the fluctuation of DO, but nitrite oxidizers did not. Extensive starvation under high DO concentrations plays an important role in ammonium oxidation under low DO conditions.</jats:p>",

A random sample of nonmetropolitan towns in the United States was selected, and physicians with AMA MF (MFMDs) addresses in these towns were listed. Local pharmacists were asked to confirm or disconfirm the identities and locations of practice for the listed physicians and to add any unlisted physicians who were there. We took pharmacist confirmed or identified local source physicians (LSMDs) to be the “gold standard.” The sample of 57 towns yielded 1,341 potential physician names. In these towns, there were 377 physician listings only from the MF, 188 only from local pharmacists, and 776 from both sources. About 80 percent of physicians identified by local informants were also listed on the MF; only 67 percent of physicians listed on the MF were identified by local informants as currently practicing in the town where they were listed. The error in these measures declined with increasing town size. The aggregate ratio of MFMDs to LSMDs was 1.20, ranging from 1.10 to 1.28 across size classes of towns. Given the persistence of local shortages of physicians, despite a national oversupply, accurate measurement of physician supply should be a priority of rural health care planners and advocates. Although the MF is the most comprehensive available national physician database, reliance on it alone to make local estimates of physician supply might lead one to believe that there are 20 percent more physicians in small rural communities than are actually there. Local pharmacists can be valuable informants about rural physician availability and their in‐ and out‐migration.</jats:p>",

Duraznero crater erupted tephrite for 14 days and shut down upon the opening of Llano del Banco, a fissure that issued first tephrite and, after 3 days, basanite. Hoyo Negro crater opened 4 days later and erupted basanite, tephrite, and phonotephrite, while Llano del Banco continued to issue basanite. The eruption ended with Duraznero erupting basanite with abundant crustal and mantle xenoliths. The tephrites and basanites from Duraznero and Llano del Banco show narrow compositional ranges and define a bimodal suite. Each batch ascended and evolved separately without significant intermixing, as did the Hoyo Negro basanite, which formed at lower degrees of melting. The magmas fractionated clinopyroxene +olivine±kaersutite±Ti‐magnetite at 600–800 MPa and possibly 800–1100 MPa. Abundant reversely zoned phenocrysts reflect mixing with evolved melts at mantle depths. Probably as early as 1936, Hoyo Negro basanite entered the deep rift system at 200–350 MPa. Some shallower pockets of this basanite evolved to phonotephrite through differentiation and assimilation of wall rock. A few months prior to eruption, a mixing event in the mantle may have triggered the final ascent of the magmas. Most of the erupted tephrite and basanite ascended from mantle depths within hours to days without prolonged storage in crustal reservoirs. The Cumbre Vieja rift zone differs from the rift zones of Kilauea volcano (Hawaii) in lacking a summit caldera or a summit reservoir feeding the rift system and in being smaller and less active with most of the rift magma solidifying between eruptions.</jats:p>",

In the absence of cycloheximide, a decrease in the amino acid concentration of medium to 75% of control values was sufficient to induce the growth of enlarged chlamydial forms of reduced infectivity. Morphology became more distorted and the yield of infectious particles from inclusions declined as medium amino acid levels were further reduced. These events correlated with a general decline in intracellular amino acids, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, suggesting that chlamydiae require a minimum concentration of each amino acid for normal development. Cycloheximide enhanced the production of normal organisms and increased infectivity yield in media, suggesting that the drug increased the available pool of amino acids. This was supported by intracellular amino acid analyses. Aberrant forms with reduced infectivity were also induced during supply of infected cell cultures with medium containing blood plasma amino acid concentrations, supporting the proposal that nutrient levels in vivo could promote abnormal chlamydial development. Markedly abnormal forms were also observed during glucose deprivation, providing further evidence that aberrant development is a general stress-related response.\n          </jats:p>",

Fifty‐six 18‐month‐old children (26 male, 30 female) who were enrolled in the trial within the first 5 days of life and fed the assigned diet to 17 weeks of age were tested using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition (BSID‐II) (Bayley 1993) at the Retina Foundation of the Southwest, Dallas, TX. These children had also been assessed at 4 months and 12 months of age for blood fatty‐acid composition, sweep visual evoked potential (VEP) acuity, and forced‐choice preferential looking (FPL) acuity (Birch et al. 1998). Supplementation of infant formula with DHA+AA was associated with a mean increase of 7 points on the Mental Development Index (MDI) of the BSID‐II. Both the cognitive and motor subscales of the MDI showed a significant developmental age advantage for DHA‐ and DHA+AA‐supplemented groups over the control group. While a similar trend was found for the language subscale, it did not reach statistical significance. Neither the Psychomotor Development Index nor the Behavior Rating Scale of the BSID‐II showed significant differences among diet groups, consistent with a specific advantage of DHA supplementation on mental development. Significant correlations between plasma and RBC‐DHA at 4 months of age but not at 12 months of age and MDI at 18 months of age suggest that early dietary supply of DHA was a major dietary determinant of improved performance on the MDI.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Flooding of the southern part of the North Sea occurred between 9000 and 8000 BP, when the rate of relative sea-level rise was on the order of 0.7 cm per year for the Dover Strait Region and 1.6 cm per year for the area north of the Frisian Islands, forcing the shoreline to recede rapidly. When relative sea-level rise decelerated after 7000 BP for the Belgian coast and 6000 BP for the central Netherlands coast, sediment supply by the tidal currents balanced the creation of accommodation space in the estuaries and other back-barrier basins. Consequently, the barrier started to stabilize, and the tidal basins and their inlets silted up. Between 5500 and 4500 BP, the Belgian coastal plain changed into a freshwater marsh with peat accumulation, and the same happened 500–1000 years later in the western provinces of the Netherlands. The E-W running barrier/back-barrier system of the Frisian Islands in the northern Netherlands stayed open until today, however, because of lower sediment supply.</jats:p><jats:p>The period between 4000 and 2000 BP was relatively quiet due to the strong deceleration of the rate of sea-level rise; peat cushions developed behind the barriers, which were straightened by erosion of the headlands. Major and often catastrophic flooding occurred in the Middle Ages, when the estuaries in the southwestern part of the Netherlands formed.</jats:p><jats:p>About 226 (± 15%) × 10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> sediment, mostly sand, is stored in the barriers and back-barrier basins of the Netherlands, 70% of which was deposited prior to 5000 BP. About 10% of the stored sediment is estimated to be of alluvial origin. Most of the sediment is derived by the erosion of the Pleistocene basement during recession of the barriers, but tide-induced crossshore transport from the North Sea forms an additional source for the barriers and back-barriers of the west-facing coast of the Netherlands.</jats:p>",
