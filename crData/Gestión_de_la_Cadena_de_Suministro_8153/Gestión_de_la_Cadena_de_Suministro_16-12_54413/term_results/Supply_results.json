      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this study is to assess contextualized operational effectiveness of involving internal supply chain personnel, referring to logistics and supply management, in a firm's product innovation activities. Building on the classical contingency theory argument, this study presents a careful contextualization of the performance effects of involving internal supply chain personnel in innovation activities (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCPII</jats:styled-content>). Specifically, the authors argue that the effect of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCPII</jats:styled-content> on operational effectiveness is moderated by the organization's technology context, the level of operational supplier integration, and the interaction of these two factors. These arguments are tested with survey responses from 203 firms. The results indicate that organizations' internal supply chain personnel are either sources or conduits of valuable innovation‐related knowledge when complemented with supplier integration, especially in high‐technology environments. Moreover, the results further support the argument for disaggregating operational performance as the complementary effects are highly dependent on the operational performance dimension. Although research has encouraged involving supply chain personnel in exploration‐oriented activities, an investigation of the actual performance benefits of such activities is needed. This study addresses the operational effectiveness of involving supply chain personnel in product innovation activities and establishes that the relationship is fundamentally context dependent by elaborating the mechanisms that link <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCPII</jats:styled-content> and performance.</jats:p>",

Traditionally, the size of an air vessel in a given water supply system is estimated by trial and error, usually aided by computers. To simplify the preliminary estimation of the air vessel's volume, in this paper, an approximate analytical method is proposed and derived on the basis of incompressible flow theory and simple harmonic vibration theory. With this method, a theoretically optimal size of an air vessel, which is able to meet the protective requirements in hydraulic transients, could easily be obtained in an analytical way. Besides, a real engineering case is introduced in this paper to illustrate that the proposed method could give guidance and reference in the preliminary work of designing an air vessel in practice.</jats:p>",

Analog zur Automobilindustrie werden wichtige Wachstumsmärkte zunehmend durch Handelshemmnisse abgeschottet, sodass die Markterschließung durch Exporte vollständig montierter Erzeugnisse häufig ausscheidet. Um dennoch die Handelshemmnisse zu umgehen, hat sich in der Automobilindustrie die Completely Knocked Down (CKD)-Strategie durchgesetzt, bei der Erzeugnisse teilzerlegt in die Märkte exportiert und dort lokal endmontiert werden. Eine grundsätzliche Herausforderung liegt in der situationsgerechten Gestaltung der CKD-Supply Chain [1], wozu die in diesem Beitrag vorgestellte, simulationsbasierte Gestaltungsunterstützung entwickelt wurde.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management is strategic to the quest for service delivery excellence in South African municipalities. The supply chain journey in South African municipalities started in 2005 with reforms to introduce internationally accepted procurement best practices. The previous system failed the country due to deficiencies and malpractices resulting from the interpretation, implementation and governance of the preference procurement policy. Today (2016), supply chain management has become a talking point on which citizens are raising major concerns and it is perceived as being handled in a way that ﬁnancially beneﬁts few individuals. Laws and regulations governing municipal supply chain management are intentionally ignored or ﬂouted by municipal officials resulting in corruption, fruitless, wasteful and unauthorized expenditure. In an effort to address these challenges, the National Treasury continuously provides guidance in terms of policy revision, clarity in the provisions of the supply chain management policy, as well as training to supply chain management officials. This article provides an insight into supply chain management practices in a municipal context in South Africa. It highlights the status, challenges and way forward for the implementation of supply chain management in a municipal environment.\nKeywords: insight, supply chain management, municipality, public procurement, South Africa.

Haloacetic acids (HAAs) are one of the major by-products of chlorination. The concentration and variation of HAAs was monitored in 540 samples taken from tap water in six water and wastewater districts of Tehran, Iran. Seasonal variation indicated that natural organic matter and HAA levels were much higher in the spring and fall seasons. The concentrations of HAAs in drinking water samples varied with water sources. They were higher in drinking water obtained from surface water. In this study, the analysis method of human health risk assessment with regard to exposure to HAAs by drinking water in Tehran was based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) guideline. It was found from these studies that the risk to human health appears to be negligible.</jats:p>",

But there is generally no consensus on what the oil market has in store over the next 1–2 years.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>At a recent industry gathering in London, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the market was recovering from its severe 2-year decline, with global supply and demand becoming rebalanced, which will raise oil prices. “We are now at the end of a considerable downturn,” he said.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>But whether OPEC can reach, or keep, a production agreement is unclear. Although North American unconventional output has been unprecedented over the past few years, OPEC’s course of action over the next year “will define whether the industry will experience a slow and smooth recovery to a sustainable price equilibrium, or a period of underinvestment leading to a volatile and high oil price,” says consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “Even if the recent provisional deal produces minimal results, OPEC Gulf countries will ultimately need to cut production if operators expect prices to recover in the next 3 years.”</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Third-quarter company earnings were mixed, with some service companies and operators finally posting profits after severely cutting costs. Shell and BP reported third-quarter profits after shedding jobs and slashing expenses, rebounding from 2 years of losses. Both companies said they believe supply and demand are coming back into balance and expressed cautious optimism about 2017. But profits at -ExxonMobil, Chevron, Statoil, and other majors were not as positive. Halliburton finally turned the corner on profitability in the quarter but other service companies such as -Schlumberger did not.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Many oil executives are warning that the lack of investment caused by the downturn will lead to a severe oil supply shortfall in just a few years and, with it, a sharp price increase. That also may suggest that they believe that the oil price recovery will be so gradual that it will not spur any rapid rise in upstream spending.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>But although upstream investment has fallen sharply, a supply shortage is not necessarily imminent. Much of the upstream spending that has been curtailed, says Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert and executive director for energy and sustainability at the University of California at Davis, was from high-cost, frontier projects such as the Arctic. With budgets tight, spending may be directed instead to surer plays such as the Permian Basin in west Texas, with a focus on existing fields, which will lead to first oil production more quickly. Investment continues to flood into the Permian, and the US Geological Survey last month upgraded its reserve estimates for the Wolfcamp shale in the Midland Basin portion of the Permian. If OPEC continues to worry about losing market share and operators become more disciplined in their upstream spending, the shortfall may not materialize.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> </jats:p>",

To assess the results of this survey it was introduced deductive approach based on literature review and were used some models like Porter's value chain, Norton's and Kaplan's strategy map and map of value drivers. Finally it was discussed, using EVA model, what is the influence of value drivers of supply management on final value of enterprise from strategic and operational perspective. Main issue is that paying too little attention by Polish managers to strategic supply management have detrimental effect on long term value creation of the enterprise.</jats:p>"

We carried out at the end of our theoretical analysis, a general study on the theoretical approach of the management of the supply chain according to the criteria resulting from the characteristics of evolution of this concept, bringing a particular lighting to the latter. In relation to our subject, the contribution of our study lies in the contribution of elements aimed at redirecting the reflection around the SCM, and in highlighting the imminence of the transition from standard logistics to an integrated management of logistics, by integrating information and communication technologies, within a logic of inter-organizational cooperation, based on trust, integrity and commitment.</jats:p>"

A lot of research has focused on how these activities are coordinated and how interfirm transactions are governed. However, the existing literature is neither complete nor clear enough to understand how external and internal factors influence the shaping of a firm’s choice of mechanisms to govern transactions along the supply chain. Building from the existing literature, this paper proposes a conceptual model with two dimensions. The dimension of determinants includes three components: institution environment, industry structure and transaction characteristics. The dimension of governance patterns consists of five mechanisms a firm may use to govern its economic transactions along the supply chain: market contract, production contract, relational contract, relational production contract, and hierarchy. The paper provides prescriptions for the firm’s choice among five supply chain governance patterns under different conditions of the above three components of determinants.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aluminum is a strategic mineral resource, and China&amp;rsquo;s aluminum production and consumption is fairly large. However, its supply guarantee is uncertain because of a high dependency on external raw materials. This uncertainty may expand, so finding a way to reduce the uncertainty of aluminum resource supply is especially important. This paper applies the SFA method to analyze the aluminum flows in mainland China from 1996 to 2014, and establishes a supply structure model to measure its supply guarantee degree. The results claim that: (1) China&amp;rsquo;s aluminum production can satisfy demand and even create a surplus; (2) Domestic self-productive primary and secondary aluminum increased at an annual rate of 12% and 24%; (3) The proportion of self-productive secondary aluminum in the supply structure increased from 7.7% in 1996 to 12.8% in 2014, while that of primary aluminum decreased from 79.6% to 42.8%; (4) The total supply guarantee degree decreased from 87.3% to 55.6% in this period. These results provide a feasible way to solve this plight: the proportion of secondary aluminum in the supply structure should be enhanced, and an efficient aluminum resource recycling system needs to be established as soon as possible to ensure its sustainable supply.</jats:p>"

To analyze the collected data, the VARX method was used and the data were analyzed by Eviews 9 software. Also, for data analysis, the variable of economic sanction was considered as exogenous variable and other variables were considered as endogenous variables. The empirical findings of the study show that there is a significant and bilateral relationship between most endogenous variables of the model. Also, it was observed that the variable of economic sanction has a significant effect on the intended macro variables.\nKeywords: interest rate, price level, money supply, real gross domestic product, economic sanction.

Nutrient values were observed to fluctuate from month to month, usually reflecting rainfall amount. The effects of atmospheric scavenging were noted for months which followed several consecutive weeks of dry weather. Dry fallout, originating from outside the catchment, was thought to be an important contributor of phosphate.

The removal process of particles and microorganisms is highly dependent on the buildup of the schmutzdecke at the filter surface. During the ripening period and especially for cold waters, the buildup of the schmutzdecke may take several months until such filters are biologically mature and at steady-state regarding their removal performance for particles and microorganisms. In order to improve the performance of SSF in terms of the removal of bacteria, e.g. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus, pilot tests using natural bauxite as a filter media have been performed. The results showed a significant improvement in bacteria retention within the filter bed of a second-stage slow sand filter containing different depths of bauxite.</jats:p>",

The producers of traditional agricultural commodities, such as cassava, face the world market directly. Consequently, the producer price of cassava has become unstable, which is a disincentive for both its production and trade. This study investigated cassava supply response to changes in price. Data collected from FAOSTAT from 1966 to 2010 were analysed using Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) approach. The results of the VECM for the estimation of short run adjustment of the variables toward their long run relationship showed a linear deterministic trend in the data and that Area cultivated and own prices jointly explained 74% and 63% of the variation in the Nigeria cassava output in the short run and long-run respectively. Cassava prices (P&lt;0.001) and land cultivated (P&lt;0.1) had positive influence on cassava supply in the short-run. The short-run price elasticity was 0.38 indicating that price policies were effective in the short-run promotion of cassava production in Nigeria. However, in the long-run elasticity cassava was not responsive to price incentives significantly. This suggests that price policies are not effective in the long-run promotion of cassava production in the country owing to instability in governance and government policies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ventilation is important to maintain the indoor air quality and other comfort parameters in the occupied zone. The design of ventilation systems is based on one dimensional approach. When the air distribution is modelled in the ventilated space usually CFD simulation is performed and simplified boundary conditions are defined at the locations where the supply air enters the room. However, in some cases it is difficult to predict the duct flow by 1D methods. The flow in the duct system determines the outflow at the air terminal devices. The interaction between the multiple system elements is important, since many different combinations are possible, for instance multiple bends can create a special flow field which also influences the distribution performance of the duct. It is very important to determine this impact, because the room airflow depends on it. In this study the impact of the inlet boundary conditions on the fluid distribution performance of a special supply duct –which is designed to provide uniform distribution– is investigated with CFD. Three different inlet boundary conditions are defined: constant inlet velocity and turbulence parameters estimated from intensity and hydraulic diameter, diffuser after fully developed turbulent pipe flow, diffuser with one bend and a Venturi-tube upstream. In each case, the simulations are performed with the realizable k-epsilon model. The reliability of the results is estimated with the grid convergence index.</jats:p>"

The interactions among energy demand of east China, energy supply of west China and the utilization of renewable energy in east China are delayed in this model. We discuss stability of the system affected by parameters and the existence of Hopf bifurcation at the equilibrium point from two aspects: single delay and two-delay. The stability and complexity of the system are demonstrated through bifurcation diagram, Poincare section plot, entropy diagram, etc. in numerical simulation. The simulation results show that the parameters beyond the stable region will cause the system to be unstable and increase the complexity of the system. At this point, because of energy supply–demand system fluctuations, it is difficult to formulate energy policies. Finally, the bifurcation control is realized successfully by the method of delayed feedback control. The results of bifurcation control simulation indicate that the system can return to stable state by adjusting the control parameter. In addition, we find that the bigger the value of the control parameter, the better the effect of the bifurcation control. The results of this paper can provide help for maintaining the stability of the system, which will be conducive to energy scheduling.</jats:p>"

Nowadays, several mathematical methods have been adopted for the purification process, but their predictive precision and speed still need to be improved. This study applies a novel neural network called the extreme learning machine (ELM) to predict the coagulant dosage based on certain signification factors of the raw water. Performances are compared between ELM and back-propagation neural networks in this paper. The results show that both neural network algorithms perform well in this application and ELM can realize online prediction due to its short time consumption.</jats:p>",

Global supply chains are unthinkable without transport integration, which is usually accomplished through the form of intermodal transport systems. Intermodal transport systems are much more complex than the unimodal ones due to the number of stakeholders, included transportation resources, infrastructure and processes, which in case of poor coordination in the planning, organization and implementation of transport chain logistic activities can lead to increased supply chain vulnerability. Therefore, the main challenge in the functioning of intermodal transport operations in supply chains is to increase their efficiency taking into account the problems of associated risks. The current initiatives on the topic of identification and management of risks in the intermodal supply chains do not provide a complete and clear picture of the potential problems which the intermodal supply chains are exposed to. Hence, the purpose of this paper, which is based on the literature review of the model of the intermodal transport system structure and models of risk management in supply chains in general, is to provide a framework for a holistic Consideration of risks in intermodal supply chains, which can lead to the improvement of their efficiency and competitiveness.</jats:p>",

The understanding of maturity and its dimensions in terms of supply chain management – SCM can lead companies to better levels of performance. This paper aims to present findings on supply chain management maturity showing a theoretical model developed from the literature review and its application on three case studies. A systematic approach was used to the literature review. Due to the lack in the literature related to the purpose of this paper a long period was considered for the search of references linked to maturity of supply chain management. The approaches for SCM maturity proposed on the literature suggest different e common dimensions which drive a maturity of SCM. These dimensions can be consolidated in eleven key-dimensions of maturity for SCM. Also, it is possible to verify that as the maturity of SCM evolves to an advanced level more integrated and capable a supply chain becomes. The application of this theoretical model through case studies could confirm the framework proposed and generated new directions of research. The theoretical model was applied in three case studies from different segment of industry and with different level of maturity. A qualitative approach was more adequate for this initial step aligned with this exploratory purpose. More qualitative and quantitative studies need to be done to obtain more evidences from the field and from other different segment of industry. This theoretical model is unique taking into consideration that it was developed from various perspectives of maturity proposed on the literature. This same structure can be applied in more field researches seeking better understandings about maturity of SCM. Also, it can be used by practitioners with the purpose to get a better view of SCM maturity dimensions and allow establishing new directions in terms of supply chain decisions.</jats:p>"

However, such a detailed, generic, and holistic policy evaluation framework is not found in the literature. This paper reviews studies to evaluate water supply and/or demand management options conducted during 2000–2016. Primarily, the paper reviews the evaluation criteria used by different studies for decision making given their significant difference and the importance of a comprehensive set of criteria to complete a rigorous evaluation. In addition, a comprehensive set of water supply and demand management options are not considered together for a comparative assessment to prioritise best options for a certain area and time. Further, performance of these options needs to be evaluated for a range of uncertainties arising from changes of spatial and temporal variables of the system. While this paper highlights the important aspects that need to be included in a comprehensive policy evaluation framework, available studies collectively present a rich set of information to support it.</jats:p>"

Over time, there was an exchange of waters from those of the sedimentation period to infiltration waters. Brine used for balneotherapy in the spa of the Salt Mine Wieliczka is captured at two outflows: WVI-32 at level VI, and WVII-16 at level VII of the mine. Long–term measurements of water flow confirm the stable nature of the outflows with a mild descending trend. NaCl content in the WVI-32 leak has a clear increasing trend, while the ­WVII-16 leak did not show any significant trend, which reflects a diversification of supply areas and inflow routes to the outflow areas in the mine. The isotopic composition of water from the WVI-32 leak is variable and did not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of the results, and creates need for further research. The WVII-16 leak represents the Pleistocene water without a direct contact with the contemporary waters, however, after more than 25 years, addition of such waters may appear.\n\n</jats:p>",

The objective of the paper is to show and analyze the results of the tracer test, during which the tracer NaCl was injected, and to correlate the obtained characteristics of the subsurface and the breakthrough curves of the selected pharmaceuticals, so that the effects of sorption can be quantified. During the tracer test, the hydraulic head, flow, electric conductivity and concentrations of the pharmaceuticals were monitored continuously to collect sufficient data. The results show that sorption coefficients can be determined from experimental data and the NaCl breakthrough curve.</jats:p>",

The effects of dominant faults, hidden misoperation and non-operation of the relay protection systems on the reduced power supply load power are analysed, and a probabilistic model for reduced power supply load power is constructed by three parts corresponding to dominant faults, hidden misoperation and non-operation. A probability calculation method of power supply risk occurrence due to hidden faults of relay protecttion system is proposed considering the fault probability of the relay protection systems, the frequency of the hidden faults occurring in operation period, the reduced power supply load power or load power outage, and the connection mode of the in-lines, out-lines and transformers in a substation. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed method for estimation of risk value probability of the relay protection systems is verified by two studied examples.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aluminum is a strategic mineral resource, and China’s aluminum production and consumption is fairly large. However, its supply guarantee is uncertain because of a high dependency on external raw materials. This uncertainty may expand, so finding a way to reduce the uncertainty of aluminum resource supply is especially important. This paper applies the SFA method to analyze the aluminum flows in mainland China from 1996 to 2014, and establishes a supply structure model to measure its supply guarantee degree. The results claim that: (1) China’s aluminum production can satisfy demand and even create a surplus; (2) Domestic self-productive primary and secondary aluminum increased at an annual rate of 12% and 24%; (3) The proportion of self-productive secondary aluminum in the supply structure increased from 7.7% in 1996 to 12.8% in 2014, while that of primary aluminum decreased from 79.6% to 42.8%; (4) The total supply guarantee degree decreased from 87.3% to 55.6% in this period. These results provide a feasible way to solve this plight: the proportion of secondary aluminum in the supply structure should be enhanced, and an efficient aluminum resource recycling system needs to be established as soon as possible to ensure its sustainable supply.</jats:p>"

Efficient simultaneous bromate and nitrate removal was achieved at feed concentrations of 500 µg/L bromate and 45 mg/L nitrate under autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions. Operational taxonomic units-based analysis (97% similarity cut-off) of bioreactor samples (three periods) revealed that the microbial diversity changed regardless of operational conditions. Sulfurimonas spp. was dominant in the reactor at the adaptation stage. Thiobacillus denitrificans is a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium that is capable of the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds. After the adaptation period, the microbial profile changed such that Spirochaetacea spp. and Denitratisoma spp. were major species in the column reactor. After 60 d of operation, Hyphomicrobium vulgare became dominant due to the mixotrophic denitrification conditions.</jats:p>",

To achieve the desirable inventory service level without the need of holding a lot of inventory, fashion companies commonly adopt the quick response practice. In this paper, we conduct an analytical study on the influence played by the inventory service target on quick response fashion retail supply chains. To be specific, we consider the case when the fashion retailer, who is the channel leader, aims to achieve an inventory service target in its inventory planning. We explore impacts of the inventory service-targeted quick response program, in terms of expected profit, and profit risk on the fashion retailer, the fashion manufacturer, and the fashion supply chain system. We also examine the quick response’s impact on social welfare. We show how three practical contracts, namely, the fixed-fee contract, the wholesale pricing contract, and the product variety contract, can be employed to achieve a win–win situation in the fashion retail supply chain system with the adoption of the inventory service-targeted quick response program. Closed-form managerial insights on how the inventory service target affects the expected benefit of quick response, the reduction of profit risk under quick response, the expected gain of social welfare, the achievability of the win–win situation, and the setting of contractual parameters, are derived.</jats:p>",

This study is based on empirical data collected from a survey of 206 small- and medium-size firms in Korea. Structural equation modeling is used to test the research questions. The results show that supply chain dynamic capabilities positively influence technological innovation and operational performance of an enterprise. Additionally, structural equation analyses reveal that technological innovation plays a role as a partial mediator of the relationship between supply chain dynamic capabilities and operational performance. In a dynamic and ever-changing environment, the enforcement of dynamic capabilities in a sustainable supply chain is important for the innovation of technology and the improvement of operational performance. Further investigation is required to understand the differences by industries, characteristics of enterprises, and positions in a supply chain.</jats:p>",

Most physicians currently are unaware of the cost of operating room supplies. A large amount of waste occurs secondary to lack of knowledge and absence of physician incentives for cost saving. Many of the decisions for supply use can be based on good scientific evidence, which supports specific cost saving measures. Careful attention to blood utilization and use of tranexamic acid has the potential to save millions in the hip fracture treatment and arthroplasty treatments. Standardization of surgical preparation and draping can decrease costs and prevent costly surgical site infections. Following protocols and guidelines for bone graft and orthobiologics is critical. The clinical and legal repercussions of retained instruments and costs associated with dropped implants is a huge source of wasted health care dollars. Reprocessing programs for external fixators and tourniquets have been extremely successful. A myriad of opportunities for intraoperative cost savings exist that could be applied to nearly every orthopaedic surgery performed in the United States. It is incumbent on all surgeons to put aside the choices made out of habit and take part in reducing operating room waste for the benefit of hospitals, patients, and the health care system. When applied to the 5.3 million orthopaedic surgeries performed annually in the United States, billions of dollars could easily be saved with no adverse effect on patient care.</jats:p>",

Methodology: The study adopted a descriptive research design. The target population was 78 registered real estate companies in Kenya. The sample size was therefore 39 registered real estate companies in Kenya. Primary data was collected through the administration of the questionnairesResults: The study found that finance cost, cost of building materials, cost of land and tax cost have a statistical and negative influence on the growth of supply of real estate housing. The study also concludes that increase in growth of real estate market despite the high interest rate could owe to the price inelastic demand for housing owing to economic disparity in the country. While low income earners, who are majority, are pushed away to less glossy and crowded homes where survival supersedes luxury, the upper middle income purchase of housing units is on the upward spiral.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended that the government should lower interest expenses so as to encourage the increase in supply of affordable real estate housing. The bank should also lower their interest rates so that the real estate firms can be able to increase the supply of housing. The study also recommends that investors should consider investing in the real estate market despite the erratic interest rates.</jats:p>"

The synchrony of several resistance mechanisms like hydraulic, osmotic, and electro-kinetic as well as numerous coupling effects complicate the analysis of their individual contributions to the fouling extent. A new measuring approach using a dead-end filtration test-cell allows exactly this, irrespective of any simultaneously occurring concentration polarization phenomena. First results show that the hydraulic resistance of a fully developed colloidal layer is not exclusively determined by the physicochemical properties of its constituents but seems to be strongly dependent on the specific way of its formation (e.g. ionic strength prevailing during layer build-up or filtration sequence of different particle sizes). This time-dependent effect is largely irreversible and therefore most likely due to persistent changes in fouling layer structure. A minor reversible ionic strength effect could also be demonstrated. The extent of this effect is identical irrespective of whether the ionic strength is increased or decreased. Results further indicate that commonly applied models like the Kozeny–Carman equation are lacking a size-dependent parameter that causes a disproportionate decrease of colloidal fouling layer resistance with decreasing foulant particle size.</jats:p>",

This paper primarily focuses on product quality and quality inspection techniques to maximize the actors’ and supply chain’s profits using game theory approach. The supplier–buyer setup is described in terms of textile manufacturer–retailer supply chain where quality inspection is an important aspect and the product return from the customer is generally accepted. Textile manufacturer produces the product, whereas, retailer acts as a reseller who buys the products from the textile manufacturer and sells them to the customers. In this context, the former invests in the product quality whereas the latter invests in the random quality inspection and traceability. The relationships between the textile manufacturer and the retailer are recognized as horizontal and vertical alliances and modeled using non-cooperative and cooperative games. The non-cooperative games are based on the Stackelberg and Nash equilibrium models. Further, bargaining and game change scenarios have been discussed to maximize the profit under different games. To understand the appropriateness of a strategic alliance, a computational study demonstrates textile manufacturer–retailer relation under different game scenarios.</jats:p>"

The Canadian Farm Products Agencies Act requires that comparative advantage be used to guide the allocation of new quota when increases in consumer demand necessitate increased production. This requirement, however, has not been met in practice. We develop a proposal by Meilke to use quota prices as measures of comparative advantage. We evaluate the quota price approach and other proposed methods, from a Hayekian and Coasean market process perspective. We conclude that quota prices offer an economically justifiable indicator of provincial comparative advantage. We develop an individual‐level general equilibrium model of quota exchange to illustrate the informational content of quota prices as indicators of comparative advantage. We also discuss potential practical challenges of using quota prices as indicators of comparative advantage.</jats:p>",

It is therefore important that the tank design and operation are sufficiently optimised. Sedimentation tanks are commonly overdesigned, leading to unwarranted capital expenditure, and overloading. This study used computational fluid dynamics to model the current conditions of two full-scale sedimentation tanks of different lengths at a large drinking water treatment plant in South Africa, using the shear stress transport turbulence model. The flow dynamics and the polyelectrolyte flocculated particle settling efficiency between the short tank and the long tank were compared. Recirculation zones near the inlet were pronounced in the short tank, which resulted in particles being drawn towards the outlets. The flow in the long tank isolated the inlet and outlet, with low particle volume fractions and particle velocities at the weirs. The particle removal in both tanks was greater than 99%; however, removal was higher in the long tank (99.86%), hence it was more efficient despite greater infrastructure cost. Computational fluid dynamics modelling is a tremendous operational tool which can review the performance of alternative tank designs and provide valuable input into future design.</jats:p>",

The adoption of supply chain management practices is critical to the provision of quality products and services as well as the satisfaction of customers by small to medium enterprises. This paper investigated the relationship between customer satisfaction, supply chain management practices and three input factors; namely, product quality, flexibility and product variety in small to medium enterprises. The study adopted a quantitative approach in which a four section questionnaire was distributed to 131 managers in small to medium enterprises based in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Hypotheses were tested using regression analysis. The results of the study revealed that product quality and flexibility predicted supply chain management practices. Supply chain management practices were also statistically significant, and mediated the relationship between customer satisfaction and product quality and flexibility. Based on these results, conclusions were drawn and appropriate recommendations were made.</jats:p>",

The global REE demand will grow rapidly during the global transformation toward a greener economy in the next decades. This high demand will require a steady supply chain in the long run. China has a monopoly of global REE production and extraction. The global REE supply chain runs the risk of disruption along with Chinese REE policy evolution. To overcome this supply chain vulnerability, new strategies and measures should be adopted to satisfy future REE supply/demand. There is a pressing need to explore REE deposits, develop efficient REE recycling techniques from end-of-life products, improve substitution technologies for REEs, and reduce the number of critical REEs used in devices. Such measures are facing significant challenges due to environmental factors and an unbalanced market, and overcoming them requires efforts from government and REE companies.</jats:p>",

Royal inscriptions treating this motif most often deploy it in general descriptions of the king’s abundant provision for his land. The note in 2 Kings 20:20 fits this pattern. Less frequently, the motif is deployed in the context of descriptions of specific military successes. The description in 2 Chronicles 32:2–4 fits this pattern. The chapter argues that 2 Chronicles 32:2–4 and 2 Kings 20:20 have no literary–historical relationship to one another and make different claims about Hezekiah’s reign. It evaluates them in light of other textual and archaeological evidence for late Iron Age II Judah.</jats:p>",

According to the Austrian Standard M5873, this plant radiometer is a standardized part of each plant. The standard defines a so-called reference radiometer (RRM) as well. This is necessary because a plant radiometer has to be controlled periodically. A RRM is a hand-held device which has to fulfil high-quality criteria and must be almost insensitive to environmental conditions. In this paper the principles of the concept behind the RRM are explained together with the requirements of such a device. Further on, the test methods are presented as well as a summary of test results from all RRMs developed during the past 15 years. It is shown that the radiation monitoring concept of the Austrian Standard has been successfully practicable and that the international acceptance of the Austrian Standard is justified.</jats:p>",

When production lead-time is long and the selling season is short, the retailer has to place an order ahead of the season, which resembles the classical Newsvendor model. However, we consider the situation when the supplier agrees to deliver the order in multiple shipments in the season, and then the retailer needs to determine the quantity and/or timing of each shipment. Under a centralized setting, we derive the optimal quantity and/or timing decisions of the retailer. Under a decentralized setting, incentive misalignment arises from ineffective allocation of inventory costs between the parties, in addition to the well- known double marginalization effect. Hence, we devise an incentive contract, which involves a risk-sharing mechanism at the end of the season and an inventory subsidizing scheme for the entire season; in practice, the inventory subsidizing scheme can be implemented in different ways, such as a direct subsidizing scheme or a delayed-payment scheme. The proposed contract can achieve channel coordination and Pareto optimality. Furthermore, we can show that the inventory subsidizing scheme plays a key role in channel coordination because without the inventory subsidizing scheme, the loss of supply chain efficiency is almost always significant. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper broaches the issue of unfair trading practices (UTPs) at the expense of, economically spoken, weaker actors among the food supply chain in context of the EU. For illustrating the concept of UTPs and delivering a theoretical basis for scrutinizing the term of fairness in respective trading practices the paper suggests the three variables 1) bargaining power, 2) market power/anti competitive practices and 3) unequal gain distribution. Subsequently the article presents selected national food-specific legislative based reactions towards UTPs evolved in context of the three variables. Ultimately the paper presents a qualitatively generated hypothesis which presumes that legislative food-specific measurements focussing on protecting suppliers lead to a beneficial monetary share for farmers, by means of influencing the producer price to a monetarily advantageous extent. The hypothesis was generated unprejudiced in the run-up to the paper. The research design which led to the hypothesis mentioned will be presented.</jats:p>"

All such reports are usually paper-based and are missing the required precision to control this valuable commodity, which could lead to misuse or illegal sale of fuel. This paper presents a control system based on RFID technology to monitor the supply and dispensing of vehicle fuel in Baghdad. The system consists of RFID readers attached to fuel dispensers and pumps, and RFID tags assigned to the vehicles and the trucks used for delivering fuel to the fuel stations. A hardware part is connected to conventional fuel dispensers and machines, located at both the stations and the fuel refineries or depots, which makes them work under the control of the RFID system, without the need to rebuild new dispensers. The designed system database is a centralized one located on a cloud server, in order to allow fuel stations to communicate with it and do the required transactions. Throughout this system, different reports can be generated, which can give important online statistics about the movement of fuel supplies over the city.</jats:p>",

Legislative interventions need to be accompanied by significant action across all sectors of the built environment through reducing energy demand, providing energy supply from low carbon sources and combining with this with energy storage to enable necessary targets to be met. Retrofitting existing buildings is critical to making these cuts as 80% of buildings currently in existence will still be present in 2050. These retrofits need to be undertaken rapidly using replicable and affordable solutions that benefit both the householder whilst significantly reducing emissions. This paper will present an evaluation of a £9.6 million regional scale retrofit programme funded under the Welsh Governments Arbed 1 Programme which aimed to reduce fuel poverty, reduce carbon emissions and support the energy efficiency and renewable supply chain and encourage recruitment and training in the sector. Results have been obtained from desk top data collection and energy modelling calculations. The evaluation work presents the technical, environmental and economic impacts of the programme and demonstrates lessons learnt to help improve the implementation of the other regional retrofit projects providing evidence of the impacts of a large scale retrofit programme that are necessary for the deep carbon reductions required in the near future.</jats:p>"

Patterns of perceived public library outcomes in five countries. Journal of Documentation, 72(2), 342–361. http://dx.doi:org/10.1108/JD-08-2015-0103\r\n\r\nObjective – To compare citizens' perceptions of the benefits of libraries in five culturally diverse countries.\r\n\r\nDesign – Postal survey to a random stratified sample and web surveys (some with a sampling plan, some apparently not).\r\n\r\nSetting – Surveys were administered in Finland (by post), Norway, the Netherlands, the United States of America, and South Korea (online).\r\n\r\nSubjects – Selected or self-selected members of the general adult population in the specified countries who had used a public library within the past year.\r\n\r\nMethods – Surveys were administered and data were collected in each of the five countries. A dependent variable representing perceived outcomes was calculated from 19 outcome measures (related to life experiences). Within this, 4 indices were calculated from subsets of the 19 measures, relating to work, education, everyday activities, and leisure activities. Five independent variables were used: frequency of library use, number of services used, gender, age, and education level. Respondent country was also entered into analyses. Descriptive statistics and analysis of covariance results were presented.\r\n\r\nMain Results – It was noted that each country's sample was skewed in some way towards one or more of the variables of gender, age, and education, and some statistical corrections were employed. While patterns within countries are similar, library users from Finland, the United States of America, and South Korea reported higher levels of benefits overall. \"Fun in reading\" and \"self-education\" were the two outcomes with the highest scores by respondents. Higher numbers of visits and greater use of services may account for the higher perceived benefits in the three countries reporting them. In fact, these two factors appear to explain a substantial portion of the variance in perceptions of benefits between countries, meaning that between-country variation in library resources and supply plays a role in perception of benefit. There were varied rather than linear patterns of benefit reporting along age and education continua, with those at the lowest education levels deriving the most perceived benefits in all spheres. By gender, women derived fewer perceived benefits in the work sphere than men.\r\n\r\nConclusions – There is variation across countries in the level of public library benefits reported, as well as variation across individual measures, creating different profiles of response by country. Even when respondent demographic characteristics and library usage are controlled for, country differences remain. These may be explained by the differences in investment in – and hence supply of – libraries by country, types of investment (e.g., according to the authors, Finland invests in services, Norway in collections, and the USA in staffing), and cultural factors such as the propensity of USA respondents to have a more extreme response style. Future research may profitably concentrate on policy contexts of libraries in each country. In the nineteenth century libraries provided social welfare services and in the twentieth they provided human rights through equitable access to information, so research should focus, by country, on what libraries will provide in the twenty-first century. Future studies might also address how differences in demographic patterns among respondents play out in benefit perceptions between countries.</jats:p>"

Moreover there is a growing strand of literature establishing a causal link between inflation and conflict. Particularly for agricultural households, the effects of inflation are usually felt through the increase in food prices with implications for consumption and food security. These findings indicate the important macro and social implications of inflation. By focusing on the importance of agricultural supply shocks, the paper contributes to a better understanding of the drivers of inflation and how the macro and social effects can be addressed.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The major contribution of this paper is to try and model an equilibrium relationship in the domestic agricultural sector rather than using proxies such as an output gap measure or rainfall.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

The significant growth in production (1.39%) and productivity (1.04%) of bengalgram in the entire period except area (0.35%) was observed. However, growth in greengram production (1.14%) and productivity (1.21%) was found almost similar. In case of blackgram, positive growth rate in area, productivity and production in both the periods have ultimately resulted higher growth rates in the overall period.

We use the nucleolus concept. The framework is illustrated through a numerical example based on the Beer Game scenario.Findings: The nucleolus offers a powerful perspective to tackle this problem, as it takes into consideration the bargaining power of the different echelons. We show that this framework outperforms classical alternatives.Research limitations/implications: The allocation of the overall supply chain profit is analyzed from a static perspective. Considering the dynamic nature of the problem would be an interesting next step. Practical implications: We provide evidence of drawbacks derived from classical solutions to the profit allocation problem. Real-world collaborative supply chains need of robust mechanisms like the one tackled in this work to align incentives from the various actors.Originality/value: Adopting an efficient collaborative solution is a major challenge for supply chains, since it is a wide and complex process that requires an appropriate scheme. Within this framework, profit allocation is essential.</jats:p>"

The objective was to enable a long-term, sustainable and greatly increased use of forest fuel by supporting the development of a more efficient production system. The financial framework of ESS was SEK 130 million (approximately CA $ 19.5 million) over eight years, and the program supported approximately 150 research and development projects. Skogforsk administered the program, and was responsible for coordination and disseminating information to the stakeholders. A program board made formal decisions, and a fuel technology collaboration group helped to identify R&amp;D areas. A project pilot was linked to each project to ensure that the focus was on sector needs and interests, and to help the project manager with relevant study objects, networks and updated information. In and around the program, valuable expertise and networks were built up in each sector and in research organisations, both nationally and internationally. Great emphasis was placed on practical demonstration, implementation and communication, in order to disseminate knowledge about new technology and methods and to influence attitudes toward forest fuel harvest. The forestry sector and its contractors gradually strengthened the supply system through improved skills, better organisation, and advanced equipment. The goals were largely attained, and practical aspects relating to forest fuel were implemented, incorporating many of the results. </jats:p>",

The objective is to determine the most important skill requirements for construction managers. A  structured  questionnaire  was  administered  to  construction  professionals  who  worked  recently  with  construction  managers  in  their  recently  completed  projects.  Snowballing  sampling  technique  was  used  to  select  seventy  (70)  respondents,  however  only  forty  (40)  responses were used for the data analysis. The results indicate that essential skills required by the   construction   managers   for   their   jobs   include:   procedural-industrial   skills,   quality   assurance/management, listening skills, knowledge of codes and regulations, sustainable skills and ability to learn skills. These skills are important for the construction manager to practice effectively  in  Nigeria  and  other  developing  countries.  These  findings  have  seven  practical  implications to professional bodies, Universities and other trainers of construction managers, whose   present   curricula   may   be   deficient   in   knowledge areas   in   industry   (business, managerial, personal and technical). These institutions may need to re-orientate and improve the curricula for newly trained construction managers to cope with current skill requirements. On the other hand, recruiting agencies should ensure that job applicants with the right hard and  soft  skills  are  engaged  as  construction  managers.  Consequently  efficient  and  effective  management of future construction projects in Nigeria and other developing countries can be ensured.</jats:p>"

In this paper we analyze Jackson networks with the additional features that (i) nodes may have an infinite supply of low priority work and (ii) nodes may be unstable in the sense that the queue length at these nodes grows beyond any bound. We provide the limiting distribution of the queue length distribution at stable nodes, which turns out to be of product form. A key step in establishing this result is the development of a new algorithm based on adjusted traffic equations for detecting unstable nodes. Our results complement the results known in the literature for the subcases of Jackson networks with either infinite supply nodes or unstable nodes by providing an analysis of the significantly more challenging case of networks with both types of nonstandard node present. Building on our product-form results, we provide closed-form solutions for common customer and system oriented performance measures.\n</jats:p>",

To meet environmental regulations on the emission of coal combustion, it must carefully mix several fuels of different qualities to make safe, environmentally friendly, and affordable blends that are generator specific. We worked with the management and engineering teams at TECO to develop a decision support platform, which centers around a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model to comprehensively capture system specifications, requirements, and operations in all key aspects of TECO’s fuel supply chain. This platform enables TECO to make optimal procurement, transportation, blending, and burn decisions and satisfy all environmental regulations. We estimate that the implementation of this model can provide TECO with annual fuel-cost savings of 2–3 percent, which translate to millions of dollars of savings in total fuel costs. </jats:p>",

Therefore, beside evaluation of enterprise’s capabilities to manage business processes, it is important to assess capabilities for business process management at supply chain level. The purpose of the research presented in this paper is to point out the necessity of supply chain management maturity in implementation of best practice. Research methodology is based on supply chain management maturity models. Application of the Delphi method enabled usage of maturity model, adapted to the enterprises in Serbia. The value of the research precedes from unique combination of best practice elements for the assessment of supply chain management maturity level. The research results show that best practice elements are not very popular in the enterprises in Serbia. All enterprises are at the second and third maturity level. Bearing in mind that everything has to be improved continually, maturity models, proposed by different authors can be further developed by including certain statistical tools. The original contribution of this paper and its practical implication refer to including statistical tools, hierarchical cluster analysis and correlation, into maturity analysis, thus enabling creation of framework as a road-map for the improvement of supply chain management maturity.</jats:p>",

Malaysia, a country of over 31 million people, is made up of a multi‐ethnic, multireligious and multicultural population. The diverse donation landscape presents unique challenges to the blood supply. These challenges become more pronounced during festive holidays, which are observed and celebrated differently across the diverse population. The <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NBTS</jats:styled-content> relies on the goodwill and the generosity of the community to maintain the blood supply. A sustainable, nationally co‐ordinated blood donation programme, coupled with an effective and efficient national blood inventory management, ensures that the blood supply is adequate, equitable and capable of meeting the transfusion needs of the country. Concerted effort must be implemented to continuously promote the recruitment and retention of donors and blood mobile organizers while actively engaging the diverse communities. These activities, in the context of a pluralistic and diverse population, can be further enhanced from a better understanding of the donor psychology and behaviour and of the transfusion needs. Fostering close and meaningful relationships with blood donors through blood mobile organizers, as well as the continuous education and promotion of blood donation, serve as the framework for the strategies to overcome the blood supply challenges.</jats:p>",

These newly introduced expressions are tested and demonstrated to determine surface water yield of Tapah River in Sarawak. Aydin and Gharahjeh's formula is found to perform similarly to the improved discharge coefficient developed by French in 1986, but is simpler and easier to use. Exploring Aydin and Gharahjeh's formula through theoretical, experimental, and field approaches, it has been found that the formula performs well in a controlled environment. Discharge computations based on field data were determined to have been formerly underestimated, with the reason as yet undetermined.</jats:p>",

In 2012, there were three irrigation methods: alternate furrow irrigation (AI), fixed furrow irrigation (FI) and conventional furrow irrigation (CI). Three N supply methods: alternate N supply (AN), fixed N supply (FN) and conventional N supply (CN), were applied at each irrigation method. In 2014, the fixed treatments were excluded. Soil NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N in horizontal direction was measured to 100 cm soil profile. For 2012, at filling stage, compared to CI, AI increased soil NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N concentration under the plant by 4.5 to 7.4% in 0-40 cm soil profile and decreased that by 9.9 to 14.4% in 40-80 cm for three N supply methods. NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N concentration between two sides of the ridge was comparable for AN and CN coupled with AI or CI. When compared to CI, AI reduced soil NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N concentration in 60-100 cm by 4.8 to 8.7% from 12 collars stage to maturity over different positions when coupled with CN. Soil residual NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N at maturityin 0-100 cm was the lowest in AI coupled with CN or AN. The 2014 experiment verified the above results. Therefore, alternate furrow irrigation coupled with conventional or alternate N supply brought an optimum spatial distribution of soil NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N during maize season, resulting in little soil residual NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N at maturity.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

A hierarchical approach is developed to present the monitoring locations within a format that satisfies the objectives of social stakeholders for making final decisions. First, a CE-QUAL-W2 model is applied to simulate water quality variables in the reservoir for a long time using a set of historic data. Second, transinformation entropy theory is used to quantify mutual information among a set of monitoring stations for each water quality variable. Then, a non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm-based model is developed for multi-objective optimization of the water quality monitoring network. Finally, a social choice method is applied to the identified non-dominated solutions to achieve a strategy that is compromised among stakeholders. The variations of the water quality variables at different depths and different seasons are investigated. The proposed approach is illustrated for Karkheh Reservoir in Iran. The number of optimized monitoring stations is the same for all seasons (three out of 22 potential stations) using different social choice methods. The results show the appropriate performance of the proposed methodology for optimization of reservoir water quality monitoring stations.</jats:p>",

Differences found in light emission of an arc tube plasma channel under different power supply methods are presented and discussed in this work. The novelty of the paper lies in systematical investigation of different power converter supply methods and demonstrating that it has a significant influence on plasma temperature in an arc tube. The tested lamp was powered by electronic ballasts controlled by different algorithms, which forced their current waveform. To compare the results, the authors performed measurements on a discharge lamp powered by a standard electromagnetic ballast. The investigation of plasma parameters is based on the optical spectroscopy method. It was shown that by using the appropriate current shape of a high switching frequency supply converter, the plasma temperature of an HID lamp can be reduced almost by half.</jats:p>",

This case holds especially for solar technology that has reached price levels that were unimaginable until a short time ago. It also holds for battery technologies the application of which is related to the increasing usage of photovoltaic energy converters and the growing interest in electric vehicles. With the decreasing prices more and more possible application cases of renewable energy technologies become economically viable. A case study was done for a location on a small island located on the west tip of Java. The levelized electricity cost of a hybrid electricity supply system composed of a solar generator and battery in combination with the existing diesel generators was compared to the electricity generation cost of the existing system. Two different battery options were taken into account, lead-acid batteries and lithium-ion batteries. The results of this study can give a rough orientation also for other locations with similar characteristics.</jats:p>"

Future sustainability constraints are emphasizing that Food Supply and Distribution Systems (FSDS) are deeply embedded in city-region systems with specific technical and socio-ecological characteristics. This paper aims to provide a systemic understanding on FSDS focusing the integration of urban and rural structures considering the system biophysical boundaries and societal targets. A qualitative framework model, based on the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)’s FSDS literature, has been developed by using Systems Thinking (ST) and System Dynamics (SD) approaches. The model analysis suggested that to increase sustainability and resilience of food systems large emphasis has to be maintained on: (i) estimation of local territorial carrying capacities; (ii) land use planning to enhance connections among rural supplies and city needs; (iii) city policies, to regulate emergent market size and local scale of production; (iv) technological efficiency at farm, distribution and market levels; (v) urban, peri-urban and rural functional linkages that considers social metabolic balances; (vi) rural development as a core point for building sustainable food systems and counteracting the urbanization growth. These key areas are relevant to test new paths of cities-regions reconfiguration towards the transition to resilient agri-food systems.</jats:p>"

The scorecard covers four aspects and has 22 measurement items. An extensive survey has been conducted in Chinese companies and 206 filled questionnaires have been collected. The researcher have compared the performance difference of logistics and supply chain in state—owned companies, foreign—owned companies and private companies. The results showed that the scorecard had the good reliability and effectiveness to become an effective tool to evaluate green supply chain performance in companies. Furthermore, the results showed that there is no direct relation between planning and executive ability, and applied ability of information technology, so the acting relation between them is deleted and the confirmatory factory analysis between them shows a strong relationship. The applied ability of information technology has a very significant influence on logistics efficiency. However, the influences of planning and executive ability on logistics efficiency are significantly strong, while “planning and executive ability” and “applied ability of information technology” are closely-related to firm strategies and organizational coordination ability. In addition, it is also crucial to build cooperative relationship between suppliers and customers and gives effective training for employees.

Para tanto, analisam-se, por meio de modelos de regressão para dados em painel, as informações financeiras não consolidadas de 1995 a 2014, coletadas na Economática® e atualizadas pelo índice IPCA/IBGE. Os resultados divergem das ideias dos autores trazidos em discussão, à medida que as variáveis explicativas não se apresentam estatisticamente significantes, ao considerar os níveis usuais de intervalo de confiança. Assim, não é possível inferir que houve impacto na eficiência produtiva das empresas, com aumento ou diminuição da proporção do custo em relação às receitas de venda. Dessa forma, e ao considerar que esse efeito pode ser compensado por outros fatores, busca-se analisar isoladamente os custos e as receitas. Os resultados demonstram que todas as variáveis explicativas não são estatisticamente significativas para as análises de receitas, mas, para as análises de custos, tem-se que, quanto maior o nível de adesão às práticas de GSCM, maiores são os custos dos produtos vendidos.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the future, with the advent of the smart factory era, manufacturing and logistics processes will become more complex, and the complexity and criticality of traceability will further increase. This research aims at developing a performance assessment method to verify scalability when implementing traceability systems based on key technologies for smart factories, such as Internet of Things (IoT) and BigData. To this end, based on existing research, we analyzed traceability requirements and an event schema for storing traceability data in MongoDB, a document-based Not Only SQL (NoSQL) database. Next, we analyzed the algorithm of the most representative traceability query and defined a query-level performance model, which is composed of response times for the components of the traceability query algorithm. Next, this performance model was solidified as a linear regression model because the response times increase linearly by a benchmark test. Finally, for a case analysis, we applied the performance model to a virtual automobile parts logistics. As a result of the case study, we verified the scalability of a MongoDB-based traceability system and predicted the point when data node servers should be expanded in this case. The traceability system performance assessment method proposed in this research can be used as a decision-making tool for hardware capacity planning during the initial stage of construction of traceability systems and during their operational phase.</jats:p>"

Supply chain is a cross-functional approach to plan the flow of goods and services required by a project, based on its front end loading (FEL) specifications, in order to meet business objectives with a successful execution and total satisfaction of the final customers.

Various data collection tools such as questionnaire survey, field observation and key informant interviews were used along with water quality analysis at the source, treatment plants, point of delivery and use. The filter bed media analysis was also carried out to assess the uniformity in the bed media. Mcrobial contamination in treated water was found due to improper sand granular used in filtration unit that hinder efficient removal of the microbes, lack of chlorination in the unit caused increase in microbial contamination at the point of delivery along with the unhygienic environment at the distribution tanks. Manual chlorine addition for three days was found to be effective in reducing microbial contamination drastically, but the water is recontaminated once delivered and stored at the household level. Improper handling and unhygienic storage location were found to be the major causes of increased contamination at households. The status of the water source is not safe either and seeks intermediate attention. The operation and management of Pasthali Water Supply System solely depends on water tariff and bears financial loss annually. The study also concludes that there is surplus of treated water termed as non-revenue water in the system. Proper granulation of the sand in the filtration unit and chlorination are must to ensure the safe water along with the awareness on the water management at the household levels. Supplying of non-revenue water to the nearby villages could be a potential to generate resources that ultimately strengthen financial aspects of the system and build resilience to financially break-down in the future.</jats:p>"

The disclosure mechanism is designed when the information of the disrupted demand is asymmetric between supply side and retail side. We first study the model with the full information as a benchmark to explore the effect of asymmetric information on the system. In the case, each manufacturer maximizes her profit while the downstream retailer only obtains the reservation profit. For the case of asymmetric information, each manufacturer can obtain the real information of the disrupted demand by using a menu of contract bundles. For each information structure, there are always robust regions for each manufacturer’s original trading quantity scheme. That is, when the disrupted amount of the demand is sufficiently small, the trading quantity will be unchanged. However, some special measures, e.g., the higher unit wholesale price, should be taken to prevent the retailer from deviating the trading quantity scheme. The high-disruption retailer gets the higher profit due to the information rent. Compared with a single supply chain, Cournot competition results in the less retail price and the lower performance for the whole system. </jats:p>",

Although, in recent decades, many changes have occurred in the construction industry, there are still many problems in this area. Therefore, research in this area becomes vital because collaboration is one of the best approaches to improve CSC performance. In this study, collaborative relationship has been found to be affected by three main factors: managerial, financial and structural. However, application of collaboration in Iran is still in its inception. This comprehensive research study focuses on suitable context for implementing the collaboration method. The methodology of this research is based on interviews and a review of previous research, which identifies critical factors and positive results of use in relation to collaboration. Results of this study improve our knowledge about the role of collaboration in a CSC's performance. Analysis of data shows that managerial factors have the most positive effects on the implementation of collaboration networks in CSCs, followed by financial factors and organizational factors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper we present a method to determine the power efficiency of ultraviolet (UV) disinfection plants and apply this to low pressure plants for drinking water. In UV disinfection plants the water flow is regulated to ensure that microorganisms receive the necessary fluence for inactivation while passing through. The flow depends on the UV transmission (UVT) of the water. The lower the UVT of the water is, the less water may flow through the plant. UV irradiance is produced by lamps that consume, together with other components, electrical power and entail running costs. The power efficiency – electrical power versus disinfected volume – of a plant has therefore an important impact. Applying this method to different UV plants that are on the market shows that electric power of at least 5.3 Wh is necessary to disinfect 1 m3 of water possessing a UVT of 80% (100 mm), 8 Wh at 50% and 22 Wh at 10%. Further we found that ineffective design or a wrong selection of a plant may enhance these values by a factor of up to 7. This method enables not only the calculation of the power efficiency but also the decision for a certain plant type.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Force lubrication systems are widely used in engines and transmission units of agricultural machinery; the oil in them is supplied to consumers by the action of oil pumps, thus reducing the nonproductive friction losses and providing the necessary thermal conditions for parts. For calculation of lubrication systems when carrying out the design and further development works, mathematical models are used, representing the complex systems consisting of large number of nonlinear equations. Such systems require the development of special solution methods. A solution method of system of linear and nonlinear equations describing the oil movement through the channels of force lubrication systems should provide the simplicity, unambiguity and high accuracy of calculations. The analysis of mutual influence of the calculated quantities is performed. The three main dependencies are pointed out: the coefficient of friction losses for each of the supply line sections is a function of the volumetric flow rate of oil; the oil density is a function of the pressure in input-output section of the supply line; the pressure by the action of centrifugal forces is a function of the oil density at the input of rotating section. Based on the performed analysis, a solution method for mathematical model of force lubrication system satisfying the suggested requirements is developed. To validate the method, the system of planetary transmission lubrication is calculated; the total volumetric flow rate of oil in the process of its operation under various modes is measured. The obtained results show the good match of calculated and measured values of the volumetric flow rate of oil, which confirms the accuracy of the proposed solution method for system of equations and the possibility of its use for calculation of lubrication systems.</jats:p>"

Pangasius was mainly produced and supplied from state of Andhra Pradesh to several states in India. The major share of Pangasius traded to West Bengal (73.29%) and Maharashtra (16.4%) and hence the study was restricted to these two states. The three marketing channels were identified (A, B and C) and the major volume was transacted through the channel (B). The stakeholders identified in marketing were farmers, broker, transporters, packers, ice providers, wholesalers, secondary wholesalers and retailers. Exchange of information among actors, was mainly focused on quality, quantity, prices, time of delivery and arrangements with supporting intermediaries. The every intermediary added a cost and moved it further to respective stakeholder after earning some returns. In channel (B), the profit of wholesalers and retailers was Rs. 3.08 and Rs. 6.85 per Kg, respectively whereas in channel (C), primary wholesaler, secondary wholesaler and retailer realised profit in rupees per kg of Rs. 2.31, Rs. 4.5 and Rs. 8.15, respectively. Channel (A) had shown direct sell to consumers. Price spread reflects Channel (B) (Rs. 31.2/Kg) was efficient than (C) (Rs. 34.95/Kg). Farmers opined that negligible local demand compelled farmers to sell Pangasius in distant market. Promotion of Pangasius consumption in home state and nearby states will go a long way in improving local demand and to ensure better prices. This may realise sustainable development of Pangasius in India.</jats:p>",

In the first scenario, retailers transship when out of stock, whereas in the second scenario, they do not. If they do not transship, some customers may perform the search on their own. In each scenario, the wholesale prices are either exogenous, or chosen endogenously by the supplier. For both cases, we determine the supplier's and the retailers’ optimal decisions. The key research question we ask and answer is the following: which of the two scenarios is preferred by either player when all decisions are made optimally? We show that when fewer customers are willing to search on their own and wholesale prices are exogenous, both the supplier and the retailers prefer to transship. In addition, the decision maker in a centralized chain will have the exact same preference as that of players in a decentralized setting when the retailers’ and the supplier's preferences coincide and wholesale prices are exogenous. This preference concordance does not hold if wholesale prices are endogenous. </jats:p>",

Experiments were carried out with two varieties of cape gooseberry – Plovdiv and Obrazec 1. The plants were grown by three different technologies – by pricking out seedlings, not pricking out seedlings and direct outdoor sowing, with three different sowing periods with interval of each being 15 days. The whole period of obtaining the production from each variant was investigated. In additional experiments, there were established the possibilities for storage of the fruit and also the period of supplying the market as well as additional post harvest ripening. The obtaining of the production from direct harvests starts from plants grown with pricking seedlings in the second decade of August to mid – October, those with no pricking seedlings from the first ten days of September to late October and with direct seeding from the beginning to the end of October. Plovdiv variety is characterized by rather high ripe. By storage, depending on the type of farming, the production comes from mid – September to early January, and in some periods coincides with fruits from additional ripening.</jats:p>",

Although there is considerable research on the effects of water supply on crop growth and productivity, there is little published research on the comparative response of crops and weeds to limiting soil water supply. The objective of this research was to determine the growth and transpiration efficiency of corn and velvetleaf at three levels of water supply. One corn or velvetleaf plant was grown in a large pot lined with plastic bags. When seedlings reached 10 cm, bags were sealed around the base of the plant, so the only water loss was from transpiration. Daily transpiration was measured by weighing the pots at the same time each day. The experiment was conducted in the fall of 2007 and in the spring of 2008. Four replicates of each species–water treatment were harvested periodically to determine biomass accumulation and leaf area. The relationship between cumulative aboveground biomass and water transpired was described using a linear function in which the slope defined the transpiration efficiency (TE). Corn TE was greater than velvetleaf TE in all treatments during both trials. In the fall trial, corn TE was 6.3 g kg<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>, 47% greater than that of velvetleaf TE. In the spring trial, TEs of both species were lower overall, and corn TE increased with declining water supply. Corn produced more biomass and leaf area than velvetleaf did at all water-supply levels. Velvetleaf partitioned more biomass to roots compared with shoots during early growth than corn did. The ability of corn to generate more leaf area and its investment in a greater proportion of biomass into root growth at all levels of water supply may enable it to more-effectively avoid velvetleaf interference under all levels of soil-water supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Delivery time differentiation is a supply chain concept that has been implemented in various industries, but not yet in the automotive industry. One reason is that the effects of delivery time differentiation on the supply chain are not well understood. The BMW Group, for instance, has considered offering an express order option, where express orders bypass standard orders in the supply chain processes to achieve short delivery times. Express orders distort planning processes, increase operations cost, and increase the delivery times of standard orders, however the effects have not been quantified yet. This study analyzes the impact of express orders on the supply chain, when express orders are built‐to‐order. To understand the supply chain consequences of express orders better, we analyzed the relevant supply chain processes at BMW Group. We determine the effect that built‐to‐order express orders have on delivery times and on component demand. To analyze the effect of introducing express orders on expected delivery times and expected cost, we use queuing theory and derive expressions for the transient behavior of a discrete time batch queue. Our analyses indicate that many supply chain processes are only marginally affected. However, the orders to the suppliers become considerably more uncertain, which must be compensated by additional safety stock. Our results indicate that express orders can be an attractive option for BMW and other automotive companies. If the fraction of express orders stays at a reasonable level, express orders can be delivered within about two weeks. </jats:p>",

We also derive the necessary condition for the most effective subsidy policy that maximizes expected social welfare and profits. Our analysis derives the following findings: (i) under the first subsidy policy, the government tends to provide high subsidy rate to a manufacturer with low marginal profit; (ii) under the second subsidy policy, the government tends to offer low subsidy to a manufacturer with low marginal profit; and (iii) a government’s selection of subsidy policy depends on the sensitivity of consumers to price.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The atmospheric cycle of phosphorus (P) is parameterized here in a state-of-the-art global 3-D chemistry transport model, taking into account primary emissions of total P (TP) and soluble P (DP) associated with mineral dust, combustion particles from natural and anthropogenic sources, bioaerosols, sea spray and volcanic aerosols. For the present day, global TP emissions are calculated to be roughly 1.33 Tg-P yr−1, with the mineral sources contributing more than 80 % to these emissions. The P solubilization from mineral dust under acidic atmospheric conditions is also parameterized in the model and is calculated to contribute about one-third (0.14 Tg-P yr−1) of the global DP atmospheric source. To our knowledge, a unique aspect of our global study is the explicit modeling of the evolution of phosphorus speciation in the atmosphere. The simulated present-day global annual DP deposition flux is 0.45 Tg-P yr−1 (about 40 % over oceans), showing a strong spatial and temporal variability. Present-day simulations of atmospheric P aerosol concentrations and deposition fluxes are satisfactory compared with available observations, indicating however an underestimate of about 70 % on current knowledge of the sources that drive the P atmospheric cycle. Sensitivity simulations using preindustrial (year 1850) anthropogenic and biomass burning emission scenarios showed a present-day increase of 75 % in the P solubilization flux from mineral dust, i.e., the rate at which P is converted into soluble forms, compared to preindustrial times, due to increasing atmospheric acidity over the last 150 years. Future reductions in air pollutants due to the implementation of air-quality regulations are expected to decrease the P solubilization flux from mineral dust by about 30 % in the year 2100 compared to the present day. Considering, however, that all the P contained in bioaerosols is readily available for uptake by marine organisms, and also accounting for all other DP sources, a total bioavailable P flux of about 0.17 Tg-P yr−1 to the oceans is derived. Our calculations further show that in some regions more than half of the bioavailable P deposition flux to the ocean can originate from biological particles, while this contribution is found to maximize in summer when atmospheric deposition impact on the marine ecosystem is the highest due to ocean stratification. Thus, according to this global study, a largely unknown but potentially important role of terrestrial bioaerosols as suppliers of bioavailable P to the global ocean is also revealed. Overall, this work provides new insights to the atmospheric P cycle by demonstrating that biological materials are important carriers of bioavailable P, with very important implications for past and future responses of marine ecosystems to global change.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Illicit drugs are trafficked across manifold borders before ultimately reaching consumers. Consequently, interdiction of cross-border drug trafficking forms a critical component of the European Union’s initiative to reduce drug supplies. However, there is contradictory evidence about its effectiveness, which is due, in part, to a paucity of information about how drugs flow across borders. This study uses a network approach to analyze international drug trafficking both to and within Europe, drawing on several perspectives to delineate the factors that affect how drug shipments move across borders. The analysis explicates how drug trafficking is concentrated along specific routes; moreover, we demonstrate that its structure is not random but, rather, driven by specific factors. In particular, corruption and social and geographical proximity are key factors explaining the configuration of heroin supply to European countries. This study also provides essential insights into the disruption of traffickers’ illicit activities. </jats:p>",

This paper aims at outlining potential synergies between communication promotion and the implementation of a structured approach to enhance water loss and energy management in WU. The use of a structured approach in the decision-making process leverages knowledge production from various stakeholders, enabling them to propose solutions for the challenges faced by the WU. Collaboration is essential to achieve improvements in the long-term by breaking down information silos and boundaries resulting from functional specialism. In the scope of the iPerdas 2014 project, 17 Portuguese WU followed a joint training and capacity-building approach to work strategically with water loss and energy efficiency issues. The benefits of implementing a comprehensive communication framework are presented, highlighting the interconnected nature of barriers to energy and water efficiency and the need to address these barriers in a holistic manner. The paper concludes with the presentation of some lessons learned regarding the promotion of communication in collaborative projects.</jats:p>",

A conclusion is made as to the most appropriate type of spacecraft power supply systems for the use of additional low-power sources of energy. The peculiarities of operation of the proposed power supply system are discussed. A method of producing additional electric energy on board the spacecraft due to its rotation in the Earth's magnetic field is described. Mathematical models of the Earth's magnetic field are analyzed. A model of description of the geomagnetic field using a series of spherical harmonics (number of Gauss) was applied on the basis of the results of the analysis of these models to assess the magnitude of the magnetic induction in spacecraft low orbits. Based on the evaluation of the magnetic induction, the set parameters of the spacecraft and the orbit the average power of electrical energy generated by low-power sources for on-board power consumers in one orbit pass was calculated. A variant of using additional electrical energy on board a spaceship is proposed. The use of the proposed scheme will make it possible to expand the possibilities of spacecraft to receive, transform and accumulate electrical energy from primary low-power sources, which will make the spacecraft service life longer and improve its power supply capacity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>The conventional auxiliary power supply (APS) of a railway vehicle is directly connected to the catenary through the LC filter. Hence, the switching devices of the APS must have a high breakdown voltage to account for catenary voltage fluctuation. On the other hand, low‐voltage switching devices have better characteristics that are desirable for low‐loss and high‐frequency operation. Therefore, a step‐down converter is incorporated between the LC filter and inverter to adapt to catenary voltage fluctuations when using low‐voltage switching devices. This paper proposes the series‐parallel continuously regulated chopper as a novel step‐down converter. First, the fundamental operation characteristics and output voltage control method of the proposed chopper are introduced. The simulation and experimental results for the fundamental characteristics are then described; the simulation and experimental values were almost the same as the theoretical values. The proposed chopper controls the output voltage at the expected value without dramatic fluctuation regardless of the input voltage fluctuation. In addition, a resonance damping control for a constant power load is proposed. The operational characteristics were considered under different potential distributions or load conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last years, there has been a great interest in the complex interactions between energy and water, known as the Water-Energy Nexus.1 Free and unrestricted availability and access to energy and water enables the growth of an economy and supports the quality of life. The Water-Energy Nexus is considered as one of the most important multidisciplinary challenges2 that the water market globally growing has to face in the forthcoming years. Currently, many water systems are not managed in terms of long term sustainability. Water Utilities (WU) are faced to further challenges, such as aging of their infrastructure and poor cost-recovery, leading to a lack of finance for operation and maintenance (O&amp;M). Energy is required in all stages of water production and distribution, from abstraction over treatment to transportation. Energy costs are a top-of-mind concern for WU, regardless of the geography, size and level of water network efficiency.3 On the other hand, in developing countries WU are having a hard time to either improve their services or expand their network to unserved neighbourhoods. Regarding all this facts, and considering an economic and competitive scenario which forces to respond to pressures from various fields (market, technology, society...), lead to the need to implement new methods and processes that can meet these growing demands and to try to manage responses and actions in real time. Intelligent software solutions can be applied to networks, whether they have either smart metering and large amounts of data or less recorded data. They enhance the operators’ knowledge of this data, turn it into useful information for decision-making related to the operation, maintenance and the design of the water supply network. In this paper, an application of an intelligent software solution is presented. WatEner, a smart Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solution that combines the key factors of energy consumption with further operational requirements of drinking water supply to improve the management of water supply networks, has been tested with good results by the WU of the city of Karlsruhe, a water rich area in North-West - Europe where the main objective was to save energy in the drinking water distribution. As a conclusion, a non-structural solution for the water-energy nexus can have a great impact on several matters (e.g. climate change, carbon footprint, WUs balance sheets, water losses) with reasonable investment in only a few sensors in the water supply network.</jats:p>",

However, B-lineage leukemia clones often carry secondary genetic lesions that result in reduced activity or inactivation of these transcription factors. Studying patient samples from clinical trials for B-lineage childhood (P9906; n=187) and adult (MDACC; n=92) leukemia, we found that genetic defects in one or more B-cell transcription factors represent near-obligate lesions in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (209 of 279 B-lineage ALL cases). While previously of unknown significance, we found that adult ALL cases with known lesions in one or more of these transcription factors had higher activity of lactate dehydrogenase, and phospho-states indicated higher activity of IRS1, PDK1, and AKT, which contribute to glucose uptake. For this reason, we investigated whether B-cell transcription factors set metabolic constraints of oncogenic signaling in leukemia.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: Reconstitution of wildtype PAX5 and IKZF1 in patient-derived B-lineage ALL cells carrying PAX5 and IKZF1deletions decreased phospho-AKT levels. Furthermore, protein levels of multiple positive regulators involved in glucose uptake and metabolism (including insulin receptor, glucose transporters and hexokinases) were downregulated upon reconstitution of PAX5 and IKZF1. Conversely, protein levels of negative regulators of glucose uptake and metabolism including NR3C1 and TXNIP were upregulated upon reinstatement of PAX5 and IKZF1 function. Analysis of ChIPseq data of human B cells revealed binding of multiple B-cell transcription factors including PAX5, IKZF1 and EBF1 to promoter regions of genes encoding positive regulators of glucose uptake and metabolism. Binding peaks for B-cell transcription factors were also observed at genes that encode negative regulators of glucose uptake and metabolism (NR3C1 and TXNIP). In addition, direct recruitment of PAX5 was confirmed by single-locus quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Reconstitution of wildtype PAX5 and IKZF1 in patient-derived B-lineage ALL cells caused depletion from the cell culture in competitive growth assays, in parallel with reduced glucose consumption and depletion of cellular ATP levels. On the contrary, overexpression of dominant-negative PAX5-ETV6 and IK6 in patient-derived B-lineage ALL cells expressing wildtype PAX5 and IKZF1 resulted in a net survival advantage, concomitant with increases in both glycolytic activity and cellular ATP levels. PAX5-mediated impaired survival fitness was significantly rescued by CRISPR-based activation of gene expression of insulin receptor, glucose transporter and hexokinases in patient-derived B-lineage ALL cells. Conversely, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of NR3C1 and TXNIP largely reversed the effects of PAX5. Finally, reduced survival fitness upon reconstitution of wild-type PAX5 and IKZF1 in patient-derived pre-B ALL cells was mostly rescued by metabolites that can enter the TCA cycle and thus provide ATP.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions: In summary,B-cell-specific restriction of glycolytic energy supply represents a previously unrecognized metabolic barrier against malignant transformation. Our findings suggest a causative link between impaired glucose uptake and metabolism caused by B-cell transcription factors as well as cell death, and the known tumor suppressive function of PAX5 and IKZF1 in B-lineage ALL.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Bullwhip effect (BWE), which refers to the phenomenon wherein the variance in demand orders increases as one moves up the supply chain (SC), has been a source of concern for most of the SC managers as it has serious implications in the SC. Problems can vary from inefficient ordering and inventory policies (IP) to higher total cost of SC with extreme cases of stock-out and disruptions in the SC. The literature on this topic suggests various factors which cause BWE and these have further been divided into two broad groups, namely, “operational causes” and “behavioural causes.” This study focuses on the operational factors identified through the survey of literature from 1990 to 2013 and suggests 18 factors which contribute to the BWE. Further, from an analysis of literature, based on a number of articles and their citations, and responses from field experts through a questionnaire, a refined list of seven factors has been taken up for the study. These factors have been ranked using the “analytical hierarchy process” (AHP). The ranking is based on pairwise comparisons based on the perception of the SC managers in the manufacturing sector in north India. </jats:p><jats:p> The article is divided into five sections. The first section deals with the introduction and identification of the BWE. The second section identifies the various factors which cause this effect under the two broad categories, namely, the operational and behavioural factors. The third section discusses AHP and the methodology used in the article to rank the operational factors. The fourth section presents the results in a tabular and graphical form. Order batching (OB) is found to be the biggest contributor of BWE in manufacturing sector in the aforementioned region followed by demand signal processing (DSP), lead time (LT), IP, price fluctuation (PF), lack of trust (LOT), and number of echelons (NOE). The fifth and final section undertakes a discussion and presents guidelines for future research. </jats:p>",

Its treatment and control are threatened by increasing numbers of multidrug-resistant (MDR) or nearly untreatable extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. New concepts are therefore urgently needed to understand the factors driving the TB epidemics and the spread of different strain populations, especially in association with drug resistance. Classical genotyping and, more recently, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that the world population of tubercle bacilli is more diverse than previously thought. Several major phylogenetic lineages can be distinguished, which are associated with their sympatric host population. Distinct clonal (sub)populations can even coexist within infected patients. WGS is now used as the ultimate approach for differentiating clinical isolates and for linking phenotypic to genomic variation from lineage to strain levels. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the genetic diversity of TB strains translates into pathobiological consequences, and key molecular mechanisms probably involved in differential pathoadaptation of some main lineages have recently been identified. Evidence also accumulates on molecular mechanisms putatively fostering the emergence and rapid expansion of particular MDR and XDR strain groups in some world regions. However, further integrative studies will be needed for complete elucidation of the mechanisms that allow the pathogen to infect its host, acquire multidrug resistance, and transmit so efficiently. Such knowledge will be key for the development of the most effective new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccination strategies.</jats:p>",

An innovative global health discussion platform allows capturing insights from the global health community on factors driving demand and supply for diagnostics. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of the online discussion ‘Advancing Care Delivery: Driving Demand and Supply of Diagnostics’ organised by the Global Health Delivery Project (GHD) (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http://www.ghdonline.org/\" ext-link-type=\"uri\">http://www.ghdonline.org/</jats:ext-link>) at Harvard University. The discussion, driven by 12 expert panellists, explored what must be done to develop delivery systems, business models, new technologies, interoperability standards, and governance mechanisms to ensure that patients receive the right diagnostic at the right time. The GHD Online (GHDonline) platform reaches over 19 000 members from 185 countries. Participants (N=99) in the diagnostics discussion included academics, non-governmental organisations, manufacturers, policymakers, and physicians. Data was coded and overarching categories analysed using qualitative data analysis software. Participants considered technical characteristics of diagnostics as smaller barriers to effective use of diagnostics compared with operational and health system challenges, such as logistics, poor fit with user needs, cost, workforce, infrastructure, access, weak regulation and political commitment. Suggested solutions included: health system strengthening with patient-centred delivery; strengthened innovation processes; improved knowledge base; harmonised guidelines and evaluation; supply chain innovations; and mechanisms for ensuring quality and capacity. Engaging and connecting different actors involved with diagnostic development and use is paramount for improving diagnostics. While the discussion participants were not representative of all actors involved, the platform enabled a discussion between globally acknowledged experts and physicians working in different countries.</jats:p>",

Forty cows were fed from −21 through 30 days around parturition in a 2 × 2 factorial design a diet containing MET or CHOL. MET supply led to greater circulating methionine and proportion of methionine in the essential AA pool, total AA, and total sulfur-containing compounds. Lysine in total AA also was greater in these cows, indicating a better overall AA profile. Sulfur-containing compounds (cystathionine, cystine, homocystine, and taurine) were greater in MET-fed cows, indicating an enriched sulfur-containing compound pool due to enhanced transsulfuration activity. Circulating essential AA and total AA concentrations were greater in cows supplied MET due to greater lysine, arginine, tryptophan, threonine, proline, asparagine, alanine, and citrulline. In contrast, CHOL supply had no effect on essential AA or total AA, and only tryptophan and cystine were greater. Plasma 3-methylhistidine concentration was lower in response to CHOL supply, suggesting less tissue protein mobilization in these cows. Overall, the data revealed that enhanced periparturient supply of MET has positive effects on plasma AA profiles and overall antioxidant status.</jats:p>"

This paper described an MIS adapted to business optimization problems. These problems can usually be solved in less than an hour as they show a linear structure. However, this delay is unacceptable for iterative and interactive decision-making contexts where users need to provide their input. Therefore, we propose a system providing the decision-makers with a convex hull of optimal solutions that minimize/maximize the variables of interest. The users can interactively modify the value of a variable and the system is able to recompute a new optimal solution in a few milliseconds. Four real-time reoptimization methods are described and evaluated. We also propose an improvement to this basic scheme in order to allow a user to explore near-optimal solutions as well. Examples showing real case of how we have exploited this framework within interactive decision support software are given.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Highlights A Mixed Initiative System adapted to business optimization problems is presented.

This methodology is based on classical linear tools and consists on the synthesis of the inverter output impedance according to standard specifications. This synthesis is performed using a multi‐loop control strategy composed of an inner current control loop using a proportional controller, and an outer voltage control loop using the multiple resonant controller. A prototype was built to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the theoretical proposal. A significant reduction of the output impedance at determined harmonic frequencies resulted in a low‐voltage total harmonic distortion of the output voltage of about 1.76%, for IEC 62040‐3 reference non‐linear load.</jats:p>",

Five characteristic attributes—reservoir storage water, operation period number, water demand, runoff, and hydrological year—are chosen as the dataset, and these characteristic attributes are applied to build a mapping relation with the optimal operation mode calculated by dynamic programming (DP). A Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) neural network and a classification and regression tree (CART) are chosen as data mining algorithms to build the LM neural network classifier and CART decision tree classifier, respectively. In order to verify the classification effect of the LM and CART, the two classifiers are applied to the operation mode recognition for the Heiquan reservoir, which is located in the Qinghai Province of China. The accuracies of the two classifiers are 73.6% and 86.9% for the training sample, and their accuracies are 65.8% and 83.3%, respectively, for the test sample, which indicates that the classification result of the CART classifier is better than that of the LM neural network classifier. Thus, the CART classifier is chosen to guide the long-series water supply operation. Compared to the operation result with the other operation scheme, the result shows that the water deficit index of the CART is mostly closest to the DP scheme, which indicates that the CART classifier can guide reservoir water supply operation effectively.</jats:p>"

We note that dual channel system comprising a brand-owned direct channel and retail outsourcing channel is quite common in the fashion industry, and in the latter, buy-back contract is popular between brands and retailers. Therefore, we build a stylized dual channel model with price competition and demand uncertainty to characterize the main properties of a fashion supply chain. Our foci are the sustainability analysis and the channel coordination mechanism. We first design a buy-back contract with return cost to coordinate the channel. We then study supply chain sustainability and examine the effect of two key influencing factors, i.e., price competition and demand uncertainty. Interestingly, we find that a fiercer price competition will lead to a more sustainable supply chain. From the perspective of supply chain managers, we conclude that (1) if managers care about environmental sustainability, fierce price competition is not a suggested strategy; (2) if managers care about economic sustainability, fierce price competition is an advantageous strategy. We also find that high demand uncertainty results in a less sustainable supply chain, in both an environmental and economic sustainability sense.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research considers a supply chain financing system consisting of a capital‐constrained retailer, a supplier and a risk‐averse bank. The retailer may be subject to credit limit because of the bank's downside risk control, and hence, credit insurance should be needed to enhance his financing ability. This paper develops a mathematical optimization model by incorporating insurance policy into the well‐known newsvendor financing model. The optimal inventory and insurance decisions under different scenarios, that is, no insurance, insurance with symmetric information and insurance with asymmetric information, are derived. This work also discusses how the retailer's capital level, the bank's risk aversion, and the insurer's loading factor affect the optimal inventory and insurance decisions. The results show that the retailer will use credit insurance if he is sufficiently capital‐constrained or the insurer's risk loading factor is low enough. Moreover, credit insurance can bring Pareto improvement to the supply chain financing system, which verifies the prevalence of credit insurance in practice. Several numerical experiments are presented to examine the sensitivities of key parameters. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Knowing the values of parasitic elements is also important as they decide the possibility of closed-loop instability, besides affecting the other circuit parameters. In this paper, a way to estimate the equivalent series resistance of electrolytic capacitor and the winding resistance of filter inductor is proposed leading to their closed form expressions in terms of system parameters.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Air merupakan salah satu kebutuhan utama yang diperlukan oleh setiap makhluk hidup untuk mempertahankan kelangsungan hidupnya. Begitu juga untuk memenuhi kebutuhan air di Mess Trikora Kobangdikal Surabaya, diperlukan sistem plambing untuk menyediakan debit dan tekanan air bersih yang cukup agar kebutuhan dapat terpenuhi.&#x0D;\nSistem penyediaan air bersih mempunyai tujuan yaitu melayani kebutuhan air ke tempat-tempat yang membutuhkan dengan debit dan tekanan cukup. Air dari PDAM sebelum didistribusikan oleh instalasi plambing terlebih dahulu ditampung di tangki bawah yang selanjutnya dinaikkan ke tangki atas oleh pompa. Setelah itu dari tangki atas akan didistribusikan ke tiap lantai/kamar yang memerlukan. Dalam perencanaan sistem penyediaan air bersih di gedung Mess Trikora Kobangdikal Surabaya ini dimulai dengan menaksir kebutuhan air, menentukan diameter pipa pada instalasi dengan menggunakan persamaan kontinuitas dan energi yang mana kecepatan aliran dalam pipa yang diasumsikan terlebih dahulu. Setelah itu ditentukan perencanaan volume efektif tangki air atas dan bawah yang dapat melayani kebutuhan puncak dengan seluruh peralatan plambing yang beroperasi pada waktu tertentu. Debit aliran air pada saat terjadi kebutuhan puncak tersebut akan digunakan untuk menentukan kapasitas pompa serta melayani volume efektif tangki atas dan bawah yang dapat melayani kebutuhan air tersebut. Perhitungan head instalasi pompa dan volume tangki efektif digunakan sebagai dasar dalam perhitungan pemilihan pompa yang sesuai dengan perencanaan.&#x0D;\nDengan adanya perencanaan ulang sistem plambing di Mess Trikora Kobangdikal Surabaya diharapkan seluruh kebutuhan air bersih bisa terpenuhi, sehingga dapat menunjang kelancaran kegiatan perkuliahan mahasiswa Sekolah Tinggi Teknologi Angkatan Laut.</jats:p>"

Este estudo teve como objetivo analisar as perdas no transporte de soja em duas microrregiões do Piauí, no sentido de verificar se as distancias percorridas impactaram no volume de perda de grãos. Foram coletadas informações de 403 cargas de soja transportadas via rodoviária, durante os meses de Abril e Maio de 2015, de duas fazendas para uma agroindústria de soja. Foram computados o peso de origem e o peso de destino dos caminhões, e a perda foi calculada pela diferença entre o valor da origem e o valor da chegada à central de processamento. Os valores médios foram analisados e aplicou-se a razão de Odds para estabelecer uma relação de causa e efeito com a distância de transporte e a quantidade de perda de grãos. Os resultados indicaram que o trajeto com menor distancia apresentou maior perda de grãos.</jats:p>"

To mobilize enough granulocytes for transfusion, healthy donors are premedicated with granulocyte–colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF) and dexamethasone. Granulocytes have a short circulatory half‐life. Consequently, patients need to receive GTX every other day to keep circulating granulocyte counts at an acceptable level. We investigated whether plasma from premedicated donors was capable of prolonging neutrophil survival and, if so, which factor could be held responsible.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS</jats:title><jats:p>The effects of plasma from G‐CSF/dexamethasone‐treated donors on neutrophil survival were assessed by annexin‐V, CD16. and CXCR4 staining and nuclear morphology. We isolated an albumin‐bound protein using α‐chymotrypsin and albumin‐depletion and further characterized it using protein analysis. The effects of dexamethasone and G‐CSF were assessed using mifepristone and G‐CSF–neutralizing antibody. G‐CSF plasma concentrations were determined by Western blot and Luminex analyses.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title><jats:p>G‐CSF/dexamethasone plasma contained a survival‐promoting factor for at least 2 days. This factor was recognized as an albumin‐associated protein and was identified as G‐CSF itself, which was surprising considering its reported half‐life of only 4.5 hours. Compared with coadministration of dexamethasone, administration of G‐CSF alone to the same GTX donors led to a faster decline in circulating G‐CSF levels, whereas dexamethasone itself did not induce any G‐CSF, demonstrating a role for dexamethasone in increasing G‐CSF half‐life.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSION</jats:title><jats:p>Dexamethasone increases granulocyte yield upon coadministration with G‐CSF by extending G‐CSF half‐life.

Forty-one participants with and thirty-nine without T2DM underwent 3-Tesla MRI, including a quantitative technique measuring (macrovascular) blood flow in the internal carotid artery and an arterial spin labeling technique measuring (microvascular) perfusion in the grey matter (GM). Three analysis methods were used to quantify the CBF: a region of interest analysis, a voxel-based statistical parametric mapping technique, and a ‘distributed deviating voxels’ method. Participants with T2DM exhibited significantly more tissue with low CBF values in the cerebral cortex and the subcortical GM (3.8-fold increase). The latter was the only region where the hypoperfusion remained after correcting for atrophy, indicating that the effect of T2DM on CBF, independent of atrophy, is small. Subcortical CBF was associated with depression. No associations were observed for CBF in other regions with diabetes status, for carotid blood flow with diabetes status, or for CBF or flow in relation with cognitive function. To conclude, a novel method that tallies total ‘distributed deviating voxels’ demonstrates T2DM-associated hypoperfusion in the subcortical GM, not associated with cognitive performance. Whether a vascular mechanism underlies cognitive decrements remains inconclusive.</jats:p>"

The higher rate of magma replenishment since 2011 resulted in the eruption of the most mafic lava in the last 500–600 years.

The metropolitan area of Mexico City discharges ~60 m3/s of raw wastewater into the valley, a substantial share of which infiltrates into the regional aquifer. In this work, we aim to develop a comprehensive approach, adapted from oil and gas reservoir modeling frameworks, to assess water supply sources located downgradient from unmanaged aquifer recharge zones. The methodology is demonstrated through its application to the Mezquital Valley region. Geological, geoelectrical, petrophysical and hydraulic information is combined into a 3D subsurface model and used to evaluate downgradient supply sources. Although hydrogeochemical variables are yet to be assessed, outcomes suggest that the newly-found groundwater sources may provide a long-term solution for water supply. Piezometric analyses based on 25-year records suggest that the MV is close to steady-state conditions. Thus, unmanaged recharge seems to have been regulating the groundwater balance for the last decades. The transition from unmanaged to managed recharge is expected to provide benefits to the MV inhabitants. It will also be likely to generate new uncertainties in relation to aquifer dynamics and downgradient systems.</jats:p>"
