      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>It has often been taken for granted that most of us work only for financial reward. This undoubtedly limits the chances of redistributing income. In other words, it raises the question of the necessity to provide incentives to work. What is meant by ‘incentive to work’ is not at all as obvious as it might seem. The quantitative results of both the interview and econometric models suggest that an increase in net earnings per hour may reduce the number of hours of labour an individual is willing to supply, that is, a backward-sloping labour supply curve (see Table 3.2). Many people’s first reaction to this is that taxes have very little (if anything) to do with the number of hours worked: in most jobs, the number of hours of work is fixed. Furthermore, the number of hours in different jobs is a consequence of technological or institutional considerations, including union and government regulation. Of course, institutions do change all the time. We also know from economic history that the continuing rise in the real wage rate over this century has been associated with a continuing reduction in hours worked per week. Many economists would argue that this change in hours worked has something to do with economic forces. As their wages have risen, individuals have chosen to take some of the gains in the form of increased leisure. It is worth emphasizing that .there is nothing irrational about such behaviour, which can be described by a backward-sloping supply curve.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Spring wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L.) grain dry matter (DM) is increased by increasing the proportion of fertilizer N as NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> in the presence of a nitrification inhibitor (enhanced ammonium supply, EAS). This yield increase is manifest in increased heads plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of EAS on the number and origin of vegetative and headed tillers and on the number of fertile spikelets and kernels of each tiller. Knowledge of these effects will aid in determining when and how EAS increases grain DM. Increased grain DM with EAS in this study resulted from an increase in the number of headed tillers plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, which, for the most part, resulted from an increase in the number of vegetative tillers plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Increases in vegetative tillers plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> were detectable within several days after the onset of tillering and were similar for a low‐tillering and a high‐tillering cultivar. The rate of mainstem development was not affected by EAS, but several tillers appeared earlier with EAS. For some tillers, EAS also increased the proportion of vegetative tillers forming heads. Increased grain DM was not proportional to increases in heads plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, because the additional headed tillers produced with EAS treatments were primarily T0 (coleoptilar mainstem) tillers and subtillers that had fewer spikelets head<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and kernels head<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. The number of fertile spikelets head<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of several tillers was increased by EAS treatments, but the number of kernels head<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> was increased for the T1 and T20 tillers, only. Negative effects of EAS treatments on late‐appearing tillers (T4, T5, and T22) were thought to result from increased self‐shading, increased plant wilting, and reduced soil‐N supply occurring at anthesis and resulting from the much greater plant DM prior to anthesis in EAS treatments. However, in general, increased spring wheat grain DM with EAS can be ascribed to the positive effects of EAS on tiller development.</jats:p>",

The objective of this work was to study the effect of steady and alternating N and P concentrations in solution culture on pepper seedling development, dry‐matter production rate, and N and P uptake rates, to allow better control of production by transplants. Seedlings were grown in trays of pyramidal cells, packed with vermiculite and floated on well‐aerated nutrient solutions of high (6 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) or low (1 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) N and high (0.25 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) or low (0.01 or 0.03 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) P. Dry‐matter accumulation in seedling tops as a function of time conformed in all treatments to a first‐order exponential equation. The growth rate constant was significantly higher in the high than in the low N or P concentrations. Root growth rate was less affected by the N and P solution concentration than was the top growth rate. Five‐day‐long alternations of solution concentration from high to low and from low to high N and P significantly changed dry‐matter production rate and nutrient content in plants. Growth and uptake rates regained their original values when seedlings were re‐exposed for 5 d to the original solutions. The rapid changes in growth rate were attributed to rapid variations in the flux of N and P uptake in response to changes in solution concentrations, which affected N and P concentration in plant organs. Varying N and P concentrations in tops affected dry‐matter production rate, whereas variations in N and P concentrations in roots influenced the flux of uptake of P and N, respectively.</jats:p>",

The objective of this research was to determine, under greenhouse conditions, the effect of EAS on the accumulation and partitioning of DM and N at several stages of plant development and on the yield components (heads plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, kernels head<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and kernel weight). Enhanced NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> supply increased plant DM at 18 d after plant emergence, boot stage, 7 d after anthesis, and maturity. Enhanced NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> supply did not alter the relative partitioning of DM among leaf, stem, and grain at any stage of development. Effects of EAS on plant and grain DM at maturity increased with increasing N rate. At the highest N rates, grain DM was increased 18 and 6% in two experiments. Nitrogen and moisture stress appeared to alter grain DM response to EAS. Increased grain DM was associated with an increased number of heads plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Kernels head<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> were decreased with EAS, but kernel weight was not affected. Consequently, EAS increased heads plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> more than grain DM. At growth stages prior to maturity, EAS increased plant N uptake. At maturity, plant N uptake was slightly and inconsistently affected by EAS; however, the proportion of plant N in the grain was increased by EAS. This indicated a greater translocation of N from the stem to the grain with EAS. In general, increased spring wheat grain DM is associated with proportional increases in plant DM throughout plant development, but not necessarily with proportional increases in plant N uptake. Heads plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> is the only yield component increased positively by EAS and thus warrants further research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ability of lithium to interfere with phosphoinositide metabolism in rat cerebral cortex slices has been examined by monitoring the accumulation of CMP-phosphatidate (CMP-PtdOH) and the reduction in Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 levels. A small accumulation of [14C]CMP-PtdOH was seen in slices prelabelled with [14C]cytidine and stimulated with carbachol (1 mM) or Li+ (1 mM). However, simultaneous addition of both agents for 30 min produced a 22-fold accumulation, with Li+ producing a half-maximal effect at a concentration of 0.61 +/- 0.19 mM. Kinetic studies revealed that the effects of carbachol and Li+ on CMP-PtdOH accumulation occurred with no initial lag apparent under these conditions and that preincubation with myo-inositol (10 or 30 mM) dramatically attenuated CMP-PtdOH accumulation. myo-Inositol could also attenuate the rate of accumulation of CMP-PtdOH when added 20 min after carbachol and Li+; these effects were not observed when equimolar concentrations of scyllo-inositol were added. Use of specific radioreceptor assays allowed the mass accumulations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to be monitored. Following a lag of 5-10 min, Li+ resulted in a marked reduction in the accumulation of both inositol polyphosphates resulting from muscarinic-cholinergic stimulation. Preincubation of cerebral cortex slices with myo- (but not scyllo-) inositol delayed, but did not prevent, the reduction in the accumulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The results suggest that cerebral cortex, at least in vitro, is very sensitive to myo-inositol depletion under conditions of muscarinic receptor stimulation. The relationship of such depletion to the generation of inositol polyphosphate second messengers is discussed.</jats:p>",

The model provides a framework for examining the role of biological factors and changing expectations of future cattle prices in generating a negative short‐run supply response. The biological link between cattle generations requires the farmer to make a decision between production today and production tomorrow. This decision is based on a trade‐off between the possibilities of increasing current profit levels by increasing current output weighted against the possibilities of increased future profit by maintaining animals in inventory under the expectation of future price increases. Application of the model to Canadian data for the period 1978‐81 shows that the necessary condition for a negative supply response exists, but that the total supply elasticity remains positive.</jats:p>",

Personal interviews were held with 102 farmers in two contrasting agricultural districts — one an intensive cereal‐growing district in eastern England, the other an area of mixed livestock and arable farming in western England. Amongst cereal producers in both areas a quota was the preferred policy instrument; in the east because of the security it offered, but in the west because it was perceived to be the least damaging instrument for the industry as a whole. A price reduction was the preferred option of small livestock farmers in the western area. None of the other instruments — co‐responsibility levy, set‐aside, nitrogen use restrictions — received much support. Farmers were particularly negative about schemes involving the withdrawal of land from agricultural use.</jats:p>",

Inclusion of autoclaved black-eye beans (<jats:italic>Vigna unguiculata</jats:italic>) in the diet prevented the bleeding syndrome. To test the hypothesis that deficiency resulted from low phylloquinone intake exacerbated by inadequate production of menaquinones by the enteric bacteria, a follow-up experiment was carried out in which groups of rats were given an all-rice diet, a rice+beans diet or a stock diet. Rats on the allrice diet had significantly lower faecal concentrations of the main menaquinone-producing bacterial species (<jats:italic>Bacteroides fragilis</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Bacteroides vulgutus</jats:italic>) than animals on either of the other two diets. This coupled with the much lower faecal output on this diet suggests that total menaquinone production was low for the all-rice diet. The alterations in faecal flora were associated with several significant changes in caecal metabolism. Rats given the stock diet had much shorter caecal transit times and a considerably greater proportion of butyric acid in volatile fatty acid end-products than did rats on either of the other two diets.</jats:p>",

In State Project water (SPW), another MWD source water, the rate of oxidation of geosmin and methylisoborneol (MIB) with ozone—with or without hydrogen peroxide—is higher than in CRW. The oxidation of geosmin and MIB is postulated to occur through the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. The higher oxidation rates in SPW are indicative of higher levels of natural initiators of ozone decomposition and lower levels of hydroxyl radical scavengers.</jats:p>",
