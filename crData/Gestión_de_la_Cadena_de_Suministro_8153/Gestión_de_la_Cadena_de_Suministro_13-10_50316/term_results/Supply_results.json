      "abstract": "<jats:p>As organizations become increasingly specialized, their ability to engage the supply network in innovation efforts is becoming critical to their success. In addition, it is imperative for organizations to align internal research and development strategies with knowledge available in the supply network in order to gain superior innovation performance. In this article, we present some perspectives on supply network–enabled innovation and discuss two frameworks that integrate a firm's internal knowledge with that of its supply network to achieve innovation objectives. The inter‐related frameworks discussed are anchored in the absorptive capacity and ambidexterity theories. They explicate how firms can effectively align internal innovation activities and knowledge available in the supply network to gain superior innovation outcomes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ability to estimate a supplier's marginal cost confers a strategic competitive advantage to the buyer, whether in negotiations with suppliers, in an auction setting, or when an auction is used to initiate the process, which is then followed up with a traditional negotiation. Focusing on electronic reverse auctions characterized by a one‐shot, first‐price, sealed‐bid format, this article proposes an approach for estimating a supplier's marginal cost. Specifically, we suggest a two‐stage model: In the first stage, empirical analysis is used to predict the winning bid. In the second stage, a game‐theory approach is used to refine the outcome of the first stage to provide an estimate of the supplier's marginal cost. To assess the model, we apply it to data from a food and beverages company that carried out electronic auctions to select suppliers for industrial maintenance services. We find that our estimates are very close to those made by the suppliers and compare favorably to the efficient marginal costs determined with the widely used approach of data envelopment analysis. This also implies that after selecting a supplier through an auction, the buyer can enhance follow‐up negotiations with the supplier by contrasting our model's estimates of the marginal costs with the supplier's' inefficiencies detected with the data envelopment analysis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ambidexterity has been gaining attention among supply chain scholars due to its potential for overcoming trade‐offs. Associated with these complexities is the choice of an appropriate governance mechanism in buyer–supplier relationships, which can include relational and contractual approaches. Extending ambidexterity research to the supply chain management domain, we focus in the present study on ambidextrous governance, which we define as the simultaneous pursuit of both relational and contractual governance elements. We investigate the effect of ambidextrous governance on innovation and cost performance. In addition, as this relationship is highly dependent on the ambidexterity that may be present on the firm level, we theorize about the moderating effect of organizational ambidexterity. We further consider external contextual factors as influencing the ability of ambidextrous governance to effectuate performance, recognizing that the former may not be as effective under conditions of greater demand uncertainty and product complexity. We delineate our hypotheses based on extensions of complementarity theory, and test them, taking a buyer's perspective, with data collected in a multirespondent survey of manufacturing firms. Our results demonstrate the positive relationship between ambidextrous governance and both innovation and cost performance, and highlight the critical role of organizational ambidexterity as an enabler for innovation performance. We furthermore detect mixed effects for the contextual variables considered—demand uncertainty and product complexity—as moderators, emphasizing that the impact of ambidextrous governance on performance is subject to dynamics that are more complex than originally perceived. With our investigation, we extend ambidexterity research to the supply chain management domain and offer important implications for research and practice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, we use blended theoretical arguments from resource dependence theory, social capital theory, and the knowledge‐based view to posit that supply chain partner innovativeness enhances a firm's innovation strategy which in turn positively influences innovation performance. In addition, we argue that the effect of supply chain partner innovativeness on product innovation strategy could be further enhanced by innovation climate and having strategic relationships with key supply chain partners. Using data collected from 207 manufacturing firms in Australia, the findings show that key supply chain partner innovativeness has a positive effect on product innovation strategy. Further, the effect of supply chain partner innovativeness on innovation strategy is enhanced when firms have stronger strategic relationships with their key supply chain partners. Finally, we find that the joint influence of innovation climate and strategic relationships with key supply chain partners enhances the effect of supply chain partner innovativeness on innovation strategy. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The latest century has witnessed two major transformations of the business landscape through which the boundaries of firms were modified substantially. The first was the establishment of the large‐scale integrated hierarchies, like the Ford Motor Company, in the beginning of the 20th century. The second was the disintegration of these hierarchies at the end of the same century. In both cases, the objective of the boundary movement was to improve the opportunities for innovative redesign. Because the strategic approaches to achieve this objective were quite different, the interplay between innovative redesign and changes of the boundaries of firms deserves further exploration. This article is based empirically on previous research on these two types of transformations. The information from these studies is used to formulate seven propositions concerning the interplay between innovative redesign and corporate boundaries. Three main findings spring from this study. First, the boundaries of firms are multifaceted. In addition to the ownership boundary, it is demonstrated that influence boundaries and awareness boundaries are central in innovative redesign. Second, corporate boundaries are dynamic. The study shows that sometimes they function as buffers in relation to other firms, while in other situations, they serve as bridges. Third, for the individual firm's boundary setting, two issues appear to be critical: one concerns the trade‐off between specialization and integration, and the other relates to the interaction between the internal capabilities of the firm and those that are accessible from business partners.</jats:p>",

Organizations do their best to improve performance by adopting better supply chain (SC) performance indicators. In this paper 19 key performance indicators (KPI) were identified based on strong literature support in consultation of practitioners and consultants in the field of non-livestock retailing (NLR). NLR is the retailing of agriculture and horticulture products. The technique of factor analysis using principal component analysis with Varimax rotation has classified KPI into four factors as; inventory metrics, customer metrics, flexibility metrics and growth and learning metrics. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach was used to develop and validate a model for measuring SC performance of organized NLR industry based on KPI. The data for analysis was collected from top 10 organized NLR players operating in Punjab, Chandigarh, New Delhi and Gurgaon in India. The results were subjected to rigorous statistical tests for reliability and validity. Finally, these classified KPI were presented in the form of a model to measure SC performance of organized NLR industry using SEM.</p>",

However, in contrast to other information sources, reference customers are selected by suppliers, not by purchasing managers; thus, purchasing managers may perceive a bias in the supplier‐selected referral. We study the antecedents of purchasing managers' perceived bias with a mixed‐design experiment with purchasing managers as respondents. We find that the greater the experience of purchasing managers, the less the bias in the referral they perceive. We also find that reference customers can reduce purchasing managers' perceived bias in the supplier‐selected referral by giving a referral that has some negative information in an otherwise positive referral.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>With increasing pressure for higher wages and growing competition from other developing countries such as Vietnam and Mexico, China can no longer rely heavily on cheap labor supply as a competitive advantage to secure her position as the world’s largest manufacturing base. Other competitive edges, such as lean manufacturing and lean supply chain management that help cut cost and reduce waste, have to be explored. Using a self-administered questionnaire survey, this study investigates the current status of lean thinking application in supply chain management by the small- and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) in China. It also explores if there are benefits in the application and the challenges faced by the SMMs in implementation. The findings suggest that application of lean thinking in China is not widespread. For those firms that have applied lean thinking, the major benefits obtained include reductions in cost, waste, inventory, labor, and cycle time. The major difficulties encountered lie in the accurate communication of the requirements between workers and managers and the collaboration with supply chain members. Proper application of lean thinking in supply chain management can bring substantial benefits to the manufacturing industry. Managers can use this research to benchmark their lean thinking application and revise their supply chain strategy accordingly.</p>",

The story is told from the perspective of a single entrepreneur working closely together with an A-team of fiercely independent shop-owners who helped transform TSP from a voluntary association into a market-leading Scandinavian retail chain. The trade network then became a global supply chain, before finally nearly going bankrupt. Three main points are made. The first is that the ‘retail revolution’ occurred as the result of new technology and market liberalization, but only as these were mediated through people’s efforts at new venture creation. The second point is that entrepreneurship itself changes the conditions for entrepreneurship, and the third that ethnography is a good method for investigating how entrepreneurship changes the conditions for entrepreneurship.</jats:p>"

Both vessels are expected to be able to operate in sea states of 4 - 5m thereby reducing waiting time for the weather and providing improved safety for the vessel and its crew.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In addition to novel design features, the key to the high speed of the FSS, and the high bollard pull and fast response time of the AHTS, is the use of an al-electric propulsion system, combining reciprocating engine and gas turbine generator sets for fuel efficiency, using clean-burning LNG as the main fuel. This concept, making use of the high power density and fast loading times f the gas turbines, provides the most efficient solution with reduced weight to maximise speed, towing power, load carrying capability and passenger comfort, while minimizing the environmental impact of logistical operations by using ‘clean’ natural gas.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The relative contribution of different components of money supply has been computed and the money supply as well as money multiplier function has been estimated. Empirical results show that disposable high powered money is found to be a major contributor to the change in monetary aggregates without any significant structural break. However, the degree of controllability of high powered money is not strong, and neither CRR nor Bank Rate has been effective monetary policy tools so far. Open market operation is found statistically significant only at 10 percent level of significance to influence disposable high powered money. On the other hand, money multipliers are affected by currency ratio, time deposits ratio and excess reserve ratio, but not by CRR. On the other hand, Granger causality based test of Post-Keynesian hypothesis reveals that money supply endogeniety cannot be ruled out. Hence, monetary policy framework needs to be changed accordingly and OMO should be strengthened further.</jats:p>"

We show that, in contrast to Earth, these ions are abruptly energized after ejection into the magnetosphere due to enhanced curvature-related parallel acceleration. Regardless of their mass-to-charge ratio, the parallel speed of these ions is rapidly raised up to ~ 2 VE × B (denoting by VE × B the magnitude of the local E × B drift speed), in a like manner to Fermi-type acceleration by a moving magnetic mirror. This parallel energization is such that ions with very low initial energies (a few tenths of eVs) can overcome gravity and, regardless of species or convection rate, are transported over comparable distances into the nightside magnetosphere. The region of space where these ions reach the magnetotail is found to extend over altitudes similar to those where enhanced densities are noticeable in the MESSENGER data, viz., from ~ 1000 km up to ~ 6000 km in the pre-midnight sector. The observed density enhancements may thus follow from E × B related focusing of planetary material of dayside origin into the magnetotail. Due to the planetary magnetic field offset, an asymmetry is found between drift paths anchored in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, which puts forward a predominant role of heavy material originating in the Northern Hemisphere in populating the innermost region of Mercury's magnetotail.</jats:p>"

An extensive and systematic literature review was undertaken in major logistics, supply chain, operations, and strategic management journals to identify theories in which a model of IOL could be grounded and to document major relationships related to the concepts of organizational learning and IOL. Using resource-based view, relational view, and knowledge-based view as the theoretical foundations, a conceptual model depicting IOL as a source of a competitive advantage was developed. The proposed theoretical framework suggests IOL can be used to develop capabilities such as innovation and flexibility that, in turn, lead to higher levels of logistics performance and contribute to a firm's competitive advantage. Supply chain orientation is an important antecedent to IOL, and cultural distance is an important moderator of IOL. This article contributes to the body of knowledge on IOL by positioning IOL within the framework of received theories and constructs. Implications for managers and several directions for future research are also identified.</jats:p>",

Literature data on the selenium supply in Hungary are reviewed in detail, also noting some important international reports. Hungarian soils are selenium deficient and this is reflected partly in selenium content of the plants, too. Selenium supplementation has been generally applied to most livestock since the 1980s in Hungary in order to prevent diseases associated with selenium deficiency. There are little data on the selenium content of Hungarian foodstuffs; therefore, selenium content of important foodstuffs available in the European Union is reviewed in detail. Data on selenium concentrations in human plasma or serum are scarce, and the results depend substantially on the analytical methods applied. In conclusion, Hungary is a country with marginal selenium deficiency, and this may play a role in the pathogenesis and poor treatment results of several diseases. Orv.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the problem of evaporation of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) occurring at different places in the LNG supply chain. Evaporation losses in the LNG supply chain are one of the key factors for LNG safety, technical and economic assessment. LNG is stored and transported in tanks as a cryogenic liquid, i.e. as a liquid at a temperature below its boiling point at near atmospheric pressure. Due to heat entering the cryogenic tank during storage and transportation, a part of the LNG in the tank continuously evaporates creating a gas called Boil-Off Gas (BOG), which changes the quality of LNG over time. The general methods of handling and utilization of the Boil-Off Gas at different points in the LNG supply chain are presented. Attention is given to the issue of LNG energy content transferred during loading and unloading of LNG tankers, as well as to the Boil-Off Gas generated by evaporation of the cargo during maritime transport. The results presented in the paper have been derived from the scientifi research project 250 - 2502209 - 2366 „Management of Ship Power Systems under Fault Conditions and Failure“ supported by the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports of the Republic of Croatia.</jats:p>"

The buyer has priors on the suppliers' costs but does not know their costs exactly. Recent literature has shown how the buyer can implement the optimal procurement mechanism by announcing a revenue function (specifying a payment for each quantity the buyer may purchase), then auctioning off the supply contract with the specified revenue function. In this paper, we show that a simple modified version of the standard open-descending auction for a fixed quantity is also an optimal mechanism for obtaining supplies. What distinguishes this mechanism is its simplicity and familiarity for the suppliers—open-descending auctions are very easy to run and ubiquitous in practice, whereas auctioning supply contracts with a specified revenue function is much less observed and more difficult to explain to suppliers. Furthermore, we show that this simple mechanism can be easily generalized to ex ante asymmetric suppliers and a class of nonlinear production costs. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of a bench scale apparatus (often referred to as a ‘collimated beam’) to apply fluences to water samples is common practice in disinfection research and in validating the performance of full-scale UV disinfection reactors. This study investigated the sources of potential experimental variations in the calculation of fluence when conducting polychromatic collimated beam exposures. Spectral variations associated with lamp operating conditions (e.g. cooling of the lamp), the angle of the spectroradiometer relative to the lamp when measuring the UV fluence rate, and the shape of the arc within the lamp are important to consider in order to achieve reproducible UV fluences when using a polychromatic collimated beam. Specific recommendations are provided to encourage greater experimental rigour and reproducibility in polychromatic UV disinfection studies, including taking spectral output measurements before and after UV exposures and monitoring the lamp voltage as an indication of lamp output stability.</jats:p>",

These changes alter the hydroclimatic condition of regions as well as the availability of water resources. In this study, the data generated by 14 general circulation models (GCMs) developed under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B, A2, and B2 are downscaled and utilized to evaluate climate change impact on the hydroclimatic system of the Karaj River basin located in central Iran. The precipitation and temperature of the study region are downscaled using the change factor approach (CFA). The study analyzes future climate data, extreme changes of future climatic conditions of precipitation, and temperature. The Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model developed by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) is used to simulate streamflow under extreme climate change conditions. Two different sources of uncertainty are investigated in this study. First, the model parameters uncertainty is analyzed with the Monte Carlo procedure, and then different datasets of GCMs projection are investigated under the climate of the twentieth-century climate simulation (20C3M). Results show the GCMs projections range can almost capture the historical records during the 1980s through 2000 for the Karaj basin. By applying the HBV model, considerable range of streamflow changes in the future can be projected that will affect the operation scheme of Karaj Reservoir. In this study, the system dynamics (SD) modeling approach is used to simulate the system behavior through time in an integrated fashion and evaluate its overall reliability in supplying water. The results of this study show that the runoff will decrease in the future under the climate change impact. This will result in more than 50% decrease in reliability of the Karaj Reservoir system under the extreme conditions. As a result, this research predicts that the Karaj Reservoir system will face more than 50% decrease in its reliability under the extreme conditions. Consequently, meeting the increasing water demands would be difficult and application of demand management strategies will be unavoidable.</jats:p>",

There is virtually universal agreement that it is necessary to upgrade the electric grid to increase overall system efficiency and reliability. Many technologies currently in use by the grid is outdated and in many cases unreliable. The reliance on old technology leads to inefficient systems, costing unnecessary money to the utilities, consumers and taxpayers. To upgrade the grid and to operate an improved grid will require significant dependence on distributed intelligence and broadband communication capabilities. The access and communications capabilities require the latest in security technology which are reliable for extremely large, wide-area communications networks.

The transport sector for example, which contributes more than 10% of the global CO2 emission, is promoting the use of biofuels in order to improve a nation’s energy security and to reduce the sector’s carbon footprint. Biofuels which are sourced from agricultural feedstocks will require more water resources than their fossil fuel counterparts and with climate change affecting rainfall patterns, it is expected that water resources will become more scarce. A fuzzy multi-objective mathematical model for optimizing the biofuel supply chain in consideration of multiple regions is developed in this paper. The model seeks to identify how resources should be allocated in the presence of regional water constraints to satisfy the growing demand for biofuels. A case study on bioethanol produced from different indigenous feedstocks in three Asian countries is presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the model.</jats:p>"

Privatization was presented as a panacea that would expand and improve water supply. Small-scale independent water providers (SSPs) were meanwhile often the only actors ensuring that services were available to the peri-urban poor. Nonetheless, they were ignored and even vilified in ‘pro-poor’ strategies of water supply reform. Recent studies have actually demonstrated the important role SSPs play in serving the poor in African cities, however, substantial knowledge gaps remain. This study of SSP activities in Maputo, Mozambique provides rigorous empirical evidence about the performance of fully private SSPs vis-à-vis a privatized utility at both the provider and household level. The findings belie long-held notions of informal water provision as inferior and inefficient and formal sector privatization as the preferred strategy for reaching the poor. Improving water supply in African cities requires an understanding of the specific advantages of provider-types and avoiding universal cures.</jats:p>",

A methodological approach is suggested, in which mathematical models and methods for nodal evaluation of heat supply reliability for consumers are developed and the studies on the impact of different elements of fuel and heat supply systems on its level are described.

      "abstract": "<p>Information technology (IT) supply chains are subject to security risks even during the most stable of economic times, However, when economies come under stress due to brisk growth or rapid contraction, IT supply chains become greater targets for nefarious players, be they employees, hackers, terrorists or nation states, for a variety of reasons. Maintaining both cyber and physical security of owned systems and facilities, over which you have direct control, is difficult and expensive enough under normal conditions. However, attempting to preserve adequate levels of security over third parties, be they process outsourcers, product vendors or contractors, is much more challenging and can be extremely costly in time, money and resources. It is also fraught with organizational, social, economic, political, geographical and contractual challenges. In this paper, the authors list a broad range of potential IT-related security risks and suggest how they might become exacerbated during times of economic stress. Mitigation of these risks may call for extreme measures. Some actions are reasonable and straightforward to implement, whereas others require substantial effort and indeed may not be achievable under current legal and regulatory conditions. The authors offer recommendations for overcoming manageable hurdles, and suggest how some reduction in risk might be attained even in situations where ready solutions are not yet available.</p>",

As opposed to this, a systematic analysis of the information available on all the renewable energy sources indicates that the total potential is only around 1000 TWh/yr.

It is generally believed that organizations with greater IT investment tend to be more agile to response to environmental changes. However, the issue of whether IT is an enabler or impeder of organizational agility still remains unresolved. Drawing upon resource-based view theory and the literatures of information systems and supply chain management, the authors develop and test a theoretical model that integrates IT capability, supply chain capability and organizational agility. The authors propose that IT capability enables the development of a higher level of supply chain capability which is embedded within inter-firm processes and in turn enhances organizational agility. Structural equation modelling is employed to test their theoretical conceptualization of 310 Australian fast-growth small-to-medium enterprises across different industrial sectors. The results show that IT capability does contribute to firm agility through enhancing inter-firm supply chain processes such as integration, information sharing and coordination. This research highlights the role of IT-enabled intermediated processes and the ways in which IT is used by firms to enhance core business processes.</p>",

In this paper, we present a scheme for securely tracing material flow in supply chains using the inherent RFID authentication and data logging capability. The scheme provides not only an overall path tracing and verification through the entire supply chain, but also the product identification within the scope of a supply chain partner. RFID tags and readers are deployed to ensure that only authorized supply chain partners can identify the tagged items in a secure and private way. The authors develop tag-reader authentication protocols to ensure the authenticity of RFID tags and readers. Their approach avoids the single point failure of the supply chain server – there is no need for each supply chain partner to communicate with the server for every material flow. Therefore, it minimizes the risks caused by system interruptions due to network failures or server unavailability.</p>",

The antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite was studied by monitoring the absorbance of contaminated water using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The nanocomposites caused a growth delay in the growth rate of E. coli bacteria. The structural analysis of the bacteria by FE-SEM showed clusters of nanocomposite anchored to the bacterial cell wall during the initial stages of interaction. Results also indicate that treated bacteria show significant damage on the outer membranes, which were recognised by the formation of ‘pits’.

      "abstract": "<p>Knowledge Supply Chains (KSCs) are the networks that provide knowledge supplies so nourishing one or more business processes carried out by a firm. KSCs are particularly crucial for innovation development processes. The need to recur to open KSCs during the accomplishment of such processes is indeed emphasized by the recent literature on open innovation (Kirschbaum, 2005; Chesbrought, 2006; Gassman, 2006; Van de Vrande et al., 2009). However, as scholars adopt different definitions of openness and stress different practices, it is not clear what open really means (Dahlander and Gann, 2010). Research is called for to further classify the different practices and, above all, to measure the impact of open vs. closed innovation so as to support companies in the identification of the right balance (Enkel et al., 2009). In the paper a methodology to map and analyze KSCs arising during an innovation development process is proposed. The methodology is described with specific reference to New Product Development (NPD) which is widely common as well as strategic in many firms. The methodology supports the characterization of the knowledge supplies (also in terms of the adopted collaboration approach) and the assessment of their criticality within the NPD process. Hence, it (1) contributes to make the concept of openness clearer and (2) provide companies with a clear picture of the process and its criticalities.</p>",

Their responses vary widely. We theorize and empirically identify several factors associated with suppliers being especially willing to share this information with buyers, focusing on attributes of the buyers seeking this information and of the suppliers being asked to provide it. We test our hypotheses using data from the Carbon Disclosure Project's Supply Chain Program, a collaboration of multinational corporations requesting such information from thousands of suppliers in 49 countries. We find evidence that suppliers are more likely to share this information when requests from buyers are more prevalent, when buyers appear committed to using the information, when suppliers belong to more profitable industries, and when suppliers are located in countries with greenhouse gas regulations. We find evidence that these factors also influence the comprehensiveness of the information suppliers share and their willingness to share the information publicly. </jats:p>",

Recently, the quality of ground water has deteriorated due to over-exploitation and contamination resulting from anthropogenic activities. A broad range of physical, inorganic and organic, bacteriological, and radioactive parameters are found in ground waters. The presence of nitrate and hardness-causing ions at elevated levels is of greatest concern currently, as they can have a serious impact on human health and water distribution systems. The conventional methods which are applied to reduce the concentration of these inorganic constituents are found to be inconsistent when the concentration is significantly high. The present study is an attempt to remove nitrate and hardness-causing ions using polystyrene (PS) beads as packed media. The ground water sample had a total hardness between 1,030–1,250 mg/L, which is greater than the permissible limit, and the nitrate concentration was less than 45 mg/L. PS beads packed media was found to respond significantly in reducing nitrate by 88% and total hardness by 38% at an optimum flow rate and particle size of 3 L/min and 4 mm diameter respectively. PS beads can be a promising media in reducing nitrate and total hardness.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Marine microbial communities mediate many biogeochemical transformations in the ocean. Consequently, processes such as primary production and carbon (C) export are linked to nutrient regeneration and are influenced by the resource demand and elemental composition of marine microbial biomass. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that differential partitioning of element resources to various cellular components can directly influence overall cellular elemental ratios, especially with respect to growth machinery (i.e., ribosomal RNA) and phosphorus (P) allocation. To investigate whether allocation to RNA is related to biomass P content and overall C : P biomass composition in the open ocean, we characterized patterns of P allocation and C : P elemental ratios along an environmental gradient of P-supply in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre (NASG) from 35.67° N 64.17° W to 22.67° N 65.52° W. Because the NASG is characterized as a P-stressed ecosystem, we hypothesized that biochemical allocation would reflect sensitivity to bioavailable P, such that greater P supply would result in increased allocation toward P-rich RNA for growth. We expected these changes in allocation to also result in lower C : P ratios with increased P supply. In contrast to our predictions however, bulk C : P ratios were decoupled from allocation to nucleic acids and did not vary systematically across a P supply gradient of 2.2–14.7 μmol m–2 d–1. Overall, we found that C : P ratios ranged from 188–306 along the transect, and RNA represented only 6–12% of total particulate P, whereas DNA represented 11–19%. However, we did find that allocation to RNA was positively correlated with SRP supply rate, suggesting a consistent physiological response in biochemical allocation to resource supply within the whole community. These results suggest that community composition or non-nucleic acid P pools may influence ecosystem scale variation in C : P stoichiometry more than nucleic acid allocation or prevailing environmental conditions in diverse marine microbial communities.\n                        </jats:p>"

With advances in social media that have empowered customers and their social communities to actively participate in sustainable practices, the role of the customers in achieving sustainability in all supply chain operations within the tourism industry has grown. Social media also constitute a force that encourages customers to support sustainability practices. This paper proposes an overall framework that identifies and synthesizes the various roles and impact of the customers’ involvement in implementing sustainable supply chain management in tourism. This involves the following four dimensions: factors motivating customer involvement in sustainability, the degree of customer involvement, management strategies for customer involvement, and outcomes of customer involvement. The paper offers examples in support of the framework that demonstrate various ways in which customers are contributing to sustainability at various points in the supply chain. </jats:p>",

Analyzing data from Audit Analytics and Compustat for the seven-year period from 2003 to 2009, we find that audit firms' supply chain knowledge has a negative effect on audit fees. Specifically, an audit firm with more supply chain knowledge charges lower audit fees to its clients when the firm also audits its clients' major buyers. In addition, we find that the fee discount is greater when the audit firm possesses major buyer-related supply chain knowledge at the office level compared to the national level. Our findings are consistent, albeit weaker, to an expanded sample of companies that voluntarily disclose their major buyers.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Availability: The data are publicly available.</jats:p>",

We believe that relaxing the server synchronization requirement provides greater deal of compatibility for implementing such a compositional method on various hardware platforms. We derive the resource supply bound function of the extended MPR model using an algorithm.

Besides mandatory cargoes which must be embarked, pending transportation orders should be prioritized and many operational constraints must be observed. The available tools found in commercial enterprise resource planning (ERP) allow for creating and editing cargo manifests without any support mechanism. The decision process it is totally dependent upon the planner, who is responsible for cargo selection, for checking consistencies and for solving conflicts without knowing, in advance, the position of each cargo in the deck. The proposed DSS interacts with commercial ERPs and provides an environment for manual cargo allocation through a drag-and-drop mechanism, and a heuristic allocation procedure focused in maximizing deck occupation respecting a broad range of operational constraints.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>1. Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>An effective response to the demand of drilling rigs and production platforms for supply items is a key issue in offshore logistics. Besides being a strategic segment, the assets present in the exploratory and production phases have extremely high capital and operational costs, reaching as high as $ 650,000 /day (Energy Global, 2013; Offshore Magazine, 2013), and cannot have its operations jeopardized due to supply shortages.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>While urban distribution systems often operate under traffic congestion, waterborne distribution operations may be adversely affected by environmental conditions hindering vessels to execute timely schedules. It is not uncommon reports of vessels that were kept from delivering supplies due to critical weather conditions in Campos Basin, Brazil. Irregular demand patterns may cause the distribution problem to become even more complex inasmuch as incoming transportation orders, that should be promptly managed, compete with backlogged ones. Considering that orders must attend a time window frame, late orders may gain an emergency status as their due dates are approached.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Given that the ports serving the offshore system considered in our study are working under high occupation rates and that late deliveries from suppliers often occur, the distribution system demands continuous monitoring and effective support tools in order to get the most out of limited resources.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Differently from the container market where general cargo are unitized into a few types of standardized ISO containers and conveyed in full cellular containerships, in the offshore segment no such standardization exists. Consider, for instance, the following companies that were found by browsing the internet in search of \" offshore container\": Acorn (2013); BSL (2013); Ferguson (2013). One will realize that each company provides more than a dozen types of containers and baskets for transporting goods. Rather than criticize or defend the use of a restricted set of standardized container types in offshore operations, our intention is to stress that this aspect poses an additional difficulty when planning cargo allocation.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The formation of new principles of functioning in this field is conditioned by the market mechanisms emerging due to the interaction between different owners of heat economy facilities within the single system. Today heat energy markets are represented by a great number of enterprises with different types of ownership that operate heat energy sources and heat networks. It is obvious that such a situation explicitly causes conflicts of interests among the heat energy market participants and unbalances the responsibility for production reliability, heat energy supply efficiency and its quality among the participants of centralized heat supply (heat sources – heat networks - consumers). A reasonable solution to this problem can make it possible to determine optimal conditions for operation of the developing heat energy market, and their implementation can increase technical, economic and energy efficiency of heat energy. These problems are solved by using the methods of hydraulic circuit theory, nonlinear dynamic programming and two level programming. The studies performed allowed the creation of mathematical models and methods for optimal construction of efficient heat supply systems, organization of their operation that ensure the realization of full energy saving potential in the field of heat supply to consumers, taking into account the interests of all participants of the heat energy market.</p>",

We integrate the assumption of above two kinds of option pricing, and design a model to combine the Black–Scholes rule and traditional option contract of optimizing in a supplier-led supply chain. Our combined model can guide the enterprises to write or buy option considering both option pricing rule in financial market and the optimization of supply chain.

Both models were thoroughly studied and researches were usually confined to cost minimization or profit maximization. In this paper, the authors proposed a more realistic multiobjective study of both multi-location Transshipment and Newsvendor inventory models. The aggregate cost, the fill rate, and the shared inventory quantity are formulated as conflicting objectives and solved using two reference multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (SPEA2 and NSGA-II). The proposed models take into account the presence of storage capacity constraints. The obtained Pareto fronts revealed interesting information. When transshipments are allowed, both low aggregate cost and high fill rate levels are ensured. The required shared inventory may have an important variability. The considered objective functions are conflicting and very sensitive to local storage capacities.</p>",

This opens a much larger hydrocarbon resource than conventional oil &amp; gas found within traps and covers a much wider surface area than historic oil fields - often in areas unaccustomed to petroleum production and lacking the required infrastructure to support production. To generate the required drainage channels, these tight source rocks have to be fractured to generate flow paths that permit economic production. Water has become the default carrier fluid required to transport proppant required in fracking because of its relative ease of handling, low cost and wide availability. Managing the logistics of water in the supply chain can be a complex and challenging process, particularly given its close scrutiny by regulators and the public. Given the challenges and complexity however, it is still often handled by a series of spreadsheets and project planning software and usually managed under a separate production schedule due to the long lead times needed for permitting, engineering, construction, filling and the required pumps and monitoring equipment. Unlike municipal and utility water systems, water systems for well stimulation are mobile or temporary as end use points move from pad to pad during development of hundreds of wells per year per company. Sourcing, transport, use, reuse and disposal of water vary from basin to basin posing significant challenges and complexity in the management and treatment of frack and produced water.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In this paper, the authors discuss Smart Water Management (SMW) in source rock play development primarily for North American and tight oil and gas formations, but with insights that apply worldwide and to the broader field of unconventional development including coal bed methane.

Thus optimize water availability, minimize fresh water use, reduce the major costs and the transportation impact, and improve spill/leak detection and regulatory compliance.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The leader decides on the locations of the facilities, and the forwarding agent builds the forward and reverse transportation plans so as to minimize the total transportation cost. A genetic algorithm solution method is used to obtain the Stackelberg solution. Furthermore, the algorithm uses penalty functions to handle the constraints.

This paper considers two competing supply chains in which a manufacturer produces semi-finished items on a MTS basis for a retailer that will customize the items on a MTO basis. The two-echelon supply chain offers multi-product to a market comprised of homogenous customers who have different preferences and willingness to pay. The retailer wishes to determine the optimal OPP, the optimal semi-finished goods buffer size, and the price of the products. Moreover, the authors consider both integrated scenario (shared capacity model) and competition scenario (Stackelberg queueing-game model) in this paper. A matrix geometric method is utilized to evaluate various performance measures for this system and then, optimal solutions are obtained by enumeration techniques. The suggested queueing approach is based on a new perspective between the operation and marketing functions which captures the interactions between several factors including inventory level, price, OPP, and delivery lead time. Finally, parameter sensitivity analyses are carried out and the effect of demand on the profit function, the effect of prices ratio on completion rates ratio and buffer sizes ratio and the variations of profit function for different prices, completion percents, and buffer sizes are examined in both scenarios.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Carbon footprinting is a tool for firms to determine the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their supply chain or with a unit of final product or service. Carbon footprinting typically aims to identify where best to invest in emission reduction efforts, and/or to determine the proportion of total emissions that an individual firm is accountable for, whether financially and/or operationally. A major and underrecognized challenge in determining the appropriate allocation stems from the high degree to which GHG emissions are the result of joint efforts by multiple firms. We introduce a simple but general model of joint production of GHG emissions in general supply chains, decomposing the total footprint into processes, each of which can be influenced by any combination of firms. We analyze two main scenarios. In the first scenario, the social planner allocates emissions to individual firms and imposes a cost on them (such as a carbon tax) in proportion to the emissions allocated. In the second scenario, a carbon leader voluntarily agrees to offset all emissions in the entire supply chain and then contracts with individual firms to recoup (part of) the costs of those offsets. In both cases, we find that, to induce the optimal effort levels, the emissions need to be overallocated, even if the carbon tax is the true social cost of carbon. This is in contrast to the usual focus in the life-cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting literatures on avoiding double counting. Our work aims to lay the foundation for a framework to integrate the economics- and LCA-based perspectives on supply chain carbon footprinting. </jats:p>",

The causes of these problems are mostly from the demand and time uncertainties, so we set up a dynamic cooperation system model to reflect these uncertainties. In a further way, we propose the H robust control strategy and LMI algorithm to reduce the uncertainty influences. And using of SIMILINK tool to make simulation analysis of the system is shown at the end of this paper.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In September 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) to execute product tracing pilot projects as described in Section 204 of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). IFT collaborated with representatives from more than 100 organizations—including the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, state departments of agriculture and public health, industry, and consumer groups, as well as not‐for‐profit organizations—to implement the pilots. The objectives of the pilot projects were 1) to identify and gather information on methods to improve product tracing of foods in the supply chain and 2) to explore and evaluate methods to rapidly and effectively identify the recipient of food to prevent or mitigate a foodborne illness outbreak and to address credible threats of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals as a result of such food being adulterated or misbranded. IFT conducted evaluations to determine the impact of currently available technologies, types of data and formats, and the data acquisition process, as well as the use of technology on the ability to follow product movement through the supply chain. Results from the pilots found inconsistencies in the terminology, numbering systems, formatting, legibility, and occasionally the language that sometimes required IFT to contact the submitting firm to gain clarity, thus increasing the time required to capture data before any meaningful analysis could begin. However, the pilot participants appeared to have many of the tools and processes in place which are required to allow the capture and communication of critical track and trace information (such as, key data elements) at critical points of product transfer and transformation (such as, critical tracking events). IFT determined that costs associated with implementing a product tracing system can vary widely as determined by numerous factors: the size of the firm/facility, the method of product tracing already in use (manual or electronic), and the range of each firm's capabilities to implement or improve its product tracing system, to name a few. IFT found that there are several areas (such as uniformity and standardization, improved recordkeeping, enhanced planning and preparedness, better coordination and communication, and the use of technology) in which industry improvements and enhancements to FDA's processes would enable tracebacks and traceforwards to occur more rapidly. IFT developed 10 recommendations for FDA to consider for improving the state of system‐wide food product tracing. The recommendations outlined in the report will enable FDA to conduct more rapid and effective investigations during foodborne illness outbreaks and other product tracing investigations, thus significantly enhancing protection of public health.</jats:p>",

A field experiment was carried out in northern Tunisia on two drip irrigated peach varieties grafted on two rootstocks. Two deficit levels, mild DI1 and severe DI2, were applied. Phenological survey allowed determination of the crop growth stages: initial, development, mid- and late-season. The average lengths of these crop stages were 32, 43, 49 and 136 days for early variety and 33, 49, 63, and 105 days for mid-season variety, respectively. Mean value of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) for the four growth stages was respectively 31, 115, 211 and 420 mm for early variety and 40, 128, 311 and 300 mm for mid-season variety. ETc was restricted with low ground cover to 25, 85, 150 and 280 mm. Tree development, yield and water needs were affected by water status, rootstock and climatic conditions. Threshold values of Ψstem of −1.5 and −2.0 MPa could be considered for mild and severe deficit irrigation. The water use of the soil water seemed to be more efficient with vigorous rootstock under mild deficit. Under extreme watering conditions, rootstock effects were negligible.

Such investments are often prudent because studies indicate that supply chain knowledge (SCK) has a positive influence on performance. Key questions still surround the SCK–performance relationship, however. First, what is the overall relationship between SCK and performance? Second, under what conditions is the relationship stronger or weaker? To address these questions, we applied meta‐analysis to 35 studies of the SCK–performance relationship that collectively include more than 8,400 firms. Our conservative estimate is that the effect size of the overall relationship is <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/deci12039-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00117315:deci12039:equation:deci12039-math-0001\" /> = .39. We also find that the SCK–performance relationship is stronger when (i) examining operational performance, (ii) gathering data from more than one supply chain node, (iii) gathering data from multiple countries, (iv) examining service industries, and (v) among more recently published studies. We also found that studies that embraced a single theory base (as opposed to using multiple ones) had a stronger SCK–performance relationship. Looking to the future, our meta‐analysis highlights the need for studies to (i) include lags between the measurement of SCK and performance, (ii) gather upstream data when examining innovation, (iii) examine SCK within emerging countries, and (iv) provide much more information relative to the nuances of the SCK examined.</jats:p>",

This decision analysis developed an improved approach to Bayer's decision for product-generation transition and global production capacity expansion that more realistically addresses potential regional supply shortages and overages due to demand and supply uncertainties that can result in supply-demand imbalances. With the added confidence provided by this more realistic approach, Bayer's executive leadership team acted on the recommendation from the decision analysis in contrast to an earlier analysis that had not resulted in management action. The paper makes two major contributions: First, it describes the details of what is involved in conducting applied decision analysis in a real-world setting in more detail than what is typically in textbooks on decision analysis. Second, the paper illustrates the important role of economic modeling in a large-scale applied decision analysis. The approach is applicable to other product-generation transition decision making for expanding global production capacity under uncertainty in a supply-constrained environment, especially for new product introductions and new product development decisions when supply is limited. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) is more than a century old. Water allowances and canal water distributions responded to increasing crop water requirements in a southward direction, e.g. higher water allowance in Sindh as compared to Punjab. But within a province, the canal water supplies do not address the issue of difference in irrigation demand. The consequence is unprecedented groundwater depletion in Bari Doab and waterlogging in certain other canal commands. After the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, gradually reduced flows and ultimate desiccation of eastern rivers have also contributed towards falling groundwater levels of adjoining aquifers. In this study, water allocations in the Water Apportionment Accord of 1991, annual average canal water diversions, and irrigation demand were compared for canal commands in Punjab. Rainfall was taken as an ultimate source of water that has a beneficial impact in integration with canal and groundwater. It is concluded that the efficiency of existing irrigation systems can be improved by adopting the concept of integrated water resources management (IWRM). Thus, to avoid waterlogging and groundwater depletion, reallocation of canal water supplies amongst the irrigation units in Punjab, in proportion to the relative irrigation water demand and cropping intensities, is recommended.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide drive accompanying changes in the marine carbonate system as carbon dioxide (CO2) enters seawater and alters ocean pH (termed \"ocean acidification\"). However, such changes do not occur in isolation, and other environmental factors have the potential to modulate the consequences of altered ocean chemistry. Given that physiological mechanisms used by organisms to confront acidification can be energetically costly, we explored the potential for food supply to influence the response of Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) larvae to ocean acidification. In laboratory experiments, we reared oyster larvae under a factorial combination of pCO2 and food level. Elevated pCO2 had negative effects on larval growth, total dry weight, and metamorphic success, but high food availability partially offset these influences. The combination of elevated pCO2 and low food availability led to the greatest reduction in larval performance. However, the effects of food and pCO2 interacted additively rather than synergistically, indicating that they operated independently. Despite the potential for abundant resources to counteract the consequences of ocean acidification, impacts were never completely negated, suggesting that even under conditions of enhanced primary production and elevated food availability, impacts of ocean acidification may still accrue in some consumers.\n                    </jats:p>"

We postulate a superstructure that combines all the components of the supply chain and different means of transportation, and model this multiscale design problem as a multiperiod MILP model. In order to identify regions where investments are needed and the optimal configuration of the network, a strategic planning model is considered in which gasoline stations are aggregated in different regions. A detailed formulation is considered where regions are disaggregated into gas stations to determine the retrofit projects for the selection of blending pumps over their expected life.

The results with this operational approach indicated a significant reduction in the time required for the column to stabilize when compared with the conventional approach. The proposed strategy proved to be a viable alternative, enabling faster dynamics and smaller volumes to be processed outside the predefined quality parameters.</jats:p>",

Hydropower has become a lesser part of the mix of energy sources, and the question arises as to value of water for that purpose relative to its value for municipal use. Three cases are used to examine the issue. Effects of withdrawal for municipal water supply on output of electric energy are estimated. Benefits of foregone energy are evaluated using the least cost alternative for replacement, and benefits for municipal water are estimated using costs for development of new sources. Benefits for use as municipal water are found to be considerably higher than benefits for hydroelectric energy at existing prices, even higher than the least cost alternative for replacement.

Then, a novel reconfiguration strategy is developed for enhancing the PSCI of distribution network when the PSCI is lower than a pre-defined warning value. The reconfiguration strategy can be integrated to distribution management system (DMS) as a preventive control method to prevent outages of customers, which can significantly increase the reliability of distribution network. Case studies are carried out by using a typical 33-bus distribution network, and simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed reconfiguration strategy, which has a good engineering application prospect.</jats:p>"

The demand for energy has been estimated by drawing on the database of the Ministry of Economic Development or by calculating the Annual Energy Requirement (AER) index, while for the estimate of the available forest biomass, reference was made to the public forest lands managed according to forestry management plans. The collected data were cross-checked with a view to detecting the technical and economic feasibility of district heating systems. The technical evaluation has mainly focused on the energetic and plant aspects, while the economic assessment was directed to defining the cost effectiveness criteria [Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Payback Period] that can measure the profitability of the investment. In the economic evaluation we also included the national public incentives, designed to encourage the production of energy from renewable sources in compliance with the international agreements signed by Italy for the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs).</jats:p>"

They discussed and deliberated the objectives of traceability and the means to develop product tracing in the food system. A total of 70 people participated in the 3 summits. These individuals were invited to participate in a small workgroup responsible for considering the details related to product tracing and presenting draft concepts to the larger group on November 1, 2011, in Chicago.

While employment relations scholars focus on a production‐oriented paradigm, revolving around interactions among employers, workers, and government, much of the activism motivating the development of private labor standards is based around companies' relations with their consumers. This article proposes an analytical framework conceptualizing the interface of employment relations and consumption relations within global supply chains, identifying four regimes of labor governance: governance gaps, collective bargaining, standards markets, and complementary regimes. Finally, we suggest a research agenda for examining the role of consumption relations in the changing nature of global labor governance. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

This study leverages the modeling capacity of an operational National Weather Service River Forecast Center to explore the potential impacts of future climate-driven hydrologic changes on factors important to planning at the Salt Lake City Department of Public Utilities (SLC). Hydrologic modeling results for the study area align with prior research in showing that temperature changes alone will lead to earlier runoff and reduced runoff volume. The sensitivity of average annual flow to temperature varies significantly between watersheds, averaging −3.8% °F−1 and ranging from −1.8% to −6.5% flow reduction per degree Fahrenheit of warming. The largest flow reductions occur during the high water demand months of May–September. Precipitation drives hydrologic response more strongly than temperature, with each 1% precipitation change producing an average 1.9% runoff change of the same sign. This paper explores the consequences of climate change for the reliability of SLC's water supply system using scenarios that include hydrologic changes in average conditions, severe drought scenarios, and future water demand test cases. The most significant water management impacts will be earlier and reduced runoff volume, which threaten the system's ability to maintain adequate streamflow and storage to meet late-summer water demands.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Low Impact Development (LID) and Water Sensitive Urban Design have as one of their tenets the use of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems to provide water for use on site. Historically implemented in arid or semi-arid regions, RWH has recently surged in popularity in more humid regions, such as the southeastern USA, due to increased interest in water conservation during severe drought conditions. An LID commercial site in Raleigh, NC, incorporated RWH with other stormwater control measures to mitigate runoff quantity and improve runoff quality. A 57,900-liter RWH tank used for landscape irrigation was monitored to determine influent and effluent water quality. Samples were analyzed for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), nitrite-nitrate (NOX), orthophosphate (Ortho-P) and total suspended solids (TSS). Low concentrations were observed for all pollutants monitored; for example, influent and effluent TP concentrations were 0.02 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively. Statistical testing showed significant increases in TAN and organic nitrogen (ON) concentrations by 33 and 38%, respectively, from inflow to outflow. NOX and TSS concentrations decreased significantly by 23 and 55%, respectively. Concentrations of all other pollutants were not significantly different between the inflow and outflow. Influent concentrations to the RWH tank were less than previously published rainfall pollutant concentrations, indicating potentially irreducible concentrations onsite. While a single case study, this RWH system appears to offer some pollutant mitigation, especially for TSS.</jats:p>",

The ratios in which N, P, and Fe are delivered to the surface ocean, relative to the demands of the phytoplankton community, define several biogeochemical provinces in terms of the limiting nutrients and the presence or absence of diazotrophs. Nutrient supply ratios provided by a global ecosystem model support the theoretical view that diazotroph biogeography is dominated by the Fe : N supply ratio, with the P : N supply ratio taking an important secondary role.

To increase responsiveness, supply chain managers often seek information that provides greater visibility into factors affecting both demand and supply. Managers often claim, however, that they are awash in data yet lacking in valuable information. Taken together, these conditions suggest that supply chain visibility is a necessary, but insufficient capability for enabling supply chain responsiveness. Based on organizational information processing theory, we posit that a supply chain organization's internal integration competence provides complementary information processing capabilities required to yield expected responsiveness from greater supply chain visibility. An analysis of data from 206 firms strongly supports this hypothesis. For supply chain managers, these findings indicate that a strategy for achieving supply chain responsiveness requires a dual‐pronged approach that aligns increased visibility with extensive information processing capabilities from internal integration. For researchers, this study provides an initial examination of visibility as a construct, and extends a growing literature addressing integration as an information processing capability.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This paper contributes to the literature by summarizing the circumstances in which information sharing between the retailer and the distributor benefits the manufacturer. In addition, our study points out that such information sharing does not always bring benefits to the manufacturer and that in some cases the information sharing may harm the manufacturer. We explain the reasons why this can happen and give managerial intuition for our results. Using numerical analysis, we illustrate the impact of partial information sharing on the agents in the supply chain with the change of the autoregressive coefficient in the demand process. </jats:p>",

But there is little investigation integrating both approaches and providing empirical evidence from developing countries. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, it describes the supply chain of organic products in Brazil, which is an emerging market. It describes how retailers manage its supply chain (wholesalers and small producers) in an organic own brand of fresh products. Second, this paper identifies the motivations, attitudes, beliefs and personal values behind Brazilian consumers' decision to purchase organic food. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Qualitative and quantitative techniques were used in two stages. First, it presents a case study of the organic supply chain. Then, a survey carried out with 261 consumers at supermarkets in a Brazilian city is presented. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The case study points out that retailers transfer to wholesalers the responsibility to manage small organic producers. It also suggests that as the organic product is under the retailer own brand, and therefore most of the value perceived by the consumer is retained by the retailer. Survey results indicate that organic consumers have strong individual values and benefits are the most significant predictors of attitude toward organic food for the Brazilian consumers interviewed. Availability is significantly related to the intent to purchase organic food, which is a key point for the supply chain to respond efficiently to consumers' demand. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper is based on a single case study and the survey is applied in only one city of Brazil. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The study contributes to expand the value analysis through a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques, including consumer behaviour and supply chain management in the same analysis.

Rebars are then fabricated on-site and installed after assembly. In the new delivery system, called prefabrication Just-In-Time (prefab-JIT) system, the off-site cut and bend along with frequent rebar delivery to the site are applied in order to improve the process and increase its efficiency. The main objective of this paper is to assess and compare the environmental impacts resulting from the air emissions associated with the two rebar delivery systems in a case study construction project. Environmental impact categories of interest include global warming, acidification, eutrophication, and smog formation. A process-based cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment methodology is applied to perform the analysis. The results show that the prefab-JIT rebar delivery system causes less contribution to all mentioned environmental impact categories compared with a traditional on-site delivery system.</jats:p>",

At 30°C, growth was unaffected by dissolved oxygen and oxygen was consumed quickly. Raising the temperature to 37°C resulted in severe growth inhibition and only slow removal of dissolved oxygen. Under these conditions, an abnormally low intracellular ratio of [ATP] to [ADP] (1.4) was found (normally around 5), which indicates that the cells are energy limited. By adding riboflavin to the medium, it was possible to improve growth and oxygen consumption at 37°C, and this also normalized the [ATP]-to-[ADP] ratio. A codon-optimized redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP) was introduced into\n            <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">L. lactis</jats:named-content>\n            and revealed a more oxidized cytoplasm at 37°C than at 30°C.

A decrease in intracellular flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which is derived from riboflavin, was observed with increasing growth temperature, but the presence of riboflavin made the decrease smaller. The drop was accompanied by a decrease in NADH oxidase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities, both of which depend on FAD as a cofactor. By overexpressing the riboflavin transporter, it was possible to improve FAD biosynthesis, which resulted in increased NADH oxidase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities and improved fitness at high temperatures in the presence of oxygen.\n          </jats:p>",

There has been a growing recognition that the two goals, cost reduction and customer service are achieved through Logistics and Supply Chain Management (SCM). Transportation of goods continues an important part of in-bound as well as outbound logistics of Supply Chain Management (SCM). Efficient distribution of goods and services is of great importance in today’s competitive market, because transportation constitutes a considerable portion of the purchase price of most products or services. Vehicle routing is considered as an important resource in a distribution logistics management system. Effective plan and control of vehicle operation can significantly reduce the cost of physical distribution system. To overcome the challenges of changing environment, the scheme of vehicle control of a physical distribution system should be dynamic. Thus India has become the top milk producing country in the world. This study addresses the vehicle routing aspect of distribution logistics in Sangam dairy supply chain of Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh. The problem is viewed as Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls (VRPB) and a mathematical model is developed with the consideration of various practical constraints. Moreover, a decision support system is developed for dynamic VRPB, which would help the manager in making operational and tactical decisions.</p>",

The problem of choosing optimal parameters involves determining the diameters of new heat pipelines, searching for the methods to reconstruct existing network sections, and choosing the pressure heads of pumping stations and their sites. To solve this problem the authors suggest a dynamic programming method for optimization of branched networks and a multiloop optimization method for calculation of loop networks, both being developed in the theory of hydraulic circuits. The paper presents new versions of algorithms for the implementation of these methods and describes their capabilities. These algorithms are implemented in the software package SOSNA-M. This software was developed on the basis of a methodological approach created to develop algorithms and methods for optimization of heat supply system parameters, flexibly control the computational process, optimize heat supply system parameters on a feasible set of equipment and improve the types of reconstruction of the existing components.</p>",

For this purpose, we used the passion fruit crop irrigated with Microjet type irrigation system, with conducting system in simple espaliers. The treatments consisted of five hours of application of the depth of water required by the crop with irrigation frequency of two days. The results showed that the highest yield (16660kg ha-1) was obtained with the fractionation of irrigation twice a day (50% to 7h and 50% to 21h30), which provided an increase in productivity of 54%, demonstrating the financial viability and being highly profitable to the interest rate of 2% per year, with low sensitivity of financial risk to real interest rates above the prevailing market.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this paper, a new modeling approach is proposed to integrate the tactical and operational planning levels in the biomass supply chain. The proposed approach includes an optimization model and a simulation model. The integration is made between these models (i) to assure the fulfillment of the daily biomass demand year‐round for a commercial‐scale cellulosic ethanol plant and (ii) to reduce biomass delivery costs. The optimization model prescribes the design of the supply area in a way that the annual biomass demand is met at a minimum delivery cost for a five‐year planning horizon. Given the design of the supply area, the simulation model schedules the flow of multi‐biomass in the supply chain to meet the daily biomass demand of the ethanol plant subject to the dynamics and uncertainties in the supply chain. If the daily demand cannot be met, the outputs of the simulation model are used to adjust the design in the optimization model to assure the fulfillment of the daily demand. The application of the integrated model to a proposed commercial‐sized bioethanol plant shows the efficiency of the integrated approach to design the supply area in a way that the daily biomass demand is met at the minimum delivery cost possible. The results of the sensitivity analysis reveal that the most influential parameter on the design is biomass yield. In addition, bale bulk density, in‐farm and road transportation operations, and farmer participation rates have the highest impact on delivery cost compared to other input parameters. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Single plant traits such as green biomass, spike dry weight, biomass, and nitrogen (N) transfer to grains are important traits for final grain yield. However, methods to assess these traits are laborious and expensive. Spectral reflectance measurements allow researchers to assess cultivar differences of yield‐related plant traits and translocation parameters that are affected by varying amounts of available N. In a field experiment, six high‐yielding wheat cultivars were grown with N supplies of 0, 100, 160, and 220 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. Wheat canopies were observed spectrally throughout the grain‐filling period, and three spectral parameters were calculated. To describe the development of the vegetative plant parts (leaves + culms) and the spikes, plants were sampled four times during grain filling. Dry weights and the relative dry‐matter content were recorded for leaves + culms and spikes. The N status of the plants was assessed by measuring the total N concentration and by calculating the aboveground N uptake. Good correlations were found between spectral indices and single plant traits throughout grain filling but varied with N supply and development stage. The normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, was strongly affected by the saturation effects of increased N concentration. The red‐edge inflection point, REIP, predicted plant traits with<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>&lt;?h.3&gt;<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>values up to 0.98. However, in plants with advanced senescence, the REIP was less efficient in describing plant traits. The NIR‐based index R<jats:sub>760</jats:sub>/R<jats:sub>730</jats:sub>was closely related to yield‐related plant traits at early grain filling. Compared to the REIP, the R<jats:sub>760</jats:sub>/R<jats:sub>730</jats:sub>index was resistant to strong chlorophyll decays being able to predict plant traits at late grain filling, with<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>&lt;?h.3&gt;<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>values of up to 0.92. Spectral reflectance measurements may represent a promising tool to assess phenotypic differences in yield‐related plant traits during grain filling.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Significant disparities in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) outcomes and intervention coverage exist between the Mountains and other ecoregions of Nepal. Delivery of essential health services to remote mountainous areas is challenging and access is a known barrier to utilization. However, the contribution of demand-side barriers is poorly understood. Consequently, policies and programs cannot strategically target constraints to increase coverage. This systematic review identifies demand-side barriers to utilization of RMNCH services in the Mountain districts of Nepal. Research was drawn from MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Eldis, and unpublished literature. Beyond inaccessibility, utilization is undermined by costs of care-seeking, traditional attitudes and practices, low status of women, limited health knowledge, dissatisfaction with service quality, and low and inequitable care by community health workers. The intensity and repercussions of these barriers are of greater magnitude in the Mountains where delayed care-seeking combines with long distances for critical health consequences. </jats:p>",

This, in turn, places increasing pressure on mining companies to broaden their concerns when planning new mining projects, covering its “social license to operate” by incorporating strategies for limiting negative socioenvironmental impacts alongside calculations of the project's economic viability as well as balancing a large number of potential stakeholders. Accordingly, understanding also the sociopolitical context of mineral development is crucial for the creation of sustainable practices within the mining industry. By applying a sustainable development framework, this article outlines the complex web of challenges associated with sustainable mineral extraction, ranging from technological and economic development to political and institutional concerns on how to govern and manage scarce resources in a globalized world.</jats:p>",

A field experiment with spring wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic>), hulless (<jats:italic>Avena nuda</jats:italic>), and hulled (<jats:italic>Avena sativa</jats:italic>) oats was conducted for 3 years in Ottawa, ON, Canada, to determine the crop responses to N addition (0, 75, and 150 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>). Biomass, N, and phosphorus (P) accumulation and partitioning into different plant components were examined during the growth season. Lodging score was determined for all crops when it occurred and again at harvest. During the growth season, both hulless and hulled oats and the wheat cultivar showed almost similar patterns of N and P accumulation with maximum contents at late grain filling or at harvest. Plant N concentration was up to 60 g kg<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> during the seedling stage, decreased gradually with advancing growth stages, and was lowest at harvest. Nitrogen treatments significantly increased plant N and P contents. At heading stage, N treatments enhanced dry matter (24%–45%), N (35%–135%), and P (27%–45%) contents in plant components (<jats:italic>i.e.,</jats:italic> culm, leaf, and head), but also enhanced crop lodging, especially in oats. Both hulled and hulless oats had higher total plant N (5%–35%), N : P ratio, and dry‐matter content in leaf (6%–43%) and head (0%–129%) along with higher P (up to 27%) in culm than the wheat cultivar. The wheat cultivar accumulated greater dry matter and higher N content in kernels than both hulled and hulless oats at harvest. Both hulled and hulless oat cultivars exhibited similar lodging susceptibility to N addition (75 or 150 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>), produced lower dry weight and lower kernel N, and hence lower grain yield than the wheat cultivar. The larger vegetative dry‐matter accumulation at heading coupled with higher P content in culms under high‐N‐supply conditions may be related to severe lodging in oat cultivars.</jats:p>",

Identifying specific minerogenic and organic markers of autochthonous and allochthonous supply, data allow documenting past climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Over the past century, the lacustrine sediment of Lake Majeur has been essentially composed of algae, drastically contrasting with the natural sedimentary infill of the basin, mainly resulting from soil erosion from the mid–late Holocene. Since ad 1907, the Lake Majeur has been used for hydroelectricity production. Human-induced lake-level regulations, affecting up to 37% of the lacustrine surface, have increased by fourfold the accumulation rate of the lake and favoured water enrichment. Rubidium abundance within the lacustrine sediments of the two lakes reflects the mid–late Holocene palaeohydrology. After dam construction in ad 1907, greater quantities of rubidium found in Lake Majeur sedimentary infills indicate drier climatic periods, such as from ad 1975 to ad 1982, during which water reservoirs were particularly in demand. Inversely, before the dam was built, rubidium fluctuations were correlated with wetter conditions and hydrological events were recorded as sandy layers deposited by canyon reactivation, synchronous with European climatic deterioration phases. We notably document that the Mediaeval Climate Anomaly was interrupted by some humid periods dated c. ad 940, ad 1080, ad 1100 and ad 1250. We also date the onset of the ‘Little Ice Age’ c. ad 1360 and identify that this period was wetter after c. ad 1500. </jats:p>",

As Table 4 indicates, by 1984-85 almost all the main crops had recovered pre-revolutionary levels and in many cases (such as coffee, sugar, rice and agriculture) considerably surpassed them. The three products that failed to recover were cotton, beef and milk, the first because of poor world prices and high costs, the latter two because of the indiscriminate slaughter during the 1978-79 insurrection which would take ten years to replace. However, supply was very badly affected by the war from 1983 onwards, particularly coffee, maize and beans (produced in the war zones) while the foreign exchange shortages also affected the output of import-dependent crops such as sugar and cotton. The general lack of 'business confidence', logical under the circumstances, also had a negative effect. The main achievement, therefore, was to maintain a reasonable level of production at all."

        "demand for producer goods (that is, implements, fertilisers, etc.) was largely left unsatisfied, a fact which eroded the peasants' productive basis. The exchange with the peasantry became conditioned by the following three interlocking phenomena: (1) the reduction in relative and in absolute terms of official marketing of crops as result of the rapid expansion of parallel markets; (2) the galloping inflation of prices in the parallel markets; and (3) the consequent rapid depreciation of the currency and the increased reluctance to accept the metical in exchange for sale of goods. Although the surface appearances of these phenomena were generally recog-nised, the explanation of the underlying mechanisms was by no means clear. The dominant explanation of the problem came from the ministry of internal commerce which was in its day-to-day operation more directly con-fronted with the problem. According to this view the nature of the problem was the withdrawal from the market by the peasantry since money no longer bought goods. Hence, the payment of rural wages and the buying of cash crops channelled a volume of money into the economy far in excess of available pro-ducer and consumer goods directed to the peasantry. Cash balances therefore accumulated over time and the stimulus to further production was blunted. The fact that the supply of commodities destined to be traded with the peasantry was, in terms of value, far in excess of the official marketing of crops was the often quoted proof that peasants simply ran down cash balances to buy goods and did not produce more for exchange. This view often overlooked the impact of the demand springing from the wage bill and, hence, directly equated the difference between the supply of goods to the peasantry and the goods obtained in return with the running down of cash balances accumulated by the peasantry. The problem therefore was seen as one of an excessive volume of money being held in the rural areas: peasants had too much money relative to the available supply of goods. Therefore, they withdrew from the market and preferred to buy up any supplies forthcoming with the money in hand rather than through production. Implicit in this view was a conception of a single circuit of exchange between the state sector and the peasantry in which the state buys with money either cash crops or labour power, and subsequently the peasantry buys consumer and producer commodities from the state sector (with or without the intermediation of private trade). If both parts do not balance in value, idle balances of money will build up in the hands of the peasantry and over time blunt the incentive of production. The preoccupation was thus with the stock of money in the hands of the peasantry (as a measure of frustrated demand) and little attention was paid to its velocity since it was implicitly assumed that these balances remained idle (stuck in the peasants' pockets). Therefore, concerning economic policy, a solution was sought in the direction of neutralising the interference of accumulated balances by linking sale and purchase together. Hence, commodities would be sold to the peasantry only in exchange for the purchase of cash crops. Similarly, state farms would guarantee a certain part of the wage in kind to assure the flow of labour."

        "subsistence production (where in the colonial period mainly extra-economic factors such as forced cultivation or forced labour caused the integration of the peasantry in the market exchange). Socialist development was there-fore strongly identified with modernising through the rapid expansion of the state sector, that is, nationalisation and mechanisation on an ever-increasing scale. The peasantry would be gradually absorbed within this expanding sector, and hence, at first, the role of the peasantry was seen as essentially passive with its transformation mainly centring on social aspects. As such, the policy of communal villages became virtually a habitational concept (and was in actual fact the responsibility of the national directorate of housing): a question of social infrastructures (water supplies, schools, etc.) within a concept of communal life without concerning production and its transformation. This view conflicted heavily with the objective conditions in the rural areas characterised by a deep involvement of the peasantry in market relationships and their dependence on it either as suppliers of labour power or as cash crop producers. This contradiction became more obvious, when the balance of payments became a real constraint (in 1979) and, hence, the question of financing accumulation cropped up more strongly in practice. The peasantry as suppliers of cash crops, of food and of labour power to the state sectors occupied a crucial position in production and accumulation. However, the crucial question then becomes whether the peasantry only performs the role of supplying part of the accumulation fund or whether the peasantry itself is part and parcel of the process of transformation and hence that accumulation embraces as an integral part the transformation of peasant agriculture into more socialised forms of production. In other words, it poses the question whether the strategy is based on a primitive socialist accumulation on the basis of the peasantry (transferring the agrarian surplus to the develop-ment of the state sector), or whether accumulation includes the transformation of peasant agriculture. Clearly, the way this question is posed in practice will influence heavily the nature of the organisation of the exchange between the state sector and the peasantry. The proposition that the state sector can develop under its own steam (with or without the aid of external borrowing) cannot bypass this crucial question since, on the one hand, a considerable part of foreign exchange earnings and of the food supply to the towns depended on peasant production and, on the other, the very conditions of productivity and profitability in the agrarian state sector depended heavily on the organic link that existed.between labour supply and family agriculture. The monetary disequilibrium originating from the state sector has a severe impact on the organisation of the exchange between the state sector and the peasantry. First, the imbalance between the demand for and the supply of consumer commodities affected rural areas differently from urban areas. The reason was that in urban areas the rationing system guaranteed to each family a minimum quantity of basic consumer necessities at official prices. In the rural areas the principal form of rationing remained the queue! Hence, forced savings were distributed differently over urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the concentration of resources on the state sector also implied that the peasants'"

        "scattered peasant holdings. This programme has made some headway, especial-ly in Bale, where it is anticipated that the entire rural population will soon inhabit specially set-up settlements. This will permit not only the state service and delivery systems to incorporate this population into their network but, as importantly, will provide some necessary preconditions for the emergence of collective units which can internalise the wide range of production and social externalities not reaped by individual peasants. With regard to the wider strategic issues concerning regional disparities, it has to be admitted that any headlong or dramatic attempt to 'solve' this historical problem is likely to prove an expensive failure. However, the policy framework developed in this article has inherent in it processes which would diminish the disparities through development at the periphery. Thus, in view of a high degree of economic fragmentation, a special if not overriding priority would have to be assigned to rural infrastructure based on four complimentary activities. First, through labour accumulation facilitated by the co-operative structure, rural roads should be developed linking co-operatives to feeder roads, and these to the main gravel highways. Second, local storage capacity for foodgrains should be constructed at critical supply points, widely dispersed. Over a period, these silos should begin to serve as the grain banks of the co-operatives of the region. Third, local rural industries located at the service-co-operative level should be initiated, at first on the basis of the demand of the members for simple consumer goods and farm implements, and subsequently for a wider range of products, including industrial ancillaries, and consumer goods for a wider market. Such industries, as also the infrastructural creation activities could have a strong seasonal dimension in the present phase of development. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, concerted efforts should be made to harness the considerable small-scale irrigation potential of the country, but again through the institutional device of the producers' or service co-operatives. The great advantage of the former would be that such activities would be self-financed, and would be non-inflationary in the short run, and strongly anti-inflationary in the long run when their benefits come on stream. The objective should be through such schemes to integrate the economy, to develop rural diversification, and to provide food security. The key to achieving these is the extension of the area of stable grain yields through irrigation. Once again, the objectives of growth and equity appear to be harmonious within a 'boot-strap' strategy of local, self-financed, labour accumulation generated and organised within the emergent rural collective institutions. But critical to the success of these measures is the rapid expansion of the co-operative mode of organisation. In this respect, the experience thus far is extremely disappointing [Ghose, this volume]."

        "Initially, mine workers would be rather reluctant to invest their wages in means of production (in agriculture and in transport) within the Mozambican rural economy. Up to 1980/81, government policies were not favourable to such investments. However, thereafter, miners were specifically encouraged to plough back their wages into production and commerce. Rural unemployment was widespread and, hence, the conditions for private accumulation were favourable on this count. Generally, miners would invest in transport and commerce, but some did invest in agriculture. Indeed, in the latter years, peasants with resources were allowed to operate on unutilised ex-settler farms. In other cases, the more permanent and better paid state farm workers could use their specific position to strengthen their own farm, often supplemented by hired labour. As mechanics or tractor drivers, etc. they had access to cer-tain resources such as seeds, fertiliser, fuel and consumer goods which they could buy either from the state farm or, not unfrequently, merely take from stocks on the state farms. Border areas were another such case of differentiated access to resources by means of barter trade cross the border. Due to the political criticality of such areas within a general condition of war, the government distribution policy would grant a certain priority to supplying these areas with commodities which would then provide a basis for further barter trade with the neighbouring country. Further, areas located more closely to the main food markets (either towns or plantations) would be subject to a much more dispersed and intensive barter and money trade, thereby raising the producer prices which would benefit those peasants who had sufficient resources to produce surpluses. More distant food producing areas were much more within the grip of the commercial traders who provided the link with the market. Hence, while some strata within the peasantry managed to create some room for themselves by producing for the parallel markets, the majority of rural producers (either as wage labourers or small-scale producers) confronted declining real incomes as a result of the inflation on the parallel markets to which they had to turn not only for industrial commodities but also to supplement their food needs. Hence, their problem was not one of having too much money at hand with too few commodities to buy; rather, they experi-enced an acute shortage of both money and goods. The poorer peasantry were the main suppliers of seasonal labour to the state sector. However, although rural unemployment was high, the supply of labour was by no means elastic. The reasons for this were the following. First, the pattern of labour demand of the state farms and plantations was in most cases highly seasonal and, hence, did not provide an all-round income for the worker. Second, money wages earned on the state farm did not guarantee any access to commodities, and often did so only at speculative prices. For both reasons, the real basis of security of the rural worker still remained his family farm, however fragile that may have been. The state sector may have become dominant in terms of area and in terms of production (regarding monetary output), but it certainly was not the dominant aspect in securing the livelihood of rural producers. In most cases, the pattern of peak demand for labour on the state farms coincided with the peak demand for labour in family agriculture. For example,"

        "in the Limpopo valley harvest labour was needed for rice production at the agro-industrial complexes at the same time that the peasants needed to harvest their own plots. The colonial settlers had relied on force and on the use of task work to cope with this. Hence, the peasants would start very early in the morning to harvest a designated area at the settler farms and subsequently move on to their family plots. The wage would supplement the income and subsistence acquired from the family plot. However, when the state farms tried to introduce an eight-hour working day (instead of task work), they experi-enced an immense withdrawal of labour when it was most needed. The wage did not cover the consumption needs of a family throughout the year and, increasingly, money did not guarantee access to goods or did so only at the cost of accepting catastrophic reduction in the real wage. Similar shortage problems of labour were experienced in the plantation sectors, in food pro-duction in state complexes of Angonia or Zambezia, on cotton farms in the north, etc. The co-operative movement, which was never very strong since it had never received the effective material backing of the state, was further weakened by the fact that the development of parallel markets within the rural economy enfeebled the poorer peasantry even further. The latter would have to be the social force to be mobilised behind the co-operative movement; rather, it became economically weakened as a result of its rapidly deteriorating real incomes and the fact that the existing co-operative movement provided no real alternative. The government policy to link up purchase with sale so as to stimulate rural production did nothing to counteract this process of differen-tiation but, rather, tended to intensify it. Indeed, rural trade between the state and the peasantry was intermediated by private trade. The policy gave them an increased leverage over the peasantry and allowed them to channel more crops into the parallel markets since they effectively traded at terms of exchange which were less favourable than those laid down officially. Furthermore, the impact was that the supply of com-modities became concentrated in the hands of the richer peasantry (who had surpluses to sell) and this gave them leverage over the poorer peasantry. Finally, this process did not take place within conditions of peace but, rather, within an ever-spreading war situation. The South African-backed MNR was gradually spreading throughout the whole country and its acts of brutal oppression of the population and of sabotage and destruction of the whole network of social and economic infrastructure led to the increased destabilisation of the economy and society. To combat this force, a strong alliance between the army and the peasantry was necessary. But this alliance itself became weakened by the worsening of the economic situation of the peasantry. Economic investment was concentrated in bis projects within the state sector and these became the target of MNR attacks. On the other hand, the destabilis-ing effect of the concentration of resources on the state sector and of off-loading the burden of the costs on to the peasantry through the inflationary issue of money, unbacked by material resources, weakened the peasantry economically and intensified processes of differentiation. At the time of the preparation for the Fourth Congress it was not surprising"

        "levels which normally oscillated between 80,000 and 100,000 per year, and which in 1975 had soared up to 118,000 workers, were sharply reduced to 40,000 thereafter [First, 1982]. This mainly affected the southern part of Mozambique by creating massive rural unemployment. The towns had no capacity to absorb this surplus labour since employment was drastically re-duced in the towns as well. The latter process was due to the fall in employ-ment in domestic work (servants) and in the tourist sector (restaurants, hotels, bars, etc.). The exodus of Portuguese settlers and the virtual standstill of tourism (which catered for South Africans and Rhodesians) had amplified the problem of structural employment in the towns. The rural unemployed could not merely fall back on family agriculture since this was heavily dependent on cash income from wage work. Oxen and ploughs, farm implements, water reserves, etc. were normally paid for with wages from mine labour or other wage work. Furthermore, due to this cash inflow from wage income, a more interactive type of division of labour developed within the rural areas of southern Mozambique. Hence, peasants without oxen and plough would rent the services of peasants who did, and pay for it out of wage income. Brick-makers, carpenters, house-builders, tailors, mechanics were to be found among the middle peasantry who relied on these activities (usually acquired through mine labour) to supplement their income from farming. In a similar fashion, local transport and petty com-merce were sidelines of middle peasants stabilised by the influx of wage income. The reduction in mine labour employment deeply affected the viability of this internal division of labour within the rural economy. Finally, the impact of the reduction in mine labour was not evenly spread among the peasantry, since only those who held valid work certificates from the recruitment agency could continue to go to the mines. Other peasants were cut off altogether. This introduced a sharp element of differentiation within the rural econonmy. Those who could continued to go to the mines not only had cash income but also a guaranteed access to commodities (including means of production), while within Mozambique shortages were rapidly turning into a goods famine. However, rural unemployment was not merely a phenomena of the south. In central Mozambique, wage work to Rhodesia dropped sharply with the closure of the border between Mozambique and Rhodesia since 1976, and as a result of the war situation which developed thereafter. As stated in above, the concentration of resources on the state sector further weakened the basis of family agriculture at a time when a considerable part of its cash income through wage labour was cut off. While the colonial situ-ation was characterised by persistent labour shortages within the rural economy and continued state intervention to keep labour cheap (through the imposition of forced labour and forced cultivation of crops as well as by fragmentation of labour markets to avoid competition for labour to drive up the wage levels), the post-independence situation became characterised by rural unemployment and an intensified flow of people from the rural areas to the towns in search of wage work. The priority accorded to investments led to the slow expansion in the supply of consumer goods and in 1981 it actually fell by eight per cent: six per cent"
