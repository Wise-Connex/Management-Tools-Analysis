However, our knowledge of what influences SCI is still very limited. Although marketing and management researchers have investigated power and relationship commitment issues between organizations, few have examined their impact on SCI. This paper extends the power–relationship commitment theory established in Western marketing literature and links it with SCI in China, through examining the relationship between power, relationship commitment and the integration between manufacturers and their customers. We propose and empirically test a model using data collected from 617 manufacturing companies in China. The results show that different types of customer power impact manufacturers’ relationship commitment in different ways. Expert power, referent power and reward power are important in improving manufacturers’ normative relationship commitment, while reward power and coercive power enhance instrumental relationship commitment. We also found that normative relationship commitment had a greater impact on customer integration than instrumental relationship commitment. These findings are interpreted in light of national culture differences between China and the U.S. in terms of power distance and collectivism, which provide a new perspective on SCI.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

However, many companies are found to have placed most of their emphasis on connectivity, often overlooking the willingness construct. As a result, information sharing seldom delivers on its promise to enable the creation of the cohesive supply chain team.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations</jats:title><jats:p>Despite the extensive data collection, the research represents a snapshot of practice.

Urquhart, who established the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL) which later was merged into the British Library Lending Division (BLLD), now called the British Library Document Supply Centre (BLDSC). His significance will be considered from the perspective of the development of science as a whole as well as library and information science in particular.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The paper presents a short history of the probabilistic revolution, particularly as it developed in Britain in the form of biometric statistics due to Darwin's theory of evolution. It focuses on the overthrow of the normal paradigm, according to which frequency distributions in nature and society conform to the normal law of error. The paper discusses the importance of the Poisson distribution and its utilization in the construction of stochastic models that better describe reality. Here the focus is on the compound Poisson distribution in the form of the negative binomial distribution (NBD). The paper then shows how Urquhart extended the probabilistic revolution to librarianship by using the Poisson as the probabilistic model in his analyses of the 1956 external loans made by the Science Museum Library (SML) as well as in his management of the scientific and technical (sci/tech) journal collection of the NLL. Due to this, Urquhart can be considered as playing a pivotal role in the creation of bibliometrics or the statistical bases of modern library and information science. The paper relates how Urquhart's son and daughter‐in‐law, John A. and Norma C. Urquhart, completed Urquhart's probabilistic breakthrough by advancing for the first time the NBD as the model for library use in a study done at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, connecting bibliometrics with biometrics. It concludes with a discussion of Urquhart's Law and its probabilistic implications for the use of sci/tech journals in a library system.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>By being the first librarian to apply probability to the analysis of sci/tech journal use, Urquhart was instrumental in the creation of modern library and information science.

During the past decade, the industry has made remarkable progress on multiple fronts. This is particularly true with regard to quality—10 firms in this industry have won the coveted Deming prize during the past six years. Surprisingly, we first observe that the financial performance of the firms that won the Deming prize (i.e., Deming firms) shows no definitive differences from the performance in the rest of the industry. We then analyze the productivity growth at the firm level across two five-year intervals using a total-factor productivity model. Our results suggest that productivity improved much more during the second period, which is the interval in which most of the firms won the Deming prize. We also analyze the impact of winning the award on profitability and suggest that new firms were able to grow faster in the improving business environment. To “externally” validate our findings, we compare the auto sector in India with that in China. Despite a 10-year disadvantage because of costs that are beyond the control of the firm, the auto sector in India seems to be competitive with that sector in China on all firm-specific factors. In summary, we suggest that firms in this sector have taken the first step by becoming competitive in the areas of cost and quality. We suggest that they are now at a crossroads and must make several choices to leverage these quality gains into a profitable, global supply chain strategy. </jats:p>",

Rehabilitation, in conjunction with the availability of replacement coagulation factor products, has revolutionized approaches to the management of patients with haemophilia in developed countries and has led to a substantial decrease in both the morbidity and mortality rates among the haemophilic population. Modern treatment approaches have also enabled persons with haemophilia to participate in sporting activities along with their peers; however, these improvements in care have not been achieved in developing nations, where health‐care resources and facilities are scarce and the supply of coagulation factor products is limited. This article attempts to address the following questions about the management of haemophilic patients in developing countries: Can physiotherapy, rehabilitation and sports prevent disabilities and preserve independence? Is participation in sports activities possible in developing countries? Do countries differ with regard to guidelines for participation in sports? Should we be encouraging participation in sports or allowing patients with haemophilia to do as they choose?</jats:p>",

As a result, the total economic losses caused by infrastructure damage may be much higher than the value of damage to infrastructure itself. In this paper, we consider the estimation of economic impacts on businesses and residential consumers resulting from water supply disruption. The methodology we present for estimating business interruption losses assumes that marginal losses are increasing in the severity of disruption and that there may be a critical water availability cutoff below which business activity ceases. To estimate residential losses from water supply interruption, we integrate consumers' demand curves, calibrated to water agency price and quantity data. Our methodologies are spatially disaggregated and explicitly account for the time profile of infrastructure repair and restoration. As an illustration, we estimate the economic losses to business and residential water users of one of the major water supply systems of the San Francisco Bay Area of California resulting from two potential earthquake scenarios, a magnitude 7.9 event on the San Andreas Fault and a magnitude 7.1 event on the Hayward Fault. For the business loss estimation, our modeling framework is general enough to calculate and compare losses using loss functions from several previous studies. Estimated business and residential losses for the San Andreas event are $14.4 billion and $279 million, respectively. For the Hayward event, estimated business and residential losses are $9.3 billion and $37 million, respectively.</jats:p>",

A total of 6667 landslides were confirmed in the period from 1965 to 2000 on the basis of seven temporal pairs of aerial photographs. Both the occurrence of landslides and discharge into the dam lake affect sediment yield, indicating that fluvial systems in Miyagawa Dam catchment are supply limited with respect to sediment. Sediment yields are affected by not only the initial failed volume of landslides but also the mobility of landslides and debris flows. In Miyagawa Dam catchment, percentages of landslides reaching channels varied from 56% in 1997–2000 to 75% in 1976–1981 and were correlated with maximum hourly rainfall. In addition, the mobility of debris flows was higher during periods with high maximum instantaneous discharge compared to lower discharge, suggesting that the water content both in initially failed materials and transported sediment controlled their mobility. Topography also affected the mobility of landslides/debris flows. For catchments &gt;0.1 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, the percentage of channel network length impacted by debris flows decreased with increasing catchment area due to reduced channel gradient. Thus both the magnitude of rainfall‐runoff events and the catchment topography affect how landslide sediment contributes to sediment yield at the large catchment scale.</jats:p>",

However, new demands on the supply‐chain system require changes to information flow and exchange. We undertake a case study of three automotive supply chains that face such new demands resulting from the introduction of an order‐driven supply‐chain strategy. We use our case study findings to evaluate the applicability of three different theoretical lenses on the multi‐faceted interactions between information, physical flow, and the complex rationales driving supply‐chain evolution: the resource‐based view (RBV), the concept of complex adaptive systems (CAS), and adaptive structuration theory (AST). We find that each theory has a separate realm of applicability and while complimentary in nature, provides distinct insight on the structural shift in the supply‐chain system. More specifically, we find that AST, a theory prominent in the social sciences, provides novel insights to supply‐chain research at the firm level, particularly with respect to the difficulties in using IT systems to drive systemic change. It complements both the system‐level perspective offered by the complex adaptive systems theory, as well as the concept of dynamic capabilities originating in the resourced‐based view. The paper concludes with wider implications for future research in supply and value chain management.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

With a price-only contract, a buyer and a seller agree only on a constant transaction price, without specifying the amount that will be transferred. It is well known that these contracts do not provide incentives to the parties to coordinate their inventory/capacity decisions. We measure efficiency with the price of anarchy (PoA), defined as the largest ratio of profits between the integrated supply chain (that is, fully coordinated) and the decentralized supply chain. We characterize the efficiency of various supply chain configurations: push or pull inventory positioning, two or more stages, serial or assembly systems, single or multiple competing suppliers, and single or multiple competing retailers. </jats:p>",

The important factors in developing more sustainable supply chains are identified as the type of supply chain involved and the individual business attitude to extending responsibility for product quality into social and environmental performance within their own supply chains. Interpersonal trust and working to standards are both important to build more sustainable local and many conserved food supply chains, but inadequate to transform mainstream agriculture and raw material supplies to the manufactured and commodity food markets. Cooperation among food manufacturers, retailers, NGOs, governmental and farmers’ organizations is vital in order to raise standards for some supply chains and to enable farmers to adopt more sustainable agricultural practices.</jats:p>",

It argues that investment protection law could contribute to the realisation of this potential synergy. Therefore, strong but appropriate investment protection clauses should be integrated in the relevant climate regulations at international, European and national levels. In the absence of such regulatory intervention, some reflections are presented on the interpretation and application of the existing investment provisions. On the one hand, the legitimacy of constraining carbon policies is examined in light of expropriation claims of carbon-intensive investors. On the other hand, attention is paid to the acute debate on the stability of support schemes for alternative modes of electricity production.</jats:p>",

Pollen supply in colonies is closely tied to this phenomenon; winter bees sequester large reservoirs of pollen-derived nutrients in their bodies and the brood-rearing capacity of colonies is dictated by the availability of pollen. We determined the effects of manipulating pollen supply during the fall on the number of winter bees present in colonies by spring, their mass and protein content before and after winter, and their capacity to rear brood during the spring. Colonies were either supplemented with or partially deprived of pollen during the fall, while a third group of colonies was not manipulated (control). We found that the performance of winter bees was not enhanced by supplementing colonies with pollen in the fall, nor did worker function suffer if pollen supply was restricted. Similar numbers of winter bees survived to spring in colonies and workers had similar physiology and brood-rearing efficiencies. These results suggest that beekeepers would not benefit by investing in fall pollen supplements to maximize colony growth in early spring.</jats:p>",

The study zones selected in four Indian cities—Ghaziabad, Jaipur, Nagpur, and Panaji—were typical residential areas with metered water supply and were readily amenable to hydraulic isolation from the rest of the area. The study areas included Lohia Nagar in Ghaziabad, Army Welfare Housing Officer's Colony in Jaipur, Shankar Nagar in Nagpur, and Mala Area in Panaji. Preparatory work in the study zones included updating water distribution network plans; installing valves and bulk meters wherever necessary to hydraulically isolate the zone from the rest of the area; and surveying homes to check for stopcocks and water meters and to collect information on household populations and consumers' opinions regarding water supply service. Both water supply modes were studied to collect data on per capita water consumption, pressures at various points in the distribution network, flow rate and variation and total flow into the network, nonrevenue water, water quality, and relevant information for engineering and socioeconomic analysis of the distribution network. Continuous water supply has certain advantages over intermittent water supply. There was an appreciable improvement in nodal pressures and flow patterns in the distribution networks and a decrease in peak factors. Also, microbial quality of the water improved considerably at the consumers' end. However, water consumption and nonrevenue water increased when the mode of supply was switched over from intermittent to continuous, which points to the need for preventive maintenance of distribution systems and proper metering at the consumers' end.</jats:p>",

It differs from traditional supply chain contract models in two ways. First, while traditional supply chain models are based on risk neutrality, this article takes the viewpoint of behavioral principal–agency theory and assumes the manufacturer is risk neutral and the retailer is loss averse. Second, while gain/loss (GL) sharing is common in practice, there is a lack of analysis of GL‐sharing contracts in the supply chain contract literature. This article investigates the role of a GL‐sharing provision for mitigating the loss‐aversion effect, which drives down the retailer order quantity and total supply chain profit. We analyze contracts that include GL‐sharing‐and‐buyback (GLB) credit provisions as well as the special cases of GL contracts and buyback contracts. Our analytical and numerical results lend insight into how a manufacturer can design a contract to improve total supply chain, manufacturer, and retailer performance. In particular, we show that there exists a special class of distribution‐free GLB contracts that can coordinate the supply chain and arbitrarily allocate the expected supply chain profit between the manufacturer and retailer; in contrast with other contracts, the parameter values for contracts in this class do not depend on the probability distribution of market demand. This feature is meaningful in practice because (i) the probability distribution of demand faced by a retailer is typically unknown by the manufacturer and (ii) a manufacturer can offer the same contract to multiple noncompeting retailers that differ by demand distribution and still coordinate the supply chains.</jats:p>",

We estimate an inverse hyperbolic sine Tobit model allowing for heteroscedasticity and non-normality of errors. The hypotheses of the rotation model can be examined by decomposing the effects of the exogenous variables into the effects on the conditional mean of nonzero harvests and the effects on the probability of nonzero harvest. The results of the study are consistent with the Faustmann rotation model when the forest owner simultaneously decides both the optimal rotation age of an even-aged stand and the optimal life-cycle consumption of goods and services with in situ valuation of standing timber.</jats:p>",

However, analysis of a detailed 9‐year time‐series of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and discharge <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> of the Meuse River in The Netherlands indicates that SSC is (besides discharge) controlled by exhaustion and replenishment of different sediment sources. Clockwise hysteresis and other effects of sediment exhaustion can be observed during and after flood events, and the effects of stockpiling of sediment in the river bed during low‐discharge periods are obvious in the SSC of the next flood. In a single regression equation we have implemented a parameter that represents the presence or absence of stock for sediment uptake. In comparison with a rating curve of SSC and <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic>, adding this parameter is shown to be a more reliable and comprehensive method to predict SSCs at all discharge regimes with all preceding discharge conditions, for single‐peaked and multi‐peaked runoff events as well as for low flow conditions. The method is probably applicable to other small‐ to medium‐scaled river basins. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The elemental composition and stoichiometry of aquatic plants has often been suggested to reflect the nutrient enrichment of aquatic habitats. However, the relationship is often weak. Moreover, uncertainties remain in the relevance of laboratory derived critical plant tissue nutrient concentrations to maximum yield or growth rates in the field.</jats:p><jats:p>2. Aquatic vascular plants and bryophytes, overlying water and sediment samples were collected to test whether freshwater aquatic macrophytes: (i) show tissue nutrient deficiencies when growing in oligotrophic freshwater habitats, and (ii) have strict homeostatic stoichiometry.</jats:p><jats:p>3. Plant nutrient concentrations were significantly related to total inorganic nitrogen (or nitrate), total dissolved phosphorus and sediment total phosphorus. However, these relationships were weak. Virtually all the variance in plant tissue nutrient concentrations, however, could be explained by species (taxon) identity.</jats:p><jats:p>4. Critical tissue nutrient concentrations for 95% maximum yield or 95% maximum growth rate in aquatic angiosperms, determined from laboratory bioassays, suggested that nutrients should not limit yield in wild aquatic macrophytes. However, there were a substantial number of samples where potential growth rate limitation was possible, particularly due to phosphorus.</jats:p><jats:p>5. Strict C : N : P stoichiometric ratios were found for both vascular plants and bryophytes, suggesting little scope for plants as indicators of nutrient enrichment, but provide robust stoichiometric data for studies on ecosystem metabolism and nutrient cycling.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a lean supply chain case study that was initiated and completed through university–industry collaboration in an effort to expose students and professionals to a real-life lean implementation experience.

The EWSS concept opens the way for a sustainable water  environment and the restoration of cities while maintaining cultural beauty  and safety for the benefit of future generations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Mycobacterium avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>paratuberculosis</jats:italic>, the etiological agent of paratuberculosis, affects a wide range of domestic ruminants and has been suggested to be involved in Crohn's disease in humans. Most available methods for identifying and differentiating strains of this difficult species are technically demanding and have limited discriminatory power. Here, we report the identification of novel PCR-based typing markers consisting of variable-number tandem repeats (VNTRs) of genetic elements called mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs). Eight markers were applied to 183<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>paratuberculosis</jats:italic>isolates from bovine, caprine, ovine, cervine, leporine, and human origins from 10 different countries and to 82 human isolates of the closely related species<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>from France. Among the<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>paratuberculosis</jats:italic>isolates, 21 patterns were found by MIRU-VNTR typing, with a discriminatory index of 0.751. The predominant R01 IS<jats:italic>900</jats:italic>restriction fragment length polymorphism type, comprising 131 isolates, was divided into 15 MIRU-VNTR types. Among the 82<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>isolates, the eight MIRU-VNTR loci distinguished 30 types, none of which was shared by<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>paratuberculosis</jats:italic>isolates, resulting in a discriminatory index of 0.889. Our results suggest that MIRU-VNTR typing is a fast typing method that, in combination with other methods, might prove to be optimal for PCR-based molecular epidemiological studies of<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>paratuberculosis</jats:italic>pathogens. In addition, presumably identical<jats:italic>M. avium</jats:italic>subsp.<jats:italic>paratuberculosis</jats:italic>316F vaccine strains originating from the Weybridge laboratory and from different commercial batches from Mérial actually differed by one or both typing methods. These results indicate a substantial degree of genetic drift among different vaccine preparations, which has important implications for prophylactic approaches.</jats:p>",
