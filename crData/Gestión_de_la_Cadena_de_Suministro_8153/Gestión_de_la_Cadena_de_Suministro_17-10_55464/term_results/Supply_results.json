      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ambidexterity involves developing competencies to excel simultaneously on the exploration and exploitation dimensions. Few studies in literature discuss ambidexterity in a supply chain context. The research presented in this paper highlights issues that act as barriers and deserve attention in implementing ambidextrous supply chain strategy in SMEs. To develop a relationship structure existing among these variables, Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) technique is used. Further, variables' impact and dependency is calculated using Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC) approach. ISM algorithm proves to be a better tool as compared to a large-scale generic questionnaire based study due to its iterative nature that helps to bring forth issues that are difficult to identify otherwise. SMEs in India under tremendous pressure to excel on exploration and exploitation dimensions would be the major beneficiaries of this study. The hierarchy based structure and the classification of factors based on their impact and dependence, will enhance the understanding of SMEs mangers/owners to improve supply chain performance by eliminating barriers and thereby implementing ambidextrous strategy across the supply chain.</jats:p>",

As a result, different technologies of IT system have been emerged based on companies' business processes. Hence, managing the business process is crucial in SCM in which process modeling plays key role for analyzing and redesigning of process. Consequently, many methodologies in SCM have been developed to support the requirements for the modeling of SCP. However, they cannot cover the details of the business process in the lower level, i.e. the coordination of the SCP and their interaction, which can be addressed by service-oriented approach. Therefore, this paper aims at proposing a service-oriented methodology, which provides a new approach for supporting the business process architecture layers. The findings prove that the methodology narrows the gap between process analysts and information system developers, using the combination of modeling languages.</jats:p>",

In fact, the retailer has both incentive and opportunity to underreport the sales to reduce the sharing revenue to the supplier. What the supplier should do when meeting with the opportunistic retailer(s)? This paper studies a kind of opportunistic phenomenon in a supply chain in which a supplier sells to a retailer under a revenue-sharing contract. Two settings are discussed. The first one is that the retailer does not, or cannot underreport the sales to the supplier to share when the supplier design a strict auditing mechanism under which no lies allowed. The second one is that the retailer can underreport the sales to the supplier to share under another soft auditing mechanism. Due to the uncertainty of market demand, it is characterized by a fuzzy variable. Interestingly, we find that the supplier's profit is higher in the second setting than the one in the first setting. We hope that the conclusion drawn in the paper can provide a new viewpoint to help the supplier to solve the problem when meeting with an opportunistic retailer in a supply chain under a revenue-sharing contract in uncertain environments.</jats:p>",

They applied Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions to analyze upstream enterprises (breeding base) and downstream enterprises (corresponding supermarket) under the conditions of sufficient or insufficient funds, Further, they consider the relationships among revenue, optimum quality assurance and investment scale at different capital positions; discuss the best cooperation conditions in four cases; and draw conclusions on ways to control quality risk.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The proposed coordination model is found to be effective in controlling aquatic product quality risk. The simulation results show that when the enterprise funds are sufficient, the sales prices, product freshness, quality assurance ability, collaboration and quality test ability have a positive influence on quality assurance level, whereas coefficient and price sensitivity have a negative influence on it. Additionally, it can obtain high-quality assurance levels and earnings in both breeding bases and supermarkets under the condition of adequate investment.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The study built a coordination model combined with the characteristics of the aquatic supply chain by adding the quality penalty mechanism, product freshness parameters and cost function in the “farming-supermarket docking” mode into the traditional principal–agent model.

Yet, organisations in developing countries constitute a significant part of global supply chains and have also experienced the disastrous effects of supply chain failures. The purpose of this paper is therefore to empirically investigate SCRES in a developing country context and to show that this also provides theoretical insights into the nature of what is meant by resilience.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Using a case study approach, a supply network of 20 manufacturing firms in Uganda is analysed based on a total of 45 interviews.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The perceived threats to SCRES in this context are mainly small-scale, chronic disruptive events rather than discrete, large-scale catastrophic events typically emphasised in the literature. The data reveal how threats of disruption, resilience strategies and outcomes are inter-related in complex, coupled and non-linear ways. These interrelationships are explained by the political, cultural and territorial embeddedness of the supply network in a developing country. Further, this embeddedness contributes to the phenomenon of supply chain risk migration, whereby an attempt to mitigate one threat produces another threat and/or shifts the threat to another point in the supply network.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Managers should be aware, for example, of potential risk migration from one threat to another when crafting strategies to build SCRES. Equally, the potential for risk migration across the supply network means managers should look at the supply chain holistically because actors along the chain are so interconnected.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The paper goes beyond the extant literature by highlighting how SCRES is not only about responding to specific, isolated threats but about the continuous management of risk migration. It demonstrates that resilience requires both an understanding of the interconnectedness of threats, strategies and outcomes and an understanding of the embeddedness of the supply network. Finally, this study’s focus on the context of a developing country reveals that resilience should be equally concerned both with smaller in scale, chronic disruptions and with occasional, large-scale catastrophic events.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<p>Abstrak:Kesehatan masyarakat belum banyak dihubungkan dengan properti fisik lingkungan. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mencari hubungan antara data kesehatan masyarakat dengan data fisik infrastruktur dan kualitas sumber air dari IFLS dan data kualitas air tanah sebagai salah satu sumber air terbesar yang digunakan oleh masyrakat Indonesia, khususnya Bandung.Kami mengambil data kualitas air di sebanyak 70 titik sumur warga dengan kedalaman bervariasi antara 6 hingga 20 m. Konsentrasi tujuh ion utama dianalisis dengan tambahan pengukuran temperatur, TDS, dan pH di lapangan menggunakan peralatan jinjing yang ringan. Khusus di kawasan bantaran Sungai Cikapundung, kami melakukan identifikasi kandungan bakteriologi, dalam hal ini bakteri E coli. Kemudian di beberapa lokasi, kami dibantu mahasiswa S1, juga melakukan pengukuran berulang (time series) sebanyak empat kali dalam sehari, untuk melihat fluktuasi parameter temperatur, TDS, dan pH pada air sungai.Hasilnya cukup menarik, saat data IFLS dan data penderita diare di Puskesmas, menunjukkan adanya korelasi positif antara kualitas infrastruktur sumber air dengan jumlah penderita diare. Hal ini didukung dengan peningkatan kandungan E coli di air S. CIkapundung sebesar hampir 2 kali lipat antara kawasan hulu dengan kawasan hilir. Kondisi ini berimbas kepada air tanah, karena pada daerah selatan (dari Viaduct ke Dayeuhkolot), air sungai meresap ke dalam akuifer. Dari sini, kami berpendapat bahwa akan terjadi interaksi yang sangat intensif antara air sumur warga di sekitar sungai (khususnya yang menggunakan pompa) dengan air sungai.Untuk meningkatkan kontribusi kepada ITB dan Kota Bandung pada umumnya, kami mengusulkan adanya portal data hidrologi yang dikelola bersama antara Pemkot Bandung dan ITB agar data didapatkan secara rutin dan dapat dianalisis kapanpun. Hal ini kami usulkan karena seringkali analisis tidak dapat dilakukan secara instan, karena perlu diawali dengan tahapan mencari data.Selain itu, riset ini juga menambah contoh riset terbuka kepada para dosen/peneliti dengan cara: membuat repositori data dan repositori riset yang terbuka (selain Simlitabmas yang masih tertutup), membuat artikel blog yang diperbarui mengikuti perkembangan riset, serta membudayakan konsep open access, yang mana seluruh luaran riset ini bebas untuk dibaca, digunakan/dianalisis ulang, dan dipadukan dengan hasil yang lain (free to read, reuse, remix), untuk berbagai keperluan pembaca.Abstract:Public health has not been connected closely to physical environment. This research looks for the connections between public health using sum of diarrhoea case in Bandung area (using kecamatan puskesmas data) with water quality, water source quality (especially groundwater quality) and sanitation system quality. As we know, groundwater is the main water supply in Indonesia.We took 70 samples from community and private dug wells with depth varied from six to 20 m underground. We measured field parameters using portable equipments: groundwater depth, temperature, TDS, pH, to support lab analysis on seven major ions. In the Cikapundung riverbank, the team had sampled bacteriology content, E coli. Next, at some points, we also brought some undergraduate and master students to measure temperature, TDS, and pH readings in the river water, four times a day for 5 months to see the fluctuation and daily, weekly, and monthly variations.The initial results is interesting, when IFLS data matches with data from puskesmas in the sum of diarrhoea case. We also note a possitive correlation between water supply infrastructure with the diarrhoea case. The concentration of E coli in the river stream increases nearly two times between upstream and downstream. This condition contributes to the groundwater quality given the close connection between both unconfined groundwater and surface water, especially in the southern part with losing stream type. We could expect an intensive mixing between dug wells in the riverbank with river water.To extend our contribution to ITB and Bandung, we also initiate a open data portal for hydrological records that can be managed both my ITB and Bandung government to provide a routine data collecting. We convince this step could solve data sharing problem between governmental unit with data users. We also need to showcase a model of open research implementation among researchers by providing open data repository, project blog, aside to only use close-system Simlitabmas portal. The blog project is the one that take the most of our interest with the increasing number of readers. This research shows another open access way to run a research program, where all of the research outputs are free to read, reuse, and remix by the readers.</p>"

Le déploiement effectif des choix stratégiques se heurte souvent à un manque de cohérence globale au sein de l’organisation alors qu’un partage de représentations et d’objectifs de performance est la condition indispensable pour atteindre une plus grande agilité organisationnelle.Supply Chain Management et performance de l’entreprise propose un modèle de pilotage de la performance au sein des entreprises fondé sur une approche supply chain. Ce modèle (VASC – Valeur Ajoutée Supply Chain) ambitionne une intégration plus importante et dynamique entre les dimensions opérationnelle et financière de la création de valeur de l’entreprise.Cet ouvrage s'adresse aux dirigeants, aux directeurs supply chain et financiers des entreprises et aux consultants.

The sustainability of these green alternatives depends on straw supply from farmers, yet little is known about their perceptions regarding such supply because of a lack of cooperation in the supply chain. To better understand farmers’ opinions on supplying straw, this study examined their trust in middlemen, perceptions regarding risk in straw supply, the possibility of reducing transaction costs, and their willingness to supply straw. Data were collected from 275 farmers in the national bioenergy industry area in Wangkui County, Northeast China. We investigated the theoretical and empirical connections between trust and risk perception, trust and the possibility of reducing transaction costs, and trust and willingness to supply straw. The results indicated that education, income, and trust factors explained farmers’ risk perceptions, the possibility that they will reduce transaction costs, and their willingness to supply straw. On the basis of the analysis, a model of the influence of trust on straw supply was established. The overall findings indicated that biomass power plants and middlemen must build trusting relationships with farmers to ensure sustainable biomass supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Energy efficiency represents a key resource for economic and social development, providing substantial benefits to different stakeholders, ranging from the entities which develop energy efficient measures to everyone in society. In addition to cost savings, multiple benefits can be achieved by supporting a better alignment between energy issues and strategic business priorities: e.g., improved competitiveness, profitability, quality, etc. Thus, energy efficiency can be a strategic advantage, not just a marginal issue, for companies. However, most firms, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), face many problems and, in some cases, hostility when trying to effectively implement energy efficiency actions. The most dominant barriers are the access to capital and the lack of awareness (especially in terms of life cycle cost effects). The supply chain viewpoint represents one of the main opportunities for overcoming those barriers and improving energy performance even for weaker companies. Since the current literature on energy efficiency and practical approaches to ensure energy efficiency mainly focus on energy performance on a single-firm basis, this paper aims to provide a systematic review of papers on the integration of energy efficiency in supply chain design and management published in academic journal, thereby defining potential research streams to close the gaps in the literature. A number of literature reviews have been published focusing on specific aspects of sustainable or on green supply chain management; however, to the best of our knowledge, no review has focused on the energy efficiency issue. Firstly, the present paper shows how considering energy consumption in supply chain management can contribute to more energy-efficient processes from a systemic point of view. Then, the review methodology used is defined and the sampled papers are analyzed and categorized based on the different approaches they propose. From these analyses, potential future research streams are outlined.</jats:p>"

From the few cows he owned at that time, he decided to sell milk to the local people residing in the nearby villages. A couple of years passed by but for Thangamuthu nothing went on well and was not able to make profits. At this despairing stage, the only hope was his 13 years old son Sathish Kumar.  Sathish Kumar was an eighth-grade schoolboy who had always observed his father’s business and the problem’s by his father faced in his business. Sathish decided to quit his school to support his father’s business. When he joined his father, Sathish thought of a different idea, “Instead of selling unprocessed milk avalue-addedmilkproduct will be more profitable!”– he thought and decided to manufacture ‘Panner’ - the first milk product that his business manufactured and sold it to a client in Bangalore. Gradually, he started to market the product in departmental stores in cities nearby under the brand name ‘Milky Mist’. Such was the beginning of the company, Milky Mist, that has seen a phenomenal growth and is ambitiously moving forward. Today, the company has evolved into a 290-crore turnover company producing about 1.7 lakh litres per day for its sale and consumption.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A supply chain consists of the flow of products and services from raw materials manufacturers, component and intermediate manufacturers, final product manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers. All are connected by transportation, storage activities, and integrated through information, planning, and integration activities. Many large firms are moving away from in-house Vertically Integrated structures to Supply Chain Management. Supply Chain are the planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing and procurement, conversion, and all logistics management activities. It also includes coordination with channel partners, which can be suppliers, intermediaries, third party service providers, and customers. Supply chain management is the design of seamless value added processes across organization boundaries to meet the real needs of the end customer. Failure to proactively design a SC results in poor coordination of effort, incompatible information systems, long cycle times, communication problems, customer service issues, excessive waste and environmental degradation, relatively high inventories for the level of customer service achieved, and lower the optimal profit. A process map is a graphic representation of the system and contains a sequence of steps that are performed to produce some desired output. The primary goal behind process mapping is to make complex systems visible. The logistics/supply chain design and technology decision is of great strategic importance to logistics, the firm as a whole, and the supply chain. A number of factors may suggest the need to design the logistics/supply chain. A formal, structured process for design and digital tools is preferable; the potential impacts on cost and service justify a significant effort toward following a sound process. Numerous factors including technology may affect the design of a logistics and supply chain and the location of specific facilities within the context of the network.</jats:p>"

Therefore, resilience thinking is needed in the future development of the city-region. To this end, the paper aims to make an analysis of recently completed asset-based local development strategies for Izmir city towards water resiliency. The methodology has two main steps. Firstly, by using spatial interaction analysis of peninsula and river basins, potential vulnerabilities and risks are indicated. Secondly, a stratified model of strategy evaluation is conducted by scrutinizing the existing layered approaches. Then, these models were applied to all strategic decisions including water resources and indicated a high level of consistency to achieve sustainable and resilient use of blue-green infrastructure in the future of Izmir's metropolitan area. Local assets, including water resources, are the backbone of future development of the Izmir city-region. Therefore, usage of local assets in a multi-level perspective of strategy development needs to be understood. The stratified model denotes that special emphasis should be given to different river basins in different levels. This study illustrates that synergy management is needed between different layers of local development strategies, in which the role of urban and rural households is of the utmost importance.</jats:p>",

However, with increased global environmental and social concerns, in recent years, green aspects have been incorporated in supply chain decisions. These expansions lead to new research areas about green or sustainable supply chain management that includes applying various green practices in order to reduce negative impact on the environment or providing sustainable development. The purpose of this study is to develop a multi-objective optimization model for determining network design of the green supply chains. In multi-objective frame of the proposed model, total profit maximization and environmental impact minimization objectives are considered in order to obtain best network configuration for economic and environmental performance of the green chain. The proposed model is validated with numerical experiments. Obtained results showed that the model can be used as a strategic decision tool in problems with multi and conflicting objectives.&#x0D;\nKeywords: green supply chain management, multi-objective modelling, network optimization.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Food security is increasingly influenced by multilateral trade systems and foreign trade policies implemented by national governments. Many of them are now concerned about the sustainability of food supply and the vulnerability of domestic food markets to price volatility, and seek to support domestic producers and protect themselves from increasing food imports. Such restrictions improve food self-sufficiency, but decrease food security. It is important to understand any changes that may have occurred in the food consumption pattern due to trade protectionism and to observe any nutritional implications of these changes. This paper employs the rational food security (RFS) assessment approach, which differentiates sources of food supply on the domestic market, assesses the influence of agricultural and trade frameworks on food consumption patterns, and complies consumption with the appropriate food intake threshold. In the case of Russia, the study demonstrates that the conventional consumption approach to self-sufficiency (FSCA) underestimates the food insecurity level by not accounting for nutrition factors. In addition, the gap between the FSCA and the RFS increases in times of protectionist trade policy and decreases when the agricultural and trade policy framework turns to liberalization. The paper concludes that trade protectionism challenges the sustainability of food supply by decreasing food availability and quality of food products, causes dietary changes, and threatens the food security of the country.</jats:p>"

This practice is critiqued as seeking to appeal to the financial interests implied by people's role as customers rather than to achieve behavioural change in householders. A policy analysis reveals that although not prominently evidenced by some water utilities, public engagement is key to long-term demand reduction. This paper presents a systematic review of the demand management literature, specifically outlining key theoretical considerations for public engagement in relation to reducing water demand and their translation into practice in utilities. The aim is to demonstrate the use of a framework for examining engagement in utilities. Findings show that demand management interventions need to exploit: (1) effective frames for messages, (2) the diversity of the public, and (3) communication mediums that facilitate feedback. These insights informed the development of the MAC (Message Actor Channel) model of communicative water practices further used in this study to review public engagement plans for household water efficiency in selected UK water utilities based on processes described in their 2014 water resources management plans. Findings will inform the next stages of a doctoral study that will assess utilities' field engagement of households to reduce water use.</jats:p>",

The biggest mangosteen production center in Indonesia is West Java Province that includes Purwakarta, Subang, Bogor, and Tasikmalaya contributing 90% of mangosteen production in West Java Province and 29% of national mangosteen production. The activities of mangosteen production in West Java Province have not been efficient yet, so the potential source of the fruit in West Java Province is not efficient enough to compete internationally.  In order to have competitive advantages, supply chain management in mangosteen business was initiated in Bogor district in 2007 which integrated processes from receiving raw material to selling finished products. Identification of key performance indicators is necessary to improve the performance of emerging mangosteen supply chain in Bogor district. Data and information were collected through surveys, participative discussions and a review of literature. The chain characteristics were mapped to describe the flow of product, funds and information. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy process was performed to identify key performance indicators of emerging mangosteen supply chain in Bogor District. The results of the analysis showed that the total supply chain cost, perfect order fulfillment, and order fulfillment cycle time were the most important key performance indicators in reducing risk of business process in emerging supply chain of mangosteen in Bogor District, West Java, Indonesia.</p>"

Companies therefore strive to implement effective and integrated sustainable supply chain management initiatives to improve their operational and economic performance while also minimizing unnecessary damage to the environment and maintaining their social reputation and images. The paper presents an easy-to-use decision-support approach based on multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies that aim to help companies develop effective models for timely decision-making involving sustainable supply chain management strategies. The proposed approach can be used by practitioners to ultimately build a comprehensive Analytic Network Process model that will adequately capture and reveal all the interrelationships and interdependency among the elements in the problem, which is often a very difficult task. To facilitate and simplify this complex process, we propose that hierarchical thinking be used first to structure the essences of the problem capturing only the major issues, and an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model be built. Users can learn from the modeling process and gain much insight into the problem. The AHP can then be extended to an Analytic Network Process (ANP) model so as to capture the relationships and interdependencies among the elements. Our approach can reduce the sustainable expertise, effort and information that are often needed to build an ANP model from scratch. We apply our approach to the evaluation of sustainable supply chain management strategies for the fashion industry. Three main dimensions of sustainability—environmental, economic and social—are considered. Based on the literature, we identified four alternative supply chain management strategies. It was found that the Reverse Logistics alternative appears to be the recommended solution by the AHP model. However, the Socially Leagile Supply Chain is recommended by the ANP model, thereby demonstrating the necessity and importance of considering interdependencies in the model.</jats:p>"

In this study, special attention is paid to the estimation of indicators of logistics service as by their own forces and due to outsourcing and assessing the elasticity of these indicators, for an example, in Sumy Engineering Works Ltd. As a result of the study, in case of their own delivery, logistics service level is higher than in case of logistics outsourcing. It may be related to the fact that in the first case, at the industrial enterprises, there is higher level of control over the process and the capacity for flexible and rapid response to various demands of consumers, which is very important for competitiveness. It was determined how the value of each individual index varies with the change in the supply control volume.</jats:p>",

Increasing anthropogenic disturbances are eroding coral community resilience, leading to declining reef ecosystem function and status globally. Successful reproduction and recruitment are essential for restoring coral populations but recruitment-limitation can constrain recovery. We supplied ~400,000 <jats:italic>Acropora tenuis</jats:italic> larvae in fine-mesh enclosures on each of four larval-enhancement plots, comprising natural reef substrata and ten settlement tiles, on degraded reef areas in the northwestern Philippines. Initial mean total settlement on tiles in larval-enhancement plots was high (255.3 ± 68.6), whereas no larvae settled in natural control plots. Recruit survivorship began stabilising after five months, with juveniles becoming visible by eye at nine months. After three years a mean of 2.3 m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> colonies survived within each larval-enhancement plot. Most colonies grew rapidly (16.1 ± 0.7 cm mean diameter) and spawned successfully at three years, thereby quickly re-establishing a breeding population. In contrast, natural recruitment failed to produce any new visible <jats:italic>A</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>tenuis</jats:italic> colonies. These results demonstrate that mass larval settlement can rapidly enhance recruitment and coral recovery on degraded reef areas, and provides an important option for active reef restoration where larval supply and recruitment success are limiting.</jats:p>"

Therefore necessity of agroclimatic resources reassessment arose.&#x0D;\nPurpose. Research of heat supply of vegetation period within the Northern grain-seeding territory of  Kazakhstan.&#x0D;\nMethods. Data of meteorological stations for period of 1981-2014 were used. Methods of statistic and climatologic processing of data were applied. The agroclimatic maps were drafted using ArcGIS 10.1 software.&#x0D;\nResults. The article describes a thermal regime, duration and heat supply of vegetation period within the territory of 4 northern oblasts of Kazakhstan. The territory of Northern Kazakhstan under study hascontinental climate. Average annual air temperature at the area under study increases from the North to the South from 1.8 °C to 5.3 °C. Average July air temperature at the area changes from 18.5 °C to 23.6 °C and average January air temperature – from minus 12.8 °C  to minus 17.4 °C. Duration of vegetation period for early spring crops constitutes 172-193 days, for late spring crops – 136-162 days and for warm weather crops – 89-124 days. Daily range of air temperature is 11.4-14.7 °C and that means rather high quality of grain. Sum of active temperatures exceeding 10 °C  increases  from the North to the South from 2100 °C to 3400 °C. Vegetation period is 90% provided by sum of active temperatures exceeding 10 °C within the range of 2000-2900 °C. Maps of heat supply and vegetation period duration were also drafted.&#x0D;\nConclusions. In the north of the territory under study thermal sources satisfy demands of soft and common sorts of wheat but are not enough for sunflower and maize, in the south they are enough for wheat, all sorts of sunflower and middle-late sorts of maize.</jats:p>"

A collimated beam setup was used to irradiate samples of MC-LR solutions prepared in Milli-Q® water. The impact of competing water compounds was tested using solutions containing dissolved organic carbon (DOC), alkalinity (NaHCO3), and chloride (NaCl). Results showed that MC-LR in pure water at typical concentrations found in cyanobacterial bloom waters (17 and 40 μg/L) could be reduced below detection limits (0.5 μg/L) within one minute of irradiation time by a UV dose less than 40 mJ/cm2. A solution with a much higher initial concentration of MC-LR (870 μg/L) did show a reduced degradation rate. The presence of competing compounds does appear to reduce observed MC-LR degradation rates with the greatest impact caused by DOC followed by alkalinity followed by chloride. MC-LR degradation appears to occur by both direct photolysis by 254 nm photons and by advanced oxidation by hydroxyl radicals generated from 185 nm photons. Vacuum UV has shown promising capability at reducing MC-LR concentration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In snow-fed inland river systems in the western United States, water supply depends upon timing, form, and amount of precipitation. In recent years, this region has experienced unprecedented drought conditions due to decreased snowpack, exacerbated by exceptionally warmer winter temperatures averaging 3–4 °C above normal. In the snow-fed Truckee-Carson River System, two sets of interviews were conducted as part of a larger collaborative modeling case study with local water managers to examine local adaptation to current drought conditions. A comparative analysis of these primary qualitative data, collected during the fourth and fifth consecutive years of continued warmer drought conditions, identifies shifts in adaptation strategies and emergent adaptation barriers. That is, under continuous exposure to climate stressors, managers shifted their adaptation focus from short-term efforts to manage water demand toward long-term efforts to enhance water supply. Managers described the need to: improve forecasts and scientific assessments of snowmelt timing, groundwater levels, and soil moisture content; increase flexibility of prior appropriation water allocation rules based on historical snowpack and streamflow timing; and foster collaboration and communication among water managers across the river system. While water scarcity and insufficient water delivery infrastructure remain significant impediments in this arid region, climate uncertainty emerged as a barrier surrounding adaptation to variable water supply. Existing prior appropriation based water institutions were also described as an adaptation barrier, meriting objective evaluation to assess how to best modify these historical institutions to support dynamic adaptation to climate-induced water supply variability. This study contributes to a growing body of research that assesses drought adaptation in snow-fed inland river systems, and contributes a unique report concerning how adaptation strategies and barriers encountered by local water managers change over time under continuous exposure to climate stressors. These locally identified adaptation strategies forward a larger collaborative modeling case study by informing alternative water management scenarios simulated through a suite of hydrologic and operations models tailored to this river system.</jats:p>"

Everyone can drink good quality water, the question is whether they have access to it in the first place. Water quality and its treatment depend on the water source. This treatment has costs that users have to pay in the water tariff. It is very important to establish a water tariff that permits the best water treatment and has a low impact on the users. Cost functions are a useful tool to predict costs before an implementation or improvement. This article, using three easy steps (analysis, obtaining costs and modification of the water tariff) proposes improving water purification treatment using cost functions in order to find the best solution for providing the best quality water with the least cost impact on the water tariff. This methodology aims to help supply managers justify their decisions in order to optimise the available economic resources.</jats:p>",

Several technologies are used nowadays to remove NOM from the water supply. The evolution of water-related directives, and progressively more restrictive standards for drinking water, however, call for the investigation of advanced, more efficient, and cost-effective water treatment processes. This paper contains a brief overview on the state-of-the-art methods for NOM removal from supply waters, and describes the experimental application of an advanced technology, tested and validated at the pilot scale on the water supply source of a town in Poland. The process allowed significant removal of natural organic matter (about 50% as Dissolved Organic Carbon) and turbidity (from 50% to 90%), however, these results requested significant additions of powdered activated carbon. The key to success of this type of process is a correct setup with the identification of optimal types and dosages of reagents. Based on the results of the tests conducted it is foreseeable that this technology could be used onsite, not only for removal of NOM, but also of other hard-to-tackle pollutants potentially contained in the freshwater supply and not presently considered.</jats:p>"

Such problem has been widely tackled by several publications, most of them employing traditional deterministic approaches such classical optimization or other heuristic methods, despite of the intrinsic stochastic components the area encompasses. Hence, this work analyzes the problem based on discrete-event dynamic simulation considering uncertainty present in offshore operations. The main results are organized in terms of lead time curves. Then a hypothetical case analysis is conducted, from which it is possible to have more robust fleet estimation, as well as an amplified comprehension on the impact of uncertainty in logistics and offshore operations.</jats:p>",

Based on the approaches of systems engineering, we propose the concept of supply chain engineering, which applies the idea of supply chain management to the engineering practices through the advanced information and management technology, to integrate the supply chain system and optimize its operations. We then illustrate the application of the supply chain engineering in China’s retailing industry. In such practices, we developed the virtual retailing enterprise mode and the FROM-SCM system, and designed the sales assistant etc. Such theory and practices are successfully applied in Meiyijia, which has transformed Meiyijia from a traditional retailer to a modern service enterprise, and the profits are resulted from the service fees rather than the traditional surplus between buying and selling prices. Now Meiyijia has built an ecosystem with the retailer in the core, the headquarter as the service platform. The success of Meiyijia in recent years shows the effectiveness of the supply chain engineering.</jats:p>",

Besides, the delay feedback control method is adopted to control the unstable or chaotic system effectively. The main conclusions of this paper show that the variables mentioned above must be within a reasonable range. Otherwise, the model will lose stability or enter chaos. The government can effectively adjust manufacturers' profit through carbon tax and carbon quota subsidy, and encourage manufacturers to reduce carbon emissions and increase the remanufacturing of waste products.</jats:p>"

The finding results reveal that, under the static reward and punishment strategy, the revolutionary process of trilateral game strategy is always unstable whether the initial behavior strategy is unitary or mixed.

The increasing number of producing wells, in addition to re-fractured wells, impose the need for optimizing field development strategies and shale gas supply chain networks that maximize profitability. Moreover, operators must account for undulating natural gas demands both locally and externally in a persistently low oil price environment. In this paper, we adopt supervised machine learning approaches to forecast local natural gas demand as well as guide well re-frac candidature. Both serve as critical inputs for maximizing the net present value of any shale gas field development project. An optimized water management structure is also incorporated in the proposed framework to account for associated produced-water recycling.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Considering a shale gas network in the Marcellus play, supply chain optimization was achieved using a mixed integer non-linear programming formulation. The Strategic Planning model relies on at least 4 major efforts including reservoir simulation, which in turn relies on output from a feed forward Neural Network (NN) algorithm. The trained NN algorithm was deemed suitable for recommending re-frac candidates, necessary decision variables for multiphase reservoir simulation. Finally, NPV optimization relied on a four-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, developed for forecasting local shale gas demand. Both neural network algorithms were scripted using python.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>17 non-redundant parameters were mined for 250 wells in the case study. The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding technique was used to visualize related low dimensional manifolds within the high-dimensional data set, and a NN algorithm was used to obtain probabilities of misclassification. The well-pads in the case study superstructure are modeled using compositional reservoir simulation. Each reservoir model is tuned by history matching production and pressure data for designated producing wells. Alternative field development strategies (including re-fracturing) are then simulated for a 10-year planning horizon to generate gas and water rate decline profiles. Using the LSTM developed, local gas demand is forecasted using data sets created from multivariate time-dependent local and global variables affecting shale gas demand. The LSTM algorithm is derived by convolving some features from the raw data set, with fined-tuned weights, with the objective of minimizing a pre-defined demand error function. The results obtained show that application of this integrated approach can give operators a calculated advantage, preventing erroneous feedback of project profitability but allowing early time decision-making that maximizes shale asset NPV.</jats:p>",

Regulating and supporting services are linked to the maintenance of long-term forest cover. Greater than 80% of family forest owners desire to maintain the forested condition of their land, whereas a much smaller percentage of these owners have entered into conservation easements or have collected money for conservation purposes.

In addition, between 1994 and 2000, another theory by the name of the ‘Global Commodity Chain’ (GCC) theory was developed by Gary Gereffi from North Carolina University (USA) which is more broader than the Supply Chain Management Theory. The aim of this paper is to revisit and critically examine Gereffi’s (1994) GCC theory and attempt to expand its analytical framework from the perspective of a small island country in the Pacific. The research findings highlight some of the limitations which GCC theory and suggest that a full understanding of global commodity chains needs to be reframed and embedded in the context of a country’s national social, economic and political environment. The paper argues that GCC theory need to incorporate variables such a as of ‘national economic policies’, ‘role of state’ and ‘labor’ in order to fully account for the complexity of modern supply chains. The paper concludes by arguing that the GCC theory is limited in explaining the true picture in developing small island countries. The paper contributes literature on GCC theory.</jats:p>"

Due, in part, to the rapid development of mobile technologies and the growing emphasis on online retail order fulfillment and omni‐channel SCM, there has been a shift toward more research on consumer‐oriented SCM practices in the academic literature. This fairly new, but growing, body of research that has contributed to our understanding of the link between SCM and consumers has proliferated, yet without an overarching theory‐driven conceptualization to connect to. The purpose of this article is to address this gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive review of research that has focused directly on consumer issues in SCM, and in doing so, present a conceptual model to add structure and clarity to this body of work. Based on themes that emerged from the literature, we propose the concept of “consumer‐based supply chain management performance” as a framework to represent this research domain. Moreover, in presenting the framework and associated categories, future research opportunities are suggested, with the aim of further contributing to the growth, development, and structure of this contemporary SCM dialogue.</jats:p>",

Five variables, relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (SR), feed flow rate (MF), and total dissolved solids of feed (TDSF) and brine (TDSB), were used as input parameters. The data were collected from an experimental solar still system used to desalinate seawater in an arid climate. The data were distributed randomly into training, testing, and validation datasets. A hybrid learning algorithm and eight different membership functions were applied to generate the ANFIS models. Several statistical criteria were used to assess the model performances. The ANFIS model with a generalized bell membership function provided the best prediction accuracy compared with models with other membership functions. The coefficient of correlation values for this model were 0.999, 0.959, and 0.832 for training, testing, and validation datasets, respectively. Sensitivity analysis (SA) was used to show the effectiveness of the considered input parameters for predicting SSP. The SA results indicated that SSP is the most influential parameter on SSP. Generally, the findings indicate the robustness of the ANFIS approach for estimating SSP.</jats:p>",

An increasing number of packaged foods and beverages are sold in India. Our objective was to evaluate the healthiness of packaged foods sold by India’s largest manufacturers. Healthiness was assessed using the Australian Health Star Rating (HSR) system and the World Health Organization’s European Regional Office (WHO Euro) Nutrient Profile Model. Sales-value-weighted mean healthiness and the proportions of “healthy” products (using a validated HSR cut-off of ≥3.5, and products meeting WHO Euro criteria as healthy enough to market to children) were calculated overall, by company and by food category. Nutrient information for 943 products sold by the 11 largest Indian manufacturers was obtained from nutrient labels, company websites or directly from the manufacturer. Healthiness was low overall (mean HSR 1.8 out of 5.0 stars) with a low proportion defined as “healthy” by both HSR (17%) and also by WHO Euro criteria (8%). There were marked differences in the healthiness of similar products within food categories. Substantial variation between companies (minimum sales-value-weighted mean HSR 0.5 for Company G, versus maximum HSR 3.0 for Company F) was a result of differences in the types of products sold and the nutritional composition of individual products. There are clear opportunities for India’s largest food companies to improve both the nutritional quality of individual products and to improve their product mix to include a greater proportion of healthy products.</jats:p>"

Co-integration and Autoregressive Dynamic Error Correction Model (ADLECM) approach was utilized. The results showed that money supply does not considerably influence inflation both in the long and short run possibly because the country is in recession. The ECM has the correct sign of negative and it is significant meaning that about 21% of the errors are corrected yearly. The Granger causality outcome demonstrates that, there is no causality between money supply and inflation in Nigeria within the study period and vice-versa. The implication of this is often that there are different economic conditions which are key determinant of inflation in Nigeria. The study recommends that the government should diversify the economy, minimize importation by encouraging local production of products and services. The CBN should guarantee an exchange rate policy that is essentially determined by the state of the economy and not by speculators being a net importation economy. Also, the CBN should look inwards into the current interest rate and see how it can be regulated in such a way that will encourage private and foreign investors to be able to invest in the country. This in turn, successively increases income, infrastructure development and economic growth at large.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Increased attention has lately been given to, first, social vulnerability reduction and, second, critical infrastructure management in the context of natural hazards and disasters. However, strikingly little efforts have been made in linking the two in a coherent manner conceptually and practically. Addressing this gap is the objective of this paper. In its first part, it provides a structured review on achievements and remaining gaps in the management of critical infrastructure and the understanding of social vulnerability towards failures during and after disasters. Special attention is given to the current state of minimum supply concepts. In its second part, the paper then responds to the identified gaps by developing a novel conceptual framework on the linkages of critical infrastructure management, social vulnerability and minimum supply. The framework is meant to guide future research as well as policy making and practical action. It facilitates and guides the conceptualization of (i) causal relationships between these three components, (ii) the assessment of system states in each component and (iii) the normative and political choices that need to be made explicit and tackled for turning the concept into policy and action. The paper closes by sketching out recommendations for a future research and practice agenda to close the detected gaps.\n                        </jats:p>"

We present practical sensitivity indices based on the Morris method to compare the sensitivity of a parameter group on one model output with that of one parameter on multiple model outputs. The new sensitivity indices were employed to measure the parameter sensitivity of the Chaohu Lake eutrophication model. The results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrate that the most sensitive parameters on cyanobacteria biomass, NH4, NO3, and PO4 were BMR, KDN, Nitm, and KRP, and the most sensitive parameter groups were algae-related, nitrogen-related, and phosphorus-related, which all directly participate in their cycles. Furthermore, Nitm, KRP, KDN, KHP, BMR, KTB, KTHDR, and KTCOD were the most important for the Chaohu Lake eutrophication model. The water environment characteristics, such as the cyanobacteria life stage in the simulated period, significantly affected parameter sensitivity. The power-law relationship between the new sensitivity index and the standard deviation of model variables in the Chaohu Lake model were also determined. This finding allows us to estimate the interactions between parameters using their sensitivity index. The results provide a basis for further improvement of the Chaohu Lake eutrophication model.</jats:p>",

The mHAP was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic techniques. The XRD pattern confirmed the formation of a single-phase nHAP without any extra steady phases. It was also found that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model gave a satisfactory fit to the experimental data (R2 = 0.99). The maximum removal percentages of Cu and Zn ions in optimal conditions (adsorbent dosage at 0.1 g, 30 min contact time at 25 ± 1 °C and pH = 5 ± 0.1) by mHAP were 97.1% and 93.8%, respectively. Results also demonstrated that mHAP could be recycled for up to five cycles in the case of copper and zinc. The Langmuir isotherm was proved to have a better correlation compared with that of the Freundlich isotherm. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that it was a spontaneously endothermic reaction. In conclusion, mHAP could be regarded as a powerful candidate for efficient biosorbent, capable of adsorbing heavy metals from aqueous solutions.</jats:p>",

In this article, after examining the nature of the existing governance and implementation gaps in labour standards in global supply chains, we explore how Viet Labor, an emerging grass-roots organization, has developed practices to help close them. This involves playing brokering roles between different workers and between workers and existing governance mechanisms. We identify an initial typology of six such roles: educating, organizing, supporting, collective action, whistle-blowing and documenting. This marks a significant shift in the way action to improve labour standards along the supply chain is analysed. Our case explores how predominantly top-down approaches can be supplemented by bottom-up ones centred on workers’ agency. </jats:p>",

This research article focuses on construction supply chains (CSCs) in the Engineer-to-Order (ETO) industry, where every product is almost unique based on specific customer needs and requirements. The development of methods and approaches for more sustainable supply chain management in construction is becoming even more important. Engineering, fabrication of parts and their installation on-site are not always well synchronized in ETO supply chains. The results of such supply chains are long lead times, inefficient material transport and high and uncontrolled levels of work-in-progress (WIP). This article describes a conceptual approach to synchronize demand on-site with supply in manufacturing using the CONstant Work In Progress (ConWIP) concept from Lean Management to achieve Just-in-Time (JIT) supply. As a result, sustainable supply chains in ETO enterprises, with optimizations from an economic, ecological and social point of view, can be designed. The approach has been validated in an industrial case study.</jats:p>"

Seventeen arrangements and configurations regarding the airflow and blockage arrangements are experimentally examined and compared. Test results indicate an appreciable hot air recirculation occurring for rack arrangement without any blockage, and the hot spot occurs at the second rack alongside the cold aisle. The hot spot had moved to the first rack when the blockage plate is installed on the rack top. Rack locations relative to air handler casts a negligible effect on the efficiency index, and it is comparatively more effective by sealing the trailing of the cold aisle. A smaller cold-aisle spacing helps to lower the temperature distribution, and an additional opening of the supplied vent will not help in removal of hot spot. Shutting off the grille in the center of cold aisle is also unable to fix the hot air recirculation and may even incur hot air reversal. The hot air reversal can be removed by adding additional blockage plate at the flow reversal section. Higher supplied air flow rate also improves the efficiency index considerably.</jats:p>",

Based on the insight gained from these previous investigations, we propose a generic design improvement to address the tremendous loss of initial angular momentum as well as inhomogeneous flow and temperature field at the outlet of the SHC. In the present paper, the main features of this design are introduced. It is shown that a three-dimensional shaping of the sidewalls, the dome, and the liners can effectively counteract the suboptimal interaction of the swirl flames with these surrounding walls. As a result, the flow at the outlet of the combustor features a high angular momentum and exhibits a uniform flow angle and temperature field. The insight gained from these generic investigations, and the resulting design optimization provides a useful framework for further industrial optimization of the SHC.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study optimal policies for dual-supply inventory systems where a firm commits to buying a total minimum quantity from both supplies or two separate total minimum quantities from each supply over a finite planning horizon. The two supply options differ in their costs and lead times. For the system under the joint commitment, the optimal policy has a simple structure and can be fully characterized by three critical numbers in each period. For the system under the separate commitments, we show that the optimal order quantities in each period are monotonic in the starting inventory and the remaining commitments with bounded sensitivity. Moreover, we establish convergence results on the optimal order quantities when the committed quantity from either supply approaches infinity. These findings highlight the effects of order commitments on the optimal inventory policies. On the basis of these results, we develop a simple heuristic for the system under separate commitments and show numerically that it performs very well. The numerical study further shows that the firm could incur a considerable loss if it ignores or overemphasizes the order commitments when managing its inventory. Finally, we conduct numerical analysis to derive insights into the firm’s supply contract selection in the presence of minimum order commitments. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1622 . </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Product recycling has become a mandatory activity under extended producer responsibility. Therefore, it is important to operate a closed-loop supply chain that integrates sourcing, production, delivery, and recycling to achieve not only environmental sustainability, but also economic benefits. However, this goal is affected by chronic problems caused by uncertainties relating to the return timing, quantity, and quality of returned items. Many studies proved that information visibility could solve these problems. In this context, a system framework for closed-loop supply chain management is proposed that gathers real-time information within a supply chain and product lifecycle by using the Internet-of-Things, including radio frequency identification (RFID). Specifically, the most recent Gen2 RFID protocol, which provides new features to create new positive effects, is considered. Additionally, an information system is designed, including RFID tag encoding, which supports the operation of the proposed system. Finally, the lifecycle benefits are examined, such as counterfeit prevention, real-time monitoring and maintenance in the middle-of-life phase, and reverse process streamlining. The ultimate aim is to design a system that facilitates the profitable and environmentally friendly operation of the closed-loop supply chain.</jats:p>"

In this study, we follow the and model to analyze that consumers strategize over which product to purchase under two scenarios where two firms enter the same market simultaneously or successively. In either model, consumers have to rely on anecdote reasoning or word-of-mouth to infer the product information of both firms. Due to this bounded rationality, firms dynamically adjust their strategic decisions to maximize profits. In this study, we prove that it is not always optimal to the production capacity decisions no matter under one anecdote or multiple anecdotes in either scenario, and the fill rate of regular product increases as the level of product environmental protection increases, then the profit of corresponding firm might increase. We show that the result of production capacity decisions of both firms being not always optimal is robust to the heterogeneous sample size, price optimization and discounted valuation.</jats:p>",

This conclusion was stated considering only the removal rate of different electron acceptors, indicating a lack of adequate proof. This study investigated the selective utilization of different electron acceptors by a perchlorate-degrading bacterium. The results showed that the mixed population of microorganisms (containing perchlorate-degrading bacteria) obeyed a certain sequence to utilize different electron acceptors, which was oxygen &amp;gt; nitrate &amp;gt; perchlorate &amp;gt; sulfate. The results of high-throughput sequencing showed that the mixed population of microorganisms contained anaerobic bacteria, facultative anaerobic bacteria, and aerobic bacteria. The microbial community structure actually had been changed by adding another electron acceptor to the perchlorate-medium and the microbial genera were distinguished in terms of utilizing the specific electron acceptor (e.g., oxygen, nitrate, sulfate). The result of canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that the abundance of microorganisms appeared as a good positive correlation with the corresponding electron acceptor. Therefore, a new viewpoint was inferred that there are two main reasons at least that make the mixed microorganisms obey a certain sequence to utilize different electron acceptors. One reason is that the perchlorate-degrading bacteria in the mixed microorganisms change their own respiratory metabolism pathway. The other reason is that the mixed microorganisms actually change their microbial community structure.</jats:p>",

The purpose is manifold: 1. Identifying the probable and possible future scenarios for the Valle of Cauca fruit and vegetable growing chain, applying for its analysis prospective methodologies recognized by the academic community and by the fruit and vegetable growers interested in the topic; 2. From the identified scenarios: trendential, optimistic and pessimistic, the Betting Scenario to which the sector’s actions of improvement must be oriented is defined; 3. To accomplish this, strategic guidelines are included in the betting scenario. Experts suggest that fruit and vegetable growers will define their projects and the strategies that would enable Valle del Cauca to improve its competitiveness in the sector, creating a positive impact on the region as well as increasing its exports; 4. The aforementioned is being supported by Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (EMBRAPA, for its name in Portuguese) that uses technological prospective and involves other connected fields of knowledge. Its focus is to discover the technical and social issues affecting an agricultural productive chain using technology as a tool that provides solutions to the community or social groups that are part of the productive chain; 5. This analysis was done in two phases: diagnostic and prospective. In the diagnostic phase, the documental analysis and the consultation with growers, producers, and experts were carried out. In the prospective phase, consultation with experts and tools such as brain storming, the Regnier Abacus, and multi-criteria analysis were applied. For the scenarios design, the morphological analysis was applied.</jats:p>"

The focus of the paper is on defining new knowledge networks and mobilisation approaches to address the network and community nature of current supply chains. Based on critical analysis of the state-of-the-art in the topic area, a knowledge network and mobilisation framework for lean supply chain management has been developed. The framework has then been evaluated using a case study from the food supply chain. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been used to incorporate expert's view on the defined knowledge networks and mobilisation approaches with respect to their contribution to achieving various lean performance objectives.

A time series model of flows was established based on the Box–Jenkins methodology. An autoregressive (AR) model was selected as the most suitable model. One hundred synthetic series, having the same length as the historical series (40 years), were produced using the AR model. It was also possible to control whether or not the generated time series maintained the statistical characteristics (mean and standard deviation) of the historical time series. After applying specified threshold levels (q = 0.5; q = 0.3; q = 0.1), the historic and synthetic flow series were subjected to runs analysis. Dry period lengths (run sum and run length) of historic and synthetic flow series were determined. Future droughts are estimated using maximum dry period lengths.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The goal of this paper is to describe, model, and optimize inventory in a reverse logistics system that supports the warranty returns and replacements for a consumer electronic device. The context and motivation for this work stem from a collaboration with an industrial partner, a Fortune 100 company that sells consumer electronics. The reverse logistics system is a closed-loop supply chain: failed devices are returned for repair and refurbishing; this inventory is then used to serve warranty claims or sold through a side sales channel. Managing inventory in this system is challenging because of the short life cycle of these devices and the rapidly declining value for the inventory. We examine an inventory model that captures these dynamics. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy for this problem for stochastic demand and introduce an algorithm to calculate optimal sell-down levels. We also provide a closed-form policy for the deterministic version of the problem, and we use this policy as a certainty-equivalent approximation to the stochastic optimal policy. Finally, using numerical experiments, we analyze the sensitivity of this system to changes in various parameters, and we also evaluate the performance of the certainty-equivalent approximation using data from our industrial partner. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0622 . </jats:p>",

Although product quality level is essential for maintaining competitiveness, traditional inventory models do not consider defect rate, which is the main determinant of product quality. Also, in real working environments, machines break down after long operating times, which increases product defect rate. Therefore, an effective preventive maintenance policy is needed to ensure that machinery is reliable. Reworking defective items is another important inventory problem. To answer the above questions regarding varying defect rate, preventive maintenance and rework, this study developed an integrated two-echelon inventory model to determine the best production quantity, delivery frequency and preventive maintenance schedule under JIT production and delivery policy. The model results can be used to minimize total cost.</jats:p>",

Water supply tract consists of an supply bucket channel, connecting the Danube with a sluice facility, a transporting channel – from a sluice to the mouth, i.e. to an output of a channel into a lake, and a mouth section of a channel. Throughout the whole period of operation of these facilities silt accumulation has been observed within supply bucket channels, in a lesser degree – within transport channels, and emergence in a mouth section of transport channels of sandbars having considerable dimensions. Throughout the whole period of operation of facilities and channels plenty of money has been spent for cleaning facilities and channels off sediments, so there is a need for deeper examination of the nature of silting phenomenon and minimization of water supply tract siltation through its simple reconstruction.&#x0D;\nThe aim of this research consists in substantiation of proposals to eliminate or to reduce effects of silting of supply and transport channels under existing conditions and substantiation of proposed necessary structural measures on the basis of proposed mathematical modelling and methods of analytical studies. Therefore methods of analytical studies including probable and statistical approaches used when analyzing processes with constant change of environment were proposed. These studies found that boundaries of supply of inlet channels in an open river’s channel depend on distribution of flow velocities throughout a river’s stream and conditions of stream distribution and flow pattern in the middle of the supply channel depends on shape of an inlet, particularly on shape of its lower side.&#x0D;\nThese suggestions and studies give us an opportunity to recommend means of controlling a hydraulic regime in the middle of a supply channel. Fighting against deposition of bottom sediments at supply channels may be won after choosing a place for water intake and a type of bucket, as well as after specification of appropriate structural forms and sizes of their inlet components. Therefore the article provides suggestions on research of regime of interaction between the river and a supply channel, dynamics of water exchange in supply channels, forces of stream masses developing during mixing, hydraulic regime and regime of deposition of supply and transport channels in order to determine the major requirements regarding size of water area of a supply channel.</jats:p>"

In an effort to clarify and consolidate terms, this conceptual research examines both supply chain management (SCM) and system of systems (SoS) literature to postulate, from a value-chain perspective, what roles integration and collaboration play in helping supply chains satisfy customer requirements. A literature review analysis was used to identify the commonalities and differences between supply chain management and system of systems approaches to examining interfirm coordination of value creation efforts. Although a framework of integration and collaboration roles in value creation is proposed, further empirical testing of the concept is required to substantiate initial conclusions. The concepts proposed may help clarify where strategic and operational managers need to focus their efforts in coordinating supply chain member firms. The incorporation of SoS engineering into the supply chain field will draw the linkage between the constituent principles, and concepts of Systems Theory as appropriate for the supply chain management field. This is the first effort to reconcile two separate but parallel scholarship streams examining the coordination of multiple organizations in value creation. This research shows that there are some methodologies, principles, and methods from the SoS field that can supplement supply chain management research. Mainly due to a unit of analysis issue, systems based approaches have not been in the mainstream of supply chain management field development.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, the Brazilian government was committed to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to reduce GHG emissions by 43% by 2030, compared to 2005. The aim of this study was to design the Brazilian electricity mix for 2030, while taking into account economic, technical and environmental criteria. In order to get this, Linear Programming optimization has been applied to obtain an electricity matrix with minimum cost of the Brazilian electricity generation system, considering GHG emission constraints – defined via the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique –, as well as capacity generation and supply needs. In addition, LCA was also applied to obtain the environmental performance of the projected scenario and results were compared with those of 2005 and 2015. The analysis depicted that renewable sources represent 88% of the projected Brazilian electricity production in 2030, mainly hydropower, which accounts for 66%. In terms of Climate Change there is an impact reduction of 12% compared to 2005, while other categories such as Ionized Radiation and Terrestrial Ecotoxicity doubled and upped more than forty times. These findings led to conclude that environmental management should not be limited to GHG analysis, and must encompass other adverse effects. Moreover, this reinforces the importance of conducting analyses such as those provided by the LCA approach and include these results in the planning and decision-making processes of the energy sector.</jats:p>"

A continent-wide, north-south transect of countries allows for the exploration of a range of climates, while a longitudinal transect from the Atlantic to the Red Sea provides a range of socio-economic factors within the similar climatic regime of Sahelian Africa. While change in national life expectancy and death rate since 1960 is modelled to be linked to a varying number and type of factors across the transects, the dominant factor in improving these demographic indicators across the continent is food availability.

For the polymer industry, the development of alternative and renewable raw materials represents an essential task. The study evaluates the different choices of unsaturated polyester resins (UPR) for production of centrifugally-cast glass reinforced pipe (cc-GRP) systems. The environmental impacts of three types of resin were evaluated and compared. The resins are: UPR standard, UPR containing recycled PET material (rPET-UPR) and UPR containing bio-sourced material (BIO-UPR). The analysis focuses on comparing the variations in environmental indicators caused by resin selection for three increasingly complex product layers (Base plate of cc-GRP shaft, cc-GRP Shaft and 1km cc-GRP Pipe-system). The study equally provides an insight onto R&amp;D and LCA collaboration across the supply-chain. One of the main challenges in LCA today is using specific data from the suppliers instead of generic data. The paper indicates how LCA tools and established R&amp;D processes can be employed to transfer LCA calculations across the supply-chain. BIO-UPR and rPET-UPR are alternatives which are realistic in terms of costs and which ensure the required quality for the manufactured products. rPET-UPR can be used for production of complete pipe systems, with positive environmental indicators. Mechanical proprieties of BIO-UPR restrict its usability and use of this resin presents similarities with the debate regarding use of bio-diesel.</jats:p>",

The supply chain is not limited to the operations related to the physical movement of goods, but also includes the management of relations with suppliers and customers. However, the supply chain management, through the integration and coordination of both information and goods flow, is a main factor of the well-developed customer service. The changes in military logistics imposed the necessity of implementation of the modern information technologies in the Polish Armed Forces. The Polish Army has adopted the Integrated Multi-level Information System of the Ministry of Defense (ZWSI RON). The article describes various technologies used in supply chain management including information, communication and automatic identification technologies. The author emphasizes that modern technologies are essential to enhance supply chain competitiveness and performance by improving the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the logistic system. Moreover, implementing of various innovative technologies shortens the time required for the fulfillment of tasks as well as reduces their labor consumption.</jats:p>",

The  study aims estimating the demand and supply functions for the wheat crop in Iraq and  analyzing the stability in equilibrium  system of  the demand and supply for the crop during the period (1971-2013), besides evaluating consequences of  the agricultural pricing policy in the short and long run by using the cobweb Equilibrium Model (CEM). the study depends  on many variables in the equilibrium analysis model those contributing in knowing influence of  the governmental policies, repressed by the consumed quantities of wheat, supplying quantities, prices of wheat,  the national income in fixed prices, the population and prices of the inputs (price of the fertilizer), in both of them we using the double logarithmic model to represent the relationship between the dependent  variable and the  independent variables, the study reached to that  the satisfaction obtained from the wheat consumption was high because decreasing of the income elasticity which was (0.004), furthermore the  positive signal it indicate that the wheat is normal and necessary good, the results show that the satiated obtained from the  wheat consumption was high, the results of the function of supply show that response of the farmer to the changing  in prices was weak, and this indicate weakness in performance of the locally  governmental pricing policy, and concerning with price of the fertilizer, the results show that the farmers do not using this input economically and about results of the an equilibrium analysis they came to support the results in the first analysis,  the results of the coefficients in the long run came stable with results of the short run, while  results of the stability of the equilibrium show that role of pricing policy causing un equilibrium in the demand and supply system of  the wheat (then equilibrium  unstable) while the system was relatively stable in the long run, and the national income, population were have positive influence in increasing the demand quantities, the study reached to set of recommendations at the end of the search.                                                                                                </jats:p>"

Alterations in spinal cord blood supply caused by complex spinal cord injuries contribute significantly to the diversity and severity of the spinal cord damage, particularly ischemic changes. However, the literature has not completely clarified our knowledge of anatomy of the complex three‐dimensional arterial system of the spinal cord in experimental animals, which can impede the translation of experimental results to human clinical applications. As the literary sources dealing with the spinal cord arterial blood supply in experimental animals are limited and scattered, the authors performed a review of the anatomy of the arterial blood supply to the spinal cord in several experimental animals, including pigs, dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, and mice and created a coherent format discussing the interspecies differences. This provides researchers with a valuable tool for the selection of the most suitable animal model for their experiments in the study of spinal cord ischemia and provides clinicians with a basis for the appropriate translation of research work to their clinical applications.

Third, the performance of the dual-channel supply chain is improved if the retailer’s cost information is shared and the dual-channel supply chain reaches coordination. The retailer is willing to share its cost information if the lump sum side payment that the manufacturer offers can make up the retailer’s reduced profit due to sharing this information.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The authors proposed a contract menus design model in a dual-channel supply chain.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Contemporary agricultural production is subject to a new dynamics of heritage enhancement that involves exploiting its economic, social, and cultural resources. As part of a development strategy for rural areas and in response to a growing social demand, this process revitalizes agricultural\n and rural spaces by giving them new social, cultural, and touristic functions. French food heritage is a lever for tourism development, but it is also a marker of collective identity. The gastronomic experience associated with tourism crystallizes a range of expectations and representations,\n notably in rural areas, giving rise to changing practices, new offers, and modes of supply, often on the fringes of more institutionalized, less differentiated tourism development. If tourism can be seen as a potential springboard for innovation, promoting or consolidating regional food heritage\n enhancement initiatives, it also provides a space for redeployment by actors in the local agri-food supply. By focusing on tourism practices and representations, this article examines the impact of the quite considerable tourism market in Midi-Pyrénées on food heritage innovation\n and what ways eating provides a lever for redefining the local offer. The article highlights the plurality of local agri-food forms available to tourists, with countless different actors and interactions between tourists and stakeholders. Considerable variety in adaptive strategies is found,\n either predominantly conservative or radically innovative, or a more hybrid combination of the two.</jats:p>",

The research focuses on the e-business/e-commerce, a new but fast growing concept as a supply chain operation model, to compare and discuss the differences of related aspects to global supply chain management versus similar practices a decade earlier. An online questionnaire was used to collect data and the participants were all supply chain experts working for the same global logistics and transportation company. Participants' perceptions were collected about their online experience and how they have experienced the change in supply chain management as a result. The research revealed that there is a relationship between globalization, technology use, and the impact of these two elements on the evolution of the global supply chain in the e-business industry. Also, the ‘digitalization' is leading the global supply chain operations to a new operation platform. There were two main limitations in this study; a) relatively small sample size, and b) the majority of participants had a logistics background and this may have impacted their reported perceptions.</p>",

In this context, the aim of our study is to characterize the microbial community of sulphurous-bromine-iodine thermal water and mud within an Italian spa complex using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. This is the first report of microbiome characterization along a water supply network from the spring to points of use within a spa. According to the 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis, our data highlight the presence of a typical microbial community, mainly composed of sulphur-cycling bacteria belonging to Desulfomonile, Thermodesulfovibrio, Geothermobacterium, Thermus, Thiofaba and Syntrophomonas genera. In addition, the characterization and evolution of the bacterial community in thermal muds during the maturation process is investigated for the first time. Interestingly, the microbiome of mature mud resulted dominated by bacteria capable of lipid biosynthesis, suggesting that these bacteria may play a role in the anti-rheumatic properties of thermal mud.</jats:p>",

Despite the amount of research on the topic, how much of its supply network (i.e., scope of control) a buying firm should control, so as to increase supply network performance, is a question that has not received adequate research attention. The study addresses this research question by considering the supply network as a complex adaptive system and developing an empirically informed agent‐based simulation model using the NK fitness landscape framework, to examine how varying levels of scope of control influence supply network performance. We also investigate the direct effect of two supply network complexity dimensions (i.e., number of firms and level of supply interactions) on supply network performance and the moderating effect played by the scope of control. Results show that the relationship between scope of control and supply network performance follows an inverted‐U shape. Furthermore, we find that the complexity dimensions negatively affect supply network performance with the performance decrease depending on the scope of control. Based on these findings, we formulate different control strategies to mitigate the negative influence of complexity.</jats:p>",

This article makes both empirical and theoretical contributions. This is one of the first studies delving into the advocacy role of brands in promoting labour rights and conditions vis‐à‐vis government. Moreover, the article develops a testable framework specifying the conditions under which brands are likely to respond, act collectively, and influence government for pro‐worker change.

In this study, the effectiveness of BAC filtration to remove natural organic matter (NOM) and taste and odor (T&amp;O) compounds was investigated by long-term (7 months) bench-scale filtration experiments. Filters contained fresh granular activated carbon (GAC) and a 2-year-old BAC which were fed with ozonated water from a full-scale water treatment plant spiked with 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin. The study aims to evaluate T&amp;O removal of GAC transitioning from its adsorptive to biological state, and to determine the effects of changing hydraulic loading during T&amp;O episodes and its effect on dissolved oxygen (DO) consumption. Sequencing of microbial communities in the BAC revealed that 20% of the identified bacteria were of genus Nitrospira. Based on nitrate formation and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal of the 2-year-old BAC, the fresh GAC turned biological after approximately 32,000 bed volumes. DOC removal of the GAC decreased from the initial 80% to 17%, however, the removal of MIB and geosmin remained &amp;gt;90% throughout the experiment (i.e., from adsorption to biodegradation). The 2-year-old BAC showed 9% lower MIB removals than the transitioned GAC filter indicating a contribution of remaining adsorption sites on MIB removal. When challenging the filters at different hydraulic loadings, higher T&amp;O removal was achieved at higher empty bed contact times, which correlated well with increased DO consumption.</jats:p>",

This research proposes a system dynamics model to analyze the effects of structures: lean, agile, flexible, responsive and resilient, in the overall performance and of each agent of the PFSC.Design/methodology/approach: Using a system dynamics model and design of experiments it is studied how the different structures and their combination, affect the behavior of inventory, transportation, responsiveness, efficiency, availability and quality-safety of the fresh fruits supply chain and each echelon.Findings: The studies of supply chains have been done for each structure in an independent way; investigations are scarce in supply chains of perishable foods. The structures modeled in this research do not show the better performance in all the metrics of the chain, neither in all agents for each structure. The above implies the presence of trade-offs.Research limitations/implications: The results show the need to investigate mixed structures with the FPSC´s own characteristics; the model can be applied in other supply chains of perishable foods.Practical implications: Management by combining structures in the FFSC, improves logistics performance and contributes to food security.Social implications: The agents of the FFSC can apply the structures found in this study, to improve their logistics performance and the food security.Originality/value: The dynamics of individual and combined structures were identified, which constitutes a contribution to the discussion in the literature of such problems for FFSC. The model includes six echelons: farmers, wholesalers, agro-industry, third-party logistics operators and retailers. The dynamic contemplates deterioration rate to model perishability and others losses.</jats:p>"

An unreliable and interrupted ARV supply chain creates the risk of virus reactivation and eventual patient mortality.The objectives of the study were to explore the problems experienced with the ARV distribution practices at the Manapo hospital, and to recommend ways in which the distribution of ARVs can be improved so that patients can receive an uninterrupted supply. The nature of the topic researched dictated the use of mainly the quantitative research method.The main problems identified include: Wrong and no uniform practice of ordering stock by the hospital and the clinics; lack of reliable, structured transportation from the depot to the hospital; as well as poor inventory management and poor overall communication. Recommendations to address the problems include: Implementing a supply chain planning and design process; improving inventory management and warehousing practices; implementing more effective and reliable distribution and transportation processes; as well as improving supply chain coordination and overall communication.</jats:p>"

Prior studies on supply chain structure have largely emphasized <jats:italic>network‐level</jats:italic> attributes but ignored <jats:italic>supply‐base level</jats:italic> characteristics. However, in many cases it is the 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> tier suppliers, not those “deep in the network,” that have most immediate influence on the buyer. In addition, some structural characteristics, such as direct links between the buyer's suppliers and its customers, are not‐so‐visible to the buyer, yet can impact its financial performance dramatically. The existing literature has overlooked these not‐so‐visible structural links. Using objective supply chain data collected from <jats:italic>Mergent Online</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Compustat</jats:italic>, we map the supply base structure of 867 public firms. We construct three visible (horizontal, vertical and spatial) and two not‐so‐visible (eliminative and cooperative) structural complexity metrics, and examine their impacts on buyer firms' financial performance as measured by Return on Assets and Tobin's Q. Our empirical analysis shows that the five dimensions have differential effects: some have negligible impacts while others appear to strongly affect financial performance. Contrary to the common belief that complexity hurts performance, we find that an individual complexity dimension may have both positive and negative effects, and the overall effect may be non‐linear.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

While much of the extant research focuses on dyadic relationships between two firms, another unit of analysis that can be utilized to augment the current research in supply chain management is the portfolio (Tokman et al. 2007). Firms engage in a diverse set of relationships at any given point in time, and these sets of relationships can be conceptualized as portfolios, defined as the set of direct interfirm relationships for the focal firm. Portfolios provide a useful unit of analysis for research because a firm must also have a vision for how to manage its portfolio in support of value creation and appropriation, in addition to understanding how individual relationships provide access to resources and help the organization adapt to the changing environment. In this research, we utilize a systematic literature review to explore supply chain portfolio research from a variety of academic fields. Our findings include multiple themes with conflicting results in the extant literature. We then utilize the findings to motivate directions for future research.</jats:p>",

Sustainability is defined in terms of minimizing the long-term risks to supply and maintaining the ecological, environmental and hydrological integrity of a river resource. The SI procedure developed uses two groups of performance criteria. The first group is based on demand-supply deficits and measures the risk to water supplies. The second group is only applied to river demands and compares a river’s allocation to a target flow regime using the Range of Variability Approach (RVA) and the Modified Hydrological Alteration factor. The RVA measures differences in flow regimes and is used to compare a projected flow regime to a targeted flow regime. This is the first attempt to use the RVA to develop a sustainability index for river basin management. A combined sustainability metric for the system (SS) is also determined. The methodology is applied to an area including the Prescott Active Management Area (AMA) in north-central Arizona. Sustainability for the entire system is determined using the weighted sum of the sustainability indices. The methodology has been used to measure and compare the sustainability of two allocation scenarios for the Prescott AMA.</jats:p>"

An increase in the pressure in the accumulator led to a decrease in the angle of the boundary layer of the jet. A decrease in the oscillations of the boundary layer of the jet about its axis is shown. The greatest variations were recorded at рак = 50 MPa. Then, as the рак increases, the vibrations of the nucleus decrease and become practically imperceptible at 250 MPa. A method for controlling the shape of the differential injection characteristic by an electric pulse, which is applied to an electromagnet of the control valve of the electrohydraulic injector of battery fuel system, is provided. The impulse consists of the preliminary, the main and the following additional one. The duration of the preliminary impulse determines the amplitude of the initial stage of the injection characteristic, and the interval between the preliminary and main pulse is the amplitude between the initial and main stages of the injection characteristic. The interval between the main and additional electric pulses is selected in such a way that the subsequent stage of the injection characteristic begins after the termination of the main, but without an interval between them. By selecting the durations of the control electric pulses and the intervals between them, it is possible to obtain a predetermined shape of the differential injection characteristic from stepped to a characteristic with an inclined leading edge. In nozzles with two groups of holes (correction sprayer), the flow rate of the holes in the sub-head volume and on the locking cone is significantly different and depends on the position of the needle. This creates the prerequisites for correcting the fuel supply through the spray holes and, consequently, along the zones of the combustion chamber, taking into account the mode of operation of the diesel engine.</jats:p>"

Some supply chain management areas such as reverse logistics, inventory management, forecasting/demand planning, outsourcing, and risk management have been explored only to some extent. Furthermore, knowledge transfer is being studied in the majority of the articles, mainly by both case study and survey approach; mathematical models and simulation techniques are used in very limited articles. Findings concerning theoretical perspectives and managerial issues are also described.Research limitations/implications: The limitation of our study encompasses the aspects of search period (2000-2014), selection of search databases (Web of Science and SCOPUS and language selection (English).Practical implications: The exhibition of the KM processes within the SC context may help practitioners and managers interested in implementing KM initiatives to replicate the methodologies in order to increase the possibilities of a successful KM adoption.Originality/value: The systematic review will contribute to the understanding of the present state of research in the knowledge management theory, with focus on the supply chain, as there are no state-of-knowledge studies that report a systematic literature review approach.</jats:p>"

To determine the distribution of trihalomethanes (THMs), measurements were performed at 0.05 m, 0.60 m and 1.50 m above the water surface. These heights were chosen to measure the exposure in the breathing zone of the users. Air samples were collected from two indoor swimming pool facilities in Norway. Facility 1 uses calcium hypochlorite and facility 2 uses sodium hypochlorite for water treatment. In facility 2, one of the swimming pools is filled with 33% seawater, while the other pools in this study were filled with freshwater. Higher values were measured at 0.05 m compared to 1.50 m. Negligible differences between the measurements at 0.60 m and 1.50 m above floor levels were obtained. On average, 282% higher concentrations of total THM (tTHM) were measured in facility 2. Different disinfection products and ventilation concepts are possible explanations. Swimmers are exposed to higher concentrations compared to users by the poolside. For future studies, it is crucial to measure as close to the water surface as possible.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Chronic ACTH exposure is associated with adrenal hypertrophy and steroidogenesis. The underlying molecular processes in mice have been analysed by microarray, histological and immunohistochemical techniques. Synacthen infused for 2 weeks markedly increased adrenal mass and plasma corticosterone levels. Microarray analysis found greater than 2-fold changes in expression of 928 genes (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001; 397 up, 531 down). These clustered in pathways involved in signalling, sterol/lipid metabolism, cell proliferation/hypertrophy and apoptosis. Signalling genes included some implicated in adrenal adenomas but also upregulated genes associated with cyclic AMP and downregulated genes associated with aldosterone synthesis. Sterol metabolism genes were those promoting cholesterol supply (<jats:italic>Scarb1, Sqle, Apoa1</jats:italic>) and disposal (<jats:italic>Cyp27a1</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Cyp7b1</jats:italic>). Oil red O staining showed lipid depletion consistent with reduced expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis. Genes involved in steroidogenesis (<jats:italic>Star, Cyp11a1, Cyp11b1</jats:italic>) were modestly affected (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05; &lt;1.3-fold). Increased <jats:italic>Ki67, Ccna2, Ccnb2</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Tk1</jats:italic> expression complemented immunohistochemical evidence of a 3-fold change in cell proliferation. Growth arrest genes, <jats:italic>Cdkn1a</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Cdkn1c</jats:italic>, which are known to be active in hypertrophied cells, were increased &gt;4-fold and cross-sectional area of fasciculata cells was 2-fold greater. In contrast, genes associated with apoptosis (eg <jats:italic>Casp12, Clu,</jats:italic>) were downregulated and apoptotic cells (Tunel staining) were fewer (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001) and more widely distributed throughout the cortex. In summary, long-term steroidogenesis with ACTH excess is sustained by genes controlling cholesterol supply and adrenal mass. ACTH effects on adrenal morphology and genes controlling cell hypertrophy, proliferation and apoptosis suggest the involvement of different cell types and separate molecular pathways.</jats:p>",

This and the increasing cost of electricity has led to the use of Pumps-operating-As-Turbines (PATs) devices that can reduce pressure (and leakage) whilst harvesting energy. This paper presents a methodology for optimal water distribution system (WDS) management, driving the optimization by minimizing the surplus pressure at network nodes and the operational pumping costs and maximizing the income generated through energy recovery. The method is based on a highly parallelized Evolutionary Algorithm, employing an hydraulic solver to evaluate hydraulic constraints. Water demands at network nodes are considered as uncertain variables modelled by using a probabilistic approach in order to take into account unknown future demands. The approach is demonstrated in different case studies. Results obtained highlight that the economic benefits of installing PATs for energy recovery in conjunction with a combined pump-scheduling and pressure management regime is especially related to the input network characteristics. Further analysis of the importance of the probabilistic approach and of the influence of the interval time step adopted for the optimization has been evaluated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Engine oil-lubricated (semi) floating ring bearing ((S)FRB) systems in passenger vehicle turbochargers (TC) operate at temperatures well above ambient and must withstand large temperature gradients that can lead to severe thermomechanical induced stresses. Physical modeling of the thermal energy flow paths and an effective thermal management strategy are paramount to determine safe operating conditions ensuring the TC component mechanical integrity and the robustness of its bearing system. The paper details a model to predict the pressure and temperature fields and the distribution of thermal energy flows in a bearing system. The impact of lubricant supply conditions, bearing film clearances, and oil supply grooves is quantified. Either a low oil temperature or a high supply pressure increases the generated shear power. Either a high supply pressure or a large clearance allows more flow through the inner film and draws more heat from the hot journal, thought it increases the shear drag power as the oil viscosity remains high. Nonetheless, the peak temperature of the inner film is not influenced by the changes on the way the oil is supplied into the film as the thermal energy displaced from the hot shaft into the film is overwhelming. Adding axial grooves on the inner side of the (S)FRB improves its dynamic stability, albeit increasing the drawn oil flow as well as the drag power and heat from the shaft. The results identify a compromise between different parameters of groove designs thus enabling a bearing system with a low power consumption.</jats:p>",

Variable factors including temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity directly influence the magnitude and frequency of water-borne pathogen transfers. In this study, we determined the long-term temporal trends and seasonal patterns of shigellosis and evaluated the effects of demographic and climatic factors on its incidence in Yazd province, Iran, during 2012 through 2015. The incidence of shigellosis was highest among patients in the age group of 6–20 years and peaked in every summer of the years studied, especially during August. Furthermore, there was a significant association between climatic variables (such as monthly temperature, humidity, and atmospheric dust) and the incidence of shigellosis. However, contrary to expectations, rainfall did not affect incidence of the disease. The transmission of Shigella to humans is a complex ecological process. Socio-economic factors and lifestyle behaviours need to be addressed in future studies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The final product of this article is a mathematical model of a Mixed Energy System (MES) with Biogas-Electrical Energy (B-EE) that uses residual biomass of the pig waste, with which it is possible to estimate the amount of organic biomass necessary (or the number of animals required to produce it) to supply a farm for a certain number of hours a day, knowing the loads to be connected to the generator and taking into account the parameters necessary for the biodigester to perform its fermentation process and deliver the necessary biogas for the generator to supply power under normal conditions. The work was carried out in San Antonio del Tequendama (Cundinamarca, Colombia), a rural municipality, with a high degree of pork exploitation, and without supply of electrical energy. A small biodigester of 2.84 m3 was standardized, chorizo type, with a load of six pigs, C:N ratio of 1:30, temperature between 18-24 °C; a pH range of 6.8-7.2, for the supply of 2 kW of power, with a generator that runs with this biogas, for a consumption of 0.55 m3⁄h.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study focuses on reviewing the current understanding of supply chain quality management research field in order to critically provide a systematic view about the existing relevant literature, and identify shortcomings and further research directions that should be explored. The Creswell’s methodology [1] in doing literature review is followed to conduct this study. As a result, three prevailing perspectives in supply chain quality management are (a) Supply chain management &amp; quality management perspective in which the factors affecting supply chain quality management, integration, coordination, and sharing in supply chain, etc are done. But the sufficient investigation in entire supply chain as well as industry, barriers or facilitators, the role of other functions, quality of the supply chain, upstream-oriented quality activities, and organization learning within partners in the supply chain are less concerned; (b) Supply chain management &amp; Lean perspective, prior studies identify factors affecting on supply chain performance and firm’s competitive advantages, benefits, characteristics, principles, practices and basic techniques for Lean supply chain management, etc. They have less interests in the entire supply chain investigation, Lean service, barriers or facilitators of supply chain quality management performance; and (c) Supply chain management &amp; Innovation perspective, recent studies investigate factors affecting supply chain innovation, barriers or facilitators, developing innovation frameworks and approaches or strategies, etc. But they reveal limitations in the integration of supply chain strategies with innovation strategies and business strategies, barriers of innovation process, and how to cope with challenges and differences of various types of innovation. Overall, most of the existing researches on three mentioned perspectives mainly investigate within the manufacturing sector in developed countries, and they gives much attention to supply chain fulfillment; few studies focus on supply chain development and lack the combination.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pulse width modulation (PWM) technology is widely used in traction converters for high-speed railways. The harmonic distribution caused by PWM is quite extensive, and increases the possibility of grid–train coupling resonance in the traction power supply system (TPSS). This paper first analyzes the mechanism of resonance, when the characteristic harmonic frequency of a four-quadrant converter (4QC) current that injects into the traction grid matches the resonant frequency of the traction grid, which may result in resonance in the system. To suppress resonance, this paper adopts specific harmonic elimination–pulse width modulation (SHE-PWM) technology combined with a transient direct current control strategy to eliminate the harmonics in the resonant frequency, which may suppress the grid–train coupling resonance. Due to the fact that the SHE-PWM process with multiple switching angles contains complex transcendental equations, the initial value is difficult to provide, and is difficult to solve using ordinary iterative algorithms. In this paper, an active-set secondary optimization method is used to solve the equation. The algorithm has the benefits of low dependence on initial values, fast convergence and high solution accuracy. Finally, the feasibility of the resonant suppression algorithm is verified by means of Matlab simulation.</jats:p>"

The entering firm behaves as the leader of a Stackelberg game while the existing firms in the existing network are followers. We assume that the entering firm can anticipate the existing firms’ reaction to his potential location decision before choosing his optimal policy. We use a CLSC network equilibrium model in which the decision makers are faced with multiple objectives to capture the existing firms’ reaction. A mathematical programming model with equilibrium constraints is developed for this competitive CLSC network design problem by taking into account the market competition existing in the decentralized CLSC network. A solution method is developed by integrating Genetic algorithm with an inexact logarithmic-quadratic proximal augmented Lagrangian method.

This study was conducted to determine the potential to use solids, phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) captured by tailwater recovery (TWR) systems for reuse onto production fields through irrigation applications. Seven TWR systems were assessed for seasonal changes in nutrient concentrations and application loads. Samples were collected every three weeks from 2013 to 2015 for seasonal analyses and weekly during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons for nutrient load analyses. Water samples collected in spring contained greater concentrations of solids than samples collected in winter and summer. In addition, spring samples contained greater concentrations of nitrate–nitrite than samples collected in all other seasons, and spring samples also contained higher ammonium than summer and fall samples. Mean nutrient loads per hectare recycled onto the landscape for an irrigation season were 325.10 kg ha−1 solids, 0.86 kg ha−1 P, and 7.26 kg ha−1 N, with the N being 77% organic. TWR systems can be used to recycle solids, P and N onto agricultural landscapes through irrigation events; however, nutrient loads will not be sufficient to alter agronomic fertilizer recommendations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Alluvial river estuaries consist largely of sand but are typically flanked by mudflats and salt marshes. The analogy with meandering rivers that are kept narrower than braided rivers by cohesive floodplain formation raises the question of how large-scale estuarine morphology and the late Holocene development of estuaries are affected by cohesive sediment. In this study we combine sand and mud transport processes and study their interaction effects on morphologically modelled estuaries on centennial to millennial timescales. The numerical modelling package Delft3D was applied in 2-DH starting from an idealised convergent estuary. The mixed sediment was modelled with an active layer and storage module with fluxes predicted by the Partheniades–Krone relations for mud and Engelund–Hansen for sand. The model was subjected to a range of idealised boundary conditions of tidal range, river discharge, waves and mud input. The model results show that mud is predominantly stored in mudflats on the side of the estuary. Marine mud supply only influences the mouth of the estuary, whereas fluvial mud is distributed along the whole estuary. Coastal waves stir up mud and remove the tendency to form muddy coastlines and the formation of mudflats in the downstream part of the estuary. Widening continues in estuaries with only sand, while mud supply leads to a narrower constant width and reduced channel and bar dynamics. This self-confinement eventually leads to a dynamic equilibrium in which lateral channel migration and mudflat expansion are balanced on average. However, for higher mud concentrations, higher discharge and low tidal amplitude, the estuary narrows and fills to become a tidal delta.\n                    </jats:p>"

In current research, flexibility options for electricity from growing renewableenergies attract attention. One of the considered options is the power-to-gas technology incombination with fuel cells. Linear Programs for optimal system operation exist for example for distributedenergy systems. In this study we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program of a power-to-gasunit consisting of an electrolyzer, a fuel cell and a hydrogen storage. For the fuel cell a minimum loadand a non-linear efficiency curve is taken into account. The non-linear efficiency curve is approximatedby piecewise linearization. Bilinear products in the modeling of the efficiency curve are beingsubstituted to maintain full power plant sizing and operation functionality. Different fuels, such as naturalgas and hydrogen to be converted in the fuel cell, are implemented as well. As a result, we showthat a detailed model of the non-linear efficiency curve of a fuel cell leads to more accurate results concerningthe system operation. The configuration of system components in the observed energy systemchanges. Especially the battery system experiences a change in sizing and operation. However, solvingtime of the model is increasing dramatically. Our results demonstrate a valuable approach to comparethe results of a Linear Program to a Mixed Integer Linear Program. Hence giving the possibility toevaluate the necessity of detailed over simplified models regarding calculation of cost-effectiveness.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we estimate wage elasticities for physicians. We apply both a structural discrete choice approach and a reduced‐form approach to examine how these different approaches affect wage elasticities at the intensive margin. Using uniquely rich data collected from a large sample of general practitioners (GPs) and specialists in Australia, we estimate 3 alternative utility specifications (quadratic, translog, and box‐cox utility functions) in the structural approach, as well as a reduced‐form specification, separately for men and women. Australian data is particularly suited for this analysis due to a lack of regulation of physicians' fees leading to variation in earnings. All models predict small negative wage elasticities for male and female GPs and specialists passing several sensitivity checks. For this high‐income and long‐working‐hours population, the translog and box‐cox utility functions outperform the quadratic utility function. Simulating the effects of 5% and 10% wage increases at the intensive margin slightly reduces the full‐time equivalent supply of male GPs, and to a lesser extent of male specialists and female GPs.</jats:p>",

The multi-scale wave perturbation method is firstly used to derive analytical solutions for the amplitude evolution of transient pressure wave propagation in pipelines, considering regular and random variations of cross-sectional area, respectively. The analytical analysis is based on the one-dimensional (1D) transient wave equation for pipe flow. Both derived results show that transient waves can be attenuated and scattered significantly along the longitudinal direction of the pipeline due to the regular and random non-uniformities of pipe diameter. The obtained analytical results are then validated by extensive 1D numerical simulations under different incident wave and non-uniform pipe conditions. The comparative results indicate that the derived analytical solutions are applicable and useful to describe the wave scattering effect in complex pipeline systems. Finally, the practical implications and influence of wave scattering effects on transient flow analysis and transient-based leak detection in urban water supply systems are discussed in the paper.</jats:p>"

However, the current disposal practices, mainly based on advertising and collecting status, are unsatisfactory in most countries and regions. Thus, some scholars proposed an alternative disposal practice that is to provide incentives to customers. This study aims to compare a Single Model (advertising only) with a Joint Model (advertising with take-back pricing) in a two-echelon reverse supply chain (RSC) that is composed of one disposer and one collector. In each model, four games (non-cooperative, collector as the Stackelberg leader, disposer as the Stackelberg leader, and cooperative) were established in order to identify the optimal pricing and advertising strategies for both members. The results of the study indicate that there is a Pareto dominant range for Joint Model compared to Single Model, whereas Single Model has no Pareto improvement in any games. Furthermore, in non-cooperative games of Joint Model, it is better to implement the leader-follower structure rather than simultaneous movement structure. Additionally, it is verified that the cooperative game is feasible, which leads to the cooperation between the disposer and the collector, and the extra profit from the cooperation can be shared based on the Nash bargaining game. However, in Single Model, it is better for the disposer to act as a channel leader and the collector figures the follower.</jats:p>"

First, a basic circuit unit is designed to illustrate the operating principle of the RVG circuit. Then, the Pspice simulations for the comparison between the RVG circuit and the conventional RC resonant circuit in the half‐bridge applications of second inverting stage are carried out to illustrate the superiority of RVG circuit. Finally, an experimental prototype of VP arc welding power supply is established to test and verify the proposed RVG circuit.

These new functions are determining a stable (or passing) short circuit in the disconnected deciding whether to perform a quick automatic restart of the circuit breakers after an emergency shutdown or finding the fault zone without testing the insulation of the contact network. The principle of operation of the functions under consideration is analyzed in the article. The limits of the optimum time of the current-free pause of the circuit breaker for automatic re-activation (AR) for each inter-substation zone are established. The paper describes the existing algorithm for automating power supply of an AC traction network (the normal reclosing algorithm) and indicates the unfavorable consequences from its application, in particular, related to the long time of the absence of voltage in the contact network. It was noted that the decision to reduce the voltage recovery time performed by introducing the function of determining the passing (or stable) short-circuit in the switched-off contact network in traction substations is due to the cost of additional high-voltage equipment and requires a rethinking. Thus, a new algorithm for automating the power supply of the traction network (the BAR algorithm) is presented, which is quite easily implemented at the modern sectioning post, which has voltage transformers for each supply line of the contact network, in contrast to the supply lines of the substation contact network and is caused by the transfer of the function of determining the passing (or steady ) short circuit to the sectioning point. In the article, the issue of performing the automatic reclosure of the power line of the traction substation is considered dependent on the successful operation of the BAR algorithm of the sectioning point. It is established that the most rational option is the implementation of a dependent automatic reclosing of a traction substation using telemechanics. The authors analyze the possibility of manufacturing compact sections of the ac contact network on the basis of single-phase re-closers OR-27.5 kV. It is noted that it is advisable to use a new automation scheme in conjunction with the sectionalization points on reclosers.</jats:p>"

Despite the severity of this developing environmental hazard, the relative importance of each component of the water cycle still needs more detailed study so that those communities who will experience the greatest extremes in supply can be identified. Specifically, data showing how the contribution of meltwater varies with increasing distance downstream are lacking for many mountain catchments, although the use of stable isotope tracers provides some hope in this regard. Imprinted on regional‐scale hydroclimatological controls of water availability are local‐scale cultural beliefs and practices that have evolved over centuries, which determine who is able to access water supplies, for how long, and for what purpose. Building the resilience of human populations and the environment to future changes in water supply therefore depends on effective interdisciplinary team working to develop an understanding of the complex interactions between physical, socioeconomic, cultural, and historical factors, and that can only be properly realized if local communities are considered as an integral part of the research team. Developing simple and practical methods for water management, storage, and societal adaptation that are appropriate to the socioeconomic and political conditions of mountain‐dwelling communities will only be sustainable if they are built on this integrated knowledge base. <jats:italic>WIREs Water</jats:italic> 2018, 5:e1258. doi: 10.1002/wat2.1258</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:\n<jats:list list-type=\"explicit-label\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Engineering Water &gt; Planning Water</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Human Water &gt; Water Governance</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Science of Water &gt; Water and Environmental Change</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p>",

When modeling the shale gas supply in a specific gas field, it is of paramount importance to determine the gas supply under economic considerations. Two common calculation methods are used in China for this purpose: Method 1 (M1) is the breakeven analysis, where the gas supply is based on the relationship between costs and revenues, while Method 2 (M2) is the Geologic Resource Supply-Demand Model, where the supply relies on demand and price scenarios. No comparisons has been made between these two methods. In this study, the Fuling shale gas field in the Sichuan Basin was chosen as a study case to forecast the shale gas supply using these two different methods. A sensitivity analysis was performed to discuss the influencing factors of each method and error measures were used to compare the different shale gas supply values calculated by each method. The results shows that M1 is more sensitive to initial production, while M2 is more sensitive to gas price. In addition, M2 is more feasible for its simplicity and accuracy at high price scenarios and M1 is considered to be reliable for low price scenarios with profit. This study can provide a quick and comprehensive assessment method for the shale gas supply in China.</jats:p>"

Accordingly, hosts discriminate against free‐riding symbionts in many mutualistic relationships. However, as the selective advantage of discriminators comes from the presence of variability in symbiont quality that they eliminate, discrimination and thus mutualism have been considered to be maintained with exogenous supply of free‐riders. In this study, we tried to resolve the ‘paradoxical’ co‐evolution of discrimination by hosts and cooperation by symbionts, by comparing two different types of discrimination: ‘one‐shot’ discrimination, where a host does not reacquire new symbionts after evicting free‐riders, and ‘resampling’ discrimination, where a host does from the environment. Our study shows that this apparently minor difference in discrimination types leads to qualitatively different evolutionary outcomes. First, although it has been usually considered that the benefit of discriminators is derived from the variability of symbiont quality, the benefit of a certain type of discriminators (e.g. one‐shot discrimination) is proportional to the frequency of free‐riders, which is in stark contrast to the case of resampling discrimination. As a result, one‐shot discriminators can invade the free‐rider/nondiscriminator population, even if standing variation for symbiont quality is absent. Second, our one‐shot discriminators can also be maintained without exogenous supply of free‐riders and hence is free from the paradox of discrimination. Therefore, our result indicates that the paradox is not a common feature of evolution of discrimination but is a problem of specific types of discrimination.</jats:p>",

We analyze all of the problems in this framework and characterize their equilibrium outcomes. In comparison, we demonstrate that a firm often benefits from its power except that a power manufacturer might suffer in a supply chain with isoelastic demand and additive shock. A balanced power structure is often conducive to the whole supply chain, but this structure might not perform very well in a supply chain with isoelastic demand and additive shock. Power structures and demand models act on consumers in much the same manner that they do on supply chain efficiency. In other words, consumers often prefer a balanced power structure and thereby do not profit from power retailers. Additionally, we find that the retail price can play a pivotal role in determining supply chain efficiency and consumer surplus. Specifically, the lower the retail price, the higher the supply chain efficiency and consumer surplus. In contrast, the service level has a less preeminent influence on both of them.</jats:p>",

Despite this importance, methods for quantifying the impact of water quality on water availability remain elusive. Here, we develop a new framework for incorporating the impact of water quality on water supply by modifying the Water Supply Stress Index (WaSSI). We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework by investigating the impact of high salinity waters on the availability of irrigation water for agriculture in Louisiana. The WaSSI was deconstructed into sectoral components such that the total available water supply could be reduced for a particular demand sector (agricultural irrigation in this example) based on available water quality information. The results for Louisiana highlight substantial impacts on water supply stress for farmers attributable to the landward encroachment of saline surface water and groundwater near the coast. Areas of high salinity near the coast also increased the competition for freshwater resources among the industrial, municipal, and agricultural demand sectors in the vicinities of the municipal areas of Lake Charles, Lafayette, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The framework developed here is easily adaptable for other water quality concerns and for other demand sectors, and as such can serve as a useful tool for water managers.</jats:p>",

In the richer habitat, rainfall was significantly correlated with natural diet diversity and time spent feeding on natural foods.  Both troops spent more time feeding during periods of high provisioning of artificial food, and the percentage of feeding on natural foods decreased when provisioning was high.  The baboons fed on natural foods throughout the year despite the availability of human foods.  We suggest the need for a nutritionally balanced diet has kept the baboons from becoming completely dependent on human foods.  Effectively preserving natural vegetation should enable commensal baboons to spend more time feeding on natural foods, thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict. </jats:p>"

In the context of recycling and remanufacturing by the remanufacturer, the manufacturer and remanufacturer choose different production strategies. By comparing the costs, profits and equilibrium quantity of supply chain members in decentralized and centralized models, we focus on the conditions under which the remanufacturer chooses to sell the remanufactured products and compete with the manufacturer. Different cooperative strategies can affect closed-loop supply chain decision-making. The article analyzes the impact of each cost and recycling rate on the productions and profits of the manufacturer and remanufacturer, and compares the total profits of members between two models. The sensitivity analysis of the models shows that the centralized model can be an effective way of achieving greater efficiency in terms of the overall supply chain. This study provides insights into the remanufacturing theory, which might guide remanufacturing operations and strategies.</jats:p>"

With data from the Dawn mission as constraints, we use a coupled thermal and vapor diffusion model to explore three different configurations of water ice (global buried pore‐filling ice, global buried excess ice, and local exposed surface ice) that could be present on Ceres. We conclude that a buried ice table cannot alone explain the vapor production rates previously measured, but newly exposed surface ice, given the right conditions, can exceed that vapor production rate. Sublimation lag deposits form that bury and darken this surface ice over a large range of timescales (from &lt;1 year to approximately hundreds of kyr) that depend on latitude and ice regolith content. Sublimating water vapor can loft regolith particles from the surface of exposed ice, possibly prolonging the visible lifespan of those areas. We find that this process is only effective for regolith grains smaller than approximately ones of microns.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The field of wearable hydraulics for human-assistive devices is expanding. One of the major challenges facing development of these systems is creating lightweight, portable power units. This project’s goal was to develop design strategies and guidelines with the use of analytical modeling to minimize the weight of portable hydraulic power supplies in the range of 50–300 W. Steady-state, analytical models were developed and validated for a system containing a lithium-polymer battery, brushless DC motor, and axial-piston pump. Component parameters such as motor size, pump size, and swashplate angle were varied to explore and develop four main design guidelines that can be used by designers to minimize overall system weight. First, it is often not beneficial to select the smallest sized electric motor that can provide the required torque and speed. Second, cooling systems generally do not help reduce overall system weight. Third, the gearbox between the electric motor and pump should be eliminated to reduce system weight. Fourth, iterative modeling is necessary to determine the various range of particular component parameters necessary to result in a minimal-weight system. The analytical model developed takes inputs of desired flowrate, pressure, and runtime, and outputs the combination of pump size, swashplate angle, and motor size that results in a minimal-weight system. The four design principles and the computer simulation are tools that can be used to either design a fully custom, weight-optimized power supply or to aid in the selection of commercially available components for a low-weight power supply.</jats:p>",

In the Fall of 2015 the Genetic Counselor Workforce Working Group, comprised of representatives from the American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC), the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling (ACGC), the Association of Genetic Counseling Program Directors (AGCPD), the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG), and the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) commissioned a formal workforce study to project supply of and demand for CGCs through 2026. The data indicate a shortage of genetic counselors engaged in direct patient care. Assuming two scenarios for demand, supply is expected to reach equilibrium between 2024 and 2030. However, given the rate of growth in genetic counseling training programs in the six months since the study was completed, it is reasonable to expect that the number of new programs may be higher than anticipated by 2026. If true, and assuming that growth in programs is matched by equivalent growth in clinical training slots, the supply of CGCs in direct patient care would meet demand earlier than these models predict.</jats:p>",

In total, 1211 patients were assigned to receive fresh blood and 1219 patients to receive standard-aged blood. RBCs were stored for a mean of 6.1 days [standard deviation (SD) ± 4.9 days] in the group allocated to receive fresh blood and 22.0 days (SD ± 8.4 days) in the group allocated to receive standard-aged blood. Patients received a mean of 4.3 RBC units (SD ± 5.2 RBC units) and 4.3 RBC units (SD ± 5.5 RBC units) in the groups receiving fresh blood and standard-aged blood, respectively. At 90 days, 37.0% of patients in the group allocated to receive fresh blood and 35.3% of patients in the group allocated to receive standard-aged blood had died {absolute risk difference 1.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) –2.1% to 5.5%]}. There were no between-group differences in any secondary outcomes. The UK cohort comprised 359 patients randomised and followed up for 12 months for the cost–utility analysis. UK patients had similar characteristics and outcomes to the international cohort. Mean total costs per patient were £32,346 (95% CI £29,306 to £35,385) in the group allocated to receive fresh blood and £33,353 (95% CI £29,729 to £36,978) in the group allocated to receive standard-aged blood. Approximately 85% of the total costs were incurred during the index hospital admission. There were no significant cost differences between the two groups [mean incremental costs for those receiving fresh vs. standard-aged blood: –£231 (95% CI –£4876 to £4415)], nor were there significant differences in outcomes (mean difference in quality-adjusted life-years –0.010, 95% CI –0.078 to 0.057).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-9\"><jats:title>Limitations</jats:title><jats:p>Adverse effects from the exclusive use of older RBCs compared with standard or fresh RBCs cannot be excluded.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-10\"><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>The use of RBCs aged ≤ 7 days confers no clinical or economic benefit in critically ill patients compared with standard-aged RBCs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-11\"><jats:title>Future work</jats:title><jats:p>Future studies should address the safety of RBCs near the end of the current permitted storage age.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-12\"><jats:title>Trial registration</jats:title><jats:p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN44878718.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-13\"><jats:title>Funding</jats:title><jats:p>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in<jats:italic>Health Technology Assessment</jats:italic>; Vol. 21, No. 62.
