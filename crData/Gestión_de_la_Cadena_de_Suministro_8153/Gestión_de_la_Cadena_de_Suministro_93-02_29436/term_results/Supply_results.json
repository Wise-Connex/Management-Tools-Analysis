This chapter reviews the physiologic determinants of oxygen supply, how it is threatened by respiratory or cardiac dysfunction or by hemorrhaged or anemic states, and how it can be assessed in individual patients. Activities and conditions that increase tissue oxygen demand arc examined so that clinicians can identify those patients whose oxygen demands may be excessive and should be controlled. Failure of tissues to consume enough oxygen is explained in patients with critically low delivery or with the maldistributed blood flow state seen in sepsis. The monitoring of mixed venous oxygen saturation is examined as a method of tracking the threats to supply/demand balance and of guiding treatment that can support the adequate oxygenation of tissue</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Simulation is used to evaluate the future performance of water supply headworks systems. Typically, most of the uncertainties associated with the use of demand models are ignored in the simulation. A simulation methodology is presented which makes allowance for the uncertainties associated with the use of demand and streamflow models. The demand uncertainties considered are natural, climatic, socioeconomic, and model parameter uncertainty. The methodology is illustrated using two case studies which consider a simple stationary demand model and the widely used trend extrapolation demand model. The results show that ignoring demand uncertainties (as well as streamflow model parameter uncertainty) can significantly bias the expected reliability. This bias depends on the magnitude of demand uncertainty which in turn depends on model structure, length of data available for calibration, and uncertainty in future socioeconomic variables. Moreover, this bias tends to increase as streamflow variability decreases. To guard against overoptimistic assessment of system performance, it is suggested that allowance be made for demand uncertainty (as well as streamflow model parameter uncertainty) in headworks simulation.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to assess the importance of the arterial blood supply to liver structure after orthotopic liver transplantation with advanced morphometric methods. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in male Lewis rats, of which 11 underwent reconstruction of the hepatic artery and 11 did not. A group of untreated controls (n = 5) and a group of animals with hepatic artery ligation (n = 4) were included. Eight weeks after surgery liver tissue was harvested and subjected to systematic random sampling. A point-counting method was used, volume fractions of tissue components were determined. Liver samples from rats that underwent hepatic artery reconstruction had preserved lobular architecture, and estimated bile duct (0.71% ± 0.33% [S.D.]) and connective tissue (1.89% ± 0.52%) volumes were not significantly different from those of controls (bile duct, 0.34% ± 0.17%; connective tissue, 0.70% ± 0.07%). In contrast, liver samples from rats that did not undergo hepatic artery reconstruction showed bile duct proliferation (7.19% ± 4.83%; p &lt; 0.05) and an increase in connective tissue volume (7.54% ± 3.68%; p &lt;0.05) associated with a decrease in hepatocyte volume (controls, 87.3% ± 0.3%; rats that underwent arterialization, 85.5% ± 1.0%; rats that did not undergo arterialization, 73.2% ± 8.2% [p &lt; 0.05]). Interestingly, hepatic artery ligation had no significant effect on any parameter. These findings show that in contrast to orthotopic liver transplantation with arterialization, orthotopic liver transplantation without arterialization may lead to derangement of liver structure, thus demonstrating the crucial role of an intact arterial supply for the biliary tree in orthotopic liver transplantation. The lack of change with hepatic artery ligation may indicate the presence of an additional arterial supply to the bile duct under normal conditions.

A series of supplementary feeding experiments on lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus) is used in conjunction with a new technique to measure pectoral muscle protein levels in live birds to investigate the relationships between food supply, body condition, and clutch size. Comparisons across treatments revealed a positive relationship between the level of flight muscle protein at the start of laying and clutch size, but not egg size. In a year when the clutch sizes of unfed birds were reduced, suggesting low food availability, gulls provided with a protein supplement had higher levels of flight muscle protein at the start of laying and laid larger clutches than birds that received no food supplement. In contrast, gulls provided with an additional energy source (fat) did not attain higher protein levels or lay larger clutches than unfed gulls. In a second year, when unfed gulls laid larger clutches, which were typical for the species, supplements of two different protein types (fish and egg) had no effect on clutch size, though egg-fed females laid considerably (10%) larger eggs. However, there were no detectable differences in condition between treatments at the start of laying, suggesting that though flight muscle protein levels may be of importance in determining clutch size, they may be of lesser significance for egg size, which may be largely influenced by dietary intake. </jats:p>",

During exercise, heart rate, respiratory rate, respiratory minute volume, and oxygen consumption increased and after 3 min reached steady‐state values, which depended on work load. The except was respiratory rate (which reached a maximum already at the lowest speed) and oxygen extraction rate (which remained at basal level during exercise, but in part decreased after walking).

Sustained (approximately 2-4 h) restriction of renal portal blood flow attenuates the autoregulatory responses. The present study was designed to assess the effects of acute (approximately 10 min) alterations of renal portal blood flow on renal function, and to dissociate the renal responses to altered renal portal blood flow from the renal responses to reductions in RAPP. The thermal pulse decay (TPD) technique and p-aminohippuric acid clearance (CPAH) were used to measure blood flow. During acute increases and decreases in renal portal blood flow, regional renal blood flow as measured by the TPD system (RBFTPD) was significantly positively correlated with total kidney blood flow represented by CPAH (RBFPAH). These results indicate that changes in total kidney blood flow induced by alteration of portal perfusion were reflected in the regional measurement of renal blood flow. Changes in renal portal blood flow did not affect the urine flow rate (UFR), GFR, or fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). Reducing RAPP from 120 to 50 mmHg significantly reduced UFR, GFR, and FENa. Overall, these results indicate that large acute changes in renal portal blood flow can significantly alter total renal blood flow without significantly affecting parameters (UFR, GFR, and FENa) primarily influenced by the renal arterial vasculature. </jats:p>",
