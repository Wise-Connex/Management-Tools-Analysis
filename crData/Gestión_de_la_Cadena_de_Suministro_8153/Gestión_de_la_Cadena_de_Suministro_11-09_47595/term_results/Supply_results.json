The emerging paradigm of joint water supply projects between communities in rural Cameroon and large corporations, with both parties as principal beneficiaries (unlike self-help projects where the principal beneficiary is the community), is examined. Our findings, based on the Mautu community and the Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC) joint project, suggest that this paradigm can be an attractive alternative for rural communities to gain access to piped water systems. However, to ensure long term performance of the rural community's distribution network, the more experienced corporate partner should negotiate a fair agreement, integrate capacity building for operation and maintenance, and include future growth and increased demand in the design of the community's network. Significant inequity during design of the supply to the two partners can lead to the dysfunction of the community system and trigger the perception of profiteering by the corporate partner resulting in subsequent vandalism. It is recommended that such joint partnerships be regulated and that local institutions working with rural communities should educate them on available support services.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many water providers in urban developing country contexts have to supply the water intermittently due to the disparity between rapidly growing demand and investment in supply infrastructure. This can lead to water quality risks such as ingress of polluted groundwater and unsafe household storage. This study has investigated the common risks and possible alternative solutions down the supply chain in the Nagpur municipal piped network through quantitative and qualitative data collection. The water quality testing indicated a significant reduction in water quality between tap and point-of-use. Interviews and a sanitary survey indicated storage design, inappropriate extraction practice and children's access as the most frequent household storage risks. The people with socio-economically lower status were found to be in greatest need of interventions. The study leads to the following recommendations: there is a need for the evolution of a Water Safety Plan to enable supportive structures for good risk assessment which includes all stakeholders from source to point-of-use; community awareness of water quality risks needs to be raised; low cost ‘improved’ water storage at household level should be promoted; and the levels of residual chlorine should be investigated and adjustments made to assure potable water at point-of-use.</jats:p>",

Because the satisfaction degree of FLSPs the cost of integrators needs to be considered in the process of order allocation, and the inventory cost of capacity does not exist, it is different from the issue of capacity allocation planning of manufacture supply chain. Meanwhile, the match of different kinds of logistics service capacity must be considered for the reason of the integrated feature of logistics service. Additionally, cost is not the most important decision objective because of the characteristics of demand uncertainty and weak economy. Accordingly, this paper considers these issues.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<p>In Europe and other advanced medical communities, medical gases are generally supplied by pipeline, with cylinders available as back up. Large hospitals usually have oxygen supplied and stored in liquid form, since one volume of it provides 840 volumes of gaseous oxygen at 15◦C. It is stored in a secure Vacuum Insulated Evaporator (VIE) on the hospital site. The arrangement is shown in Figure 22.1. The VIE consists of an insulated container, the inner layer of which is made of stainless steel, the outer of which is made of carbon steel. The liquid oxygen is stored in the inner container at about−160◦C (lower than the critical temperature of−118◦C) at a pressure of between 700 and 1200 kPa. There is a vapour withdrawal line at the top of the VIE, from which oxygen vapour can go via a restrictor to a superheater, where the gas is heated towards ambient temperature. Where demand exceeds supply from this route, there is also a liquid withdrawal line from the bottom of the VIE, from which liquid oxygen can be withdrawn; the liquid can be made to join the vapour line downstream of the restrictor and pass either through the superheater or back to the top of the VIE. The liquid can also be made to pass through an evaporator before joining the vapour line. After passing through the superheater, the oxygen vapour is passed through a series of pressure regulators to drop the pressure down to the distribution pipeline pressure of 410 kPa. It should be remembered that no insulation is perfect and there is a pressure relief valve on top of the VIE in case lack of demand and gradual temperature rise results in a pressure build up in the container. There is a filling port and there is usually considerable wastage in filling the VIE; the delivery hose needs to be cooled to below the critical temperature, using the tanker liquid oxygen itself to cool the delivery pipe. The whole VIE device is mounted on a hinged weighing scale and is situated outside the hospital building, protected by a caged enclosure, which also houses two banks of reserve cylinders.</p>",

First, the specificity of E. histolytica PCR detection was verified by using species-specific primers of 16S-like rRNA genes to clearly differentiate it from the closely related amoebae species E. dispar and E. moshkovskii. The sensitivity of this method was subsequently determined using purified E. histolytica genomic DNA and culture cells as PCR reaction templates. Results indicated that conventional PCR visualized on 1% agarose gel was able to detect as low as 0.02 pg genomic DNA and 5 cells, while real-time PCR could detect 0.01 pg genomic DNA and 2 cells of E. histolytica. The protocols for E. histolytica PCR detection in real water samples were then optimized by spiking E. histolytica cells into tap water and reservoir raw water samples. A two-round centrifugation treatment to concentrate amoeba cells directly as a PCR template was the most effective way to detect E. histolytica in spiked tap water samples, while DNA extraction after concentrating amoeba cells was required for spiked reservoir raw water samples. The detection limit of 50 E. histolytica cells in 100 ml tap water was achieved in 2 h from sample collection to real-time PCR data readout. With these established protocols, 78 tap water samples, 11 reservoir raw water samples and 4 feed water samples from Singapore water supply systems were analyzed by both conventional PCR and real-time PCR methods. No E. histolytica cell was detected in tested samples.</jats:p>",

The supply chain concept helps underpin global commerce. In the fishery data arena, it is an underutilized tool that could benefit the business of fishery advice. Supply chain networks can lower operating costs and increase product availability, agility, and customer satisfaction. The EU's Data Collection Framework has consolidated and strengthened data collection in Europe, but inadequate data management undermines many stock assessments of fish through the lack of supply chaining. Commercial supply chain know-how, when implemented on solid enterprise architectures, can endow fishery advice with industrial-strength scrutiny, making it transparent, standardized, integrated, agile, consistent, accurate, and timely.</jats:p>",

Gender differences in labor market are a problem of many countries. Being a larger demographic group, women have played a vital role in employment and economic development. Despite longstanding striving for gender equality, the inequality manifests itself in labor markets around the world. There is no common opinion on the reasons of the existence of gender differences in economic literature. After decades of research most investigators would agree that there can be no single-factor explanation for gender inequality in the labor market. One of the conventional explanations of gender gap in employment sphere includes the differences in men’s and women’s preferences in working hours due their stereotypical roles in the private and public life. This paper is focused on the study of gender feature of time allocation and its impact on the labor supply by men and women. For this purpose, based on the different types of activity, particular: income getting or in­co­me increasing promote activity, non-monetary inco­me obtain activity, income-make activity, non-income-make activity, indirect-receipts activity, the author introduces the time allocation model which includes parameters such as working time, leisure, non-working time, using time, free time and time for satisfying an individual’s physiological needs. For the attribution of different types of practice to certain kinds of activity the “principle of dominant purpose of activity” was offered. According to given time allocation model, the  pattern of features of labor supply by men and women is offered in the paper.</jats:p>"

This survey considers eleven Minoan settlements on the eastern part of Crete and is based upon a field assessment of the water technologies. While water systems had a monumental role in the life of the Minoans there has been little understanding of these ancient systems. Partially this can be explained by the multiple levels of modifications to the original structures since the demise of the Minoan civilization. In addition, post-excavation activities on archaeological sites obscure and mask features of the ancient structures making it difficult to discern their original purposes. Today, Minoan water technologies can serve as models for sustainable water management and adaptation to climatic fluctuations. Our present day practice of designing water systems in many developed parts of the world has forgotten the more sustainable practices, based upon traditional knowledge, such as rainfall water harvesting, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. In many developing parts of the world people overlook the technologies and know how that was used thousands of years ago by ancient civilizations, such as the Minoans. How do we overcome these modern day shortcomings and strive for water resources sustainability? Possibly one way is to study the past.</jats:p>",

Due to the hydrogeological setting in these parts of Germany many of the small water works with an average capacity of 50 m3/h have to treat raw water extracted from karstic or cliffy aquifers. These raw waters tend to be contaminated with particles and pathogens acquired during snowmelt or after strong rainfalls. In the last decade ultrafiltration has become the technology of choice for the removal of the aforementioned contaminants. Flux decline caused by unanticipated membrane fouling is the main limitation for the application of ultrafiltration membranes. This paper describes how membrane fouling phenomena can be predicted by using a statistical approach based on data from large scale filtration systems in combination with field and lab experiments on raw water quality and membrane performance. The data defines water quality and respective fouling phenomena both in technical scale filtration plants and in lab experiments of eleven different raw waters. The method described here is more economically feasible for small water works when compared to typical pilot experiments that are used for high capacity water works.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Centrica's analysis of business risk confirmed several years ago that reliance on key contractors and its supply chain brought significant threats to the business. Centrica's business model reflects a similar exposure to that faced by other operators in relation to the dependency upon the major contracting companies, although Centrica also \"contracts out\" duty holdership of two of its producing platforms in the North Sea. We therefore recognized quite early on in our business continuity management programme that we could be exposed to an operational disruption through one of our key suppliers not having effective plans in place to cope with an incident that causes an unexpected loss of resource. During the past 3 years we have carried out regular supplier continuity reviews, with some interesting results. This paper outlines the issues and risks that should be understood by other operators and their suppliers to ensure that, as an industry, we can safeguard our credibility and the continuity of operations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Practical interview, workshop and exercise methods have been effectively utilized to gain an appreciation of the maximum levels of service disruption that we could be exposed to. Our key contractors are scored on their level of business continuity preparedness. Appropriate risk mitigation activity was then identified to help reduce the likelihood or impact of a serious disruption to our operations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This ongoing review has proved extremely useful for our management team to appreciate the actual state of preparedness of key contractors and identify any weak links in the supply chain. A common attitude expressed by suppliers showed an element of \"risk blindness\", often stated as: \"we will just deal with the situation, should it ever happen\". It is essential that the benefits of pre-planning become more widely appreciated, otherwise our industry could face some unwelcome impacts as the result of future incidents.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Being seen to manage an effective response and recovery, when faced with an unexpected event, is not only important for the credibility and sustainability of individual organizations but also for their customers, partners and the industry as a whole. This paper also includes some useful learning points in relation to how other industries have successfully addressed business continuity in their supply chains.</jats:p>",

Being a channel leader the first manufacturer’s role becomes a little sophisticated. That is, being the traditional retailer’s supplier and competing with the traditional retailer’s on the internet at the same time. Besides, as an online competitor the second manufacturer’s channel status could go steadily up as electronic market becomes more mature institutionally. This paper compares two kinds of game models corresponding to two different channel statuses in supply chain partners, which means a weakest traditional retailer or a weakest online manufacturer separately. It finds two models’ existence conditions of supply chain partners’ optimal revenues, optimal decision variables, etc. By numerical analysis it especially analyzes their channel pervasion effects, at the same time, it gives some useful managerial inspiration further.</jats:p>"

Head driven analysis (HDA) of water distribution networks allows for the pressure-dependent nature of nodal flows and, therefore, yields the actual nodal flows and heads for both normal and subnormal pressure conditions. Hence, HDA simulation models are more practical than demand driven analysis models that assume that all demands are satisfied in full even under pressure-deficient conditions. This paper describes an approach in which a new pressure-dependent demand function that has no discontinuities has been incorporated in the Gradient Method. The procedure has been tested extensively and demonstrated to be capable of effectively simulating both normal and pressure-deficient operating conditions. The algorithm's convergence is smooth and rapid thanks to a line search and backtracking procedure that ensures progress towards the solution in each iteration. The results presented herein would appear to confirm that the proposed method is robust and efficient. Results for a real network are also included.</jats:p>",

Structural breakpoint or stability of the variables and impulse responses are also conducted in this study. The econometric analysis is done by using the time series data of the variable of interest which is collected from the secondary sources. The study has empirically tested the hypothesis and long run relationship and casualty between variables of the models. The study findings reveal that the trend growth rate of aggregate export is higher in post-liberalization period as compared to the pre-liberalization period. The Cointegration analysis shows that all the variables of the study are cointegrated at their first differences meaning that there exists long run relationship among the variables.</jats:p>"

This paper conducts the research on the business excellence measurement of supply chains, where \"collaboration degree\" (CD) and \"service level\" (SL) are introduced to represent the supply chain's immediate and long-term yields respectively. As a result, an integrated indicator named \"business excellence indicator\" (BEI) is obtained to quantitatively evaluate the supply chain's overall business advantage.

However, only a few companies have taken a further step to develop a hydraulic model based on GIS, and Zhengzhou Water Supply Corporation is one of them. The WaterGEMS V8 XM from Bentley is used to develop the hydraulic model for the water distribution network in Zhengzhou city, which has a population of over 3 million. During establishment of the model, some of the data extracted from GIS are missing, abnormal, and redundant and require careful screening, searching, and judging. Model calibration is performed after a sensitivity analysis. Peaking factor and pipe roughness coefficient are key model parameters to calibrate. In calibrating peaking factors, the distribution system is divided into 5 operation districts with different types of water usage. To calibrate pipe roughness coefficients, the system was divided into 4 water supply districts with different attributes of pipelines. Finally, a case study of pipe layout evaluation it shows the hydraulic model to be a powerful tool for water supply management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditionally, the members of a supply chain compete to reduce their individual costs. However, as collaborative supply chain approach is urged within industries to reduce the overall costs, either full cooperation or partial coopetition is considered by the members. In cooperative approach, members benefit from lower overall costs and lower cost variations. But individually, some seem better off in a competitive approach in a single period considering their local costs. Coopetition, or partial cooperation, may be suggested as a compromise to lower overall supply chain costs, while members choose alliances towards lower average costs and cost variations.A multi-stage, multi-member, multi-product and single period supply chain model is considered with deterministic demand, capacity and cost. Product prices are assumed to be constant. The objective is to minimize total production and distribution costs of the overall chain. Four distinct cases are considered, modeled, simulated and compared. These cases are complete competition, integrated cooperation, two-stage supply chain partition, and partial coopetition. Quantitative conclusions from the cost performance ratios are drawn using the simulation results.</jats:p>"

Each of those stakeholders can both affect and be affected by the way a project is managed, and none of them usually has the power or the ability to coordinate project supply chains. However, the existing literature on supply chain management does not provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for describing or explaining the coordination of construction project supply chains. This paper discusses the role of three different theoretical perspectives for understanding the inter-firm coordination process of project supply chains in the construction industry: the Theory of Coordination, the Transaction Cost Theory and the Language-Action Perspective. The contribution of each theoretical approach is pointed out in the paper, and their complementary role is illustrated in a case study carried out in a petrochemical construction project in Brazil.</jats:p>"

Products defined as innovative in Fisher's taxonomy correspond to disposed products with high residual value, whereas functional products correspond to disposed products with low residual value. Furthermore, the PRV and the speed at which returned products lose their value are considered in order to determine the configuration of the reverse supply chain that allows for recapturing most of the PRV. These notions have then been tested by analyzing two reverse supply chains with a case study research methodology.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The findings show that low PRV is associated with second‐class recovery options (recycling and energy recovery) and that high PRV is associated with first‐class recovery options (reconditioning and remarketing). When the recovery option is recycling, time is not relevant, the primary objective is cost reduction (efficiency), the chain is centralized, and actors and phases of the reverse chain are determined by the specificity of the recycling process. When the recovery option is reconditioning, time is primarily relevant, tradeoffs between costs and time efficiency are necessary, the chain presents a centralized structure, and the presence of other types of actors and phases influences the structure of the reverse supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The focus is restricted to the industry of electrical and electronic products.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Based on the outcome of the study, managers are able to determine the basic prerequisites for the design of their reverse supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Previous literature suggests that when the PRV is high, early product differentiation is necessary, and the chain is therefore decentralized.

Temporal and spatial variations in rainfall in different basins greatly affect water supply and demand in inter-basin water transfer projects, leading to risks to the operation of the water transfer projects. This paper applies a Bayesian network model to analyze this risk and studies the rich–poor rainfall encounter risk between a water source area and water receiving areas in the middle route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project in China. Real time scenario simulations with the input of new observations were also studied. The results show that the rich–poor rainfall encounter risk is high for the Tangbai River receiving area in the fourth quarter, for the Huai River and South of Hai River receiving area in the second quarter, and for the North of the Hai River receiving area in the fourth and first quarters. The scenario simulations reflect risk change in the operation of water transfer projects, providing scientific decision support for the management of the water resource distribution in the inter-basin water transfer projects.</jats:p>",

But cost minimizing is only one of the demands placed on network design. Satisfactory networks are required to operate above a minimum level even if they experience failure of components. Reliable hydraulic performance can be achieved if sufficient redundancy is built in the network. This has given rise to various water distribution system optimization methods including genetic algorithms and other evolutionary computing methods. Evolutionary computing approaches frequently assess the suitability of enormous numbers of potential solutions for which the calculation of accurate reliability measures could be computationally prohibitive. Therefore, surrogate reliability measures are frequently used to ease the computational burden. The aim of this paper is to assess the correlation of surrogate reliability measures in relation to more accurate measures. The surrogate measures studied are statistical entropy, network resilience, resilience index and modified resilience index. The networks were simulated with the prototype software PRAAWDS that produces more realistic results for pressure-deficient water distribution systems. Statistical entropy outperformed resilience index in this study. The results also demonstrate there is a strong correlation between entropy and failure tolerance.</jats:p>",

Contrary to the ‘competition’ hypothesis prediction of a negative reaction, it is found that marginal supply Granger-cause existing house prices in a positive manner. The effect is robust to the inclusion of exogenous demand factors as well as price interaction in the primary (new houses) and secondary (existing houses) market segments. The ‘contagion’ effect is consistent with the hypothesis that developers, due to their ability to predict the market, are price leaders in the housing market. It is also found that homebuilders exhibit ‘herding’ behaviour in mimicking each other’s timing on when to market their new residential projects. </jats:p>",

However, such systems lost popularity to rapid sand filters mainly due to smaller land requirements and less sensitivity to water quality variations. SSF is still a particularly attractive process because its operation does not require chemicals or electricity. It can achieve a high level of treatment, which is mainly attributed to naturally-occurring, biochemical processes in the filter. Several microbiologically-mediated purification mechanisms (e.g. predation, scavenging, adsorption and bio-oxidation) have been hypothesised or assumed to occur in the biofilm that forms in the filter but these have not yet been comprehensively verified. Thus, SSFs are operated as ‘black boxes’ and knowledge gaps pertaining to the underlying ecology and ecophysiology limit the design and optimisation of the technology. The objective of this review is to outline the biological aspects of SSF in to the context of recent developments in molecular microbial ecology.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The third edition of the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality establishes a ‘Framework for Safe Drinking-water’ that promotes a risk assessment and risk management approach called Water Safety Plan (WSP). In Germany, the discussion on the WSP approach started with significant scepticism by various stakeholders questioning its added value in light of the high quality and service level of water supply. In response, the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Environment Agency and the DVGW Association for Gas and Water jointly took the leadership for initiating a sectoral dialogue process involving water suppliers and local public health offices, including a series of WSP pilot projects to evaluate WSP feasibility, benefits and expected challenges for scaling-up. As the regulatory system in Germany makes explicit reference to ‘generally acknowledged codes of good practice’ the paper also examines how far the suite of established DVGW technical and managerial standards already supports WSP implementation. The evaluation process confirmed an added value of the WSP approach under Germany's national conditions, clearly providing an impetus for safeguarding a high quality and service level of drinking-water supply. Various activities to support scale-up implementation of a WSP-type approach have been initiated, including the preparation of step-by-step guidance in German (i.e. DVGW Guidelines W 1001), information campaigns to broadly raise awareness amongst all stakeholders in water supply, and capacity building initiatives.</jats:p>",

For this study, 200 households with at least one pre-school child were surveyed. Women’s non-market time does not depend on their husband’s wage; but both housework and child care of other adults—particularly female adults—respond positively to an increase in the wife’s labour force participation. The decision to buy formal child care is affected by the age of children, cost of day-care centres, household income, types of occupation and level of education and quality of child care. Quality child-care services increase female labour force participation. Moreover, if child care is more affordable, more mothers would participate in the labour force. Governments can embrace this argument. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study provides evidence concerning the impact of anticipated and unanticipated components of the weekly money supply announcements on stock market returns in the United States and Canada on the date after the announcement. The innovative aspect of this study is the use of a multiprocess mixture model recently proposed by Gordon and Smith (1990) for modeling time series that are subject to several forms of potential discontinuous change and outliers. The technique involves running multiple models in parallel with recursive Bayesian updating procedures which extend the standard Kalman filter. The results provide strong evidence in favor of the efficient markets hypothesis that only the unanticipated component of the money supply announcement influences the stock market returns in both the United States and Canada.The use of OLS estimated in the present study produces results which suggest that both anticipated and unanticipated components of the money supply announcement exert a statistically significant influence on stock market returns in both countries. In contract, the multiprocess mixture model estimation method produces results which support the efficient markets hypothesis. The difference in findings between OLS and multiprocess estimation methods is attributed to the ability of the multiprocess techniques to model discontinuous structural shifts in the parameters and accommodate outliers in the stock return-weekly money relationship. The multiprocess mixture method provides evidence that numerous discontinuities and outliers exist in the stock market returns-weekly money relation and produces posterior probabilities for the multiple models running in parallel. These probabilities suggest that the OLS model has low posterior probability relative to the structural shift and outlier models which suggest poor inferences regarding the significance of anticipated and unanticipated money arise from the use of OLS estimation techniques.</jats:p>"

Nanofiltration (NF) has a great potential to remove these contaminants. The main objective of this work is to study the influence on the rejection of phenol by a NF90 2540 NF membrane of various operating conditions: pressure (0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 × 106 N/m2); phenol feed concentration (from 0.025 kg/m3 up to 0.150 kg/m3) and pH (from 5.9 to 11.5). The influence of organic fouling is also investigated. Results showed that when different phenol concentrations were compared at the same pressure, permeate fluxes decreased as phenol concentrations increased (from 20% for the highest phenol feed concentration tested to 10% for the lowest); when phenol concentration increased, phenol was probably adsorbed onto the membrane, which led to lower rejection values (from 78 to 59% rejection). Changes in the pH of the solution altered the phenol dissociation equilibrium and membrane rejection characteristics. The reduction in phenol rejection by organic fouling (maximum of 35%) was a consequence of the materials deposited onto the membrane, which led to the formation of a cake layer.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>NO (nitric oxide) may be involved in fluid homoeostasis. We hypothesized that increases in NO synthesis contribute to acute, saline-induced natriuresis, which, therefore, should be blunted when NO availability is stabilized. Young men were studied during simultaneous infusions of L-NAME [NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester; bolus of 750 μg·kg−1 of body weight and 8.3 μg·min−1·kg−1 of body weight] and SNP (sodium nitroprusside), the latter at a rate preventing L-NAME from increasing total peripheral resistance (‘NO-clamping’). Slow volume expansion (saline, 20 μmol of NaCl·min−1·kg−1 of body weight for 3 h) was performed with and without concomitant NO-clamping. NO-clamping itself decreased RPF (renal plasma flow; P~0.02) and tended to decrease arterial blood pressure [MABP (mean arterial blood pressure)]. Volume expansion markedly decreased the plasma levels of renin, AngII (angiotensin II) and aldosterone (all P&amp;lt;0.001), while MABP (oscillometry), heart rate, cardiac output (impedance cardiography), RPF (by p-aminohippurate), GFR [glomerular filtration rate; by using 51Cr-labelled EDTA] and plasma [Na+] and [K+] remained constant. Volume expansion increased sodium excretion (P&amp;lt;0.02) at constant filtered load, but more so during NO-clamping than during control (+184% compared with 52%; P&amp;lt;0.0001). Urinary nitrate/nitrite excretion increased during volume expansion; plasma cGMP and plasma vasopressin were unchanged. The results demonstrate that NO-clamping augments sodium excretion in response to volume expansion at constant MABP and GFR, reduced RPF and decreased renin system activity, a response termed hypernatriuresis. The results indicate that mediator(s) other than MABP, RPF, GFR and renin system activity contribute significantly to the homoeostatic response to saline loading, but the specific mechanisms of hypernatriuresis remain obscure.</jats:p>",

Recent guidelines and position papers for the industry by the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency stress the necessity of mechanistic insights into large‐scale bioreactors. A detailed mechanistic view of their practically relevant subsystems is required as well as their mutual interactions, i.e., mixing or homogenization of the culture broth and sufficient mass and heat transfer. In large‐scale bioreactors for animal‐cell cultures, different agitation systems are employed. Here, we discuss details of the flows induced in stirred tank reactors relevant for animal‐cell cultures. In addition, solutions of the governing fluid dynamic equations obtained with the so‐called computational fluid dynamics are presented. Experimental data obtained with improved measurement techniques are shown. The results are compared to previous studies and it is found that they support current hypotheses or models. Progress in improving insights requires continuous interactions between more accurate measurements and physical models. The paper aims at promoting the basic mechanistic understanding of transport phenomena that are crucial for large‐scale animal‐cell culture reactors.</jats:p>",

The majority of households obtain water from public standpipes or from neighbors who are connected to the municipal network. Water resale is often prohibited, however, because of concerns about affordability and risks to public health. Using data collected from 1,377 households in Maputo, Mozambique, we compare the microbiological quality, as well as the time and money costs of water supply from individual house connections, public standpipes, and water obtained from neighbors. Households with their own water connections have better service across virtually all indicators measured, and express greater satisfaction with their service, as compared with those using other water sources. Households purchasing water from their neighbors pay lower time and money costs per liter of water, on average, as compared with those using standpipes. Resale competes favorably with standpipes along a number of service quality dimensions; however, after controlling for water supply characteristics, households purchasing water from neighbors are significantly less likely to be satisfied with their water service as compared with those using standpipes.</jats:p>",

This results in a focus on succedent interdependencies, a focus on coordination by planning and a restricted view of likely positioning options. This article contributes an original approach to the supply chain management (SCM) debate, based on value configuration analysis (VCA). VCA recognizes the value chain logic (VCL), but finds it restraining in particular business systems, and also includes recognition of the value network model (VNM) as representing the layered supply chain relationships (SCRs) classically related with a mediating presence. In general, this article contributes in two ways: by enlightening some of the complexities to be addressed in managing SCRs and by looking at how SCRs function despite this complexity. In particular, it presents an alternative view of how value creation happens between, as well as within, firms in SCRs. It discloses how more complex sets of supply chain interdependencies exist in SCRs than in simple chains, and that these necessitate managing by a variety of coordination machineries to achieve efficient working. Finally, it suggests a novel way to define a firm’s supply chain position beyond that covered by the conventional upstream/downstream terms. These arguments are illustrated with the help of a case study and are related to previous work on supply chains and networks. </jats:p>",

Much of the earlier research was carried out on supply networks — mostly focused on strong lead-manufacturing firms producing mass-produced consumer goods. More recently, attention has been paid to a new model of industrial organization based on systems integration being adopted by many of the world's leading firms, particularly those in high-technology sectors [Hobday et al. (2005)]. The key role of systems integrator is usually played by a prime contractor or a dominant manufacturer.</jats:p><jats:p>However, there are sectors where structural problems inhibit both the innovation and the development of supply networks and where it is not obvious who should play the systems integrator role. The UK construction sector has long been characterized as fragmented with much of the industry continuing to be structured and constrained by the contracting model that emerged in the early 19th century with the emergence of the professions. These structural problems are often held to contribute to the perceived poor record of innovation in the sector [Winch (1998); Gann et al. (1992)].</jats:p><jats:p>This paper analyzes how BAA, a major airport operator and construction client, developed and managed a network of suppliers to deliver both its portfolio of routine capital construction projects and one-off complex mega projects. To achieve its objectives, BAA sets about implementing ways of improving the efficiency of its ongoing capital projects that would enable them to show continuous improvement in performance whilst simultaneously developing the project capabilities required to manage the massive T5 project. These developments enabled BAA to address issues of predictability at the same time as providing an environment that encouraged innovation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Atherosclerosis (AS) is a systemic cardiovascular disease with complicated pathogenesis involving oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation. Increasing lines of evidence have questioned the statins‐dominated treatment for AS, including their dangerous side‐effects such as the breakdown of muscle when taken in larger doses. A multifaceted approach that addresses all major risk factors or pathological targets may provide an ideal treatment for AS. Studies of the herbal remedies on the prevention and treatment of AS have received much attention in recent years. This review summarizes some important experimental findings regarding their mechanisms of action on AS. Using the pre‐set PUBMED searching syntax and inclusion criteria, representative citations published in English concerning the experimental studies of 14 herbal materials were included. We found that many extracts and (or) single compounds from these herbal materials, such as<jats:italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Curcuma longa</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Rheum undulatum</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Panax notoginseng</jats:italic>, could regulate multiple key targets involved in the initiation and propagation of AS. Some important findings about the effects of herbal formulations on AS were also reviewed. Given the complicated nature of AS and the holistic, combinational approach of herbal remedies, we propose that mixed herbal preparations with multiple active ingredients may be preferable for the prevention and treatment of AS. Further rigorously designed pharmacological evaluation and multi‐centred clinical trials are warranted. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In contrast, the Holocene evolution of the Kosi Lagoon, South Africa (an incised coastal plain river valley) took place under very low sedimentation rates which have produced a distinctive stratigraphy and contemporary sedimentary environments. The findings are based on a synthesis of the results of studies of seismic stratigraphy, sediment distribution, morphodynamics and geomorphology. Barrier migration was prevented by a high pre‐Holocene dune barrier against which Holocene coastal deposits accumulated in an aggradational sequence. Holocene evolution of the back barrier involved: (i) drowning of the incised valley; (ii) wave‐induced modification of the back‐barrier shoreline leading to segmentation during the highstand; and (iii) marine sedimentation adjacent to the tidal inlet. Segmentation has divided the estuary into a series of geochemically and sedimentologically distinctive basins connected by channels in the estuarine barriers. The seismic stratigraphy of the back barrier essentially lacks a transgressive systems tract, shoreline modification and deposition having been accomplished during the highstand. The lack of historical geomorphological change suggests that the system has achieved morphological equilibrium with ambient energy conditions and low sediment supply. This study presents a classification for estuarine incised valley fills based on the balance between sea‐level rise and sedimentation in which Kosi represents a ‘give‐up’ estuary where much of the relict incised channel form is drowned and preserved. It exhibits a fundamentally different set of evolutionary processes and stratigraphic sequences to those of the better known incised valley systems in which sedimentation either keeps pace with sea‐level (‘keep‐up’ estuaries) or occurs after initial drowning (‘catch‐up’ estuaries).</jats:p>",

In this paper, we describe how the increasing of information released increases the overall economic results of the whole chain, and how this information can be protected, exploiting secure computation techniques, to reduce the risk of data disclosure and prevent quasi-altruistic or selfish behaviors without interfering with the chain's normal operation, and in particular with the minimization of the cost function. </jats:p>",

This dependence theoretically makes health care vulnerable to petroleum supply shifts, but this vulnerability has not been empirically assessed. We quantify key aspects of petroleum use in health care and explore historical associations between petroleum supply shocks and health care prices. These analyses confirm that petroleum products are intrinsic to modern health care and that petroleum supply shifts can affect health care prices. In anticipation of future supply contractions lasting longer than previous shifts and potentially disrupting health care delivery, we propose an adaptive management approach and outline its application to the example of emergency medical services. </jats:p>",

Unique anatomical functional properties of vessels and blood supply determine the susceptibility of the spinal cord to damage, especially ischemia. Spinal cord injury (SCI), for example, complicating thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair is associated with ischemic trauma. The rate of this devastating complication has been decreased significantly by instituting physiological methods of protection. Traumatic SCI causes complex changes in spinal cord blood flow, which are closely related to the severity of injury. Manipulating physiological parameters such as mean arterial blood pressure and intrathecal pressure may be beneficial for patients with an SCI. Studying the physiopathological processes of the spinal cord under vascular compromise remains challenging because of its central role in almost all of the body's hemodynamic and neurofunctional processes.</jats:p>",

It is unanimously acknowledged that for these farms it is not the support through supplementary income found in the 1st axis that gives a chance of survival (it rather piles difficulties up on them because of the additional cost of administration and protection of the environment), which is rather helpful for the producers of large quantities in complying with the processes of world markets, but it is the support given for the maintenance of the environment and the programmes serving to strengthen connection to the local and regional markets that can produce results (presently 2nd axis). The endeavours mentioned above provide some possibilities of protection and long-term survival of multifunctional, small size family farms, which at the same time produce quality goods, and of warding the hectic changes in the free markets off. Among the countries of Western Europe, it is France that could provide especially useful examples in the course of reformation of the European support system, because the French government and the rural stakeholders have been following their aim, almost for two decades, of the effective development of direct selling (in French vente directe) and short food provision systems (in French circuits courts) through which they preserve those agricultural structures that are built on family connections. The subject of this paper is adaptation possibilities of the French direct marketing model, which evolved for the preservation of multifunctional family farms and warding of the hectic changes in marketing conditions off. It provided proof in the past decade that it is not only the intensive industrial production that can be competitive and viable, but also the small size, multifunctional farms, close to nature, that support one or two families, can provide effective perspectives for the renewal of the prime sector and the agriculture of Europe. If the good practices of Western Europe, and within it France, can be employed in the region of the Eastern and Central Europe, this will contribute to the reduction of distances between country areas, to the uplift of those areas that lag behind and are subdued to a measure of poverty</jats:p>"

Nutrient management for crops must be improved. Yield gaps, indigenous nutrient supplies, and nutrient use efficiencies (NUEs) must be assessed to design management strategies for further yield increase. In this study, data from 1022 field experiments with wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic>L.) conducted between 2000 and 2008 in north central China, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and northwest China were analyzed. Treatments in these experiments consisted of a check without fertilizer use, an optimum nutrient application, the farmers’ practice, and a series of nutrient omission treatments. The results showed that gaps between attainable yields and yields in experimental plots with farmers’ practices averaged 0.76 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Indigenous nutrient supplies of N, P, and K averaged 133.0, 30.2, and 131.7 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively, in the regions studied. On a national scale and under optimum fertilization, agronomic efficiency of N, P, and K were 9.8, 19.2, and 7.2 kg kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, while recovery efficiencies were 37.9, 19.0, and 27.0%, respectively. Compared with values obtained 10 yr previous, agronomic efficiencies and recovery efficiencies determined between 2000 and 2008 were lower but also lower than world averages. Successive inputs of large amounts of nutrients significantly increased the indigenous nutrient supply and therefore are contributing to lower NUE because recommendations for N, P, and K have not been adjusted downward in China.</jats:p>",

In order to guarantee safe drinking water, it is important to be able to predict the reactors' performance to adjust the operating conditions to the actual influent water characteristics (like UV transmission) and lamp performance. Therefore, a design tool was developed, which is based on a kinetic model that describes and predicts the direct photolysis and oxidation of organic compounds in pilot experiments, using Low Pressure (LP) UV-lamps. This model has been combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), in order to be able to accurately predict the results of pilot and full scale installations, and also to design reactor systems. The model was applied to three model compounds (atrazine, ibuprofen and NDMA) in two different pilot reactors, and it has been shown that reactor performance can be fairly predicted by applying this ‘UVPerox’ model. The model takes into account the water quality and power of the lamps, and the properties of the compounds involved.</jats:p>",

The process is dependent on the activities of complex microbial communities in the biofilm (schmutzdecke) layer. In this study, we generated a comprehensive view of three-domain microbiological complexity within a model SSF. DNA was analysed using a high-density microarray (PhyloChip) and rRNA library analysis. The Eukaryotic community was dominated by Cercozoa (Ebridd-type protists); these are likely to be involved in predation of other organisms in the schmutzdecke layer, thus proving opportunity for successional development. Ciliate protozoa, green microalgae, stramenopiles, amoeboid protozoa and fungi in the Phylum Ascomycota and the deep-branching Chytridiomycota were also detected. The Archaeal community was dominated by Euryarchaeota, and most were Halobacteriales. These organisms may contribute to filter function through removal of dissolved organic carbon, a primary treatment goal of these filters. Given that the Eukaryotic and Archaeal communities were examined using clone libraries, the expected richness of taxa present is expected to be greater than detected here and dependent on sampling effort (library size). The bacterial community was rich in taxa (21 Phyla) but was not dominated by any phylogenetic group. The successful function of SSF's relies on interactions between taxa (e.g. grazing of Cercozoa protists on bacteria), and removal of dissolved organic matter from the influent. Understanding the taxa and functions in these systems will aid in monitoring and managing SSF for optimal water quality.</jats:p>",

This paper focuses on Chao Lake, a large, shallow eutrophic lake used as a source of drinking water. The study considers the possibilities of improving the lake monitoring system and developing a SCADA system to manage the emergencies relating to water quality in order to meet the need of ensuring safe drinking water to the population of Chaohu City. The paper is presented in sub-sections that reflect the multitasking nature of the study, which focused on: (a) upgrading the monitoring system at lake and water treatment plant levels and also applying remote sensing, to develop a SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) system using neural networks to support prompt and effective management of emergency situations; (b) upgrading water collection and treatment technologies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An adaptive nutrient control method for a plant factory is proposed. The method is based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) modified for a target in which the same state never comes back during a single episode and a reward is given after a very long delay. In application such as plant growth control, one episode takes a very long time period, and a rapid convergence to a prospective control solution is essential while an extensive exploration is needed since there is usually no precise model available. A method like reinforcement learning is useful for a problem having no reference model. But a necessity of exploration does not match the need for rapid convergence, and a new balancing method is needed. In this research, an average reward distribution method is proposed, which is similar to the profit sharing method but effects more extensively on finding much prospective early solutions, while guaranteeing to converge into a rational solution in a long run. An experiment is conducted in a simple plant factory system, which shows that at least standard reinforcement learning is insufficient for this type of problem. Computer simulations show that the method has good effects on acquiring prospective control policy at early stage comparing to a standard reinforcement learning and a profit sharing method.</jats:p>",
