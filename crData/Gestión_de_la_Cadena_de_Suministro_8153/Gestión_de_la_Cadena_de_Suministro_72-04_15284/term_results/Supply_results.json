      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The use of linear programming as a planning tool for determining the optimal long‐range development of an urban water supply system was explored. A stochastic trace of water demand was synthesized and used as an input to the model. This permitted evaluating the feasibility of imposing demand restrictions as an effective cost reduction mechanism. The City of Lincoln, Nebraska, was used as the urban model. The fundamental problem was to allocate limited water supplies from several sources to an urban load center to minimize costs and comply with system constraints. The study period covered twenty years, and findings indicate the planning direction for stage development during this period. Sensitivity analyses were performed on cost coefficients and demands. Thirteen sources were included in the initial computations. Conclusions were that linear programming and generated demand traces are useful tools for both short‐ and long‐term urban water supply planning. Lowering peak demands results in long‐range development of fewer sources of supply and more economic and efficient use of the supplies developed.</jats:p>",
