Goolsbee (1998) has used changes in investment tax incentives to identify whether this supply curve is significantly upward-sloping and has concluded that it is. This paper shows that investment tax incentives are a poor instrument for identifying this supply curve because they are spuriously correlated with supply shocks for equipment producers. Once input costs for equipment producers are controlled for, there is no evidence of a relationship between tax incentives and equipment prices. In fact, the evidence favors the interpretation that the supply curve is flat.</jats:p>"

This paper contrasts the effects \nof energetic efficiency differences between horses and \nhuman porters with productivity differences between European \nand Mesoamerican agricultural systems. Depending on strength \nand nutritional requirements, horses may be from one to \nfive times as efficient as human porters. Furthermore, \nhorses compete with humans for food. Where the horse played \na major transport role, one-third of available, arable \nland was devoted to oat production. With this in mind, \nI compare maize versus wheat productivity to show that \na unit of land in Mesoamerica could support up to twice \nas many people as the same unit of land in Europe. Thus, \nthe transport advantage enjoyed by European cities is essentially \noffset by a more intensive agricultural system in Mesoamerica.</jats:p>",

We consider three situations: (1) a traditional model where there is no information to the supplier prior to a demand to him except for past data; (2) the supplier knows the (s, S) policy used by the retailer as well as the end-item demand distribution; and (3) the supplier has full information about the state of the retailer. Order up-to policies continue to be optimal for models with information flow for the finite horizon, the infinite horizon discounted and the infinite horizon average cost cases. Study of these three models enables us to understand the relationships between capacity, inventory, and information at the supplier level, as well as how they are affected by the retailer’s (S − s) values and end-item demand distribution. We estimate the savings at the supplier due to information flow and study when information is most beneficial. </jats:p>",

Improvement in supply chain performance is often greatly separated by time (many months) and distance (many miles) from the action taken to trigger better customer service coupled with lower stockholdings. A global long‐term view must therefore be taken if we are to be sure that enhancement is real and permanent. This paper outlines the problem areas associated with supply chain dynamics and reviews a set of Supply Chain Material Flow Principles originally based on established results from simulation models and observation of good industrial practice. The paper further shows that these Principles were embedded in an Agile Manufacturing Program undertaken in order to re‐engineer a real‐world mechanical precision products global supply chain. Subsequent improvements in supply chain dynamics recorded include a 45 per cent reduction in global inventory and the damping of supply chain amplification patterns by up to 58 per cent.</jats:p>",

A detailed description of this phenomenon is given, including a summary of embryo development, egg-laying, juvenile hatching and development. It is demonstrated that low food supply significantly promotes the beginning of endotokia matricida but has no influence on the time scale of the process. The biological function of endotokia matricida and the intra-uterine induction of the dauer formation is discussed. Endotokia matricida in Heterorhabditis spp. is a well synchronised process of the destruction of the maternal tissues correlated with the juvenile development including the uptake of the symbiotic bacteria by the late pre-dauer stage. It secures the development of dauer juveniles at a moment when the external food supply is reducing and provides offspring which are well equipped with energy reserves and symbiotic bacteria for long term survival and subsequent infection of insects in the soil. Endotokia matricida bei Hermaphroditen von Heterorhabditis spp. und der Einfluss der Nahrungsversorgung . - Der Schlupf juveniler Nematoden im mutterlichen Uterus mit anschliessender Totung des Muttertieres (endotokia matricida) ist relativ weit verbreitet bei rhabditiden Nematoden und typisch fur entomopathogene Nematoden der Gattung Heterorhabditis. Die Endotokia matricida wird beschrieben sowie die Embryonalentwicklung, das Eilegeverhalten, der Schlupf und die Entwicklung der Juvenilen. Der Beginn der endotokia matricida wird durch eine niedrige Nahrungsverfugbarkeit in der Kultur signifikant gefordert, diese hat jedoch keinen Einfluss auf den zeitlichen Ablauf der endotokia matricida. Die biologische Funktion der endotokia matricida und die intra-uterine Induktion der Dauerlarvenbildung werden diskutiert. Die endotokia matricida bei Heterorhabditis spp. ist ein gut synchronisierter Prozess, bei dem die Zerstorung des Muttertiers korreliert mit der Entwicklung der Juvenilstadien, einschliesslich der Aufnahme der symbiotischen Bakterien durch das Pra-Dauer Stadium. Sie sichert die Entwicklung von Dauerlarven zu einem Zeitpunkt, wenn die externe Nahrungsversorgung sich verschlechtert und bringt so Nachkommen hervor, die gut mit Energiereserven und symbiotischen Bakterien ausgestattet sind, um im Boden lange zu uberdauern und Insekten zu befallen.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The composition of meats, fish, and eggs is dependent on animal feed. Fish‐meal, flax, and n‐3 from algae in animal feeds increase the n‐3 fatty acid content of egg yolks and lead to the availability of n‐3 fatty acidenriched eggs in the marketplace. Research is ongoing for the production of n‐3 fatty acid‐enriched products from poultry, beef, lamb, pork, milk, bakery products, etc. In the case of n‐3 fatty acid‐enriched eggs, the egg under complete natural conditions (Greek or Ampelistra egg) can serve as a guide for proper composition. Otherwise, the amount of n‐3 fatty acids is determined by the organoleptic properties of the products. It is essential in the process of returning the n‐3 fatty acids into the food supply that the balance of n‐6/n‐3 fatty acids in the diet that existed during evolution is maintained. Clinical investigations confirm the importance of n‐3 fatty acids for normal function during growth and development and in the modulation of chronic diseases. The availability of n‐3 fatty acid‐enriched products should lead to improvements in the food supply. Pregnant and lactating women and infants should benefit since their diet is deficient in n‐3 fatty acids, especially for the vegetarians among them. Studies with n‐3‐enriched eggs lower cholesterol levels, platelet aggregation, and blood pressure. Since cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and autoimmune, allergic, and neurological disorders appear to respond to n‐3 fatty acid supplementation, a diet balanced in n‐3 and n‐6 fatty acids consistent with the diet during human evolution should decrease or delay their manifestation.</jats:p>",

Two co‐integrating vectors involving cocoa and coffee exports as endogenous variables are identified in the system while tests for exogeneily of cotton exports are consistent with the independence of cotton from the other two commodities. These findings are corroborated by estimates of a restricted error‐correction model which lead to acceptance of the hypothesis that cocoa and coffee exports are‐indeed determined endogenously to the system and not linked to cotton exports. Statistical significance of the error‐correction terms for cocoa and coffee validates the existence of an equilibrium relationship among the variables in each of these co‐integrating vectors. The combined short run dynamic effect of lagged quantities of cocoa and coffee, export/domestic price ratio and GDP jointly explain changes in exports of cocoa whereas lagged quantities exported do not seem to have a significant short‐run dynamic effect on changes in coffee exports.</jats:p>",

The supply of a reactant was followed by a purge with inert gas before introducing another reactant onto the substrate in order to prevent gas-phase reactions. In one set of experiments the reactants were supplied separately in the sequence of TDMAT. silane. and ammonia. The Si content of the films remained constant at 18 at.%. and the film growth rate varied little from 0.24 nm per reactant-supply-cycle, even though silane partial pressure varied from 0.002 to 0.1 torr. In the other set of experiments silane and ammonia were simultaneously supplied in the sequence of TDMAT and silane/ammonia. The Si content varied from 3 to 23 at.% as the silane-to-ammonia ratio varied from 0.01 to 10. Atomic layer deposition of Ti-Si-N films allows the precise control of Si content as well as film thickness.</jats:p>"

Recent neoliberal economic reforms propelled vehicle assemblers to adopt flexible modes of production and subcontract component manufacturing. However, transactional hazards in supply chains escalated as first‐tier subsystem assemblers had to rely on small, opportunistic, and inefficient parts makers. Large tier one suppliers purchased existing parts makers and invested in greenfield facilities to service both new flexibly organized vehicle assembly plants in southern Brazil and Argentina and restructured assembly plants in the traditional automobile complex of São Paulo. We focus on Dana Corporation, Bradesco Bank, and British Tyre and Rubber Corporation—firms that assemble chasses, engines, and body subsystems, respectively. These companies dominate their segment of the parts industry, delivering subsystems to a growing network of flexible vehicle assembly plants throughout Brazil. Large‐batch parts production, subsystem assembly by a few major multinational tier one suppliers, and ownership consolidation underscore the continued role of vertical integration and scale economies in automobile production chains.</jats:p>",

Instead of an old-established adversarial system, the food industry has allegedly witnessed the development of trust-based partnerships along the supply chain. These have been nurtured by sophisticated retailers apparently in order to secure reliable sources of supply. The author examines the nature, extent, and consequences of this transformation. She argues that, although there is a tendency for buyers to favour ‘known’ suppliers, the role and importance of ‘weak ties’ is subsumed beneath straightforward competitive processes. To the extent that a community of supply-chain partners has been created, its role in terms of filière dynamics is simply one of facilitating and lubricating buyer—supplier relations which retain an underlying rationale: competition between individual actors over the distribution of value added. </jats:p>",

Over the next decade, there will be an increasing demand for new teachers––about two million––due in part to a dramatic increase in enrollments and high attrition rates as an aging teacher workforce becomes eligible for retirement. Where these teachers will come from and where they will teach is important to understand as our society faces increasing racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity. Amid this diversity is a continuing concern that some racial-ethnic groups are disproportionately placed at risk. Thus, this article focuses on the supply and demand patterns of minority teachers, with special attention to teachers of students in high-risk districts. We analyze data on teachers from Texas between 1979 and 1996. We provide a variety of descriptive results––both univariate and multivariate––showing that while Texas has been successful in attracting minority teachers, it has a long way to go in attaining the goal of the Texas State Board of Education: to have a teacher workforce that reflects the racial-ethnic composition of the state. </jats:p>",

The calculated diffusive nitrate flux showed a sharp latitudinal gradient, with the lowest nitrate supply (0.00037 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>mol m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre and the highest values (23.5 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>mol m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) between the Equator and 15°N. The uptake rate of nitrate was inhibited at high irradiance at most stations. Both nitrate and ammonium uptake rates were lowest (about 3 and 10 umol m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively) at the southern end of the transect and increased (about 20 and 55 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>mol m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively) towards the Equator, with this increase being much greater for ammonium than for nitrate uptake. The <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>‐ratio was highest (≈0.4) just south of the Equator and lowest (≈0.03) at the southern end of the transect. The slope between total uptake rate of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and gross primary production, calculated from O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> ‐based measurements, in surface waters (4.72 ± 1.54) was somewhat lower, but not significantly so, than the expected C/N ratio of 6.6. The average uptake rate of nitrate did not differ significantly from the average estimated diffusive supply of nitrate to the biogenic layer over the Central Atlantic. However, the nitrate uptake rate increased as the ⅓ power of the diffusive nitrate flux to the biogenic layer. As a result, nitrate uptake far exceeded (by up to 100‐fold) the nitrate flux to the biogenic layer in the stations where the supply of nitrate was lowest. The excess nitrate uptake averaged 0.65 ± 0.24 mmol NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (range, 0.05–1.9 mmol NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), which must be supplied through atmospheric deposition and other perturbation events. This excess nitrate uptake is relatively large compared to the diffusive supply in the most unproductive areas, where external nitrate inputs fuel the new production. In contrast, these sources of nitrate are far less significant where high diffusive fluxes suffice to maintain high nitrate uptake rates.</jats:p>",

These responses of the plants were caused by defoliation, which stimulated growth, and not a fertiliser effect from the birds' droppings.

To study neuronal glutathione metabolism and metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes in this respect, neuron-rich primary cultures and transient cocultures of neurons and astroglial cells were used. Coincubation of neurons with astroglial cells resulted within 24 hr of incubation in a neuronal glutathione content twice that of neurons incubated in the absence of astroglial cells. In cultured neurons, the availability of cysteine limited the cellular level of glutathione. During a 4 hr incubation in a minimal medium lacking all amino acids except cysteine, the amount of neuronal glutathione was doubled. Besides cysteine, also the dipeptides CysGly and γGluCys were able to serve as glutathione precursors and caused a concentration-dependent increase in glutathione content. Concentrations giving half-maximal effects were 5, 5, and 200 μ<jats:sc>m</jats:sc>for cysteine, CysGly, and γGluCys, respectively. In the transient cocultures, the astroglia-mediated increase in neuronal glutathione was suppressed by acivicin, an inhibitor of the astroglial ectoenzyme γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, which generates CysGly from glutathione. These data suggest the following metabolic interaction in glutathione metabolism of brain cells: the ectoenzyme γ-glutamyl transpeptidase uses as substrate the glutathione released by astrocytes to generate the dipeptide CysGly that is subsequently used by neurons as precursor for glutathione synthesis.</jats:p>",

FBF did not change significantly (1.7 ± 0.1 ml min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in air) so that O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery to hindlimb muscles fell from 0.28 ± 0.07 to 0.16 ± 0.02 ml min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in 8 % O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Nevertheless, the <jats:italic>V̇</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub> of hindlimb muscles was well maintained: 0.06 ± 0.02 ml min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in air and 0.08 ± 0.02 ml min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in 8 % O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. In CH rats breathing 12% O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, <jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sub>a,O2</jats:sub> (23 ± 10 ml (100 ml)<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) was comparable to that of N rats breathing air, due to an increase in haematocrit, as were FBF (1.6 ± 0.2 ml min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery (0.39 ± 0.05 ml min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). However, <jats:italic>V̇</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub> was 2–5‐fold greater in CH rats (0.16 ± 0.03 ml min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). As in N rats, FBF was well maintained at 1.7 ± 0.2 and 1.6 ± 0.2 ml min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in 8 % O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and air, respectively. Further, <jats:italic>V̇</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub> was also well maintained, at 0.17 ± 0.02 and 0.12 ± 0.02 ml min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in 8% O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and air, respectively. These results suggest that, contrary to previous reports, muscle <jats:italic>V̇</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub> of the rat is independent of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery over a wide range of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery values. They also suggest that muscle <jats:italic>V̇</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub> of CH rats is similarly independent of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery. The novel finding that muscle <jats:italic>V̇</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub> has a greater absolute value in CH rats can, we propose, be explained by an increase in <jats:italic>V̇</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub> of the vasculature rather than of the skeletal muscle fibres and reflects increased biosynthetic activity of the vessel walls and/or vascular remodelling.</jats:p>",

It has been demonstrated that anthropogenic acid precipitation can significantly reduce levels of available calcium in soil and the abundance of calcareous items such as snail shells. Recent research in areas adversely affected by acid precipitation on Continental Europe has suggested that reduced calcium availability has resulted in an increased incidence of eggshell defects in small birds. In this paper we present data from one of the areas of the U.K. most severely affected by acid precipitation and where snail abundance (0.36 snails per m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) and exchangeable soil calcium levels (0.02 mg g<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>) were very low: lower than values at sites in the Netherlands where severe eggshell defects occurred. The provision of supplementary calcium and the examination of eggshells, however, provided no evidence that blue tits <jats:italic>Parus caeruleus</jats:italic> were constrained in their ability to form effective eggshells as a result of calcium deficiency. We suggest that other factors, besides low calcium availability, may be contributory to the high incidence of eggshell defects seen in other areas.</jats:p>",

Seasonal dynamics of nitrogen (N), protein, soluble carbohydrates, starch, and lipids were studied in roots, cuttings, stems, and leaves during a full growth cycle induced by varying photoperiod and temperature in a growth chamber. Nitrogen was supplied at two rates. Both season and N availability significantly affected storage of N and carbohydrates. Reserves peaked in dormancy, and plants grown at a higher N availability were able to build up larger N reserves, whereas carbohydrate reserves were similar in the two N treatments. All perennial plant organs functioned as storage sites for N. Roots were prominent in carbohydrate storage, in good agreement with the notion of a pioneer species adapted to recurring disturbance by a pronounced resprouting capacity. Roots differed from aboveground plant parts in their exceptionally high starch levels, and in that N storage in roots to a greater extent involved nonprotein compounds. Triglycerides contributed to carbon storage in aerial plant parts but not in roots. Our results suggest that an increased N supply enhance both the accumulation of nutrient reserves and early season growth. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The physiological potential for acquisition of atmospheric ammonia (NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) was investigated in three European meadow grasses (<jats:italic>Arrhenatherum elatius</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Bromus erectus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Brachypodium pinnatum</jats:italic>) competing in chalk grasslands. Experiments were carried out with plants cultivated for about three months on a soil–sand mixture at high root nitrogen supply or in nutrient solutions at low root nitrogen supply. Two different root nitrogen regimes were applied to the solution‐grown plants: 130 μmol NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> wk<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (approx. 50 kg nitrogen ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in three months); or 130 μmol NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> plus 130 μmol NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> wk<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Each regime was combined with two levels of NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> fumigation (0 and 70 nmol mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> air for 24 d). Uptake of gaseous NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> in the shoots was investigated under controlled environmental conditions including NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> concentrations ranging from 0 to 30 nmol mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> air. Concurrently, photosynthesis, glutamine synthetase activity, nitrogen allocation, biomass allocation and apoplastic cation composition were measured. For <jats:italic>A. elatius</jats:italic>, the influence of photorespiration on NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> acquisition was also assessed. Independently of plant nitrogen status, ammonia compensation points in <jats:italic>A. elatius</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>B. erectus</jats:italic> plants were &lt;0.5 nmol mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. The total leaf conductance to NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> absorption remained constant at increasing NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> concentrations, showing that the capacity for assimilation was unaltered. Whereas internal factors in the leaves did not cause differences in the potential for NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> acquisition between the species, other factors of NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> acquisition were quite different: <jats:italic>B. erectus</jats:italic> had higher stomatal conductance and, thus, higher NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> uptake rates per unit leaf area compared to <jats:italic>A. elatius</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>B. pinnatum</jats:italic>; higher stomatal conductances of <jats:italic>B. erectus</jats:italic> were to a large extent offset by a lower leaf area per plant, resulting from a lower growth rate and thicker leaves than in the two other species. The rate of photorespiration in <jats:italic>Arrhenatherum</jats:italic> constituted at least 15% of the net photosynthetic rate. Surprisingly, suppression of photorespiration indicated that NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> uptake was supported by photorespiration. <jats:italic>Bromus</jats:italic> responded to fumigation with 70 nmol NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> air for 24 d by lowering the root∶shoot ratio and increasing the nitrogen concentration in the stem dry matter. The total leaf conductance to NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> uptake decreased in all three species upon exposure to NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, while the stomatal conductance was unaffected. The NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>\nexposure caused lower apoplastic concentrations of H<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> in <jats:italic>A. elatius</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>B. erectus</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Data were analyzed from 74 “Freight Mobility Interviews”—surveys conducted with key transportation executives whose products and services are shipped into New York City’s central business district (CBD). Quantitative data collected included company profiles, defined by product category; kind of transportation service; type of distribution channel; characteristics of dispatched truck trip; and time and cost for last leg of trip. Major barriers to freight mobility identified by logistics/distribution/ transportation managers were widespread congestion, theft/vandalism, inadequate docking space, and insufficient curbside parking for commercial vehicles. Recommendations to increase productivity in the CBD included off-peak and extended delivery hours, additional truck parking zones, and incentives to upgrade docking areas. Barriers to freight mobility were consistent across industry sectors. Initiatives that have the potential to increase the efficiency of urban goods movement include improved law enforcement to deter theft/vandalism, information-based improvements such as accurate signage, the use of ITS technology and management systems to actively manage curbside commercial parking zones, and improved road maintenance. The nontraditional methodology developed for collecting urban freight mobility data provides process-oriented data that reflect changing supply chain strategies of private-sector shippers and carriers. </jats:p>",
