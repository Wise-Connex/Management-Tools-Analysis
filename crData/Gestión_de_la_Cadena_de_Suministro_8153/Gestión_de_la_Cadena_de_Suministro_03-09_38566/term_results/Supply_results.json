What is urgently needed is a more comprehensive analysis of supplier integration activities. This research, which is based on responses from 173 industrial firms as well as supplementary interviews with purchasing executives, develops the notion of a phase‐differentiated approach toward supplier integration. It further provides insights into supplier integration in the development phase and supplier integration in the industrialization phase with respect to, for example, the degree of integration, the distinct managerial approaches, and the benefits sought by the buyer and the supplier. Additionally, results of an industry‐level analysis examine how various industries approach supplier integration.</jats:p>",

Research questions are then proposed to determine the extent to which negotiation is part of the integrated sourcing process. To answer the research questions, the strategic sourcing process and negotiation plan are evaluated in 29 cases. In 14 of the 29 cases, strategic sourcing was completed and integrated into the negotiation plan. This is just under half of the cases, which led to the general conclusion that negotiation is not well integrated with the other strategic sourcing processes. Additional findings indicated the appropriate negotiation style was used in only 64 percent of the cases, with most mismatches occurring when an integrative style was used instead of the more appropriate distributive style. Managerial and research implications of the findings are presented and discussed.</jats:p>",

It is argued that, with a given wage rate and a chosen level of consumption, the individual maximizes savings as the function of time of search. As a result, when the wage rate is increased, the substitution effect is limited by higher prices of imperfect markets, and the income effect is limited by inferiority of consumption goods. The model discovers some differences of economic behavior of men and women. The level of development of an economy also changes the economic behavior, which in its turn contributes differently to economic growth.</jats:p>"

Existing measures continue to capture intrafirm performance and focus on traditional measures. The lack of a framework to simultaneously measure and translate interfirm performance into value creation has largely contributed to this situation.

The downstream facility faces discrete stochastic demand and passes supply requests to the upstream facility. The upstream facility always meets the supply requests from downstream. If the upstream facility cannot meet the supply requests from inventory on hand, the shortage must be filled by expediting, which will incur per unit and setup costs. Such expediting may take the form of overtime production, which occurs at the end of the period and incurs relatively high production costs, or premium freight shipments, which involves building products at the beginning of the period they are needed and shipping them very quickly with relatively high shipping costs. We consider the case where one method of filling shortages is available and determine novel optimal inventory policies under centralized control. At both stages, threshold policies that depend only on the current inventory in the system are optimal; for the total inventory in the system, a base-stock policy is optimal. Numerical analysis provides insight into the optimal policies and allows us to compare the supply chains under centralized and decentralized control. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasing uncertainty of supply networks, globalization of businesses, proliferation of product variety and shortening of product life cycles have forced Indian organizations to look beyond their four walls for collaboration with supply chain partners. With a gross domestic product (GDP) of over US$474.3 biilion, the Indian industry spends 14 percent of its GDP on logistics. Considering this scenario, it is necessary to study the supply chain practices being followed by the Indian industry and to suggest areas for improving the same. This paper is based on a joint survey, covering 156 organizations, carried out by Management Development Institute, Gurgaon and KPMG India. The paper primarily focuses on the status of four major supply chain dimensions. The paper recommends that the Indian industry should align supply chain strategy with business strategy, streamline processes for supply chain integration, form partnerships for minimizing inventory and focus on infrastructure and technology deployment to build a India‐specific supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s volatile business environment, whether a company is able to compete in the local and global arena depends heavily on how effective the company can build up the partnership synergy with their business counterparts. Indeed, it is important that companies are able to monitor effectively on the manufacturing activities outside its boundary, such as business partners with dissimilar business nature and probably geographically isolated from each other. With the emergence of a dispersed manufacturing network, the important issue is the communication with the partners, collection of data, and making use of data. This paper calls for an effort to suggest practical and agile approaches and models to avoid a poorly managed supply chain in order to improve productivity and cost‐effectiveness to support the business. The agility of the supply chain models would also be concerned to ensure that there is enough adaptability in the system to respond and tackle problems that may occur in the turbulent market.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Teacher quality is now the focus of unprecedented policy analysis. To achieve its goals, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) requires a “highly qualified teacher” in all classrooms. The concern with teacher quality has been driven by a growing recognition, fueled by accumulating research evidence, of how critical teachers are to student learning. To acquire and retain high-quality teachers in our Nation’s classrooms will require substantial policy change at many levels. There exists longstanding precedent and strong justification for Washington to create a major education manpower program. Qualified teachers are a critical national resource that requires federal investment and cross-state coordination as well as other state and local action. NCLB provides a standard for equitable access to teacher quality that is both reasonable and feasible. Achieving this goal will require a new vision of the teacher labor market and the framing of a national teacher supply policy. States and local districts have vital roles to play in ensuring a supply of highly qualified teachers; however, they must be supported by appropriate national programs. These programs should be modeled on U.S. medical manpower efforts, which have long supplied doctors to high- need communities and eased shortages in specific health fields. We argue that teacher supply policy should attract well-prepared teachers to districts that sorely need them while relieving shortages in fields like special education, math and the physical sciences. We study the mal-distribution of teachers and examine its causes. We describe examples of both states and local school districts that have fashioned successful strategies for strengthening their teaching forces. Unfortunately, highly successful state and local program to meet the demand for qualified teachers are the exception rather than the rule. They stand out amid widespread use of under-prepared teachers and untrained aides, mainly for disadvantaged children in schools that suffer from poor working conditions, inadequate pay and high teacher turnover. The federal government has a critical role to play in enhancing the supply of qualified teachers targeted to high-need fields and locations, improving retention of qualified teachers, especially in hard-to-staff schools, and in creating a national labor market by removing interstate barriers to mobility.</jats:p>"

Scientific exploitation of groundwater meets irrigation water need and controls rising water table. However, if tubewells are drilled indiscriminately and without proper assessment of exploitable groundwater, it results in an adverse impact on the groundwater regime. The research farm of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi has witnessed varied groundwater situation in past 60 years. This paper describes over the how the excess use of canal water during the forties and fifties and indiscriminate drilling of tubewelIs after that resulted in waterlogging till mid sixties and depletion of groundwater resources thereafter. Analysis of long term data of water table fluctuations at JARI farm revealed that it has been rising till 1964, reaching to ground surface at several places. Subsequent drilling of a large number of tubewells and reduced canal water supply caused decline of the groundwater table. At present, groundwater table is 14 m deep at some places. This paper also stresses the need for comprehensive water balance study before undertaking any water resources development and utilization project in an area.</jats:p>"

Pricing and delivery-frequency decisions in the system are analyzed by two three-stage noncooperative games with different decision rights designated to the parties involved. The customer first sets the price (or delivery frequency) for each supplier. Then, the suppliers offer the delivery frequencies (or prices) simultaneously and independently. Finally, the customer determines how much demand to allocate to each of the suppliers. We show that delivery frequency, similar to delivery speed in time-based competition, can be a source of competitive advantage. It also allows firms that sell identical products to offer complementary services to the customer because she can lower her inventory with deliveries from more suppliers. In general, higher delivery frequencies lower the value of getting deliveries from the second supplier and therefore intensify price competition. Assuming the cost structures do not change and the suppliers are identical, we show that when the customer controls deliveries, she would strategically increase delivery frequencies to lower prices. The distortion in delivery frequencies is larger and the overall performance of the supply chain is lower when the customer, not the suppliers, controls deliveries. Moreover, the customer is better off under delivery competition, while the suppliers are better off under price competition. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It has been an increasing trend for companies to migrate their businesses onto or publicize themselves on the Internet. Business process reengineering (BPR) is applied to migrate the business processes of the supply chain onto the Web. Such migration may cause some of the processes merged together, minimized or transformed into other processes within a supply chain. Therefore, careful planning for such migration with technical requirements is necessary. This paper starts with the review of related research on BPR, migration of supply chain onto the Internet, and the impact analysis of the migration. A thorough overview of how BPR can change each process of the supply chain onto the Internet is discussed. The main contribution of this paper is a framework of the electronic commerce (EC) impact on the supply chain and the measurement of impact. An industrial example is used to illustrate the evaluation as a result of EC deployment.</jats:p>",

While the question of “what beneficial impact do linkages with suppliers and with customers have for a firm” has been addressed in numerous studies, the equally important question of “why” this beneficial impact arises deserves further discourse and explication. This paper borrows and applies the Resource‐Based View of the Firm, a theoretical perspective prevalent in the strategic management literature, to develop a conceptual framework to describe, explain, and predict the advantages of a firm's linkages with entities in its supply chain on its internal operations. The proposed framework can be used to justify decisions to develop, strengthen, and protect relationships with suppliers on the upstream side and with customers on the downstream side. The framework can also be used to evaluate practices implemented to link a firm to its suppliers and customers and to provide a decision roadmap for firms to better understand how to maximize operational performance benefits from these supply chain linkages.</jats:p>",

Both light-saturated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation at ambient CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and at saturating CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> increased curvilinearly as leaf N increased. Although stomatal conductance showed a similar response to leaf N as CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation, calculated intercellular CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations decreased. On a leaf area basis, activities of key enzymes in the Calvin cycle, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), NADP-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoribulokinase (PRK), and key enzymes in sucrose and starch synthesis, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), increased linearly with increasing leaf N content. When expressed on a leaf N basis, activities of the Calvin cycle enzymes increased with increasing leaf N, whereas activities of FBPase, SPS, and AGPase did not show significant change. As leaf N increased, concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), and 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) increased curvilinearly. The ratio of G6P/F6P remained unchanged over the leaf N range except for a significant drop at the lowest leaf N. Concentrations of glucose, fructose, and sucrose at dusk increased linearly with increasing leaf N, and there was no difference between predawn and dusk measurements. As leaf N increased, starch concentration increased linearly at dusk, but decreased linearly at predawn. The calculated carbon export from starch degradation during the night increased with increasing leaf N. These results showed that 1) grapes leaves accumulated less soluble carbohydrates under N-limitation; 2) the elevated starch level in low N leaves at predawn was the result of the reduced carbon export from starch degradation during the night; and 3) the reduced capacity of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation in low N leaves was caused by the coordinated decreases in the activities of key enzymes involved in CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation as a result of direct N limitation, not by the indirect feedback repression of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation via sugar accumulation.</jats:p>",

Additionally a model trial with quartz sand was carried out for investigations of the influence of P supply on root parameters. The differences of P uptake in dependence of the proofed variants were significant. Under a sufficient P supply Buckwheat, Maize and Oil radish had the highest P uptake on sandy soils, on loamy soil also Buckwheat and Maize but Serradella too. Under P deficiency the withdrawals of Phosphorus for Buckwheat, Maize and Oil radish were found to be the highest. In contrast to the sandy soils for the loamy soils no significant relation between the P uptake by plants and changes in the P-DL amount in soil could be found. For all variants the P uptake by plants were higher than the reduction of the P-DL amount in soil. The rate of P-DL content on the total P content in soil reduced while the two trial years only in sandy but not in loamy soils. The P uptake, the root length and the root/shoot relationship depends significantly on the cultivated crop and the added P compound. The added water soluble KH2PO4 caused a higher P uptake but a lower root/shoot-relationship than the water insoluble P compounds.</jats:p>"

The four operational constructs represented in the model are retailer investment in interorganizational information technology, perceived supplier investment in interorganizational information technology, logistics efficiency, and logistics effectiveness. Among other findings, the results of the investigation found that perceived supplier investment in interorganizational information technology has a significant and positive effect on logistics efficiency.</jats:p>",

However, managers must not only consider their own manufacturing operations in isolation, but also those of others along the supply chain. This paper explores two dimensions of supply chain activities—collaboration and evaluation—that might be leveraged by plant managers to improve environmental management in their own plant. The linkages with suppliers and customers were assessed. Both customer‐ and plant‐initiated collaboration were found to have a significant effect on the level and form of investment in environmental technologies for a sample of Canadian plants. Of greatest importance, as customer‐initiated collaborative activities increased, plant‐level investment in environmental management was increasingly allocated toward pollution prevention. In contrast, only very limited evidence was found that evaluative activities influenced environmental investment. </jats:p>",

The UK Human Tissue Bank is a not-for-profit organisation that acquires and processes human tissue, with a specialist interest in the isolation of human hepatocytes. A recent in-house survey of the processing of liver tissue over 1 year revealed that freshly isolated hepatocytes were underutilised due to mismatched consumer demand, despite the published need for them. We present the results of a telephone survey to investigate the reasons behind this paradox. This survey highlighted some problem areas, including “out of hours” availability of cells and personnel difficulties, but overall, demonstrated the value of such a service, with numerous researchers taking advantage of available good quality human hepatocytes. Although further work is required in optimising long-term storage protocols through cryopreservation, we have demonstrated that tissue handling of this type can be successful and beneficial to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of our study was to develop and validate a simple surgical model in the sheep which allows control of the gas composition of the blood supplying the carotid and central chemosensitive area independently of the rest of the body. This approach was made possible due to the specific features of the cranial circulation in the sheep. An extracorporeal circuit, consisting of a pump and a gas exchanger, was placed at the level of the two common carotid arteries to create a pressure gradient between the carotid and the systemic systems and to reverse blood flow in the vertebral vessels via the occipital arteries. When a pressure gradient of about 40 Torr was created between the systemic and carotid circulation, we found that no blood could reach the carotid bodies and the medulla without passing though the extracorporeal circulation. This was established (1) by measuring vertebral blood flow; and (2) by injecting either a coloured suspension or particles labelled with <jats:sup>99m*</jats:sup>Tc into the systemic or the carotid circulation. The slope of the relationship between minute ventilation (V̇<jats:sub>E</jats:sub>) and systemic arterial P<jats:sub>CO2</jats:sub> (P<jats:sub>a,CO2</jats:sub>) during high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> inhalation in seven hyperoxic vagotomised and anaesthetised sheep was dramatically reduced, but remained above zero, when P<jats:sub>a,CO2</jats:sub> was maintained constant in the cephalic circuit (0.11 ± 0.15 vs. 0.70 ± 0.35 l min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> Torr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for the control tests). This residual V̇<jats:sub>E</jats:sub> response to CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> inhalation remains to be explained since it could not be accounted for by any of the chemical or circulatory changes occurring in the cephalic circulation. Nevertheless, this preparation provides an easy method of maintaining chemical and circulatory homeostasis at the chemoreceptor level.</jats:p>",

The study is modelled on Germany. The features of the well-tested and widely used power system simulation package Power System Dynamics (PSD) were expanded so that windfarms with all commonly used wind turbine generators and their control structures can be simulated. In particular, the windfarm interaction with the power grid can be studied. Additionally, the effects of topology and wind conditions at the location of the wind turbines on the output power have been incorporated into the simulation. The result reveals that the stochastic nature of wind power at significant capacity may cause noticeable frequency fluctuation on the whole grid. Without countermeasures, the fluctuating power may use a disproportionately large component of the primary control power reserve of the grid system. The paper describes options for the integration of large offshore and onshore windfarms in the task of primary frequency control. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As firms have placed more emphasis on their core competencies and outsourced production and services to suppliers, effective cost management of purchases has become a critical factor in achieving corporate success. The Purchasing and Supply Management (PSM) function is generally responsible for obtaining goods and services from outside suppliers. Techniques such as total cost of ownership, supplier cost structure analysis, and target costing have become important tools for PSM to manage inbound supply costs. Results of a survey indicate that the perceptions of PSM by peer functions and top management, in terms of PSM's importance and accountability, are related to implementing the strategic cost management activities of total cost of ownership, supplier cost structure analysis, and target costing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this review, we discuss the mechanismsof responses of various tissues of the lactating dairy cow, particularly the mammary glands, to perturbations in supply of single amino acids that result in observed milk protein yields. Additions of methionine, lysine, histidine or leucine to the absorptive supply cause arterial concentrations of these amino acids to increase, mammary extractions to drop and mammary blood flow to decrease. Single subtractions of essential amino acids have the opposite effect. Changes in mammary blood flow that have been recorded can be explained as attempts by the mammary glands to restore intracellular ATP balance in the face of altered concentrations of energy metabolites in the general circulation. In a quantitative sense, milk protein yield is relatively insensitive to fluctuations in arterial amino acid concentrations but can be stimulated by any one of a number of amino acids. In this context, it is suggested that the designation of a limiting amino acid is not appropriate to the purpose of predicting milk protein yield. Rather, milk protein synthesis appears to operate at a predetermined rate set by external communications of milk withdrawal rate, physiological state and overall nutritional status. Utilization of amino acids (AA) by splanchnic and peripheral tissues, in coordination with the mammary setpoint, offsets imperfections in the dietary AA supply. How strongly an individual AA influences the mammary setpoint, arterial concentrations of energy metabolites, and mammary AA transport capacity will determine the magnitude of the milk protein yield response when its absorptive supply is changed. Key words: Dairy cows, milk protein, amino acid </jats:p>",
