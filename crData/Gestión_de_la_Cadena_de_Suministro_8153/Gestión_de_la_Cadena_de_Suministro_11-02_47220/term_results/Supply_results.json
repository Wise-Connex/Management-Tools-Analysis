      "abstract": "<jats:p>Todays Global economy is putting a premium on the ability of companies and their professional employees to rapidly evaluate a broad range of decisions in collaboration with both existing and prospective supply chain partners. This includes the development, evaluation and refinement of product designs, the evaluation of alternatives sourcing options, the evaluation of requests for bids, etc. A key difficulty in supporting the collaborative development, evaluation and refinement of alternative courses of action across different organizations lies in the complexity of the solutions involved (e.g. complex production schedules spanning multiple organizations, complex product designs or configurations involving large numbers of parts and components that are procured from a number of suppliers, etc.). Given a growing and ongoing need to revitalize the accounting curriculum and explore eclectic methods to teach accounting information systems, real challenges and opportunities exist to import this material into the accounting systems classroom.The Business Process Integration Lab at Saint Josephs University has developed a prototype environment for collaborative development, evaluation and refinement of supply chain management scenarios (e.g. requests for bids, product designs, sourcing options). The environment relies on the use of Enterprise Resource Planning software, using SAP R/3 to streamline and integrate the supply chain. Through the use of application scenarios, students are able to develop a total understanding of the power of the ERP technology tool as a decision maker and problem-solver, while enhancing their knowledge of the system in modules such as Production Planning and Customer Order Management. It is possible to support powerful workflow management functionality in the context of both interactive and highly automated decision making processes. This functionality has been operational for some three years and is coordinated by senior level graduate and undergraduate students who develop and test the scenarios and assist other students as they navigate through the R/3 system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Significant amounts of carbon and nutrients are released to the atmosphere due to large fires in forests. Characterization of the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the intense fire emissions is crucial for assessing the atmospheric loadings of aerosols and trace gases. This paper discusses issues of the representation of forest fires in the estimation of emissions and the application to an atmospheric chemistry transport model (CTM). The potential contribution of forest fires to the deposition of soluble iron (Fe) into the ocean is highlighted, with a focus on mega fires in eastern Siberia. Satellite products of burned area, active fire, and land cover are used to estimate biomass burning emissions in conjunction with a biogeochemical model. Satellite-derived plume height from MISR is used for the injection height of boreal forest fire emissions. This methodology is applied to quantify fire emission rates in each three-dimensional grid location in the high latitude Northern Hemisphere (&gt; 30° N latitude) over a 5-year period from 2001 to 2005. There is large interannual variation in forest burned area during 2001–2005 (13–51 × 103 km2 yr−1) which results in a corresponding variation in the annual emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) (12–78 Tg CO yr−1). Satellite observations of CO from MOPITT are used to evaluate the model performance in simulating the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the fire emissions. During the major Siberian fire seasons in the summer of 2002 and in the spring of 2003, the model results for CO enhancements due to intense fires are in good agreement with MOPITT observations. These fire emission rates are applied to the aerosol chemistry transport model to examine the relative importance of biomass burning sources of soluble iron compared to those from dust sources. Compared to the dust sources without the atmospheric processing by acidic species, extreme fire events contribute to a significant deposition of soluble iron (10–60%) to downwind regions over the western North Pacific Ocean. It may imply that the supply of nutrients from large forest fires plays a role as a negative biosphere-climate feedback with regards to the ocean fertilization.\n                        </jats:p>"

INTRODUCTION</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>One of the most serious problems in strategic pipeline projects is the need for reliable power for unattended stations in the severe environments under which these pipelines must continuously operate (temperatures as low as −55°C (−67°F) in winter, roads to the stations inaccessible for long periods of time making the stations inaccessible for maintenance crews, etc).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The objectives for high reliability in RGV operation, telecommunications, cathodic protection and SCADA systems in strategic projects have become staggering. In areas not serviced by commercial power, the problems faced by the power systems designers are very stringent since power generators must operate continuously on a 24 hour-per-day basis 365 days per-year.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The high reliability of the power supply in remote stations along the pipeline can be achieved by:–Selection of the most reliable remote power generators–Providing adequate redundancy of power generators</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Telecommunications, SCADA, cathodic protection facilities along oil and gas pipelines are mission-critical, carrying vital performance, telemetry and control data.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The use of specially designed, arctic type, Closed Cycle Vapor Turbogenerators and their associated non-electric heating systems in arctic telecommunication systems has solved two of the most stringent problems of the pipeline operators: reliable remote power up to 4 kW is provided with maintenance requirements reduced to a visit only once in 6 months or more, and required temperature ranges in equipment shelters are maintained, assuring correct operation of the sensitive electronics, without any need of electrical power.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper reviews the key criteria to consider in selecting power solutions for remote site applications and CCVT performance is reviewed.

The supplier makes the production process investment decision and determines the type of production process level (high level type or low level type), who will also make quality prevention strategy and determine its products quality prevention level. The manufacturer makes the quality appraisal strategy and processing strategy when it accepts the intermediary components, who will also determine its products quality inspection level and processing level. In this paper, we analyze the supplier may signal the type of production process investment level to the manufacturer in order to obtain the optimal incentive contracts. We take use of the optimal theory to establish supplier’s production process quality prevention model and manufacturer’s products quality inspection model and investigate the manufacturer's information rents to motivate supplier to improve products quality level. This paper will prove that: the supplier may have the incentives to signal the type of production process investment level to the manufacturer, and improve its products quality prevention level in its production process. When the manufacturer observes supplier’s signals of products quality level, it will reduce quality inspection level and improve processing level. With the improvement of supplier’s quality prevention level, its warranty payments and price rebate will decrease, the manufacturer will increase its upfront payments and reduce apportionment ratio of external failure cost. Meanwhile the integrated supply chain’s joint expected profits will also increase, and then the manufacturer will reduce the supplier’s information rents obviously. Above all, we analyze the causes of ratchet effects and provide corresponding quantitative descriptions and proofs for our conclusions respectively.</jats:p>"

It develops an integrated performance measurement framework to survey the relationship between best practice firms and their position in supply/buy networks operating between firms in the Electronics and IT Communications industry in the Northern Adelaide Region of South Australia. The methodology joins models of best practice with theories of structural network analysis applied to a sample of 44 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their first tier suppliers and customer firms. It uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis to arrive at a classification of best practice firms, and correlates their leader and lagger status against a five class typology of supply and buy networks for the OEM firm, to show the impact of supply chain performance on firm performance. The results reported here are a pilot study to test the validity of the conceptual framework preparatory to a future survey of the full population of firms in the industry operating multi-tier supply/buy chains. Advanced statistical techniques and snowball sampling will be used to test and confirm the preliminary relationships presented here. The study was sponsored by Playford City Council as part of its Industrial Renewal Program for Northern Adelaide to build regional systems of innovation and agendas for change.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we propose an exhaustive model of the European natural gas supply including the possibility of strategic behaviour of the agents along the value-added chain. We structure it as a two-stage-game with natural gas exports to Europe (first stage) and wholesale trade within Europe (second stage). The case of non-cooperative Cournot competition at both stages proves to be the most realistic scenario. The results of the perfect competition and cartel scenario are also presented. Our results suggest that the main suppliers of natural gas to Europe (Russia, Algeria, the Netherlands, Norway) remain dominant, but that they are complemented by overseas supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The model also enables us to identify transport infrastructure bottlenecks where transport capacity constraints are binding.</jats:p>"

In this context, an integrated management information system will be viewed as the key instrument that captures all relevant data and makes it available to the appropriate decision-maker and that provides an optimizer and decision-support function supporting various phases of the decision-making process, requiring the identification of cost cutting and value adding strategies. The properly integrated management information systems will help companies to gain the critical global competitive edge to survive in today's markets. We suggest various strategies in sourcing, manufacturing/operation, and marketing that can provide a competitive global supply chain strategy for a firm to increase value.

By the analysis of a numerical example, we find that the competition between the manufacturers in model II will affect their prices decisions and their profits; in model II, the two manufacturers would like to halve the market while the retailer hope to increase the difference of their market shares, and the two manufacturers would not like to increase the substitute ratio of their products while the retailer can benefit from that. So, from the manufacturers’ point of view, they should avoid the competition risk by choosing the independent retailers.</jats:p>"

The project benefited from the support and cooperation of BBK Ltd. the largest turnaround firm worldwide engaged by the automobile sector. In contrast to previous work which utilized a single predictive model to indicate the likelihood that a supplier company was in distress, our effort tested the idea that large and small automobile suppliers face different exigencies and therefore require separate predictive models. The paper concludes by identifying the key factors to consider when reviewing the health of automobile suppliers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

This paper also discusses the application of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) to supply-chain management issues. Then, several strategies are examined for improving supply-chains in the oil and gas industry.

For the symmetric supply chain, we give closed-form expressions for the unique equilibrium. We find that, provided there is a sufficiently large number of manufacturers and retailers, the supply chain efficiency (the ratio of the aggregate utility in the decentralized and centralized chains) can be raised to 1 by inducing the right degree of retailer differentiation. Also, risk aversion results in triple marginalization: retailers require a strictly positive margin to distribute even when they are perfectly competitive, because otherwise they are unwilling to undertake the risk associated with the uncertainty in demand. For the asymmetric supply chain, we show how numerical optimization can be used to compute the equilibria, and we find that the supply chain efficiency may drop sharply with the asymmetry of either manufacturers or retailers. We also find that the introduction of asymmetric product assortment reduces the degree of competition among retailers and thus has an effect similar to that of reducing the number of retailers. We show that, unlike in the symmetric chain, the asymmetric chain efficiency depends on product differentiation and risk aversion because of the interaction between these features and the asymmetry of manufacturers and retailers. </jats:p>",

Heterogenous customers choose services based on the utility maximization principle taking congestion into account. We use customer choice theory and infinite dimensional variational inequality to model the customer behavior and estimate service product’s market share. An extended Frank and Wolfe algorithm for solving this market share problem and a numerical example is given. The results shows that that service providers with poor service quality can also win some market share due to customers’ aversion to congestion.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many manufacturing and service activities can be modeled using queuing theory. The optimization of the long-run solution to imbalances between supply and demand is very important to established businesses. This paper presents a family of queuing models that minimize the expected total cost incurred when restoring equilibrium to a stochastic system that has become unstable due to changes in the environmental parameters affecting its behavior. Analytical expressions for the expected total cost in terms of a policy parameter are derived from which numerically-savvy users can obtain the policy that minimizes the expected total cost. To determine the model parameters that most affect the optimal policy and to facilitate the determination of near-optimal policies, exact solutions were found for a large number of scenarios and then used to fit a regression model. The resulting regression equation can be used by practitioners to find policy parameters that approximately minimize the expected total cost due to imbalances in supply and demand.</jats:p>"

The stability area of the different modes of the supply chain is given theoretically, and bifurcation diagram are used to describe the dynamics of the system by simulations. It is pointed that information sharing can make the supply chain more stable by weaken the bullwhip effect, however, the supply chain is apt to be unstable if the retailer choose to adjust its inventory unbalance radically, if so, the distributor should take a more conservative attitude to adjust its inventory unbalance. And it is also deduced that the stock level of the distributor has the critical effect on the dynamics of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Products are customized by customer’s special needs at stochastic time. Then Manufacturing Oriented to Customization (MOC) would inevitably be faced by those enterprises that had to meet the changeable and complex needs of customers. However, there were large quantities of difficulties would appear in MOC supply chains, such as information overload, technology and resource constraints. All of these problems made it hard to quickly and effectively respond to customers’ needs. Therefore, we need to find a new way to deal effectively with the problems about how to respond quickly to supply chains oriented to customization. Petri Nets have been extensively used for modeling and simulating of the dynamics of flexible manufacturing systems. However, Petri Nets have not been very popular for molding of workflow in CSCM environmental. In this paper Stochastic Timed Petri Nets (STPN) were used to solve the above problems. The enterprises’ workflow was analyzed, and then the STPN model was constructed according to the characteristics of its internal supply chain. In order to minimize total tardiness time of workflow, the structure of STPN was optimized in a proper way. The results suggest that the STPN approach is also valid to minimize due date of each transition in CSCM and responses to customized needs more quickly than before.</jats:p>"

Companies need not only to make the “make” or “buy” decisions but also differentiate across potential suppliers in order to improve operational performance. Product design is an engineering based activity that realizes the customer requirements into functions of a new product. Many studies have pointed out that the integration of product and supply chain is a key factor for profitability and efficiency. However, most studies address supply chain performance after freezing the design of the product; only a few studies discuss when and how to incorporate supply chain decisions during product design. This paper presents a graph theory based optimization methodology to tackle this problem. The supplier selection issue is considered by evaluating its impact on both internal (e.g., ease of assembly) and external (e.g., transportation time) enterprise performances, which are aggregated as supply chain performance at the conceptual design stage. A case study in the bicycle industry demonstrates the advantages of this methodology. The presented mathematical programming formulation enables simultaneous optimization of both product design and supply chain design during the early design stages.</jats:p>",

According to different cooperative modes, Stackelberg leader-follower game models are established to gain the optimal costs of the buyer, the vendor and the supply chain system. A decision principle is designed to compare the cost savings of the buyer, the vendor, the third-party logistics and the system.

Although case studies of real systems bridge the gap between theory and practice, they are nevertheless investigations of a subset of cases, each with specific characteristics. To tackle this problem, a multitude of networks with diverging characteristics are generated using the graph‐theory‐based Modular Design System (MDS). In this paper the application of this MDS is demonstrated by generating a set of 2280 virtual Water Supply Systems. The layout and the properties of these systems are representative of typical examples encountered in practice. Scatterplots, density, and cumulative distribution functions are used to characterize several network parameters. A comparison of the virtual set with three real‐world case studies shows similar characteristics. Finally, the potential of the methodology is demonstrated by analyzing the impact of increased water demand on hydraulic performance. It can be shown that the allowed maximum and minimum diameters envelop a range of impacts on mean values for nodal pressure.</jats:p>",

These reviews are referred to as Quality Control Reviews (QCRs). The TEA also conducts desk reviews of all audited financial statements issued by Texas independent school districts. During the desk review process, the TEA performs a limited check of the accuracy of financial statement amounts, completeness of financial disclosures, and existence of proper audit output. Prior research suggests that desk reviews and quality control reviews both measure audit quality (Colbert and O&amp;rsquo;Keefe 1995; Copley et al. 1994; Deis and Giroux 1992, 1996; Giroux et al. 1995; O&amp;rsquo;Keefe and Westort 1992; O&amp;rsquo;Keefe et al. 1994). The purpose of the paper is to determine if desk reviews capture the same audit quality information as quality control reviews. If so, regulators should focus resources on desk reviews since they are more timely and economical than QCRs. The results of the study, however, indicate that desk reviews and quality control reviews do not measure the same constructs. The findings suggest that desk reviews measure the industry specific knowledge of the auditor, which is only one aspect of audit quality. Moreover, it was observed that some audits passing the desk review were graded low in quality by the working paper review. This finding suggests that low audit quality may be more prevalent than generally suspected and that steps to improve audit quality and auditor credibility are warranted.&lt;strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this work, we propose a single period stochastic inventory decision-making model that captures the trade-off between inventory policies and disruption risks for unreliable (both uncapacitated and capacitated) dual-sourcing reverse supply chain networks. Risk-management has emerged high at the corporate agenda as globalised supply chain networks are more stretched than ever due to offshoring and thus are more exposed to disruptions, while reverse logistics has been proven to constitute a profit center. In this environment, global companies have to scrutinize especially the role of major Asian economies (with large manufacturing capacities and huge markets), while conducting their strategic procurement planning. The developed model can be applied to a number of different scenario types encompassing various instances of disruptions to the collection of the end-of-life products, of the transportation system, and of the remanufacturing yield and capacity. Analytical closed-form solutions are obtained and important managerial insights on the merit of contingency strategies in managing uncertainties for reverse logistics networks are discussed. </jats:p>",

In contrast, other firms with IOS deployments have struggled to achieve this level of success. So it is not clear how such systems can be configured to promote idiosyncratic interorganizational processes that integrate the supply chains and facilitate successful outcomes. To shed further light on this issue, we draw from multiple theoretical perspectives to develop a comprehensive and unique conceptualization of IOS characteristics that goes beyond the limited treatment it has received in extant literature. Furthermore, we empirically examine the IOS configuration choices made by firms with different supply chain integration (SCI) profiles. Our results support the notion that successful firms sequence the configuration of IOS characteristics toward effectively developing and supporting their supply chain process capabilities. In particular, we found that firms at the lower end of SCI configure IOS features to support supplier evaluation and automatic alerts. As organizations move to the upper end of the SCI spectrum, greater attention is paid to features associated with systems integration, planning, and forecasting. Recommendations to managers and academics stemming from our study are provided, along with avenues for future research.</jats:p>",

We then described the effects of deletions of key metabolic pathways (e.g., Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas and pentose phosphate pathway) and reactions (e.g., transhydrogenase and NADH dehydrogenase) on resting‐cell xylitol yield (<jats:italic>Y</jats:italic><jats:sub>RPG</jats:sub>: moles of xylitol produced per mole of glucose consumed) (Chin et al., <jats:italic>Biotechnol Bioeng</jats:italic>. 2009;102:209‐220). These prior results demonstrated the importance of direct NADPH supply by NADP<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>‐utilizing enzymes in central metabolism for driving heterologous NADPH‐dependent reactions. This study describes strain modifications that improve coupling between glucose catabolism (oxidation) and xylose reduction using two fundamentally different strategies. We first examined the effects of deleting the phosphofructokinase (<jats:italic>pfk</jats:italic>) gene(s) on growth‐uncoupled xylitol production and found that deleting both <jats:italic>pfkA</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>sthA</jats:italic> (encoding the <jats:italic>E. coli‐</jats:italic>soluble transhydrogenase) improved the xylitol <jats:italic>Y</jats:italic><jats:sub>RPG</jats:sub> from 3.4 ± 0.6 to 5.4 ± 0.4. The second strategy focused on coupling aerobic growth on glucose to xylitol production by deleting <jats:italic>pgi</jats:italic> (encoding phosphoglucose isomerase) and <jats:italic>sthA</jats:italic>. Impaired growth due to imbalanced NADPH metabolism (Sauer et al., <jats:italic>J Biol Chem</jats:italic>. 2004;279:6613‐6619) was alleviated upon expressing CbXR, resulting in xylitol production similar to that of the growth‐uncoupled precursor strains but with much less acetate secretion and more efficient utilization of glucose. Intracellular nicotinamide cofactor levels were also quantified, and the magnitude of the change in the NADPH/NADP<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ratio measured from cells consuming glucose in the absence vs. presence of xylose showed a strong correlation to the resulting <jats:italic>Y</jats:italic><jats:sub>RPG</jats:sub>. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Mount Gambier’s stormwater is discharged directly via drainage wells into the unconfined, karstic Gambier Limestone aquifer, which in turn provides the majority of recharge to Blue Lake. Discharge of urban runoff to the aquifer commenced in the 1800s as a means of stormwater management, but is now recognised as contributing to the drinking water supply in Blue Lake. Recently, guidelines for managing the risks associated with water recycling and augmenting drinking water supplies have been developed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. A size-structured ecosystem model is coupled to a 3-dimensional, high-resolution circulation model to investigate the seasonal and interannual variability of physical and biological states and their driving mechanisms at the shelfbreak front of the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). Simulated surface chlorophyll fields compare favorably to the satellite observations and capture the shelfbreak biomass enhancement, which is one of the essential biological features of the region. The domain-wide upper water column nutrient content peaks in late winter-early spring. The phytoplankton spring bloom starts 1–2 months later, followed by a zooplankton bloom in early summer. Seasonal and interannual variability in hindcast shelfbreak nutrient supply is controlled by three processes: (1) local mixing that deepens the mixed layer and injects deep ocean nutrients into the upper water column; (2) alongshore nutrient transport by the shelfbreak jet and associated currents; and (3) nutrient upwelling associated with shelfbreak bottom boundary layer convergence. Interannual variability of physical and biological processes are highlighted by cross-shelf nutrient budget diagnostics for spring 2004 and 2007, which show not only complex vertical structure of various dynamical terms, but also significant variations in magnitude between the two years.\n                        </jats:p>"

Published estimates of forest biomasssupply as harvest residues are reported and discussed. The range of estimates listed here indicates that this source ofenergy is important but that it is still a fraction of our energy demands. The potential of using this biomass to reduce ourGHG emissions is strongly dependent, among other factors, on the technological pathways that are used, with direct heatproduction and combined heat and power (CHP) ranking amongst the best options available.

We contribute to the literature by shedding light on the importance of a multifaceted formal ethical infrastructure—consisting of formal communication, recurrent communication, formal surveillance, and formal sanctions—as a crucial antecedent of moral awareness. In so doing, we discern how these four elements of a formal ethical infrastructure combine to collectively influence moral awareness based on a second‐order factor structure using structural equation modeling. We test our model based on survey data from 805 respondents with significant work experience across three separate ethical scenarios. Our results across the three scenarios provide overall support for our model. We found that a second‐order factor structure for the formal ethical infrastructure explains the variance among the four infrastructure elements and that a multifaceted formal ethical infrastructure significantly increases moral awareness. Our results further suggest a strong positive effect of moral awareness on moral judgment, which in turn was found to have a positive impact on moral intention. These results were substantiated when taking several individual and contextual control variables into account, such as gender, age, religiosity, work satisfaction, and a de facto ethical climate. Implications for theory, practice, and supply management are discussed.</jats:p>",

Applying a semi‐parametric decomposition approach we show that controlling for children significantly reduces the gap between married women and secondary lesbian earners both in terms of the decision to remain attached to the labor market (the extensive margin) and annual hours of work conditional on working (the intensive margin). Further, the effect of controlling for children primarily reduces the percentage of secondary lesbian earners working extremely high annual hours.</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>JEL</jats:italic> J15, J16, J22)</jats:p>",

The parallel combination of the three diodes at the output functions like a comparator circuit and compares the outputs voltage of the three sources, so that the highest voltage at a particular time feeds the DC output and supplies the charging current to the battery. The universal DC power supply system was tested under various operating conditions and the results obtained showed a good performance of the system. The system outputs, when all the power sources were available, during utility power failure and when only the stored energy in the back-up battery was available were 13.8, 13.1 and 12.2V, respectively. The system guarantees an uninterrupted power supply, which can be used to power telecommunication equipment, audiovisual materials, computers, DC motor driven devices and other DC appliances. A typical day solar radiation varied from 547 W/m2 to 865 W/m2 while the generated voltage from PV varied from 11.8 V to 13.7 V.

This research examines two capabilities that enable firms to collaborate successfully as a means to combine knowledge and expertise in an episodic collaboration initiative. Building from two theoretical foundations, the knowledge‐based and relational views of the firm, we examine the effects of absorptive capacity and collaborative process competence on the outcomes of an episodic collaboration initiative. Using structural equation modeling, we empirically validate the positive effect of absorptive capacity, collaborative process competence and level of engagement on the operational and relational success of a collaboration effort. Results show that collaborative process competence mediates the relationship between absorptive capacity and collaborative engagement, and positively influences both operational and relational outcomes. Finally, we offer suggestions for managers to improve the effectiveness of inter‐firm collaboration initiatives and discuss future research opportunities.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>An integrated sub‐1V voltage reference generator, designed in standard 90‐nm CMOS technology, is presented in this paper. The proposed voltage reference circuit consists of a conventional bandgap core based on the use of p‐n‐p substrate vertical bipolar devices and a voltage‐to‐current converter. The former produces a current with a positive temperature coefficient (TC), whereas the latter translates the emitter‐base voltage of the core p‐n‐p bipolar device to a current with a negative TC. The circuit includes two operational amplifiers with a rail‐to‐rail output stage for enabling stable and robust operation overall process and supply voltage variations while it employs a total resistance of less than 600 K Ω. Detailed analysis is presented to demonstrate that the proposed circuit technique enables die area reduction. The presented voltage reference generator exhibits a PSRR of 52.78 dB and a TC of 23.66ppm/<jats:sup>∘</jats:sup>C in the range of − 40 and 125<jats:sup>∘</jats:sup>C at the typical corner case at 1 V. The output reference voltage of 510 mV achieves a total absolute variation of ± 3.3% overall process and supply voltage variations and a total standard deviation, σ, of 4.5 mV, respectively, in the temperature range of − 36 and 125<jats:sup>∘</jats:sup>C.

Survey results were then used to identify patterns or trends that existed in the data. There was a marked shift in the employment settings and a decrease time worked as an APRN, despite an aging APRN workforce. There was an increase in the aggregate education level of APRNs; however, the percentage educated at the doctoral level remained flat at 2%. Overall, APRNs were a satisfied segment of the health workforce; however, those intending to leave for dissatisfaction voiced more concern about job stress and less concern about salary and benefits over time. Implications for workforce planning and public policy are discussed. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we study an inventory system operating under a (<jats:italic>q</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>) policy, where the supply can become inaccessible for random durations. The availability of the supply is modeled by assuming a single supplier that goes through ON and OFF periods of stochastic duration, both of which are modeled by phase‐type distributions (PTD). We provide two alternative representations of the state transition probabilities of the system, one with integral and the other employing Kolmogorov differential equations. We then use an efficient formulation for the analytical model that gives the optimal policy parameters and the long‐run average cost. An extensive numerical study is conducted, which shows that OFF time characteristics have a bigger impact on optimal policy parameters. The ON time characteristics are also important for critical goods if disasters can happen. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The gate-drive of the cascode NMOS is controlled by an auxiliary LDR that draws only 1 μA from a small charge pump, thus helping in reducing the quiescent current. Adaptive biasing is employed for the multi-stage error amplifier of the core LDR to achieve high loop gain hence high PSR at low frequency, low quiescent current at light load and high bandwidth at heavy load.

Based on the contingency and organizational information processing theories, we argue that under a high EU, the associations between supplier/customer integration, and delivery and flexibility performance, and those between internal integration, and product quality and production cost, will be strengthened. These theoretical propositions are largely confirmed by multi‐group and structural path analyses of survey responses collected from 151 of Thailand's automotive manufacturing plants. This paper contributes to operations management contingency research and provides theory‐driven and empirically proven explanations for managers to differentiate the effects of internal and external integration efforts under different environmental conditions.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The companies' overall GSCM practice level (L<jats:sub>GSCM</jats:sub>) is measured by using the data from 165 valid respondents in a questionnaire survey conducted during April and May 2009. The relationships between L<jats:sub>GSCM</jats:sub> and the classified determinant factors are analyzed. It is indicated that Chinese companies are still at a preliminary stage of GSCM practices. Their environmental management in cooperation with external members of the supply chain is very marginal. A company's L<jats:sub>GSCM</jats:sub> is significantly and positively associated with the external pressures from regulatory, domestic clients and business competitors. As an internal factor, a company's learning capacity greatly determines L<jats:sub>GSCM</jats:sub>. We also confirm that the internal factors function as intermediate variables of external pressures in influencing a company's GSCM. A company's environmental management capacities will be strongly enhanced by frequent internal training of employees to increase its involvement in GSCM practices.

Three sea‐level rise scenarios given by the IPCC (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#bib26\">2007</jats:ext-link>) were used in the simulations of morphology using a large‐scale behaviour‐oriented modelling approach. Sedimentation rate scenarios were derived both from the Holocene evolution of the estuary and from a semi‐empirical estimation of present‐day sediment aggradation. Our results show that the net lateral expansion of the intertidal zone area would be about 3–5% of the present intertidal zone area for each 10 cm rise in sea level. Under constraints imposed by the lack of fluvial sediment supply, the lateral expansion of the landward boundary of the intertidal zone will occur mainly in the Portuguese margin of the Guadiana estuary, while submergence of the salt marshes will occur in the Spanish margin. Therefore the Spanish margin is highly vulnerable to both sea‐level rise and lack of sediment supply. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. From November 2008 through May 2009, the Po river (Italy) experienced several floods exceeding 5000 m3 s−1. This long series of events ended with a large flood in early May 2009 (~8000 m3 s−1). An event-response sampling was carried out in the Po prodelta in April–May 2009 to characterize the preservation of this series of floods in the sediment record and to describe the event-supply and deposition of riverborne particulate material during the May 2009 flood. The water sampling was carried out early in the event under conditions of moderate river flow (~5000 m3 s−1) and 24 h later during the peak discharge (~8000 m3 s−1). Sediment cores were collected in the prodelta before and after the peak flood. At each station, profiles of conductivity, transmittance, and fluorescence were acquired. Surface and bottom waters were sampled to collect sediments in suspension. In addition, a few days before the May 2009 event, suspended sediments were collected at Pontelagoscuro gauging station, ~90 km upstream from the coast. Biogeochemical compositions and sedimentological characteristics of suspended and sediment samples were investigated using bulk and biomarker analyses. Furthermore, 7Be and radiographs were used to analyze the internal stratigraphy of sediment cores.  During moderate flow, the water column did not show evidence of plume penetration. Stations re-occupied 24 h later exhibited marked physical and biogeochemical changes during the peak flood. However, the concentration of terrestrially-derived material in surface waters was still less than expected. These results suggested that, since material enters the Adriatic as buoyancy-driven flow with a reduced transport capacity, settling and flocculation processes result in trapping a significant fraction of land-derived material in shallow sediments and/or within distributary channels.  Although numerous discharge peaks occurred from November 2008 through April 2009 (4000–6000 m3 s−1), sediment cores collected in late April 2009 showed lack of event-strata preservation and reduced 7Be penetrations. This suggested that only a small fraction of the sediment supply during ordinary events reaches the deepest region of the prodelta (12–20 m water depth). As a result, these event-strata have a thickness not sufficient to be preserved in the sediment record because of post-depositional processes that destroy the flood signal.  Stations in the northern and central prodelta were re-occupied after the peak of the May 2009 flood. Based on 7Be and radiographs, we estimated event layers of 17 and 6 cm thickness, respectively. Selective trapping of coarse material occurred in the central prodelta likely because of the geomorphologic setting of the central outlet characterized by an estuary-like mouth. Despite these settling processes, lignin-based parameters indicated that the composition of the terrigenous OC was fairly homogenous throughout the network of channels and between size-fractions.\n                    </jats:p>"

Ethylene plays a crucial role in the senescence of carnation (<jats:italic>Dianthus caryophyllus</jats:italic> L.) flowers. Two cDNA clones encoding putative RTE‐like protein (DCRTE1 and DCRTH1) were obtained from total RNA isolated from senescing carnation petals using RT‐PCR and RACE techniques. The predicted proteins of DCRTE1 and DCRTH1 consist of 228 and 233 amino acids, respectively. Interestingly, the deduced DCRTE1 protein, like most other RTEs, includes two putative transmembrane domains, while the deduced DCRTH1 protein includes five putative transmembrane domains, according to the TMHMM database. Northern blots showed that the level of <jats:italic>DCRTE1</jats:italic> mRNA in petals first decreased then increased remarkably after ethylene production started, and <jats:italic>DCRTE1</jats:italic> expression showed an increasing trend in ovaries during natural flower senescence.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bevacizumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is a promising, yet controversial, drug in human glioblastoma treatment (GBM). Its effects on tumor burden, recurrence, and vascular physiology are unclear. We therefore determined the tumor response to bevacizumab at the phenotypic, physiological, and molecular level in a clinically relevant intracranial GBM xenograft model derived from patient tumor spheroids. Using anatomical and physiological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we show that bevacizumab causes a strong decrease in contrast enhancement while having only a marginal effect on tumor growth. Interestingly, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI revealed a significant reduction of the vascular supply, as evidenced by a decrease in intratumoral blood flow and volume and, at the morphological level, by a strong reduction of large- and medium-sized blood vessels. Electron microscopy revealed fewer mitochondria in the treated tumor cells. Importantly, this was accompanied by a 68% increase in infiltrating tumor cells in the brain parenchyma. At the molecular level we observed an increase in lactate and alanine metabolites, together with an induction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and an activation of the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase pathway. These data strongly suggest that vascular remodeling induced by anti-VEGF treatment leads to a more hypoxic tumor microenvironment. This favors a metabolic change in the tumor cells toward glycolysis, which leads to enhanced tumor cell invasion into the normal brain. The present work underlines the need to combine anti-angiogenic treatment in GBMs with drugs targeting specific signaling or metabolic pathways linked to the glycolytic phenotype.</jats:p>",
