      "abstract": "<jats:p> The bullwhip effect describes the tendency for the variance of orders in supply chains to increase as one moves upstream from consumer demand. We report on a set of laboratory experiments with a serial supply chain that tests behavioral causes of this phenomenon, in particular the possible influence of coordination risk. Coordination risk exists when individuals' decisions contribute to a collective outcome and the decision rules followed by each individual are not known with certainty, for example, where managers cannot be sure how their supply chain partners will behave. We conjecture that the existence of coordination risk may contribute to bullwhip behavior. We test this conjecture by controlling for environmental factors that lead to coordination risk and find these controls lead to a significant reduction in order oscillations and amplification. Next, we investigate a managerial intervention to reduce the bullwhip effect, inspired by our conjecture that coordination risk contributes to bullwhip behavior. Although the intervention, holding additional on‐hand inventory, does not change the existence of coordination risk, it reduces order oscillation and amplification by providing a buffer against the endogenous risk of coordination failure. We conclude that the magnitude of the bullwhip can be mitigated, but that its behavioral causes appear robust. </jats:p>",

The calculation in a case indicates that the change of heat production of large-scale heat supply unit will not affect the quality of heat supply to a certain extent. During heat supply period, thermal load of heat supply network shall be moderately lowered to coordinate with the in-depth peak regulation when power grid is at its low ebb, and heat supply shall be moderately decreased based on characteristics of thermal storage of heat supply network and buildings when the peak regulation capacity of power grid is very limited, which indicates that it is feasible and practical to help power grid go through its low ebb with the peak regulation capacity gained here. Through the mathematical model established in this paper, time of thermal storage and thermal release as well as such units capacity of in-depth peak regulation can be calculated, which provides a scientific basis for dispatcher of power grid to conduct in-depth peak regulation of heat supply unit.</jats:p>"

Intermarried couples may specialize less due to smaller comparative advantages resulting from positive assortative mating by education, and due to different bargaining positions within the household. The empirical analysis relies on panel data using a two limit Random Effects Tobit framework to identify determinants of a gender-neutral specialization index. Results indicate that for immigrants intermarriage is indeed related to less specialization, as is similar education levels of spouses, while children and being Muslim or Islamic are associated with greater specialization. For natives, on the other hand, the likelihood to specialize increases with intermarriage. This might result from differences in bargaining strength or be due to adaptation to immigrants’ gender roles.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>JEL classification</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n                <jats:p>J1, J12.</jats:p>",

Culture becomes the means by which capitalism imposes itself as an ideological system. This paper asks how Kulturkritik might be revived or revisited in the current moment of capitalist globalisation. Focusing on changes to production systems introduced by the growth of logistics and supply chain management, it argues that cultural processes of translation, signification, communication and argument have become deeply and materially embedded in the development of capitalism. Particular attention is paid to how infrastructure and technology shape relations of capital and labour. The paper asks how the subjective force of labour can exploit the vulnerabilities inherent in supply chains and confront the networked forms of organisation that enable contemporary capitalism. Overall the aim is to establish a role for culture in struggles against capitalism and to rethink the place of critique and ideology in the wake of such an approach.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Transportplanungsprobleme werden in der Literatur typischerweise nach Art der zu berücksichtigenden Restriktionen (etwa Kapazität, Zeitfenster) sowie der Art der logistischen Aktivität (etwa Anlieferung, Anlieferung plus Abholung) unterschieden. Bildet man das Transportplanungsproblem in ein Modell der Supply-Chain ab, ergeben sich verschiedene Modellrestriktionen und Parameter, die je nach Problem zu berücksichtigen sind.Moderne integrierte Supply-Chain-Management Systeme, wie etwa das TPVS-Modul in SAP-SCM 7.0 oder gar SAP-TM, sind in der Lage, eine Reihe von Klassen dieser Transportplanungsprobleme direkt abzubilden, falls die Parameter entsprechend gewählt werden.Für einige Transportplanungsprobleme existieren zudem Benchmarks, die bisher bekannte beste Lösungen mit ihren Kosten pro Lösung spezifizieren und zur Bewertung von Implementierungen von Transportalgorithmen herangezogen werden.Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, die wesentlichen bekannten Klassen von Transportplanungsproblemen sowie die zugehörigen Benchmarks darzustellen. Für die wesentlichen Klassen wird die Abdeckung in TPVS dargestellt und die für die Abdeckung notwendigen Parameter spezifiziert. Zudem wird betrachtet, was im Rahmen der integrierten Planung in SCM bei Abbildung der Benchmarks in SNP zu beachten ist. </jats:p>"

Approach: Relief data was obtained from the Relief Coordination Center (RCC), Pingtung County Government during July 10 to July 28, 2009. The relief was classified into food and supplies categories. Results: The most need of relief was cleaner necessaries (8/15 = 53.3 %), the last need of relief was seasoning (0/15 = 0 %). The subjects including eggs, bread, cloths, socks, lighter, and candle were not required by the victims although they were donated by people. Conclusion: The several catchment areas in Pingtung County needed to be cleaned after the flooding. Therefore, the kind of cleaner necessaries was the most as well as the longest need of relief expectantly. Our results suggest the priorities of resources allocation for the next disaster.

With the development of a low carbon economy, further requirements for energy-saving and emission-reducing have been put forward for electric power supply companies. In this case, we considered the desirable (good) outputs (e.g., electricity sale amount) and undesirable (bad) outputs (e.g., line loss) in evaluating the performance of power supply companies. We combined the unified efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and the super-efficiency DEA model to create tge USDEA model, calculating companies’ unified efficiency. The unified efficiency DEA model can easily incorporate both desirable and undesirable outputs in a unified analytical structure. The super-efficiency data envelopment analysis model can make a comparison among various efficient decision making units (DMUs). Our results showed that the electric power supply companies of Hebei, Qinghai, Ningxia, Beijing and Shanghai achieved the highest levels of unified efficiency during the observed period (2003–2010), which differed from the economic efficiency results. The results meant that using unified efficiency to evaluate power supply companies will motivate them to care more about social and environmental benefit besides economic benefit.</jats:p>"

However, when a horizontal merger occurs in a multitier decentralized supply chain where a finite number of firms compete at each tier, we show that this result holds only when a merger occurs at the tier that acts as the leader in the supply chain. In this supply chain, a horizontal merger at any other tier will decrease consumer price when the cost reduction exceeds a certain threshold that is larger than the premerger markup. Moreover, this threshold is increasing as the supply chain gets longer and can be substantially larger than the premerger markup. When accounting for subsequent entry after a merger in long-run equilibrium, contrary to a common belief, a larger synergy from a merger does not necessarily benefit consumers more. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossiv Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

This system can automatically adjust the mode of operation in accordance with different working conditons. The controller can choose the number of working pumps and change the motor speed to achieve constant pressure water supply. The PID regulator is set in the CPS-20B1 controller to adjust the output of the inverter, and the automatic regulating system is formed into a closed loop. The simulation results and practical application show that this system used in the water supply network can keep the water pressure stable. This system has been used in a number of industrial and civil water supply service since 2009, which improved efficiency and saved cost.</jats:p>"

A series of XAD resins were used to fractionate DOM based on their hydrophobicity and functional group. The results show that hydrophobic acid (HPOA) fraction was the most important precursor pool for haloacetonitrile (HAN); these precursors mainly generated HAN through chloramine incorporation. HPOA and hydrophobic neutral (HPON) gave higher trichloronitromethane (TCNM) yields than the other fractions did. The nitrogen origin upon chloramination of HPOA was primarily from dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). By contrast, chloramines provided the main nitrogen sources during chloraminating HPON and HPOA with low DON to dissolved organic carbon ratios. The results of formation kinetics show that dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) of which nitrogen source originate from DON formed faster than that of which nitrogen source originate from chloramines. Under normal chloramine exposure (4,000 mg-min/L, equal to 2 mg/L chloramines with around 2 days' reaction duration), 14N-DCAN concentration was two to over five times higher than that of 15N-DCAN. This study also uses a model to calculate the formation concentration of nitrogenous disinfection by-products without hydrolysis effects. The results show that 15N-DCAN formation was linearly correlated with chloramine exposure.</jats:p>",

A circuit diagram of the power supply included two opposite charged branches (each consisting of four voltage doublers). The designed CW VM was powered by 230 V/50 Hz alternate current and it generated up to 5 kV and 90 mW at the output. Voltage and current characteristics of the power supply were measured by known load resistances in the range from 10 kΩ to 1 GΩ, which is a common resistance range for IEF strip geometry. Further, the power supply was tested by a separation of a model mixture of colored p<jats:italic>I</jats:italic> markers using a 175 × 3 × 0.5 mm focusing bed. Automatically limited power load enabled analysis of samples without previous optimization of the focusing voltage or electric current time courses according to sample composition.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the removal of negatively charged suspended solids (SS) in surface water treatment using magnetic particles (nFeO; FeO · Fe2O3) synthesised in our laboratory. The performance of nFeO in removing turbidity, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and trihalomethanes (THMs) was compared to the performance of coagulation with polyaluminium chloride (PACl) and to that of a combined nFeO–PACl system. High-turbidity water was prepared by re-dispersing SS with abundant SiO2 and Al2O3 into tap and river waters. The SS were collected from the Ara River in Japan after heavy rain. By adding nFeO to the turbid water, magnetic flocs of several microns in diameter were formed. The nFeO dosage, the solution pH and DOM influenced the turbidity removal by the nFeO. Introducing a low nFeO dose of 6.3 mg/L followed by 20 mg/L PACl reduced turbidity from 51 to 1.6 NTU, an effect that was associated with a total THM removal of 54%. Surface charge, aggregation kinetics and scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that both physical and surface charge interactions contributed to flocculation of SS by magnetic seeding.</jats:p>",

Investigations concluded that the interlocks functioned as designed on loss‐of‐airflow but were not sufficient to prevent overheating the inlet air filters (including HEPA filters) by the residual heat in the air heaters.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As technology scaling down, power consumption of integrated circuits increases tremendously due to leakage current. Power gating is one of the most effective techniques to reduce leakage power by shutting off idle blocks from power supply. However, during a power-mode transition, an instantaneous charge current passes through the switch transistor, and creates current surge elsewhere. Because of the self-inductance of the off-chip bonding wires and parasitic inductance inherent to the on-chip power rails, these surges result in severe simultaneous switching noise (SSN), which results in function failure.Based on typical power delivery network, it is found that the magnitude of SSN would accumulate positively with Fcurrent = 1/(n + 1) Resonant, and the magnitude of SSN would accumulate negatively with Fcurrent = 1/(n + 1/2) Resonant. In this paper, a new method is proposed to suppress the power supply noise based on its periodic characteristic. By cutting power grid, partition of switch transistors and controlling their switching, smaller segmented charge current magnitude and controllable period can be provided into gated block for mitigating noise. The power supply noise produced by charge current can be suppressed through adjusting the delay of charge current and the magnitude of charge current which is verified by simulation. Compared to conventional power gating structures, this method can save decap area and is practical and flexible to embed in an optimization flow. A principle for controllable switch transistor chain is also given to simplify the high speed power delivery network design.</jats:p>",

This paper will analyze supply risks after making a brief study of different types of oil risks. In the second part, the paper will have a glance at the history and prospective of Chinas SPR system before trying to identify the optimal level of SPR. The paper will then have a horizontal comparison with identical countries and associations SPR policies, attempting to draw experiences from them. Based on all these discussions above, the last part will have an estimation of future SPR level and the optimal level requested. I then come to the conclusion under a series of strict assumptions that Chinas SPR will cover its supply shock in the coming decade.</jats:p>"

The results suggest that a rise in unearned income has a negative (although small) effect on working hours. In particular, after receiving a windfall gain, individuals are more likely to drop out of the labour force and the effects become larger as the size of windfall increases. Furthermore, the empirical findings show that the impact of windfall gains on labour supply: (i) is more important for young and old individuals, (ii) is most negative for married individuals with young children, (iii) but can be positive for single individuals without children at the age of around 40 years. The latter effect can be explained by individuals using the windfall gain to set up their own business and become self-employed.</jats:p>",

The aim of this paper is to present a simple technique which is able to estimate the mean consumption and its distribution for a given demand zone with an hourly resolution. Simplicity (low computational cost) is advantageous since the forecast model needs to be run for any optimization computation. The proposed technique uses a recorded hourly consumption database and consists of two steps. First, the database content is automatically grouped based on the similarity of the elements (more precisely, their normality). This step is time-consuming but is performed only once for a given database independently of optimization. The second step – which is quick but has to be performed before the actual optimization – makes use of this grouping for forecasting mean value and standard deviation. The proposed technique provides hourly water consumption predictions independently; that is, the neighbouring hours do not effect each other, which prevents the accumulation of prediction errors. The daily overall consumption is computed a posteriori. The test results presented in this paper prove the applicability of the technique for real-life problems. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the confidence interval provided by the technique includes the actual measured data.</jats:p>",

We employ Markov-switching Bayesian vector autoregressions (MS-BVARs) to gather evidence about the hypothesis on a long annual U.S. sample running from 1890 to 2010. The sample covers several episodes useful for understanding U.S. economic and financial history, which generate variation in the data that aids in identifying credit supply and demand shocks. We identify these shocks within MS-BVARs by tying credit supply and demand movements to inside money and its intertemporal price. The model space is limited to stochastic volatility (SV) in the errors of the MS-BVARs. Of the 15 MS-BVARs estimated, the data favor a MS-BVAR in which economic and financial crises and noncrisis business cycle regimes recur throughout the long annual sample. The best-fitting MS-BVAR also isolates SV regimes in which shocks to inside money dominate aggregate fluctuations.</jats:p>",

In some instances, the decision maker may have to deal with the problems in which only partial information and uncertain preference relation is available. Consequently, the decision maker may provide interval fuzzy preference relation with incomplete information. In this paper, we focus our attention on the investigation of incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation. We first extend a characterization to the interval fuzzy preference relation which is based on the additive transitivity property. Using the characterization, we propose a method to construct interval additive consistent fuzzy preference relations from a set of n–1 preference data. The study reveals that the proposed method can not only alleviate the comparisons, but also ensure interval preference relations with the additive consistent property. We also develop a novel procedure to deal with the analytic hierarchy problem for group decision making with incomplete interval fuzzy preference relations. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated and a supplier selection case in supply chain management is investigated using the proposed method.</jats:p>"

Several novel model-based approaches to managing such risks have been developed in the academic literature, but how behavioral tendencies may affect procurement decisions under such conditions has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we present results from a study where paid subjects were asked to place orders from two suppliers who differ in their costs and risks to satisfy a fixed amount of end-customer demand. We show that under such a scenario, it is theoretically optimal to sole source either from the more reliable (and more costly) supplier or from the more risky but cheaper supplier, depending on cost and risk parameters. Subjects in our experiment, however, show a systematic tendency to diversify their orders between the two sources. We document this diversification tendency in procurement decisions and its possible impact on profits under various cost and risk settings as well as comment on various ordering behavior observed during the experiments. We also establish that bounded rationality of subjects can provide a possible rationale for the above phenomenon. </jats:p>",

The phenomenon by which consumers hold firms responsible for the unsustainable behavior of their upstream partners suggests the notion of “chain liability.” This study aims to generate insights into the antecedents and consequences of such consumer responsibility attributions. Using data from four vignette‐based survey experiments, the authors find that the chain liability effect increases if an environmental degradation incident (1) results from supplier behavior rather than<jats:italic>force majeure</jats:italic>, (2) results from a company decision rather than the decision of an individual employee, and (3) is more severe. Responsibility attributions do not differ with varying organizational distance from the supplier, firm size, strategic importance of the supplied product, or the existence of environmental management systems. The chain liability effect also creates strong risks for the focal firm; higher responsibility attributions increase consumers’ anger and propensity to boycott. Therefore, firms should work to ensure sustainable behavior throughout the supply chain, to protect them from chain liability.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Most of the DOM molecules were composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Molecular formulae in river water consisted of CHO mostly and much less N- and S-containing compounds than other water samples. The percentage of CHO molecules was the highest for reclaimed water. The reclaimed water sample was characterized by a few peaks with strong intensities, which were presumed to be linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, their co-products and their biodegradation products based on their molecular formulae. Some of these compounds were also detected from river water, probably indicating the impact of wastewater treatment plants located upstream of the sampling point.

Based on the battery characteristics, we build an energy loss model of various components of EV charging stations with different topologies including distribution transformer, power cable and charger with different conversion structure. Using this model, the system operation efficiencies of charging stations equipped with an AC or a DC supply bus are compared. The comparative results for both power supplies, acquired by the appropriate MATLAB/Simulink simulations, are presented.</jats:p>"

Information required for the study was obtained through interviews, administering a set of questionnaires and data collecting from existing documents. The results show that women in decision-making positions at head office of the Ministry responsible for water affairs only constitute about 11.1%. Assessment of the budget allocations has revealed that previously no budgetary allocations were made for gender issues, and that since the 2006/07 fiscal year about US$14,286 was allocated for gender mainstreaming. Women's involvement in local governance institutions and project activities in Mzimba is generally high. Most local water committees have 60% women and 40% men, whereas participation in project activities is highly rated at 97.2%. To improve gender balance, the Ministry responsible for water has to work with stakeholders in the education sector. Besides, great disparities still exist between men's and women's participation in water projects at a local level (97.2% for women) and a person's socioeconomic position greatly affects their inclusion in the local governance structures. Addressing these issues would, therefore, result in better gender integration in the water sector.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Management of new product introductions is critical for nearly all firms, and one of its most important dimensions is the management of demand during the introduction. Research analyzing this area predominantly uses versions of the diffusion model to capture the demand trajectory of a new product with a fixed potential market. The classic Bass model assumes that demand for innovative products is influenced both by “external” media influence and “internal” word-of-mouth effect, but it excludes price and assumes that capacity is unlimited. In reality, both factors critically influence firms' strategies. Price fluctuations for a new product are common, and price is often a critical lever that helps to shape the demand. Also, firms often have significant capacity constraints, which influence the feasibility of their strategies. In this paper, we consider how a capacity-constrained firm prices products during new product introductions. Thus, the demand rate is influenced by price and, when capacity is insufficient, we allow some customers to be either lost or backlogged, which slows down the word-of-mouth effect. To understand the effect of both pricing and capacity, we consider the integrated optimal pricing, production, and inventory decisions, using control-theory framework (a generalization of the classic Bass model). Most of our results are fairly robust and apply under the assumption of lost sales and partial backlogging, as well as make-to-order and make-to-stock environments. We show that in most cases, the optimal trajectory of demand is unimodal, as in the Bass model, but the optimal price trajectory and the corresponding pricing policy are more complicated when capacity is limited. Using a numerical study, we explore when pricing flexibility is most valuable and whether simple pricing policies may be effective. We find that benefits of pricing flexibility are highest when capacity is neither unlimited (very large) nor very small and when word-of-mouth effect dominates direct impact from media. The ability to adjust prices is significantly more important than the option of producing in advance and holding inventory. We also find that simple pricing policies, appropriately chosen for given capacity, perform very well. In a numerical study, we show that demand uncertainty and increases in capacity over time do not affect our main insights. </jats:p>",

The TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by conventional sol–gel method followed by blending them into PAN polymer. The blended solution was electrospun into nanofiber using the co-electrospinning technique. The nanoparticle, PAN nanofibers and the TiO2 impregnated nanofibers were characterized using suitable techniques like X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy attached with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The average size and the diameter of the TiO2 nanoparticles and TiO2/PAN nanofibers were found to be 22 ± 0.32 nm and 90 ± 15 nm respectively. TiO2 nanoparticles and TiO2/PAN nanofibers showed maximum nitrate removal of 74.67 and 39% respectively at 10 mg/L nitrate concentration at pH 4. However at higher concentration (50 mg/L), the nitrate removal was found to be only 16.87%. The experimental data were fitted onto pseudo second-order kinetic model. The impregnation of TiO2 nanoparticles into the PAN nanofibers by co-electrospinning techniques lead to higher removal of nitrate in aqueous solution at lower concentration (10 mg/L and below). However at higher concentration, the TiO2/PAN nanofiber membrane was inefficient to remove nitrate.</jats:p>",

Through integrated operations research (OR) models, SCSM optimizes the distribution network, supply flow, inventory, and transportation policies, and quantifies the impacts of changes on financial, operational, and environmental metrics. The modeling work spawned a roadmap of projects with quantified opportunities, including a new air freight supply chain path, and provided new insights that have been critical to improving McKesson’s performance as a pharmaceutical industry leader. A structured data model supporting the OR models has provided a basis for additional improvement projects. The model directly links OR modeling results to a detailed profit-and-loss statement by product category for the different supply chain paths that McKesson uses. Since this effort began in 2009, McKesson Pharmaceutical division has reduced its committed capital by more than $1 billion. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Aims: The aim of this study was to explore differences in self-rated health and physician-diagnosed disease across geographical regions in Iceland to better understand regional requirements for health services. Methods: Data on self-rated health and diagnosed disease from a 2007 national health survey ( n=5909; response rate 60.3%) across geographic regions were analysed. Area of residence was classified according to distance from the Capital Area (CA) and availability of local health services. We used regression models to calculate crude and multivariable adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of self-rated health and diagnosed diseases by area of residence. Models were adjusted for age, gender, education, civil status, and income. Results: Residents in rural areas with no local health service supply rated their physical health worse than residents of areas with diverse supply of specialised services (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.21–1.61). Residents outside the CA rate both their physical (aOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.23–1.50) and mental (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06–1.30) health worse than residents in the CA. In contrast, we observed a lower prevalence of several diagnosed chronic diseases, including cancers (aOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60–0.99) and cardiovascular disease (aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62–0.95) outside the CA. Conclusions: These findings from a national survey of almost 6000 Icelanders indicate that self-rated health is related to regional healthcare supply. The findings have implications for national planning of health services aiming at equality both in health and access to health services. </jats:p>",

Three AERs (IRA-910, IRA-958, and MIEX) were evaluated to determine which resin would remove the most natural organic matter (NOM) and moieties responsible for DBP formation. All the AERs were found to be highly proficient at NOM removal specifically the moieties that absorb UV254 (i.e., chromophores) over 75 min of contact time; however, MIEX removed NOM at a faster rate than IRA-910 and IRA-958 resins. Enhanced coagulation was effective at removing approximately 35% of the NOM and 40–60% of the chromophores and fluorophores (i.e., excitation–emission matrix pairs A and C). DBP formation was determined as a function of pH for the different NOM removal processes. MIEX treatment resulted in significant reduction in DBP concentrations when compared to chlorinating the raw source water. MIEX generally out-performed enhanced coagulation for reducing DBP formation. However, alum was found to remove more NOM and resulted in less DBPs compared to aluminum chlorohydrate. This could impact water utilities trying to balance the health effects due to DBP exposure verses chemical/sludge management costs.</jats:p>",

Long-term impacts of environmental conditions on algal dynamics were investigated in the Paldang dam watershed, Korea. Dam inflow, water temperature, chlorophyll-a, TN, PO4-P and TP data collected at five major dams located on the North Han River (NHR) and at four water quality monitoring sites on the South Han River were analyzed for 21 years (1992 to 2012) to examine spatio-temporal variations in each. A pattern of slightly increasing chlorophyll-a and nutrient levels in the NHR since 2001 indicates that algal dynamics were affected by the increased nutrient levels as well as the reduced flow conditions (−10% to −37%). The temporal variations in monthly averaged data collected during summer monsoon seasons (mainly July) over the two decades show that high chlorophyll-a levels observed in both rivers corresponded to the relatively lower flow condition, which means a reduced amount of dam water release due to low or no rainfall over a short period of time, and abnormally high water temperature. This study shows that flow control is most critical for effectively managing algal level in the rivers in the short term, and nutrient management in the watershed is the key to reducing the potential for algal bloom in the long term.</jats:p>",

The sales agent is working mainly at the retailer's location to boost demand. We focus on a wholesale price contract, under which the retailer decides how much to order from the manufacturer. The information structure within the supply chain and the efficiency of the sales agent affect the supply chain members' expected profits. We show that, because of the agency issue between the sales agent and the manufacturer, when the retailer's demand forecast accuracy is similar to the manufacturer's and the wholesale price is fixed, the retailer's profit decreases as his demand forecast accuracy improves. We also illustrate that when the retailer's forecast accuracy is much better than the manufacturer's and the wholesale price is endogenous, his expected profit decreases as his forecast accuracy improves. Moreover, we demonstrate that having a more efficient sales agent is beneficial for the retailer when the wholesale price is fixed, whereas this is not always the case when the wholesale price depends on the efficiency of the sales agent. </jats:p>",

In view of a limited future supply of biomass, this article outlines the options to further develop carbon recycling (C‐REC). The focus is on carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) capture and use for synthesis of platform chemicals to produce polymers. CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> may be captured from exhaust gases after combustion or fermentation of waste in order to establish a C‐REC system within the technosphere. As a long‐term option, an external C‐REC system can be developed by capturing atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. A central role may be expected from renewable methane (or synthetic natural gas), which is increasingly being used for storage and transport of energy, but may also be used for renewable carbon supply for chemistry. The energy input for the C‐REC processes can come from wind and solar systems, in particular, power for the production of hydrogen, which is combined with CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> to produce various hydrocarbons. Most of the technological components for the system already exist, and, first modules for renewable fuel and polymer production systems are underway in Germany. This article outlines how the system may further develop over the medium to long term, from a piggy‐back add‐on flow system toward a self‐carrying recycling system, which has the potential to provide the material and energy backbone of future societies. A critical bottleneck seems to be the capacity and costs of renewable energy supply, rather than the costs of carbon capture.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rebounding water use behaviour has been observed in communities that have experienced plentiful water supply following a very dry period. However, the drivers of such rebounds in water consumption are varied and not well understood. Knowledge of such drivers can greatly assist managers towards proactive demand management, modelling and timely promotion of water efficient behaviours. Total and end-use residential water consumption has been tracked in South East Queensland, Australia for a sample of up to 252 homes in post-drought conditions (dam supplies growing but water restrictions continued, changed water use behaviours still ‘fresh’), and during and post-flooding conditions (eased restrictions, 100% dam capacity). Data on end-use water consumption trends using nearly 3 years of residential water end-use data have revealed several interesting patterns of consumption such as a delayed return to pre-drought use, the influence of climate and end-use specific rebounds (e.g. indoor versus outdoor use). The end-use data have helped to identify the drivers of rebounding water consumption which appear to include environmental cues (rainfall, temperature), social cues (e.g. government encouraging consumers to turn on tap) and a gradual general reduction in conservative water use behaviours. The paper concludes with a discussion of how this knowledge can be used to inform long-term demand management policy, particularly in variable climates.</jats:p>",

These processes require a large amount of ATP molecules to be maintained. Of these, synaptic transmission is most energy consuming. Here we report that lactate transported through monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) at excitatory synapses constitutively supports synaptic transmission, even under conditions in which a sufficient supply of glucose and intracellular ATP are present. We analyzed the effects of MCT inhibition on neuronal activities using whole-cell recordings in brain slices of rats in the nucleus of the solitary tract. MCT inhibitors (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4-CIN), phloretin, and<jats:sc>d</jats:sc>-lactate) significantly decreased the amplitude of EPSCs without reducing release probability. Although 4-CIN significantly reduced currents mediated by heterologously expressed AMPA-Rs in oocytes (a novel finding in this study), the IC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>of the inhibitory effect on EPSC in brain slices was ∼3.8 times smaller than that on AMPA-R currents in oocytes. Removal of intracellular ATP significantly potentiated the inhibition of EPSC with 4-CIN in a manner that was counteracted by intracellular lactate addition. In addition, extracellular lactate rescued aglycemic suppression of EPSC, in a manner that was prevented by 4-CIN. Inhibition of MCTs also reduced NMDA-R-mediated EPSCs and, to a lesser extent, the IPSC. The reduction in EPSC amplitude by γ-<jats:sc>d</jats:sc>-glutamylglycine was enhanced by 4-CIN, suggesting also a decreased quantal content. We conclude that “on-site” astrocyte-neuron lactate transport to presynaptic and postsynaptic elements is necessary for the integrity of excitatory synaptic transmission.</jats:p>",

A retailer exhibits peer‐induced fairness concerns when his own profit is behind that of a peer retailer interacting with the same supplier. In addition, a retailer exhibits distributional fairness when his supplier's share of total profit is larger than his own. While existing research focuses exclusively on distributional fairness concerns, this study investigates how both types of fairness might interact and influence economic outcomes in a supply chain. We consider a one‐supplier and two‐retailer supply chain setting, and we show that (i) in the presence of distributional fairness alone, the wholesale price offer is lower than the standard wholesale price offer; (ii) in the presence of both types of fairness, the second wholesale price is higher than the first wholesale price; and (iii) in the presence of both types of fairness, the second retailer makes a lower profit and has a lower share of the total supply chain profit than the first retailer. We run controlled experiments with subjects motivated by substantial monetary incentives and show that subject behaviors are consistent with the model predictions. Structural estimation on the data suggests that peer‐induced fairness is more salient than distributional fairness. </jats:p>",

Our model is motivated by laboratory observations under several types of supply chain contracts. Ordering decisions are found to follow multi‐modal distributions that are dependent on contract structures and incentives. We differ from previous research by using statistics to determine which behavioral factors are applicable to each decision maker. A great deal of heterogeneity was discovered, indicating the importance of calibrating a contract to the individual. Our analysis also shows that the profit performance and the effectiveness of co‐ordinating contracts can be affected by non‐optimizing behaviors significantly. We conclude that, in addition to the aggregate order quantities, the decision distributions should be considered in designing contracts. </jats:p>",

Finally, iCMaps with a white region surrounded with yellow and green was assigned a “4”. Examples of iCMaps scoring are shown in Fig. B. Using a DSA scoring method in the literature5, a score of 1-5 was given independently based on the degree of retrograde collateralization (5: poor collateralization).\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>\n            Good correlation was found between the MR perfusion iCMaps and DSA (DSA=0.70*MR iCMaps+0.54, R=0.75).

In this study, we report the performance of a zeolite permeable reactive barrier (PRB) designed to remove ammonium from contaminated river water that infiltrates to a groundwater aquifer that serves as a drinking water supply for the city of Shenyang. Groundwater monitoring data obtained over 5 months of operation indicate that ammonium concentrations in the groundwater decreased from 2–10 mg/L to &amp;lt;0.5 mg/L after the PRB was installed in the vicinity. Data suggest that ammonium removal was mainly due to sorption and ion exchange, with NH4+ exchanged with Na+ and K+ in the zeolite. After more than 1 year of continuous operation, there is no evidence of microbial ammonium oxidation. To our knowledge, this was the first field-scale demonstration of a PRB in China.</jats:p>",

All other marine organisms must source their essential FA directly from phytoplankton or indirectly through the food web. Thus, the growth and abundance of all organisms in the marine ecosystem is constrained not just by the rate of carbon fixation in photosynthesis but also by the rate of synthesis of essential FAs. Despite the significance of this controlling step, we have had until now only very limited knowledge of the amount, distribution and rate of synthesis of essential FAs in the sea. Here, we report results on the quantity of a specific essential omega-3 FA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the ocean, obtained with a novel application of ocean-colour data collected by remote sensing. Using in situ samples collected in the Northwest Atlantic, we developed a simple model to describe the relationship between total FAs and total chlorophyll-a. We refined these by examining the relationships of FAs produced predominantly by diatoms with the fraction of total chlorophyll-a derived from diatoms. These models were then applied to satellite data to map the distribution of EPA relative to diatom carbon in the Northwest Atlantic. With extrapolation to the global oceans, we were able to provide a first estimate of annual production of EPA, which demonstrated that the supply was barely sufficient to meet the nutritional demand of the world population in the present day; as the world population increases, this resource may become inadequate to meet those demands. This approach will allow us to begin to address issues such as the budget of essential FAs in the ocean and the maximum sustainable rate at which these FAs could be harvested from the ocean without compromising the integrity of the marine ecosystem.</jats:p>",

Adequate nutrient inputs and crop‐rotation practices are among the most important measures to insure a successful, rapid development of strawberry nursery plants. However, relationships between macronutrient use and strawberry‐nursery‐plant formation in different rotation environments are not well understood. Our objectives were to assess strawberry plant P : N nutrition and nursery development under various limited and unlimited P inputs applied at different growth stages and to examine how nursery plants cope with limited P inputs. The field studies were conducted in a wheat–ryegrass–ryegrass–strawberry (WRRS) system in 2008 and in another corn–ryegrass–ryegrass–strawberry (CRRS) system in 2009 in Nova Scotia, Canada. The nursery crop was cv. Strawberry Festival and the experimental treatments consisted of three mother‐stock P (MSP) rates (0, 6.6, and13.2 P kg ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>) and five daughter‐plant P (DPP) rates (0, 13.2, 26.4, 39.6, and 52.8 kg P ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>), representing 0%–125% of the regional recommendations for strawberry nursery. The P treatments were arranged with three blocks in a split‐plot design in each field. The results showed that the effects and interactions of the MSP and DPP treatments were significant (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 5%) on whole‐plant P and N acquisition and nursery productivity. Two‐year whole‐plant total P and N acquisition varied between (13.2 ± 2.0) kg P ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> and (46 ± 7.3) kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> (n = 270) in both nursery systems. There was a quadratic regression relationship between nursery runners and daughter plants with plant P and N acquisition (0.33 &lt; <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>&lt;?h.3&gt;<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> &lt; 0.42, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 5%). Soil pH levels declined with time and were positively correlated with nursery‐plant formation. Too many runners (18–22 per mother stock) might reduce nursery‐plant formation. Limited P inputs (37.5%–62.5% of regular recommendation) might result in a suitable plant P : N ratio (0.12–0.13) and adequate daughter plant‐to‐runner ratios (1.4–1.7) for optimum nursery formation (14–16 daughter plants per mother stock). Nutrient P was the single controlled factor influencing the N acquisition of nursery plants. High P inputs (&gt; 39.6 P ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> or &gt; 75% of regular recommendation) may harm the crops. Therefore, this study implies that low‐input horticulture can improve the nutrition management of strawberry nursery.</jats:p>",

While individual Member States and companies have put forward sustainability criteria, it remains unclear how different requirements will influence the availability and cost of solid biomass and thus how specific regions will satisfy their demand in a competitive global market. We combined a geospatially explicit least‐cost biomass supply model with a linear optimization solver to assess global solid biomass trade streams by 2020 with a particular focus on <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NW EU</jats:styled-content>. We apply different demand and supply scenarios representing varying policy developments and sustainability requirements. We find that the projected <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EU</jats:styled-content> solid biomass demand by 2020 can be met across all scenarios, almost exclusively via domestic biomass. The exploitation of domestic agricultural residue and energy crop potentials, however, will need to increase sharply. Given sustainability requirements for solid biomass as for liquid biofuels, extra‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EU</jats:styled-content> imports may reach 236 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PJ</jats:styled-content> by 2020, i.e., 400% of their 2010 levels. Intra‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EU</jats:styled-content> trade is expected to grow with stricter sustainability requirements up to 548 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PJ</jats:styled-content>, i.e., 280% of its 2010 levels by 2020. Increasing sustainability requirements can have different effects on trade portfolios across <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NW EU</jats:styled-content>. Excluding pulpwood pellets may drive the supply costs of import dependent countries, foremost the Netherlands and the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content>, whereas excluding additional forest biomass may entail higher costs for Germany and Denmark which rely on regional biomass. Excluding solid biomass fractions may create short‐term price hikes. Our modeling results are strongly influenced by parameterization choices, foremost assumed <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EU</jats:styled-content> biomass supply volumes and costs and assumed relations between criteria and supply. The model framework is suited for the inclusion of dynamic supply–demand interactions and other world regions.</jats:p>",

The proposed voltage‐source power supply can not only generate sinusoidal fundamental voltage waveforms, but also produce desired harmonic and asymmetrical voltage waveforms for applications of series active power filter, dynamic voltage regulator, uninterrupted power supply and programmable AC power source. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel operating strategy under synchronous coordinate frame based on internal model principle controllers, in such a way that it can provide more accurate tracking ability for generalised voltage references. Besides, the features of fast dynamic response, high stability and easy implementation are offered. The detailed design and analysis for the proposed strategy are given. An improved virtual resistor method is proposed to further improve the performance of the generalised voltage‐source power supply. Both simulated and experimental results are given to verify the validity of the proposed approaches.</jats:p>",

At the present time, grain sizes have been controlled to improve the mechanical properties of fabricated micro features. The centre of attention of the study is application of pulsed power supply on the developed ultrasonic-assisted jet electrodeposition set-up, which involves pulsed current application between nozzle (electrolyte) and work surface in ultrasonic-assisted jet electrodeposition process instead of direct current application. The impacts of frequency and duty cycle on the grain size, nanomechanical properties and microhardness of fabricated micro features have been studied. It is experimentally observed that the pulsed current ultrasonic-assisted jet electrodeposition process has the capability to fabricate nano-sized grain micro parts and yields better mechanical properties as compared to those obtainable using direct current ultrasonic-assisted jet electrodeposition process. </jats:p>",

We formulate a bi‐level Stackelberg game for the supply chain finance system in which the bank acts as the leader and the manufacturer as the subleader. Considering the bankruptcy risks of the manufacturer and the retailer, we analyze the optimal financing interest rate for the commercial bank, the optimal order for the retailer and the optimal wholesale price for the manufacturer, respectively. We compare our model with two benchmark cases, that is, no financing scheme and infinite‐credit‐line financing scheme, to find out the important interactions between the operational and financial decisions in the supply chain finance system. It concluded that the different interest rates and credit lines would affect the supply chain operations. Finally, we demonstrate the impacts of different capital levels and interest rates on the optimal decisions through numerical studies that validate our theoretical analysis.

On‐farm surveys were conducted to document the dominant harvesting practices used by farmers and their perceptions of barriers to adoption of alternative harvesting practices. In districts with less emphasis on livestock, less labour and inadequate facilities to store conserved lucerne, smaller areas of lucerne are grown and it is often harvested daily to meet demand from penned livestock. The consequence is that much of the lucerne is harvested either before or after flowering, resulting in suboptimal yield of biomass and crude protein. Field experiments conducted at low and high rainfall locations on the Loess Plateau over three seasons showed that delaying the start to harvest until after mid‐June (the date of first flowering), while not affecting total biomass harvested for the season, does reduce leaf biomass harvested and hence crude protein concentration and yield. Lower crude protein is a consequence of a decline in both leaf percentage in harvested biomass and stem nitrogen concentration. Commencing harvests well before flowering with short (3 week) harvest intervals also penalized total and leaf biomass harvested. Raising cutting height from ground level (current farmer practice) to 50 mm (likely with the advent of mechanized harvesting) did not penalize harvested total or leaf biomass.</jats:p>",

Freeze‐dried dairy cattle feces were used (external archaea) as co‐inoculum (Co‐i) and structural carbohydrates (CHO: apple pulp; sugar beet pulp; and wheat straw) as substrates. Bottles were incubated (39 ± 1°C for 56 days), and the gas production was measured (mbar) and converted to the volume. A sample of produced gas was taken and analyzed for methane concentration using a gas chromatography. Bottles were opened at days 0, 25, and 56 to determine total bacteria, total, and hydrogenotrophic methanogens archaea (HMA) concentrations using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and population biodiversity using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Incubation time reduced the titers of total bacteria and archaea (P &lt; 0.01) but did not modify HMA population. Doses of Co‐i showed a positive correlation with HMA titers, although interacted with an incubation period (P &lt; 0.001); at 5% Co‐inoculation, total bacteria decreased significantly (0–25 days) but remained steady until day 56 (P &gt; 0.05), whereas at 10% Co inoculation, titers decreased constantly. Most of the archaeal DGGE bands were observed in all samples, suggesting a common microbial population origin but Co‐i supply altered the DGGE structure of archaea populations. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 34: 54–64, 2015</jats:p>",

Late‐laying birds at all latitudes lay clutches of similar sizes, suggesting that latitudinal differences may be driven primarily by earlier‐laying birds. Focused comparisons of site‐years in North America with qualitatively different food availability indicate that food supply significantly affects mean clutch size but not the clutch size–lay date regression. Other studies on the seasonality of swallow food also indicate that steeper clutch size–lay date declines in the North are not caused by steeper earlier food peaks there. The distribution of lay dates grows increasingly right‐skewed with increasing latitude. This variation in lay‐date distributions could be due to the predominance of higher quality, early‐laying (and large‐clutched) individuals among populations at higher latitudes, resulting from latitudinal variation in mortality rates and the intensity of sexual selection. Our results underscore the importance of studying clutch size and lay date in tandem and suggest new research into the causes of their joint geographic variation.</jats:p>",
