The report's projections do not appear to be inevitable projections do not appear to be inevitable or even highly probable. The somewhat uncritical acceptance of the Initial Appraisal projections as a forecast of the future by some members of the industry and others tends to obscure the possibility that the nation may have real choices in the matter of energy supply within the period to 1985 as well as beyond.

The purposes of the model are twofold: (1) to generate short-run predictive estimates of milk production, consumption by major product groupings, government support purchases, and farm level gross income from sale of dairy products; (2) to provide a facility for analysis of alternative support prices, or other policy instruments. It is one of a collection of models of the dairy industry being developed by Farm Production Economics Division at Purdue University. This particular model serves a central role since it forms both the linkage from the reported aggregate statistics to a series of regional production models and also the linkage from a model of the current institutional framework to models which can analyze alternative institutional frameworks (e.g., spatial equilibrium or competitive position models). Primary emphasis will be on the model but representative results will be presented to show validity and possible uses of the model.</jats:p>",

Stochastic inflows feeding a water supply reservoir are assumed for a hypothetical community with defined demand functions. Prices are allowed to vary as a function of reservoir level, generally rising as reservoir levels fall. Increasing, decreasing and constant rates are tested. It is concluded that varying the price to reflect the increased value of scarce supplies can greatly reduce the risk of water supply shortages. It is also concluded that varying incremental (conservational) pricing policies not only reduces the risk of shortages, but also lowers the average price to the community while rewarding the low consumption user with lower average rates.</jats:p>",
