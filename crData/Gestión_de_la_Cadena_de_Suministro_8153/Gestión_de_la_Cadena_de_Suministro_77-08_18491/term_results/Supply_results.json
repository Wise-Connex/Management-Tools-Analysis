The model is first formulated as a general differential game problem. Then, after assumptions regarding competitors' strategy are specified, the problem becomes and is solved as an optimal control problem. It appears that the joint effect of both constraints generates an optimal price trajectory that may only have a local minimum; that is, if it is not monotonic, it will initially decrease and eventually increase. </jats:p>",

These data suggest that the extensive mobility of the temporomandibular joint, and the maintenance of mandibular posture during mastication and speech are strongly influenced by proprioceptive mechanisms. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A model describing physician supply and distribution is described. Two surveys obtained information to examine elements of the model. The first survey identified a group of primary care physicians that had considered rural locations but ultimately selected an urban location. This sub-group, 29 per cent of the primary care supply pool, received a follow-up survey to provide more information about how they made their choice. About one-half of them finally chose on the basis of factors other than metropolitan/non-metropolitan considerations. For this half, some of the factors that entered into the decision were the availability of physician specialists, nearby hospital facilities, and access to medical school programs. Such factors could be affected by future policy decisions, but the cost is unknown. Even if such policy decisions were made, and appropriate programs instituted, the results would probably not solve the problem of disproportionate physician distribution. The most likely-to-succeed approach to increasing the number of rural physicians remains that of increasing the number of entrants to medical school with a rural background. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In five well-trained and five sedentary control subjects potential subendocardial blood supply was estimated from the diastolic pressure time index (DPTI) and myocardial oxygen demands from the tension time index (TII) during a progressive near-maximal treadmill test. DPTI/TTi was used to assess the effects of training on myocardial oxygen supply/demand balance. DPTI/TTI was significantly higher in trained subjects at rest and comparable workloads. At 6.4 km/hr, 18% grade (maximum for the controls), TTI was significantly lower (4300 +/- 76 vs 4495 +/- 99 mm Hg-sec/min) and DPTI significantly higher (2534 +/- 86 vs 2295 +/- 91 mm Hg-sec/min) in the trained subjects; DPTI/TTI was significantly higher (0.59 +/- .02 vs 0.50 vs .03). At near-maximal heart rates both groups achieved the same supply/demand balance (0.50); however, the trained subjects were working at higher workloads. We conclude that endurance conditioning increases work capacity, reduces myocardial O2 demands, increases potential O2 supply and improves the supply/demand balance at any given submaximal workload which reduces the risk of ischemia.</jats:p>",

Our observations show that the intraosseous vessels are richly supplied by adrenergic nerves. The large primary nerves are located on or about the surface of the vessel; the medium sized secondary nerves spiral around the long axis of vessels lying more deeply in the tunica adventitia; and the fine tertiary nerves form a rich plexus at the outer area of the tunica media. The tertiary nerves have various structures which probably contain neurotransmitter substance--that is, noradrenaline--and function as neuro-vasomuscular synapses. The sympathetic nerve supply of bone originates from the appropriate ganglion, and in the case of the tibial diaphysis it descends through the sciatic nerve and thereafter mainly through the medial popliteal nerve and enters the bone alongside the nutrient artery. </jats:p>",
