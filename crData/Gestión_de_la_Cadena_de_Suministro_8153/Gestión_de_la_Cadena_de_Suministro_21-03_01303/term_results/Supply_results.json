      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Approximately half of US government supply chain procurement contracts failed to meet all objectives. In 2018 the US government spent almost US$2bn on procurement contracts. Failed procurement projects represent a lot of public tax-payer dollars which are wasted each year. The US government does not necessarily intend for its government procurement contracts to fail, but when they are awarded on a fixed firm price basis, the entire project management is transferred to civilian contractors for a specific cost. When something goes wrong, contractors are forced to adjust the other parameters such as time, scope and/or quality. It appears many government supply chain procurement contracts are failing despite substantial analysis of project data by academic scholars and practitioners. In the literature, most researchers could not statistically identify the underlying causes of government procurement contract failures. In fact, the sample sizes surpassed 10,000 and in one case almost 60,000 cases were examined without generating a conclusive statistical result. It was clear a new study like ours was warranted. Thus, in this study, we collected a large sample of procurement project data from US government contractors. We tested several hypotheses in an attempt to identify which conditions affected government procurement contract breaches. We applied robust parametric statistical techniques, namely logistic regression, to test the hypotheses. We developed a statistically significant model which adequately explained US government supply chain procurement contract performance. This paper is in a scholarly format using statistical techniques which are primarily aimed at an academic audience rather than practitioners. We followed the well-known American Psychology Association conventions for writing style which resulted in this paper having a strong academic tone. Nonetheless, the results ought to be of interest to scholars and practitioners alike. Scholars will be able to replicate our research design with new sample sizes of at least 1,000 in other states or countries and cite our findings. Practitioners and government procurement programme managers should find it relevant that our statistical model correctly classified 67 per cent of US government procurement contract performance, with an 11 per cent effect size using only two predictors (project manager certification and ISO quality registered). We found that if a project manager was professionally certified, this increased the likelihood of contract success by 2.3 times. Decision makers could use this model for procurement policy revision or to inform selection criteria in government contract awards.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, some of the supply chain’s most basic activities, such as manufacturing and transportation, are not sustainable. Empty miles, product damage and even traditional recycling are complicating global efforts to reduce CO2. Rethinking how products move through the supply chain will require global collaboration. This article explores business-to-consumer and business-to-business efforts to change supply chain functions with sustainability in mind. Next, it provides examples of companies that are leading their industry’s efforts to ‘go green’, using strategies such as closed loop manufacturing and reduced product touches. Finally, it provides thoughts for companies looking to undertake their own sustainability initiatives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Most companies by and large have tuned their supply chains to either focus on achieving the lowest total cost or providing most flexibility in responding to customer demands. Regardless of the company’s supply chain strategy design, leading companies continue to invest in their people, business process and digital technology to extend their competitive advantage in the marketplace. Leading companies want to be able to predict supply chain performance and achieve above-market returns when supply matches demand. When the global pandemic COVID-19 hit the world, however, most companies’ supply chain systems were thrown into disarray, and companies could not respond predictably. The current supply chain system was no longer operating in a stable environment when both the demand and the supply sides of the equation were simultaneously affected. As pharmaceutical and bio firms raced to develop vaccines to protect citizens, the hope is that the vaccines will be here shortly and the world will be able to return to normal. It is during this period of uncertainty that supply chain management and professionals should consider questions such as what the post-COVID-19 global supply chain management framework should look like and what are the factors that should be considered going forward from a supply chain management practitioner’s perspective. This paper attempts to answer these questions based on interviews from a few selected companies and supply chain literature research and business articles review.</jats:p>"

This paper takes two main SCM practices, i.e. supply chain flexibility (SCF) and supply chain strategy (SCS).Against this background, this paper acknowledged 5 success factors (SFs) for supply chain flexibility and 3 success factors (SFs) for supply chain strategy for proper implementation of SCM practices in the Automobile industry, and studied their impact on three factors of supply chain performance (SCP), and thereby on firms performance. The top management of any industry is focused on their core strength with commitment, long-term vision and provides resources for supply chain, and thereby developing effective and efficient SCS emerged as the most significant SFs. To measure the impact on supply chain performance, the author carefully measures different SFs of SCS related to customer-oriented strategy, innovation strategy and agile supply chain strategy on cost performance, logistics performance and customer satisfaction performance. Similarly to access the impact on supply chain performance, carefully measure different SFs of SCF on cost performance, logistics performance and customer satisfaction performance.

Scilab version 6.1 was used for simulation. Based on the results of the simulation, the optimal mode of the automation system function of the heat exchanger primary circuit was developed and implemented. Reagentless treatment of geothermal water in the heat supply system with an acoustic–magnetic device (designed and patented by the authors of this paper) can significantly reduce the intensity of scale formation in the heat exchanger and geothermal heat supply system equipment. It provides conditions for the automation of geothermal heat supply systems of greenhouses with a surface heat exchanger. Using an automation system allows greater accuracy and reliability in maintaining the required temperature regime (18–20 °C) in the greenhouse, reduces the frequency of system shutdown for unplanned cleaning of the heat exchanger and equipment, reduces the complexity of manual operations of heat exchanger and equipment maintenance (removal of sludge, scale) and reduces the economic costs of transportation and heat consumption.</jats:p>"

The module is intended to perform the energy function of a mobile robot (MR), namely, to provide power to all electronic and mechatronic units of mobile robots with modular architecture. In contrast to the power supply unit for robots with mono-block architecture, in this case, the module power supply node must be made in the form of a full-featured module, i.e. meet a number of special requirements: 1 - structurally it must be made as a separate module, easily included in the design of the modular robot and possess the ability to quickly build up its power; 2 - the control system must monitor the state of the battery and power consumption of each of the MR’s modules, to manage the process of switching them off / on; 3 - to have an information communication channel with all MR’s modules for dynamic control of the power supply to each of the modules, including the supervisor module for subsequent transfer power status parameters to the operator of the MR by the radio channel. As a part of the solution of the problem the concept of sub-module principle of organizing the structure of the power supply module of modular mobile robot was developed, battery power submodule and submodule decoder based on PLC modem using DC-PLC technology (Direct Current Power Line Communication), which provides the formation of an intermodular information communication channel over the power supply lines, were designed and manufactured.</jats:p>",

In addition, this study also tests the mediation role of SCP in analyzing the relationship between GHRM and BP and the mediation role of SCP in analyzing the relationship between SCOL and BP.Design/methodology: This study uses survey method. The survey is distributed to owners/managers of courier service SMEs in two provinces (Special Region of Yogyakarta and East Java) in Indonesia. The sampling technique is conducted purposively with 165 respondents. The data analysis technique uses AMOS 23. Findings: SCOL has a positive effect on SCP and BP and mediates the effect of SCP on BP. The most interesting about the findings is GHRM has no effect on SCP and BP and SCP does not mediate GHRM on BP.Research limitations/implications: Researcher use purposive sampling which has limitation of not being able to generalize the population in two provinces, namely Special Region of Yogyakarta and East Java. This is also not ideal approach to evaluate the impact of GHRM on SCP and BP and the impact of SCOL on SCP and BP. Courier service SMEs in this study have not implemented GHRM in ideal manner so they are unable to conclude the results in a comprehensive and transparent manner.Managerial Implication: Companies need to consider aspects related to the courier service industry, namely digitalization of information and green innovation so their contribution can be seen in improving whole business performance. In addition, it is necessary to divide SMEs that have practiced GHRM and those that are not so they can make strategies and policies related to GHRM, SCP, BP and SCOL. It is also necessary to examine other aspects in improving the business sustainability of courier services, namely the complexity and service strategy orientation. SMEs who have more SCOL strategy will better implement GHRM practices associated with SCP and BP. This is important since competition in the courier service industry is getting tougher especially when faced with foreign competitors who already have global service standards.Theory Implication: This study contributes the theory enrichment of SCOL aspect in mediating the relationship pattern between SCP and BP. This study also provides theoretical contributions namely GHRM has no effect on SCP and BP and SCP does not mediate GHRM on BP.Originality/value: Study which examines the role of SCOL, especially when it is related to GHRM, SCP and BP is still limited in Asia. SME owners in the courier service industry rarely have good data integration in the system. The implementation of SC is starting from upstream to downstream processes so that SMEs need a well-planned and integrated SCOL in each work unit which ultimately have an impact on SCP and BP. </jats:p>"

Using a combination of census and satellite data, we estimate housing supply for more than 90 metropolitan areas in Brazil. We find that widespread informal housing increases the housing supply elasticity, partially offsetting the downward pressure of geographical constraints.  Our empirical approach is guided by a monocentric city model that includes informal housing.  Our identification strategy relies on the use of two novel instruments, combining demographic data and public land ownership.  We use the supply elasticity estimates to forecast the response of future housing prices to natural population growth.</p>"

Since this is an important research issue, as part of this study, investigation of water supply system failure seasonality by the selected statistical approaches was presented. The basis of the research was monthly number of the pipelines' failures from the multi-year period of 2007–2017 of the municipal water network located in southern Poland. Mann–Kendall test results proved decreasing seasonal trend of the failure rate indexes λ. In turn, the results of the Colwell indexes' calculations allowed it to be stated that seasonal course of the water pipelines' failure events can be relatively easy to predict. As it turned out, it is difficult to determine unambiguously the impact of a given period of the year on the water pipeline failure events' occurrence. However, greater failure-free operation of the water pipelines may be expected in spring and summer months than in autumn and winter months. Because using Colwell indexes for seasonality analysis has no limitations compared to other methods, Colwell indexes may be considered as reliable tools for the assessment of the seasonal course of the water pipelines' failure events.</jats:p>",

Even more radically, this, too, applies to «well behaved» supply and demand curves as well.\nKey words: Backward Bending Supply Curves, Price Controls, Praxeology, Giffen Goods, Logical Positivism.\nJEL Classification: D0.\nResumen: ¿Cuál es el status del análisis sobre los efectos de las leyes de salario mínimo? ¿Empírico o praxeológico? Nosotros defendemos lo se gundo. ¿Pueden analizarse mejor los efectos de dichas leyes suponiendo curvas de oferta y demanda anómalas (como las de los bienes Giffen)? Como en el  nálisis tradicional se produce una mala asignación de recursos. En todo caso, tanto tales curvas, como las tradicionales son muy problemáticas.\nPalabras clave: Control de precios, praxeología, bienes de Giffen, positivismo lógico.\nClasificación JEL: D0.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The availability of magma is a key to understand mid-ocean ridge tectonics, and specifically the distribution of the two contrasted spreading modes displayed at slow and ultraslow ridges (volcanically-dominated, and detachment fault-dominated). The part of the plate divergence that is not accommodated by magma emplaced as gabbros or basaltic dikes is taken up by normal faults that exhume upper mantle rocks, in many instances all the way to the seafloor.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Magma is, however, more than just a material that is, or is not, available to fill the gap between two diverging plates. It is the principal carrier of heat into the axial region and as such it may contribute to thin the axial lithosphere, hence diminishing the volume of new plate material formed at each increment of plate separation. Magma as a heat carrier may also, however, if emplaced in the more permeable upper lithosphere, attract and fuel vigorous hydrothermal circulation and contribute instead to overcooling the newly formed upper plate (Cochran and Buck, JGR 2001).&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Magma is also a powerful agent for strain localization in the axial region: magma and melt-crystal mushes are weak; gabbros that crystallize from these melts are weaker than peridotites because they contain abundant plagioclase; and hydrothermally-altered gabbros, and gabbro-peridotite mixtures, are weaker than serpentinites because of minerals such as chlorite and talc. As a result, detachment-dominated ridge regions that receive very little magma probably have a stronger axial lithosphere than detachment-dominated ridge regions that receive a little more magma.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because magma has this triple role (building material, heat carrier, and strain localization agent), and because it is highly mobile (through porosity, along permeability barriers, in fractures and dikes), it is likely that variations in magma supply to the ridge, in time and space, and variations in where this magma gets emplaced in the axial plate, cause a greater diversity of spreading modes, and of the resulting slow and ultraslow lithosphere composition and structure, than suggested by the first order dichotomy between volcanically-dominated and detachment-dominated spreading.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this talk I illustrate these points using results of recent studies at the Mid-Atlantic and Southwest Indian ridges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

However, it is not clearhow SCMPractices influence logistic performance in the agribusiness context. However,themechanism of SCMPs effects is not yet understood since extant literature hasproduced mixedresults. Hence, this study sought to test the impact ofmediation of the competitive advantage ofrelations between SCMP and ORGPERfrom the point of view of Kenya's dairy supply chain.The study examined fourestimates that were tested using partial minimum square structuralequationmodeling (PLS-SAME) techniques to work out the purpose of the study. Acrossdepartmental survey design has been used to collect preliminary data from109 dairy cooperativesin thirteen major dairy producing counties in Kenya. Theresults reveal that SCM practice has apositive and significant effect on CA(P=0.730) and ORGPER (P=0.237). In addition, THERE isa positive, statisticallysignificant effect on THECAORGPER (P=0.522). Further results showthat CAmediates the relationship between SCMP and ORGPER. Consequently, thestudyconcludes that SCMPs first generate CA, which in turn enhances ORGPER in a logisticsense.Theoretically, the study provides insights on the resource-based view theory aswell as aconceptual framework for its validation. Similarly, the study informsmanagers and policymakersin knowing specific SCMPs to focus on to enhance CAand ORGPER of the dairy cooperativesin Kenya.</p>"

By combining a vast database of ship tracking data with bilateral trade data and input-output tables, we highlight the critical role of specific ports in global supply chains and economies. For some countries, we find that 43.5% of economic activity is dependent on trade going through a single port. The top ten global ports influence 9.3% of the global economy, of which the port of Shanghai alone embeds 1.7% of global output. Ports are even more critical in some sectors, such as the mining and quarrying sector, for which 82% of trade is transported by maritime transport. We estimate how changes in final demand will be routed through ports, revealing that for every US$1000 increase in final demand a country’s ports experience a US$18.3 increase in imports on average, and up to US$108 increase in low income countries and small islands.</jats:p>"

The findings also show that when ED is high, the relationship between SCF and SCR is stronger and vice versa. Moreover, SCR mediates the relationship between SCF and OP. The hypothesis regarding the moderating effect of ED on the paths joining SCF and SCR was also supported. SCR has a significant negative effect on OP. However, the hypothesis regarding the effect of ED on SCR was not supported.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study has some limitations. First, this paper conducted the research with Chinese organizations. This may result in low generalizability in other contexts. In addition, this paper used the survey method and cross-sectional data design in this study, which may generate the potential issue of common method bias. However, the findings of this study will help organizations across China and other emerging economies to adopt SCF as a secure financing mechanism to enhance working capital and mitigate risk. In addition, the paper provides some new managerial insights for decision-makers in organizations, while exploring different factors such as SCF, SCR and ED and their effect on the organization.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study has greatly developed a general SCF adoption model that helps to guide empirical research investigating the critical impact of SCF on firm performance.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

The logging data were collected from 2000 to 2009. Sampled forest compartments were clustered into two groups based on the stand position to the levee (exposed to inundation of Danube or not). The effects of the Danube are evaluated using local hydrological measurements (e.g. gauge at Moh&amp;amp;#225;cs).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The forest growth itself is not the best indicator because it is also influenced by several other ecological variables. To control better these variables two forest stands were selected aged about 110 years. One of them is located behind a summer levee (low crown height levee), which is inundated only by the high floods. Another forest compartment is outside the main levee and never inundated. These stands are sampled to prepare dendrochronological analysis, which gives us higher time-resolution data. We hope these analyses will help us to interpret the relationship between forest growth and water&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;conditions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research has been supported by the Ministry of Agriculture in Hungary.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>This paper examines General Electric's new combined-cycle gas turbine GT11N2 M upgrade. The new technology provides operational flexibility and promises output and cost efficiencies. To investigate the benefis of this technology, we propose a power supply chain model and construct cost functions for generation and service and maintenance using actual market and firm level data. The upstream firm is General Electric (GE) who invests in GT11N2 generators. The investment results in innovation of GT11N2 M upgrade facilitating different operational modes and efficiencies. The downstream firm is TransAlta's Sarnia plant which utilizes this new technology to produce and sell electricity to residential, small business, industrial, and wholesale market customers in Ontario, Canada. We quantify equilibrium prices and outputs under various efficiency rates in costs of fuel, service, and maintenance. We find a large variation in electricity generation depending on which operational mode (\"Maximum Continuous Load\" or \"Performance\" or \"Lifetime\") of GT11N2 M is selected. Under a mixed usage of all modes, we expect 44% output expansion to the industrial customers and 0.2% sales increase in the Ontario wholesale electricity market. Under this mode, GE's price should go down by 0.4% due to fuel cost efficiency. If GE's cost was $2.8 per MWh, GE should have asked Trans-Alta an average price of $5.822 per MWh for service and maintenance prior to the new technology. With the new technology, GE should charge $5.502 per MWh to Trans Alta. While GE's sales to wholesale market are almost stable, the sales to industrial customers increase nonlinearly in downstream efficiency rates. This shows that the amount of greenhouse gas emissions will be largely impacted by the choice of operational mode and how long it is used.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle and catchment processes has been extensively studied. In Wales, such changes are projected to have a substantial impact on hydrological regimes. However, the impact on the water abstraction capability of key sectors in the country, such as hydropower (HP) and public water supply (PWS), is not yet fully understood. We use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to generate future (2021-2054) daily streamflows under a worst-case scenario of greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) at two large catchments in Wales, the Conwy and Tywi. SWAT streamflow output is used to estimate the abstractable water resources, and therefore changes in the average generation characteristics for 25 run-of-river HP schemes across Conwy and Tywi and the total unmet demand for a single large PWS abstraction in the Tywi. This unmet PWS demand is assessed using the Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) system under increasing, static, and declining demand scenarios. Mann-Kendall trend analysis is performed to detect and characterise the trends for both sectors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Results show greater seasonality in abstraction potential through the study period, with an overall decrease in annual abstraction volume due to summer and autumn streamflow declines outweighing increases seen in winter and spring. For HP, these trends result in a projected decline in annual power generation potential, despite an increasing number of days per year that maximum permitted abstraction is reached. For PWS, under all future demand scenarios, annually there is an increase in the number of days where demand is not met as well as the total shortfall volume of water. Our results suggest that currently installed HP schemes may not make optimal use of future flows, and that the planning of future schemes should take account of these to ensure the most efficient operation is achieved. Moreover, PWS supply sustainability is under threat and will require management and mitigation measures to be implemented to ensure future supplies. Overall, our study provides a novel perspective on the future water resource availability in Wales, giving context to management planning to ensure future HP generation efficiency and PWS sustainability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

En este contexto, la pregunta de investigación fue ¿De qué manera se puede integrar el BSC y el SCOR con la finalidad de establecer relaciones y grados de incidencia entre indicadores que permitan evaluar el desempeño de la cadena de suministro? Para responder dicha pregunta, se planteó como objetivo diseñar una propuesta de integración entre el BSC y SCOR con la finalidad de diseñar una propuesta de modelo de integración entre el BSC y SCOR con la finalidad de integrar la evaluación del desempeño de la cadena de suministro. La estrategia metodológica adoptada se sustentó en la investigación documental y en el método comparado que, en este caso, tuvo como unidades de análisis las estrategias para la evaluación del desempeño mediado por indicadores logísticos. La articulación teórico-metodológica seleccionada permitió concretar la interrelación de las cuatro perspectivas del BSC y de los cinco procesos primario de gestión del SCOR misma que se mediatizó en un modelo de integración que puede coadyuvar a optimizar el rendimiento de la cadena de suministro. Finalmente, como conclusiones se establece la viabilidad del modelo aquí propuesto para la evaluación del desempeño de la cadena de suministro de manera tanto horizontal como vertical para su implementación y valoración empírica.</jats:p>"

This epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling the COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. The results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.</jats:p>"

Inspired by the practice of Chinese household appliance firms sustainably entering the rural market from the urban market, Tesla and Topshop entered the Chinese market from their own. We model a supply chain system composed of a manufacturer and a retailer to investigate entry strategies for facing a new market. These sustainable entry processes can help enterprises better achieve their own promotion and increase profits. The equilibrium solutions indicate that (1) the manufacturer’s exclusive entry mode is “market development” entry, while the retailer’s exclusive entry or joint entry mode can achieve “dual benefit” entry under certain conditions; and (2) both the manufacturer and the retailer prefer the joint entry mode. It is the only Nash equilibrium. Monopoly firms dominating the new market may not be profitable all the time. Appropriate competition can bring about a win-win situation. These results provide theoretical proof for the preference and rationality of the rural market entry mode in the Chinese household appliance industry and of the overseas market entry mode for international enterprises.</jats:p>"

The references describe in detail the general principles of DIES, examine the energy and thermodynamic aspects and the main mechanisms of intensification that can be initiated on the basis of this principle. DIES mechanisms conveniently can be divided into hard and soft ones. The former should be used to stimulate hydromechanical processes, and the latter to accelerate the processes of phase heat and mass transfer, or for the purpose of intensive mixing of multicomponent media. The authors have studied the possibility of using DIES to intensify the hydromechanical processes, in particular emulsification of milk fat (homogenization of milk, preparation of spreads), processing of cream cheese masses. Objects of research were whole non-homogenized milk, fat emulsions, cream cheese mass. In order to evaluate the efficiency of milk homogenization the homogenization coefficient change was studied, which was determined by centrifugation method as the most affordable and accurate one. Emulsions were evaluated according to the degree of destabilization, resistance and dispersion of the fat phase. The rheological characteristics of cheese masses were evaluated by the effective viscosity change.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>With the recent emphasis on supply risk management in sustainable supply chains (SSCs), the evaluation and selection of appropriate suppliers are more important than ever. However, most existing research does not take all three sustainability perspectives of supply risk into account simultaneously and they rarely consider the correlation among supply risk factors in risk assessment. Therefore, considering the uncertain information decision-making environment, this research paper proposes a risk-based integrated group decision-making model for sustainable supplier selection (SSS). First, the weights of decision-makers (DMs) are taken as linguistic terms denoted by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs). Second, after obtaining the aggregated intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making matrix considering the expert weights, this study uses the entropy weight method to calculate the criteria weights objectively. Then, the improved failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is adopted for the risk assessment to exclude high-risk suppliers. Finally, the extended alternative queuing method (AQM) is applied to rank the qualified suppliers in SSCs. This model can not only enable enterprises to reduce supply risk in SSS practices and identify and prevent the failure modes that lead to supply risk, but also reduce the uncertainty of decision-making, in order to make supplier selection more accurate. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model are illustrated through application in a leading Chinese electrical appliance manufacturing company.</jats:p>"

The hup/Lc is the main parameter affecting the Cd. The value hup/Lc equal to 0.6 is a good criterion for designing the crest of the FCSS. At this point, the Cd of FCSS is about 1.0. The performance of FCSS regarding the EDR changes between 95 and 40 percent. By increasing the discharge of flow and skimming flow formation, the performance of the FCSS related to energy dissipation is dramatically decreased.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Supraglacial debris extent and thickness is an important control on the ablation rate of a debris-covered glacier. Debris is supplied to the surface of a debris-covered glacier through several pathways with the primary source of this debris originating from rockfall in both the accumulation area, where debris is transported englacially downglacier, and the upper ablation area, where debris remains in the supraglacial environment while transported downglacier. Current quantification of debris supply to debris-covered glaciers is limited to headwall erosion rates determined through the dating of headwall derived supraglacial debris using &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;10&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;Be concentrations, or estimations of these rates using a ratio of supraglacial debris flux to the headwall catchment area. To increase the knowledge of the contemporary short-term estimations of these processes, repeat LiDAR scans of debris-contributing slopes were acquired during a single ablation season in both July and September at Miage Glacier, Italy. An area of ~7.7 km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; comprising &amp;gt; 1.8 billion 3D points was scanned per survey epoch, covering ~33% of the glacierised area of Miage Glacier. Sequential scans were co-registered using an iterative closest point adjustment algorithm within CloudCompare. Manual filtering was used to remove snow, artefacts, and the glacier surface from the raw point clouds. To ease processing, the rock walls were segmented both horizontally and vertically within the catchment. Change detection was carried out using the M3C2 algorithm at a projection scale of 0.3 m and point clouds representing areas of significant change within the segment were obtained using a distributed 95&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;th&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; percentile confidence interval. The DBSCAN clustering algorithm was used to identify individual rockfall clusters, and the volume of each rockfall was calculated using both an iterative alpha-shapes approach. Finally, a bounding box approach was used to estimate the a, b and c axes and therefore shape of the individual rockfalls. Increasing the projection scale used within the M3C2 algorithm decreases the frequency of significant rockfalls found exponentially, and an iterative alpha shapes approach is the most computationally efficient volume estimation method. Our results show that the Miage Glacier catchment is dominated by small scale rockfall events, although at least one large-scale rockfall event is evident in the upper ablation area (validated by time-lapse imagery). This failure on a recently deglaciated area of rock wall highlights that slope response to glacial erosion can be rapid following periods of deglaciation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Because of the confidential nature of engaging with organisations, most of the examples given are well known and in the public domain, but the general trends and information reflected in the paper are based on the author’s experience of the status of decision making in organisations. The observation made is that despite the advancement of technologies in the personal environment, in larger organisations, decision making is disconnected, less collaborative, slow and inefficient, with hours spent gathering data as opposed to using the time to analyse it. In the current environment of economic and operational turbulence, the author would like to raise awareness of a better, faster, more accurate way of making decisions by challenging the current organisational decision-making processes and technologies used.</jats:p>"

Mutation supply determines\nkey features of population genetics, such as the pool of adaptive\nmutations, evolutionary pathways available, and importance of processes\nsuch as clonal interference. The resultant trait evolutionary dynamics,\nin turn, can alter population size and species interactions. However,\ncontrolled experiments testing for the importance of mutation supply on\nrapid adaptation and thereby population and community dynamics are\nlacking. To close this knowledge gap, we performed a serial passage\nexperiment with wild-type Pseudomonas fluorescens and an isogenic xerD\nmutant with reduced mutation rate. Bacteria were grown at two resource\nlevels in combination with the presence of a ciliate predator. We found\nthat a higher mutation supply enabled faster adaptation to the\nlow-resource environment and anti-predatory defense. This was associated\nwith higher population size at the ecological level and better access to\nhigh-recurrence mutational targets at the genomic level for the strain\nwith higher mutation supply. In contrast, mutation rate did not affect\ngrowth under high-resource level, possibly because of more permissive\nconditions or high population size saturated in mutations. Our results\ndemonstrate that intrinsic mutation rate influences population dynamics\nand trait evolution particularly when population size is constrained by\nextrinsic conditions.</jats:p>"

It then considers the pandemic’s implications for the multilateral trade system and its impact on Asian economic integration and regionalism. The pandemic has motivated attempts to increase robustness of supply chains through diversification away from excessive dependence on China and into Southeast and South Asia, in an incremental rather than revolutionary way; no wholesale departure from manufacturing in China is anticipated. For most countries, the most efficient response is to continue to rely on international trade and global production networks, while addressing the strategic concerns through improved emergency-preparedness stockpiles. The increased pressure for reshoring, however, is part of a larger disaffection with globalization and the erosion of the rules-based international trade system.</jats:p>",

COVID-19 has made running out of those supplies a real possibility. Business as usual is not an option; pivoting is strategic and crucial. Banner Health Supply Chain’s collaboration and education throughout the organisation on supply chain services and cost, quality and outcomes as core competencies enabled rapid mobilisation and permanent strategic pivots in response to COVID-19. It collaboratively teamed with clinical practice to assess the situation and implement solutions in an environment that presented numerous barriers. Managing disruption and understanding the changing supply chain, while not new practices, calls for faster turnaround, flexibility and resilience. Continued work to digitally enable the supply chain allowing for more visibility will support these efforts. This paper provides an overview of supply chain services at Banner Health and the team’s strategic responses to COVID-19. It also looks ahead to a future supply chain post COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this paper’s novelty identifies and defines the priorities of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable development dimensions in supply-chain- and logistics-management-related studies in the last decade. Knowing logistics and supply chain sustainability focus and orientation is valuable information for researchers and managers to adapt and mitigate their business logistics according to the forecasted trends. The paper provides a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature and is based on 116 scientific papers published between 2010 and 2020 in 73 international journals in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The study defines focus with integrating environmental, social, and economic sustainability for logistics- and supply-chain-related studies. It emphasizes primary and secondary links of investigated studies with 17 United Nations sustainable development goals. The bibliometric analysis also examined keyword relations. One of the main contributions is that economic sustainability was identified as the most represented one-dimensional sustainability focus. It was revealed that supply chain studies integrated all three sustainability dimensions more frequently (50.60%) than logistics studies, which were equally related to studying two- or three-dimensions of sustainability (39.39%). The most significant findings are also that studies were identified to be oriented primarily towards “responsible consumption and production”, “industry, innovation, and infrastructure” and “affordable and clean energy” and secondary especially on “sustainable cities and communities”.</jats:p>"

About 121 honey producers (110 male &amp; 11 female) were selected randomly from a list of 536 honey producers found in 5 purposively selected ‘kebeles’. The data were generated by individual interview and group discussions using pre-tested semi structured questionnaires and checklists. Secondary data were collected from different published and unpublished sources. The data collected were analyzed with the help of descriptive statistics and econometric model (multiple linear regression model). The results obtained from econometric analysis indicates that colony size, type of beehives used, beekeeping equipment, market information, current honey price, frequency of extension contact per year and trainings were positively and significantly affected honey supply. Of course, some opportunities have also been indicated like availability of bee colony, favorable environment, and annual flora and farmers’ experiences. To boost the economy of beekeeping and honey marketing which in turn increase producers income from honey supply, all concerned bodies need to focus on building farmers capacity via training on improving honey production and supply, increasing access to improved beehives and its accessories, availing extension facilities, improving road facility, organizing honey producers to increase the volume, access to marketing and price setting, and establishing honey market center are recommended for policy intervention. </jats:italic></jats:p>"

Circularity refers to identifying, tracking and transforming materials and resources for repeated use. This approach forms the basis of a global economy that decouples economic growth from required virgin resources. The three principles of the circular economy are: 1) design waste out; 2) keep resources and materials in use; and 3) regenerate natural systems. Analyst firms predict in as little as five years global supply chains will be required to embrace circular operations, due to depleting natural resources. Partners across supply networks will come together to solve for circularity and introduce new practices and new measures of success. Seven concepts for partnership in circular supply chains are explored: identify circles, intensify circles, narrow circles, predict circles, slow circles, close circles and capture circles. The role of partnership and measures of success are proposed for each. This paper focuses on circularity in partnerships that stretch across these three scenarios. It explores seven concepts for circular supply chains and the role partnerships will play.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compressed air energy storage (CAES) in porous formations is one option to compensate the expected fluctuations in energy supply in future energy systems with a 100% share of renewable energy sources. Mechanical energy is stored as pressurized air in a subsurface porous formation using off-peak power, and released during peak demand using a turbine for power generation. Depending on share and type of renewable energy sources in the future, different storage capacities and storage power rates will have to be satisfied to compensate fluctuating nature of the renewable power supply. Therefore, this study investigates scenarios for subsurface compressed air energy storage using four potential future energy system development pathways. Because for CAES subsurface processes and power generation are strongly linked via reservoir pressure and flow rates, coupled power plant and geostorage model has to be developed and employed to evaluate potential operation conditions for such a storage technique.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this study, a diabatic CAES is designed, with a three-stage compression and a two-stage expansion with heat recuperator in the power plant and a porous formation as a storage formation with 20 m thickness in an anticline trap structure at a depth between 700 and 1500 m. A withdrawal rate of 115 MW and a total stored energy of up to 348 GWh per year are derived from the future energy system scenarios. Scenario simulations are carried out by coupling the open-source thermal engineering TESPy code and the multiphase-multicomponent ECLIPSE flow simulator using highly fluctuating load profiles with a time resolution of one hour. In addition to the diabatic CAES, two adiabatic concepts are considered for the same geostorage configuration.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Results show that nine vertical storage wells are sufficient to deliver the target air mass flow rates required by the power plant during 98% of the year. Flow rate limitation occurs due to bottom hole pressure limits either during the injection or the withdrawal phases, depending on the specific load profile of the future energy systems, as well as the prior operation conditions. Thus, our scenario simulation shows that one porous media CAES site can cover all expected load profiles and balance the expected offsets between energy demand and energy supply up to the GWh scale. Balancing of the energy system at the national level can be achieved by up-scaling of the results obtained in this study.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Although government authorities sought to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by restricting travel and in-person activities, failure to deploy time-sensitive strategies in ramping-up of critical resource production exacerbated the outbreak. Here, we analyze the interactive effects of supply chain disruption and infectious disease dynamics using coupled production and disease networks built on global data. We find that time-sensitive containment strategies could be created to balance objectives in pandemic control and economic losses, leading to a spatiotemporal separation of infection peaks that alleviate the societal impact of the disease. A lean resource allocation strategy is discovered that effectively counteracts the positive feedback between transmission and production such that stockpiles of health care resources may be manufactured and distributed to limit future shortage and disease. The study highlights the importance of cross-sectoral coordination and region-wise collaboration to optimally contain a pandemic while accounting for production.</jats:p>"

Blockchain technology has evolved from merely being a decentralized, distributed and immutable ledger of cryptocurrency transactions to a programmable interactive environment for building decentralized and reliable applications addressing different use-cases and existing problems in the world. In this research, with a chosen research method of proof-by-demonstration, the Decentralized NFC-Enabled Anti-Counterfeiting System (dNAS) is proposed and developed, decentralizing a legacy anti-counterfeiting system of the supply-chain industry using Blockchain technology to facilitate trustworthy data provenance retrieval, verification and management, as well as strengthening the capability of the product’s anti-counterfeiting and traceability qualities in the wine industry, with the capacity to further extend this to the supply chain industry as a whole. The proposed dNAS utilizes a decentralized blockchain network with a consensus protocol compatible with the concept of enterprise blockchain, programmable smart contracts and a distributed file storage system to develop a secure and immutable scientific-data provenance tracking and management platform on which provenance records, providing compelling properties of the data integrity of luxurious goods, are recorded, verified and validated automatically.</jats:p>"

Circular economy, the need for optimized material flows, ad-hoc responses and personalization are some of the trends that require supply chains to become “cognitive”, i.e. able to predict trends and flexible enough in dynamic environments, ensuring optimized operational performance. Digital Twins (DTs) is a promising technology, and a lot of work is done on the factory level. In this paper, the concept of Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) and how they can be deployed in connected and agile supply chains is elaborated. The need for CDTs in the supply chain as well as the main CDT enablers and how they can be deployed under an operational model in agile networks is described. Emphasis is given on the modelling, cognition and governance aspects as well as on how a supply chain can be configured as a network of connected CDTs. Finally, a deployment methodology of the developed model into an example of a circular supply chain is proposed.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study is to present a prediction method based on multivariate statistical models calibrated from an original data set covering nearly 130 torrential basins in the Northern French Alps. Data on sediment yield and occurrence of torrential events were collected on these catchments thanks to registries from sediment retention basins (average monitoring period of 20 years) and historical archives of the catchment basin managers. On these catchments, several morphological and hydro-meteorological characteristics were calculated (e.g. geological and sediment connectivity indices, the rate of connected eroding areas in the catchment, the Melton index, the slope of the fan, etc.) in order to relate them to sediment production and the frequency of occurrence of torrential events. These models allow the estimation of quantiles of the sediment yield in small torrent catchments. These models could be useful to evaluate sediment yield and the occurrence of torrential events on catchment not equipped with sedimentation structures.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Therefore, knowledge management is one of the most influential and essential factors in comprehensive development and gaining a more significant market share. This study's primary purpose was to investigate the relationship between critical aspects of knowledge management on Kale Amol Dairy Products Company's supply chain productivity. Five main factors of organizational strategy, organizational structure, knowledge team, knowledge map, and knowledge audit were used as independent variables to achieve this goal. The research method was a correlation, and data collection tools were library and internet resources. The statistical population consisted of high and middle-class managers and staff members involved in knowledge management and supply chain in Amol Calais Dairy Products Company, of which 58 were. Chang china et al. standard questionnaire was used to measure the variables, and SPSS software was used to analyze the statistical data. Descriptive statistics were used for the frequency of data. The Pearson correlation test was used to determine the relationship between variables, and the Friedman test was used to prioritize the variables. After data analysis, it was found that there is a relationship between all independent variables and supply chain productivity.

Theoretically voters exhibiting a higher degree of populist attitudes and beliefs are expected to be more prone to support parties classified as populist. However, this hypothesis has not been systematically tested in the literature. Our analysis based on the Comparative Studies of Electoral Systems (CSES Module 5) dataset, suggests that this expected congruence between ‘populist’ attitudes and likelihood of voting for ‘populist parties’ is only partial. We identify three main potential causes of such mismatch which should be taken into consideration when developing future tools to capture populism: (i) problems with the choice and design of attitudinal items; (ii) problems in the assessment of parties; (iii) instrument biases which make them more effective with some particular varieties of populism.</p>"

A multi-period buyback contract between a supplier and a retailer under the demand uncertainty is considered. Under the contract, an advance order is submitted to the supplier in advance when the demand is unknown, and an additional order can be made at the beginning of each period after the previous period demand is realized. The impact of the coordination on the supply chain’s expected total profit is also considered. The results show that the additional order does not always increases the supply chain profit. The additional order increases the supply chain profit only when both the retailer and supplier are coordinated. Under the decentralized system with the buyback contract, the retailer tends to order less in an advance order to reduce the risk. This leads to the higher cost due the additional order after the demand is realized. As a result, it is lowers the supply chain profit. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis is performed using numerical studies in order to observe the behavior of the expected total profit of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Due to the expanded scope in the supply chain, designing CLSCN often faces significant uncertainties. This paper proposes a fuzzy multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to deal with uncertain parameters in CLSCN. The two objective functions are minimization of overall system costs and minimization of negative environmental impact. Negative environmental impacts are measured and quantified through CO2 equivalent emission. Uncertainties include demand, return, scrap rate, manufacturing cost and negative environmental factors. The original formulation with uncertain parameters is firstly converted into a crisp model and then an aggregation function is applied to combine the objective functions. Numerical experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model formulation and solution approach. Sensitivity analyses on degree of feasibility, the weighing of objective functions and coefficient of compensation have been conducted. This model can be applied to a variety of real-world situations, such as in the manufacturing production processes.</jats:p>"

Its ultimate goal is to increase the viability of many critical metals hosted in small primary deposits, particularly in Europe, by developing a modularized mobile plant (MMP) concept that can economically operate different type of ores in different types of geological and geographical contexts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition, the project addresses the prospect of applying the SO-SO concept and the small-scale mining paradigm with regard to the reprocessing of mineral wastes in Europe. A dataset of legacy deposits of interest for the SO-SO concept was drawn from the ProMine Anthropogenic Concentration (AC) database (built during the European FP7 ProMine project) used as the data source and by applying a sequential-rating as a methodology to rank records and to highlight potential targets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apart from national mining wastes registries, the ProMine AC database remains so far the most exhaustive and reliable attempt at a consolidated pan-European database regarding mining wastes. Despite data shortcoming in the ProMine AC database, this study proposes potential targets of mineral wastes for the SO-SO concept in Europe and provides with preliminary information on location, type of waste, commodities content, tonnage and their potential.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To put into perspective the application of the SO-SO concept and the small-scale mining paradigm in regards with mineral wastes reprocessing, this study also proposes generic flowsheets to address specific potential targets identified among the records from the ProMine AC database and based on the preliminary information available. However, the relevancy and completeness of these information still require a case-by-case assessment. As a result, this methodology falls into a scoping approach that could be applied ahead of (pre)feasibility studies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Combining the re-exploitation of a primary ore deposit along with the reprocessing of its wastes inherited from previous mining and ore processing activities is of great interest in seeking social acceptance. Eventually, in such perspective, a cross survey of the potential of both primary deposits, using the ProMine Mineral Deposits (MD) database, and secondary deposits, using the ProMine AC database, therefore appears as a relevant scoping strategy ahead of implementing small-scale mining.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The supply chain is considered from agriculture to retail. The main result of this work is a specification framework, which consist of a supply chain process model describing activities relevant for food traceability, a collection of usage requirements formulated as data classes, a summary of technical requirements regarding data access, storage and processing, and interoperability requirements necessary to assure digital communication and permanent operability of the BBTS. Based on this, general application guidelines for digital information systems are derived and the blockchain technology is evaluated with regard to its potential in meeting requirements and challenges. A distinction between public and sensitive data appears to be necessary to assure traceability and trust in the supply chain. A two-part architecture involving a public permissioned blockchain network is proposed as the most promising basis for a digital traceability system in the food industry.</p>"

Previously, in many articles, discrete demand is considered. In this model, we consider a newsvendor selling a single seasonal item with price-dependent stochastic demand. Competition in markets has forced the retailer and manufacturer to coordinate in decentralized supply chain management. A coordination contract is made between a retailer and manufacturer to overcome the randomness of demand for a short-life-cycle product. The retailer pays an additional amount per product to transfer the risk of unsold items. The manufacturer bears the cost of unsold products from the retailer. Shortages are allowed with back-ordering costs during the season. The distribution-free model is developed and solved with only available demand data of mean and standard deviation. Stackelberg’s game approach is used to calculate the optimal ordering quality and price. This model aims to maximize expected profit by optimizing unit selling price and ordered quantity through coordination. To illustrate that the model is robust, numerical experiment and sensitivity analyses are conducted for both decentralized and centralized supply chain management. For applicability of the model in the real-world business scenario, managerial insights are provided with sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>"

This article only needs to introduce the financial risk analysis of the enterprise supply chain based on the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. This paper proposes a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, which uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods to assess financial risks, and designs a financial risk assessment system by constructing a fuzzy judgment matrix. It also proposes a comprehensive judgment of the financial risk assessment method. The impact of various risk factors on financial services provides a basis for risk prevention. The experimental results of this paper show that the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process evaluation method is relatively objective and can effectively evaluate the financial risks of the enterprise supply chain. From the weight analysis, it can be concluded that the technical risk weight value is 0.47, which accounts for the largest proportion and is the most important risk.</jats:p>",

In this research, we demonstrate that the annual water supply of the Colorado River in the United States is predictable up to several years in advance by a drift-free decadal climate prediction system using a fully coupled climate model. Observational analyses and model experiments show that prolonged shortages of water supply in the Colorado River are significantly linked to sea surface temperature precursors, including tropical Pacific cooling, North Pacific warming, and southern tropical Atlantic warming. In the Colorado River basin, the water deficits can reduce crop yield and increase wildfire potential. Thus, a multi-year prediction of severe water shortages in the Colorado River basin could be useful as an early indicator of subsequent agricultural loss and wildfire risk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Research findings show that circular production systems, engaging with stakeholders, and a comprehensible supply chain are strategic for sustainability. There has been some progress towards resolving the issues of worker exploitation but several problems remain when it comes to confronting demand from consumers for fast fashion.

An idealized numerical model was used to explore the long-term morphodynamics of a large estuary subject to these changes. In the model, a funnel-shaped channel with fixed banks, constant riverine water and sediment fluxes, a single grain size and a semi-diurnal tide were used. A range of values of changes in the sediment supply (50-90% reduction) and sea level (1-5~mm/yr increase) were considered. Starting from an equilibrium state for an initial sediment supply, the estuary shifts to a new equilibrium for the considered changes on a timescale of millennia. Half of the bed level change occurs within several hundreds of years. A larger decrease in the sediment supply leads to a stronger bed erosion, while the corresponding adjustment time has minor changes in its range for the considered settings. When combined with sea level rise, the erosion is weakened and the adjustment time is shortened. The equilibrium state under sea level rise is characterized by a bed level keeping pace with the sea level and a significant amount of sediment being trapped in the estuary. Additional numerical experiments that use more realistic geometry and forcing of the Yangtze Estuary show that overall erosion of the estuary is expected for centuries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The study area is Bogura, a northern region of Bangladesh, located on the Pleistocene terrace of the Bengal Basin. The aquifer consists of medium-to-coarse sand, located at a depth of 4.66–42.68 m; groundwater is scarce during dry seasons. The water table (WT) time-series data for 2007–2019 were used for forecasting and characterizing present and future groundwater conditions using existing numerical simulations. The annual groundwater budget for discharge and storage was 2,772 and 2,442 Mm3, respectively. Thus, the annual scarcity of groundwater was 330.4 Mm3 (13.5%), excluding the surface water contribution of 10 Mm3 (0.4%). The present spacing of deep tube wells (DTWs) and shallow tube wells (STWs) was 744 and 372 m, respectively. Currently, the DTW spacing ranged 744–800 m; however, the STW spacing of 250–372 m is higher than the set distance. Hence, further installations of STWs were strictly disallowed for irrigation. WT declined by 1.0 m in the last 13 years, i.e., 0.07 m or 1.2% decline rate per annum, causing water scarcity in the region during the peak period in the dry season (June–February), thus affecting irrigation and limiting agricultural production.</jats:p>",

The methodological approach used was to conduct online searches using the databases of Google Scholar, Web of Science, Pub Med, the International Water Association, and ResearchGate. Several indices have been identified in the literature including the Canadian Water Sustainability Index, Index of Drinking Water Adequacy, the Sustainable Water Governance Index, equity index in water and sanitation, WASH performance Index, Sustainable Water Management Index, and Index of water service quality. However, these indices do not provide an integrative, contextualized and prospective analysis of the sustainability of water services. In addition, these indices select only a few evaluation criteria deemed relevant. In other words, these indices choose to make visible certain phenomena and therefore make others invisible, according to the logic of action of each and to certain social compromises. These difficulties therefore encourage the development of a new index to provide an integrative, contextualized and prospective analysis of the sustainability of rural water services.</jats:p>",

One of the consequences is that the operation of many small and medium enterprises (SMs) had become very difficult. Hence, many of SMEs in Taiwan have gone bankrupt and some of them have moved to other places where they have lower production costs, in order to survive; this not only hollowed out the industries but also disconnected the supply chains in their mother countries. Because Taiwan’s SMEs are generally poor in innovation, this study explored the implementation of the theory of inventive problem-solving (TRIZ) with alignment of new product development (NPD) and supply chain management (SCM) to strengthen the innovation and productivity of new products, so that SMEs can refer to its use to aid sustainable business operation. We considered an SME in Taiwan as a case to study and investigate the strategies that it employed to achieve survival and sustainability. By examining the practical applications of the NPD of the case company, which was based on the TRIZ and NPD SCM alignment, we found that value-added products may be created despite unfavorable industry environments, by implementing and coordinating the TRIZ and three product-related variables, namely innovating, modularity, and variety. This study explored practical alternatives for SMEs to develop various value-added products that meet customers’ changing requirements and succeed in competitive markets to achieve a sustainable business operation. Considering SMEs are crucially important to the economic equality and development of countries and that SMEs may only survive for a short time when operating in changing supply chain environments, this study can be used as a reference for the management of SMEs and future academic research in related fields.</jats:p>"

The most important environmental problems include threats related to the pollution of surface waters and groundwater as a result of processes related to the functioning of an urban catchment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The main aim of this work is to present the magnitude of pollution supply into the catchment and to determine the temporal variability of matter circulation in a small urban catchment in years with different pluvial conditions and therefore quantitatively changing atmospheric supply reaching the geoecosystem.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The magnitude of pollution supply to the catchment was determined on the basis of systematic, comprehensive measurements of the natural environment. The measurement system and the field research methodology refer to the methodological concept of the system functioning, as well as the assumptions of the European International Cooperative Programme on Integrated Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Ecosystems (ICP IM) and Integrated Monitoring of the Natural Environment in Poland (ZMSP) programs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This work presents the results of measurements of several components of the natural environment, initially including meteorological conditions (mainly precipitation and air temperature). The next elements of the research concerned air pollution with sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide as well as the chemical composition of precipitation, which is considered as an entry into the geoecosystem. Moreover, there are also presented the results of the physicochemical properties of surface waters (including levels, flows and chemical composition) and groundwater.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the atmospheric supply to the geoecosystem, the water cycle in the catchment and the water runoff confirm the assumptions that the dissolved matter circulation is one of the most important indicators of changes in the natural environment in the moderate morphoclimatic zone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

To this end, it is critical to develop new methodologies to trim away processes and activities that add no value and, thus, derive more sustainable supply chains. Considering the need to have a simple tool that can be used by managers to achieve this goal, in this work, we explore the value stream mapping method (VSM) and extend it to support the design of sustainable supply chains in a more systematic and quantitative way. This work proposes a new generic methodology, called SustainSC-VSM, which allows assessing the supply chain’s performance through a set of realistic indicators. These indicators are designed to identify bottlenecks that hinder sustainable operations development and provide guidelines to achieve that goal by following a lean-driven sustainability approach. SustainSC-VSM was tested and validated through its application to a relevant industrial case study, where operational bottlenecks were pinpointed and potential solutions were identified to seek continuous improvement. Although envisioned to be generic and applicable to all supply chains, the indicators should be selected according to the context in study (e.g., services). SustainSC-VSM aims at being a generic and systematic tool to design future value stream maps to achieve a more sustainable supply chain following a lean-driven sustainability approach, through the use of multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary indicators to identify and solve the supply chain’s bottlenecks.</jats:p>"

Aluminum, copper, silver, bauxite, iron, lead, and others all stand to potentially benefit from a strong shift to low carbon technologies. It would be reasonable to expect that all low carbon energy systems are more likely than not to be more metal intensive than high-carbon systems. All literature examining material and metals implications for supplying clean technologies agree that building these technologies will result in considerably more material-intensive demand than would traditional fossil fuel mechanisms. At present the minerals/materials considered &amp;amp;#8220;critical&amp;amp;#8221; (Critical Raw Materials &amp;amp;#8211; CRM) for EU economy are mainly constituted by rare earth metals, base and precious metals. The supply of CRM is highly connected to international politics and global market conditions; most of them are exploited in countries other than EU ones, causing high economic dependence from non-EU countries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RM and CRM are principally extracted from natural resources, urban and industrial landfill sites, and extractive waste facilities. To evaluate the potentially exploitable quantity and typologies of RM/CRM and secondary raw materials (SRM), standardized protocols, including waste characterization and waste volume potentially exploitable are needed. Further to this, and together with environmental and human health aspects, the economic and societal aspects need to be integrated and therefore common cost benefit analysis (CBA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies should be also used. A more sustainable and integrated approach in the management of extractive industry at large, also thanks to proper Guidelines, is needed to boost the waste recycling. Some tools, as the sustainable finance, can be applied to encourage industries to be more responsible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fundamental is the interaction within Research Centers, Academies, Industries and Public Administrations in researching innovative and newer solutions for waste recycling (in terms of new technologies and products) and in guaranteeing the application at a wider scale of the products, objects of patents and already tested, not already present in the global market. In many cases, the possibility to re-use SRM from mining waste is invalidate from landscape constraints or bans on protected areas; to move these limits, it&amp;amp;#8217;s necessary working harmonically with Public Administrations and Mining Companies in order to show them the results of materials recovered in terms of LCA, if compared to mining. &amp;amp;#160;The typical objection from &amp;amp;#8220;stakeholders&amp;amp;#8221; is to consider the removing operations too much invasive on territory, but this belief could be debunked with a correct, agreed approach of the project; good solutions of environmental recovery should be found after exploitation, also to solve safety and pollution problems and return the site in better condition. For these reasons, we consider to give priority to the case-histories which represent a real or potential risk (for production, of stability, hydrogeological, chemical, etc.), but in perspective mostly a precious resource.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The present research investigates the chance to guarantee a more sustainable mining in selected Italian case studies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

A resource-supplying enterprise is a complex multifunctional production and economic system that is aimed at providing the city's population with water supply and sanitation services, as well as focused on the interests of the consumer. It is possible to achieve the main goals of the enterprise only with the construction of long-term goals and assessment of development prospects. The study provides an analysis of the weaknesses and strengths in the course of the activities of the enterprise SUE \"Vodokanal of St. Petersburg\" and reflects its long-term goals and assesses the prospects for achieving these goals and objectives. Further, the article reflects the matrix of prospects for building complex strategies that allow you to evaluate and plan the activities of the water supply and sewerage enterprise. The article was prepared as part of the author's dissertation research. Strategic guidelines and, in particular, the matrix contains the main elements of the organization's activities, which include: the general direction of the enterprise's activity, interaction along the \"consumer\" – \"enterprise\" chain, production, social, environmental strategies of the organization's activities, investment and tariff strategies. In summary, the presented mechanism reflects the fact that the water supply and sewerage enterprise will develop in the direction of reducing the negative impact on the environment, the ways of innovative development of the enterprise, the enterprise also plans to receive investments from external sources and allocate internal financing for development and projects within the organization. Considerable attention will be paid to the development of production processes, i.e. reduce losses and costs, the most efficient use of enterprise resources, improve the quality of provided services. Special attention will be paid to the field of \"working with consumers\", which will improve communication between employees of the enterprise and direct subscribers of the organization. Thus, the water supply and sewerage enterprise has prospects in the development of its activities, but the beneficial development depends on external and internal factors and the correct construction of a system of strategic guidelines.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background. Predicting future sales is necessary to control the flow of goods in supply chains (SC), which is why firms perform forecasting of consumer demand. To study the reliability of the solution, the sensitivity analysis (SA) of the results to changes in the original data is performed. Network decision support (DS) models usually contain a very large number of elements and connections between them, which makes it difficult to perform SA.\nObjective. The aim of the paper is to assess the sensitivity of the solution, given in the form of the element ranking of the network DS model, to inaccuracies and contradictions in elements of expert pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs), as well as to changes in individual elements of the supermatrix of the network DS model. To assess the priority of different types of information in the SC management system and to assess the sensitivity of the decision to obtain a more accurate forecast of consumer demand.\nMethods. Evaluation of DS models to prioritize information needs in the SC management system is carried out based on a developed method of network analysis. The method for assessing the sensitivity of the decision, proposed for the hierarchical DS model, includes finding stable elements of each level of the hierarchy and assessing the degree of sensitivity of global ranking of elements. The sensitivity of a solution based on a network DS model includes an assessment of the stability of local rankings, finding the matrix elements that most affect the change in consistency and change in the local ranking, as well as the sensitivity to changes in individual elements of the model supermatrix.\nResults. The method of complex assessment of sensitivity has been further developed, the stages of assessing the stability of local ranking of elements of the network DS model and the resilience of the pairwise comparison matrix elements to changes in the permissible inconsistency have been improved. A method for SA of results based on the network DS model to changes in individual elements of the supermatrix using machine learning tools is generalized.\nConclusions. In the SC management problem, the elements of the expert PCM are found, which to the greatest extent affect the change in consistency and change in the rankings of decision alternatives. The stable elements of the matrix and elements for revision by an expert were calculated in order to increase the reliability of the solution to the SC management problem based on the hierarchical and network DS models.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Accurate data and strategic business processes are crucial to all parties in a supply chain system. However, the absence of mutual trust can create a barrier to implementation. Several studies have shown that supply chains face challenges arising from a lack of trust with respect to the sharing of data. How well each party trusts the data they receive can have a profound influence on management decisions. Blockchain technology has been widely used to process cryptocurrency transactions. Recently, it has also proved to be effective in creating trust in the Internet of things (IoT) domain. Blockchain technology can facilitate mutual trust between parties who would otherwise have been doubtful of each other’s data, allowing for more effective and secure sharing of data. However, if the blockchain is not IoT-optimized, companies can experience significant delays and the need for extensive computational capacity. Moreover, there are still some limitations regarding the consensus between the nodes in the traditional consensus approaches. Here, we propose an alternative approach to creating trust in supply chains with diverse IoT elements. Our streamlined trust model simplifies data sharing and reduces computational, storage, and latency requirements while increasing the security of the IoT-based supply chain management. We evaluate the suggested model using simulations and highlight its viability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Green supply chain management has received increasing attention as consumers have become more environmentally conscious. Manufacturers are making green investments to meet consumers’ demands, while retailers in different markets often engage in cooperative promotion to attract more consumers. This study develops game theoretic models for investigating cooperative promotion for two cross-market firms with different channel structures, i.e., decentralized and centralized. The manufacturer determines the wholesale price for the retailers and the green investment of a product, and the retailers determine the promotional effort and retail price. This study finds that whether the firms join in cooperative promotion mainly depends on the wholesale price, as well as the impacts of the price, green investment, and cooperative promotional activities on the demand. When the wholesale price is relatively low, the retail price of the decentralized green supply chain must be lower than that of the centralized green supply chain. On the contrary, the difference in the retail price between the two green supply chains varies with the impacts of green investment and cooperative promotional activities on demand. In addition, due to the influence of channel structure, the contribution to cooperative promotion of the centralized supply chain is more than that of the decentralized supply chain with the most given conditions. Moreover, as the impact of cooperative promotional activities on demand increases, the centralized green supply chain does not necessarily result in higher profits than the decentralized green supply chain.</jats:p>"

As this is ecologically disadvantageous, it is necessary to determine if nitrogen (N) fertilization can be reduced without negative effects on productivity. For quality reasons, the effects of reduced N supply on taste, valuable compounds and storage life must be elucidated in parallel. This study examines whether reducing the N supply of cocktail tomatoes by 50% to recommendations affects the yield and quality of tomato fruits. Three varieties with different skin colors, yellow-orange (‘Apresa’), red (‘Delioso’) and brown (‘Bombonera’), were grown in soil in a greenhouse and harvested at the red-ripen stage. Quality parameters were assessed at harvest and after eight-day storage. Total yield decreased exclusively with ‘Bombonera’ due to reduced fruit weight. Firmness of the fruit pulp, concentrations of minerals, soluble solid contents, total acidity, total phenolics and liposoluble pigments of fruits were not influenced. However, storage affected chemical compositions positively, as shown by increased antioxidants. Descriptive sensory analyses revealed no impact of reduced N supply. From the perspective of the yield, quality and shelf life of fruits, reducing the N supply by 50% offers opportunities for the three cocktail tomato varieties in soil cultivation.</jats:p>"

The first stage deals with strategic levels, such as to determine facility locations and their capacity, while the second stage considers in a tactical level, such as production quantity, delivery routing. Each stage’s decision could affect the other stage’s result, and it could not be determined individual. However, supply chain network designs often fail to account for supply chain disruptions. In this paper, this paper proposed a two-stage stochastic programming model for a four-echelon global supply chain network design problem considering possible disruptions at facilities. A modified simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is developed to determine the strategic decision at the first stage. The comparison of traditional supply chain network decision framework shows that under disruption, the stochastic solutions outperform the traditional one. This study demonstrates the managerial viability of the proposed model in designing a supply chain network in which disruptive events are proactively accounted for.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ensuring reliability is one of the most important issues in the creation and operation of any technical system. This is especially important for complex systems, such as power supply systems with internal and external connections consisting of many elements. The task of ensuring the reliability of power supply systems includes a whole set of technical, economic and organizational measures aimed at reducing damage caused by violations of the normal mode of operation of electricity consumers. To obtain information about the reliability of elements of power supply systems, it is necessary to study a fairly large number of identical elements over a long period of time. In the real conditions of an industrial enterprise, this creates certain difficulties, so it is possible to conduct an accelerated reliability test using mathematical modeling [3].&#x0D;\nThe article discusses some ways to solve the main problem of reliability theory - building a mathematical model and obtaining criteria for selecting optimal options for power supply systems. In this paper, the main materials for calculating the reliability of power supply systems using the mathematical apparatus of probability theory are presented.</jats:p>"

Their biosynthesis is directed by the hybrid multimodular megaenzymes of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase. We have previously discovered a new neoantimycin analogue unantimycin B, which was demonstrated with selective anticancer activities and was produced from neoantimycins biosynthetic pathway with a starter unit of 3-hydroxybenzoate, instead of the 3-formamidosalicylate for neoantimycins. However, the low fermentation yield and tough isolation procedure have been hindering in-depth pharmacology investigation of unantimycin B as anticancer agents.ResultsIn the work, we genetically constructed two unantimycin B producer strains with neoantimycins production destroyed by removing natO and natJ-L genes essential for 3-formamidosalicylate biosynthesis and therefore facilitated chromatographic separation of unantimycin B from the complex fermentation extract. Based on the △natO mutant, we improved unantimycin Bproduction by two times, reaching to approximate 12.8 mg/L, by feeding 3-hydroxybenzoate in fermentation. Further, the production was improved by more than six times, reaching to approximate 40.0 mg/L, in the △natO strain introduced with a chorismatase gene highly expressed under a strong promoter for over-producing 3-hydroxybenzoate endogenously.ConclusionThe work gives a case of targeting accumulation and significant production improvement of medicinally interesting natural products via genetically manipulation of precursor biosynthesis in streptomycetes, the talented producers of pharmaceutical molecules.</jats:p>"

Recycling livestock waste to generate biogas will partially solve environmental problems, as well as benefit from decentralized renewable energy production or fuel production.\nThe role of renewable energy sources in energy production is constantly growing and now the issue of increasing the share of renewable sources in the energy balance of each country is relevant. In the supply of primary energy, the share of renewable energy accounts for 13% worldwide. Of these, biomass accounts for 10%, or 258 million tons per year, ie in the world biomass provides the largest share of energy supply from renewable sources.\nDomestic agricultural enterprises are significant consumers of fuel and energy resources, so they face the objective need to use alternative energy sources, including biofuels and the introduction of innovative energy-saving technologies. Biogas production is an efficient and attractive investment technology, due to the presence of significant raw material potential, favorable climatic and other. However, the level of introduction of this type of energy in the agro-industrial complex is insufficient, which is due to a number of issues, including insufficient level of practical recommendations for choosing power generators, their number, modes of operation taking into account daily energy consumption schedule, load and optimal efficiency. installations while providing autonomous power supply of the enterprise.\nThis paper determines the level of energy supply of livestock farms through the use of biogas plants as a source of energy used for livestock waste.</jats:p>",

Such events have significant human and economic impacts. For example, in 1988, landslides resulted in 373 deaths and caused up to US$80 million in damage (Tanavud, 2008); in 2011, floods and landslides affected more than two million people and killed 53 across Southern Thailand with a village of about 100 households being buried by one large slide (EarthObservatory, 2021). Landslides in the Krabi province in Thailand are predominantly shallow and rainfall-induced, they also represent the main source of sediment pulses for coastal environments such as mangroves and beaches.

This paper presents some theory-based equations for explicit estimation of the discharge from a radial gate under free and submerged flow conditions using energy and momentum (E-M) principles. The proposed equations were calibrated using extensive experimental data collected from the literature and this study for three types of radial gate under free and submerged flow conditions. The submergence threshold of radial gates is concluded, based on the concepts of hydraulic jump and the intersection of free and submerged head-discharge curves. The results indicated that the error in estimating the discharge increases under transition ( − 2.5 ≤ Sr% ≤ + 2.5), gate lip (1 &amp;lt; y0/w ≤ 2), and high submerged (yt/y0 ≥ 0.95) flow conditions. However, in these flow limit conditions, the discharge error can be considerably decreased by adjusting the tailwater depth to flow depth just after the gate and using the energy equation for the sections before and after the gate. The efficiency of the proposed methods was evaluated based on the data series from field measurements of radial gates in 29 check structures at irrigation canals in the United States and Iran. The results showed that the discharge could be estimated using the proposed equations in field conditions with acceptable accuracy.</jats:p>",

This can be interpreted as the problem faced in the short term by a ride-hailing platform. We propose a two-dimensional framework in which a platform selects prices for different locations and drivers respond by choosing where to relocate, in equilibrium, based on prices, travel costs, and driver congestion levels. The platform’s problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem with equilibrium constraints. We elucidate structural properties of supply equilibria and the corresponding utilities that emerge and establish a form of spatial decomposition, which allows us to localize the analysis to regions of movement. In turn, uncovering an appropriate knapsack structure to the platform’s problem, we establish a crisp local characterization of the optimal prices and the corresponding supply response. In the optimal solution, the platform applies different treatments to different locations. In some locations, prices are set so that supply and demand are perfectly matched; overcongestion is induced in other locations, and some less profitable locations are indirectly priced out. To obtain insights on the global structure of an optimal solution, we derive in quasi-closed form the optimal solution for a family of models characterized by a demand shock. The optimal solution, although better balancing supply and demand around the shock, quite interestingly also ends up inducing movement away from it. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, optimization. </jats:p>",

The research results show that mining companies use economic, environmental and social criteria in the selection of sustainable suppliers, which are consistent with the research carried out by Dickson (1966) and Zimmer, Frohling and Schultmann ( 2016). However, the differentiation that mining companies make in the evaluation of criteria when it comes to suppliers of goods or service providers stands out as an important finding. In the case of suppliers of goods, economic criteria are valued more preferably, such as: quality, delivery on time, price, historical performance and previous sales. On the other hand, when it comes to service providers, environmental and social criteria, such as: occupational health and safety management and  environmental management, are valued with greater importance.</jats:p>"

Based on these advantages, the amount of literatures in this field is gradually expanding especially in recent years. This paper combines the bibliometric and main path analysis (MPA) method to introduce the current status and development trend, and explore the dynamic evolution of knowledge and main research topics of this domain. The main results are as follows: (1) Sarkis J is the most prolific author and Hong Kong Polytechnic University is the most productive institution of this field. (2) Articles on main path mainly focus on the application of GSC in various industries and can be divided into two categories based on the research content, including the evaluation and selection of green practices and green supplier, as well as the identification and evaluation of obstacles and drivers in green supply chain management (GSCM) practices. Moreover, the topics of theoretical innovation of evaluation method, evaluation of entire supply chain performance and circular economy (CE) based on the triple bottom line maybe the possible research direction for scholars. In general, this article not only provides a comprehensive and systematic longitudinal bibliometric overview but also presents the trajectory of knowledge diffusion of GSC domain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim was to determine the reliability indicators of a power supply system using an artificial neural network model. A model for calculating technical reliability was developed using the following methods: an algorithm for calculating reliability indicators of power supply systems, the method of failure rate of a power supply system and a forecasting model using artificial neural networks. It was established that a power supply system is formed by an open radial power supply circuit. The failure rate of the power supply subsystem was determined by calculating the failure rate of i-th element of the subsystem. As a result of calculating the probability of failure-free operation of the subsystem for various conditions (5 time intervals), it was found that with an increase in the operating time from 100 to 500 h, a linear increase in the rate of system failures occurs from 0.0051 to 0.0073 1/h. A comparison of the obtained mean-to-failure values of the main and the same backup subsystem in the unloaded mode with an absolutely reliable switch (269.62 h) with the main and the same backup subsystem in the loaded mode (202.21 h) was carried out. The results differ by 67.41 h, which indicates a higher degree of reliability of the first method. The software package Prognoz_INS_2020 was developed. An acceptable accuracy of no more than 2.17% was obtained by comparing the results of the conventional calculation of the failure rate of power supply systems and using the Prognoz_INS_2020 software package. This indicates the efficiency of the proposed software package in reliability calculations at operating energy enterprises. The proposed methods for assessing technical reliability both using the conventional model and a model based on an artificial neural network made it possible to assess the state of power supply systems, which helps to prevent dangerous emergencies. </jats:p>"

The agent is designated to act on behalf of the company owner, i.e., the principal, in the domain of supply chain management in the face of a supplier’s default uncertainty. Each of the players is gain-oriented, but their objective functions and the degree of risk-bearing may significantly differ, leading to an agent’s decisions not being optimal in terms of the principal’s outcome. This article proposes a multi-period supply chain simulation model that can be used to perform a supply chain optimization and comparison between the agent and the principal. The proposed framework allows for differentiating the model parametrization depending on the industry, in particular the consequences of the inability to deliver the end product, costs of keeping safety stocks, or the uncertainty regarding the suppliers’ delivery failure. As players’ objective functions, we consider expected profit-based indicators and measures taking the inter-period variance into account. We find that the agent’s actions may diverge from the principal’s optimum if the agent’s incentive system is not selected correctly. We also propose a solution that unifies the goals of the players. The recent COVID-19 pandemic amplifies the importance of such research. Many companies had to limit production capacities due to global lockdowns and, per the JIT production strategy, the prior safety stock levels were low.</jats:p>",

At the same time, their customer orientation makes it increasingly important to ensure high delivery reliability. Manufacturing sites within a supply network must therefore be resilient against events from the supply network. This requires deeper integration between the supply network and manufacturing control. Therefore, this article presents a concept to connect supply network and manufacturing more closely by integrating events from the supply network into manufacturing control’s decisions. In addition to the requirements, the concept describes the structure of the system as a control loop, a reinforcement learning-based controlling element as the central decision-making component, and the integration into the existing production IT landscape of a company as well as with latest internet of things (IoT) devices and cyber-physical systems. The benefits of the concept were elaborated in expert workshops. In summary, this approach enables an effective and efficient response to events from the supply network through smarter manufacturing control, and thus more resilient manufacturing.</jats:p>"

At the same time, the task is to minimize the costs associated with the excessive operation of pumps, while providing the protection of the pipeline from freezing in harsh natural operating conditions. To solve this problem, a computer simulation model was developed for the first rise section, equipped with a pump performance control system. The main differences of the developed model are: integrated approach to the analysis of parameters of various physical nature, assessment of the object economic indicators, possibility of simulating non-standard control algorithms. Preliminary studies of the model have shown the possibility and feasibility of its application for calculating the optimal parameters and operating modes of the object under consideration. Based on the simulation results, it was revealed that to calculate the control action by level, it is advisable to use the PID law, for temperature—PD law, for flow rate—PI law. To calculate the main control action, it is proposed to simultaneously calculate the actions in terms of level and temperature, followed by bringing the larger of them to the value of the setpoint for the flow rate maintained by the flow controller. The studies of the proposed management concept for the first rise section have shown its high technical and economic efficiency. In particular, the savings in electricity consumption are estimated at about 55.2% while providing pipeline frost protection.</jats:p>"

In supply chain management, optimization goes hand-in-hand with inventory control to address several issues of the supply, management, and use of drugs. However, it is difficult to determine a shortage situation in a hospital due to multiple unpredictable reasons, such as manufacturing problems, supply and demand issues, and raw material problems. To avoid the shortage problem in a hospital, efficient inventory management is required to operate the system in a sustainable way and maximize the profit of the organization in the Hospital Supply Chain (HSC). In this work, we study a drug refilling optimization problem, a general model for drug inventory management in a hospital. We then investigate a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model to address this problem under an online solution that can automatically make a drug refilling decision in order to prevent a drug shortage. We further present a numerical result to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, which outperforms the baselines (e.g., over-provisioning, ski-rental, and max-min) in terms of the refilling cost and the shortage rate.</jats:p>"

A new concept of supply risk level (SRL) of a channel is proposed to quantitatively characterize the supply risk of the channel due to supply uncertainty. Under different SRLs, we study the order strategies for the two channels in integrated and decentralized supply chains. Regardless of whether the game is integrated or decentralized, we find that the different SRLs give rise to a difference between the belief-degree costs of the two channels that directly influences the optimal order strategy, market supply and profit of each channel. This implies that the decision maker of the supply chain can take different risk attitudes toward the supply uncertainty of the two channels to adjust the potential market supply and profit of each channel because the decision maker generally replaces the SRL with his or her risk preference. Under given SRLs, we find that integration is a better strategy than decentralization. However, the channel profit with a higher belief-degree cost under decentralization is greater than that under integration in some cases. Finally, proper risk preferences for both channels are suggested to strike a balance between supply reliability and supply risk.</jats:p>",

Surges in suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases have depleted supplies, most notably personal protective equipment; overwhelmed health system and hospital order/inventory management processes and systems, particularly those that are manual, paper based; and essentially wiped out revenues, with US hospitals losing an estimated US$1m per day in cancelled or delayed elective procedures (American Hospital Association.

In this paper, we present insights from US healthcare supply chain leaders on how COVID-19 has impacted their operations and what steps they have taken to support clinicians and maintain patient care delivery. We include recent research on the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and commentary from industry organisations and thought leaders on important findings. On the basis of these industry insights and our own work to support both provider and supplier organisations in delivering critical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conclude with best practices for strengthening the supply chain moving forward.\nReaders will gain knowledge around the following:\n• How COVID-19 has impacted health systems and hospitals clinically, operationally and financially, including commentary and examples from US healthcare supply chain leaders on their experiences during the pandemic\n• Why traditional methodologies, systems and processes for procuring products and managing inventory have failed under the sudden and sharp increase in supply demands\n• The impact of the pandemic on the global supply chain, including the risks of procuring products from non-traditional suppliers to meet clinical supply needs\n• The many ways health systems and hospitals have been financially impacted by the pandemic, including increased supply acquisition costs coupled with lower revenues and delayed cash collection\n• Best practice supply chain advance preparation strategies aimed at strengthening supply chain resiliency and mitigating the negative impact of future disruptions to supply availability and delivery</jats:p>"

The approach is based on the analysis of the functioning processes of modern quality control systems for information security in supply chain. In addition, it is based on an analysis of decision support processes. We use controlled Markov chains, represented by difference stochastic equations. The considered version of the analytical description of the state change in dynamics allows one to formalize, structure, and mathematically describe the process of this class from a uniform perspective. It is important to note that with this representation of the dynamics of state transitions, the requirements for operativity (timeliness), reliability, secrecy and resource costs for supporting decision-making to control information security in the supply chain are taken into account.</jats:p>"

They suggested that resilience does not just relate to the ability of a system to “bounce back” after an impeding event, but also to the capacity to adapt and transform. The operations and supply chain management literature remains surprisingly disconnected from these debates. This essay sets out to further our theoretical knowledge of what resilience means (or means to others) by disentangling two prominent perspectives of resilience—engineering resilience and social‐ecological resilience—and offering an updated definition of supply chain resilience. We integrate and discuss these perspectives in the context of our understanding of the supply chain as a system. The goal is to outline the potential links and inconsistencies of these perspectives with supply chain management (SCM). From there, we seek to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what resilience means in SCM. Supply chain resilience is then no longer understood in terms of stability, but in terms of adaptation and transformation.</jats:p>",

This paper adds knowledge to the existing research by answering following questions: (1) what is the status of BPM research domain? And (2) what are the possible future research directions on BPM? A thematic review was conducted focusing a series of literature on BPM which have been published between 2001 and 2020. The findings highlight that the integration of BPM into new digital innovations, such as process mining, is essential for an effective and efficient organization. More research on BPM and IT management needs to be conducted to support this integration between BPM and digital innovations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In his 2004 article, Professor Hau Lee argues that the best supply chains are not only fast and cost‐effective but also agile, adaptable, and aligned. The concept of triple‐A supply chains has been extensively studied in academic and trade publications and integrated into numerous operations and supply chain management curricula. It has also influenced the management approach of leaders around the world. Yet since the triple‐A concept was first developed, supply chains have become increasingly global, connected, and interdependent. The increased complexity of global supply chains has reduced much‐needed visibility, further complicating their management, while the growing connectivity and interdependence among different stakeholders have led to many unforeseen environmental and social issues. As a result, Professor Lee’s emphasis on triple‐A supply chains is even more relevant today. In light of these new challenges and demands, we revisit the original triple‐A definitions of agile, adaptable, and aligned, expanding these concepts for a more socially and environmentally conscientious world. We also discuss potential enablers of and barriers to sustainable triple‐A supply chains. </jats:p>",

The sample collected by using purposive sampling method obtained 488 companies. The data were tested using STATA 16.Findings: The results of the analysis showed that green supply chain management had a positive effect on green innovation, green innovation had a positive effect on firm performance, and green supply chain management had no effect on firm performance. Green innovation mediated the relationship between green supply chain management and firm performance.Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study was using companies listed on the PROPER program, so it needed to be studied by applying other companies. Besides, it only implemented green innovation, green supply chain management, and firm performance. Future studies can apply other green-related aspects and performances.Practical implications: Regarding the problem of environmental impact, companies in Indonesia can apply green innovation and green supply chain management to improve their firm performance. Companies in Indonesia are increasingly faced with pressure from stakeholders to implement green supply chain management.Social implications: It is useful for the Indonesian government in overcoming environmental impact issues by implementing green supply chain management by companies. Companies that implement green supply chain management will have an impact on increasing green innovation and firm performance.Originality/value: This study assessed the mediation of green innovation in the relationship between green supply chain management and firm performance. This indicated that here there was pressure from stakeholders to pay full attention to the environment, so that companies in Indonesia can apply green innovation and green supply chain management to improve firm performance.</jats:p>"

This study aims to determine the effectiveness of RSF to remove MPs. The artificial samples were made from plastics bags and tyre flakes, with sizes from 10 μm to more than 500 μm. Bentonite was added to represent turbidity in the water. The average removal efficiency of plastics flakes before entering the filter was 50.48% (using bentonite) and 47.78% (without bentonite). Overall, the removal efficiency for the tyre flakes was 90.72% (using bentonite) and 93.03% (without bentonite). The filtration used in this study was varied between 4 and 10 m/h. Removal efficiency using RSF for plastic flakes on which the Effective Size (ES) filter media 0.39 mm was 97.7% and on which ES 0.68 mm was 94.3%. Meanwhile, the removal efficiency of the tyre flakes for ES 0.39 mm were 90.6% and ES 0.68 mm was 85.2%.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At the end of March 2020, the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus was declared a global pandemic. By mid-May, the number of confirmed cases had risen to more than 5 million and more than 300,000 deaths were reported worldwide. Morocco confirmed its first imported case of COVID-19 on March 2, 2020. As of May 31, 2020, there were 7550 confirmed cases of infection with this virus. Like many countries, this epidemic prompted the Moroccan government, as of 20 March 2020, to apply travel restrictions and suspend travel within and between cities to prevent the spread of the disease. These distancing measures have resulted in effective control of the virus. However, they also have a profound effect on the health system, relatively speaking, on blood donation and supply and the management of transfusion at the national level. In this context, on March 20, 2020, WHO provided guidance on the management of the blood supply. In addition, the National Centre for Blood Transfusion and Haematology (NCBTH) has accompanied the Regional Centers for Blood Transfusion (RCBT) of the kingdom through the implementation of a new strategy to deal with a possible shortage of blood supply. In response to such a situation, the Oujda Regional Center for Blood Transfusion (ORCBT) anticipated the development of a proactive regional strategy in collaboration with the Blood Donor Association of the Eastern Region (BDAER), and set up accompanying measures during the pandemic. The objective of this study is to describe the strategies undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on all transfusion activities from blood collection, delivery, and transfusion of Labile Blood Products (LBPs). To achieve our objective, we performed a comparative prospective analytical study from January 1 to May 31 of 2019 and 2020 years at the ORCBT, located in the prefecture of Oujda Angad. The results of this study showed a positive impact, to some extent, of the strategies implemented, first on blood collection and then on the center′s safety stock, which remained at the same level despite the containment circumstances. Thus, the ORCBT carried out its mission by responding to the majority of requests for LBPs that were addressed to it with a satisfaction rate of over 90% for all health facilities in the eastern region during the study period.</jats:p>"

Results indicated that chicken meat demand was responsive to changes in own and beef prices as well as income. The direction of the independent variables were as expected, with the exception of pork prices. The response of chicken meat supply to own-price changes was found to be inelastic in the short run. Chicken feed and the exchange rate elasticities did not present a great impact on the percentage changes of the quantity offered of chicken meat. The proposed model can be useful for producers, chicken meat companies managers and policymakers as understanding the factors that affect the chicken market can lead to optimal managerial and financial decisions</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Deep-water systems in active rift margins are complex, highly dynamic, and often characterised by short, steep source-to-sink configurations promoting high and sustained sediment supply to substantially underfilled, deep-water depocentres. The timing and character of coarse siliciclastic sediment delivery to deep-water environments in active rift basins is governed by complicated interactions of tectonics, climate, eustasy, and shelf process regime. However, existing sediment-supply models are largely geared towards longer term changes (~10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; yrs) in tectonics, or eustatic variability, with relatively limited consideration for higher order (10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; yrs) changes in catchment sediment flux due to the difficulty in deconvolving controls at these timescales. In the case of deep-lacustrine, syn-rift systems, the excess accommodation resulting from substantial subsidence, limited storage in short or absent shelves, and suppressed water-level variability in lacustrine settings, means climate-controlled catchment sediment flux may become a dominant allogenic control on mesoscale stratigraphic architecture. However, well-constrained conceptual models and examples of the stratigraphic record of sediment supply variability to deep-water syn-rift lakes are rare due to the paucity of exhumed deep-water syn-rift systems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The West Xylokastro Fault Block, on the southern margin of the Gulf of Corinth, Greece presents an exhumed Early-Mid Pleistocene deep-lacustrine syn-rift fan system of the Rethi-Dendro Formation. The stratigraphic correlation possible in the West Xylokastro Fault Block permits the tying of stratigraphic architecture recorded in the up-dip Ilias fan-delta, supplying sediment to the deep-water realm, and their stratigraphy and palaeoenvironmental record down-dip. Through combining fieldwork, digital-outcrop investigation with palynological and palaeomagnetic sampling of a behind-outcrop research borehole, a chronostratigraphically-constrained palaeoenvironmental record reveals important changes in sediment supply variability to the deep-water consistent with obliquity-paced oscillations of forest coverage and glacial-interglacial climate variability. Integration of the borehole data, with outcrop observations, highlights that thick, laterally pervasive mudstone intervals can be tied to transgressions of the fan delta, interpreted to be related to sediment supply shutdowns. Sediment supply shutdowns occur during the warming phase of the most severe interglacials of the Early Pleistocene, where the palynological record shows the substantial expansion of warm-temperate, forested vegetation biomes. The role of vegetation in governing sediment supply, through hindering sediment erosion and transport from a catchment, has commonly been linked to reduced sediment yields throughout interglacials. However, the observations in the West Xylokastro stratigraphy highlight that such a model may not appropriate for very severe interglacials where highstand conditions may become highly seasonal, with semi-arid or dry summers, but with very large storms in winters and/or too warm to sustain lowland forests. In these conditions more open, scrubland vegetation permits the erosion and transport of coarse-grained material to the deep-lacustrine fan during the interglacial highstand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The study informs new conceptual models for climate- and vegetation-controlled sediment supply to deep-water in active margins, which highlight the substantial potential complexity of palaeoenvironmental controls on sediment flux. Binary interglacial vs glacial sediment supply models are likely insufficient for characterising the complexity presented by deep-water syn-rift stratigraphy and highlights a greater need for deep-water stratigraphers to identify suitable proxies (such as palynology) for constraining palaeoenvironmental change.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

It is considerably getting more complex in the case of agroindustry as its commodity mostly is classified as perishable goods. The increase of order at a particular season sometimes is not counterbalanced with the number of stocks. The prevalent rationale of this problem is due to none of the appropriate inventory policy is implemented. The purpose of this research is to develop an inventory policy system in the case of agroindustry considering the inventory cost, deterioration rate of perishable fruits, and seasonal variable. Thus, it can be used to maintain the stability of demand while considering those variables. This study employs the periodic review (R,s,S) to construct an inventory policy. The periodic review is determined by order interval (R), a combination of reorder point (s), and maximum level (S). The experimental case study is presented to provide an example of an inventory policy. The inventory policy can alleviate the stocking problem of perishable and seasonal fruits encountered by the agroindustry. The method is able to minimize inventory cost by controlling the inventory systems. This paper offers a model of inventory policy on agroindustry to control and optimize the stocks while reckoning the inventory cost, deterioration rate, and seasonal to fulfil the demand.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management as a new business philosophy in today’s competitive conditions is a source of numerous advantages for those enterprises that apply it. Due to its dynamic structure, it is a much wider term than that of logistics management, because it encompasses the process of conceiving, developing, optimizing and managing internal and external components of acquisition, transformation of material and distribution of finished products or services in accordance with the business strategic goals. The aim of the supply chain management is the creation of as great a value as possible for all value chain participants, especially for the final consumer, as he is at the end of the system of value creation and he validates the quality of supply chain via his purchase. When all enterprises –participants in the supply chain – do their business separately and act on their own separate business strategies, the sum of their expenses surpasses the expenses generated by integrated business of these enterprises within the supply chain. It is precisely because of this fact that, when an enterprise creates a unique system of goods and information flow with other members of the chain, it in fact enhances the efficiency of managing the entire chain. In that way, the value of the whole system increases for the consumer and competitive advantage of the chain is created. Since the clusters occur by connecting enterprises or chains of new value creation, the rest of this paper explains the meeting points between cluster concept and supply chain concept respectively, with special emphasis on agricultural clusters. The basic idea was that agricultural clusters are a geographical concentration of mutually connected SMEs, specialized suppliers and service providers, companies in related businesses, scientific and educational institutions, and government bodies and agencies in the sectors of agriculture and rural development. Therefore, the network of interdependent enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads), within agricultural clusters and related institutions, confirms that within every cluster there are numerous supply chains, that is, that the supply chain management is an integral part and an indispensable factor of a cluster. At the same time, there is a complementarity and symbiosis between the concept of supply chain management and cluster concept, that is, their combination can effectively advance the competitive advantage both of the enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads) and consequently regional and national economic competitiveness. The geographical proximity of cluster participants enables a more efficient access to specialized resources, information, human resources, institutions, and trainings; facilitates the coordination of activities within enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads) as well as among cluster members; creates larger possibilities for innovation; stimulates permanent comparison of performances and of creating more successful business models, so-called best practices; and contributes to the commercialization of products and services and entering the new markets, as well as creating of new enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads). More specifically, doing business in a cluster environment stimulates the competitiveness of enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads) and affects the promotion of supply chain management within enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads).</jats:p>"

It has become one of the development trends of power supply for future technologies such as electric vehicles. In many engineering applications, inductive wireless power supply systems need to supply power to multiple loads at the same time. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the dynamic process of the multiload system. This paper first selects the optimal compensation network according to the stable operating conditions of the multiload system. Secondly, in order to classify and describe the movement state of the load in the dynamic process, the simulation model is established on the MATLAB/SIMULINK platform to analyze the influence of the mutual inductance or resistance of any load on the output characteristics of the primary system and other loads. Then, in order to solve the problem of unstable output voltage used by multiple loads entering the same track at the same time or load resistance changes, this paper adopts a secondary side control strategy. The duty cycle of the Buck circuit is adjusted by the fixed frequency PWM sliding mode controller (PWMSMC), so as to realize the independent control of each load. Finally, an experimental platform was established to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis.</jats:p>"

To study in depth the functioning of the circular supply chain, we use the dimension of exploitation of absorptive capacity, distinguishing between routines that allow adaptation to new production needs (technological knowledge) and new commercial needs (market knowledge). The empirical study was conducted on a sample of 9612 companies, divided into three levels of technology intensity manufacturing, from the PITEC panel using multivariate models. The results show that the operating routines associated with the use of production and logistics technologies developed in a circular fashion favor the development of new products. Similarly, a bidirectional knowledge flow is necessary. The first flow is toward the company with practices that allow a better understanding of the customer and their needs in the framework of the circular economy. The second flow would be toward customers, who need to be informed and educated through various marketing and communication activities to adapt their behavior to the principles of circularity.</jats:p>"

The COVID-19 crisis, as an exceptional event, showed the limits and the fragility of supply chains, with circular economy practices as a potential solution during and post-COVID. Reverse logistics (RL) is an important dimension of the circular economy which allows management of economic, social, and environmental challenges. Transportation is needed for RL to effectively operate, but research study on this topic has been relatively limited. New digitalization opportunities can enhance transportation and RL, and therefore further enhance the circular economy. This paper proposes to review practical research and concerns at the nexus of transportation, RL, and blockchain as a digitalizing technology. The potential benefits of blockchain technology through example use cases on various aspects of RL and transportation activities are presented. This integration and applications are evaluated using various capability facets of blockchain technology, particularly as an immutable and reliable ledger, a tracking service, a smart contract utility, as marketplace support, and as tokenization and incentivization. We also briefly introduce the physical internet concept within this context. The physical internet paradigm proposed last decade, promises to also disrupt the blockchain, transportation, and RL nexus.

A quantitative approach with cross-sectional design as a survey method has been employed in this study and purposive sampling was used as the sampling technique. A total of 209 usable questionnaires were processed in this study. Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to validate the research model and to test the hypotheses. The Air Traffic Management sector is the largest sector in the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) and the primary job responsibility of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) is to control and navigate the movement of planes especially during take-off and landing. The job characteristics are distinct, and it leads ATCs to be stressful and demanding job. This study found that self-efficacy is related to employee wellbeing. ATCs with high self-efficacy produce good initiatives, effort, and persistence in doing their job. Undoubtedly, self-efficacy will help ATCs to predict their future planning.</jats:p>"

This problem is solved on the basis of the problem of identification and evaluation of the influence of voltage distortion sources. To date, existing methods for identifying and assessing the impact of harmonic voltage sources have significant limitations of practical implementation. This is due to their basic mathematical model and local approach to measuring the parameters of the network. In the given research the new mathematical model of identification and an estimation of harmonic voltage sources that is focused on the distributed measuring system is presented. The criterion for identifying harmonic voltage sources is the distorting nodal current. To adequately determine it, it is necessary not only to measure the parameters of the network mode in the base nodes by the currents of the higher harmonic components, but also to control the structure and parameters of the replacement circuit of the entire power supply system. To achieve this goal, it is proposed to use a distributed measuring system, which is based on vector measurement systems and control systems. The estimation of the influence of harmonic voltage sources is directly proportional to the distorting nodal current, where the coefficient of proportionality is either mutual or intrinsic resistance of power supply systems, that connects the location of the distortion source and the place for which its influence is estimated. In order to control the influence of measurement errors and determine the parameters of circuits for replacing elements of the power supply system, the method and algorithm for identifying and assessing the impact of harmonic voltage sources should be developed based on the principle of excluding one of the voltage distortion sources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Steep step-pool streams are often coupled to adjacent hillslope, directly receiving episodic sediment supply from mass movement processes such as landslides and debris flows. The response of step-pool channels to the variations in sediment supply remains largely unexplored. We conducted flume experiments with a poorly sorted grain-size distribution in an 8%-steep, 5-m long flume with variable width at the University of British Columbia, to study the effects of episodic sediment supply on channel evolution. After a conditioning phase with no feed, the channel was subjected to sediment pulses of different magnitude and frequency under constant flow discharge. High-resolution data of hydraulics, bedload transport, bed surface grain size, and channel morphology were collected every 10-20 minutes and an additional time at the end of each pulse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In response to sediment pulses, we recorded an increase in bedload transport rates, channel aggradation, bed surface fining, and continuous step formation and collapse. In between pulses, bedload rates dropped by several orders of magnitude, net erosion occurred, the bed surface gradually coarsened, and steps became more stable. The small-magnitude high-frequency pulses caused smaller but more frequent spikes in bedload transport, bed surface evolution, and thus step stability. Instead, the large-magnitude low-frequency pulses cause larger changes but provided a longer time for the channel to recover. This suggests that in step-pool channels pulse magnitude is a key control on channel rearrangement, while pulse frequency controls how fast and strong the recovery is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The frequency and stability of steps varied as a function of local channel width, showing that channel geometry is a primary control on step formation and stability even under episodic sediment supply conditions. Instead, the effect of sediment pulses is less important because the total number and average survival time of steps were similar among runs with different pulses. The critical Shields stress decreased following sediment pulses, then increased immediately after, and fluctuated until the next pulse. The variations in sediment supply caused cycles in bedload transport rate, surface and bedload texture, thus controlling the variability in the threshold for motion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our results indicate that episodic sediment supply is a primary control on the evolution of step-pool channels, with sediment feed magnitude affecting mostly morphological changes, and sediment feed frequency controlling channel stability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The evolutionary features of URT systems have attracted much attention in recent years, but their evolution and their distinct function in contrast to other transit modes have seldom been investigated, especially quantitatively from the perspective of work–residence separation. Accordingly, we propose a framework for exploring the evolution of URT topological networks and demand-weighted networks, comparing the different impacts of all transit modes on work–residence separation. In this study, a URT passenger flow assignment model was formulated on the basis of travel cost function and an improved logit model was proposed that takes into account the heterogeneity of passengers. This model was used to generate a section load, which is regarded as a weight and able to reflect the residents’ demand for travel by URT. Then, the fractal dimensions for a non-weighted network and demand-weighted network are proposed and their indications for transportation explained. Finally, the Beijing Subway System (BSS) is used as a case study by employing fifty years of network data and ten years of smart card data. Using fractal approaches, the different characteristics illustrated by the two networks were investigated and the reasons behind the observed patterns explained. In addition, the spatial features of the rail network, in terms of fractal indictors, were compared with population distribution and urban mobility for all modes, extracted from phone data as a proxy. Thus, the relationship between the residents’ travel demand and traffic supply can be revealed to some extent. The main finding of this work is that demand must be taken into account when analyzing the fractal features of a transport network, lest the demand side be separated from the supply and important issues missed such as inconsistencies between demand and supply. Additionally, the role of rail transit in work–home imbalance can be investigated in the context of urban mobility for an entire city.</jats:p>"

The analysis also pays particular attention to the lockdown period (March – June 2020). Data for this study were obtained from several sources, including information from government records, onsite observation, and semi-structured interviews. Field research was conducted in August 2020 for 10 days in a village in Plaba sub-district. Data was obtained using an interview guide with 55 ginger farmers who have been growing ginger for at least 3 years. The results show that the lock down and transportation restrictions affected input supply chains, such as fertilizer and rhizome seeds. The flow of international labor was also constrained affecting skilled labor shortage in ginger production. However, COVID-19 shows positive impacts on ginger production systems. Ginger price is higher than the previous year because of world market demand and the belief that ginger can be used as an antioxidant to prevent COVID-19 infections. Moreover, the result also shows that these ginger farmers are somewhat resilient in the face of COVID-19 as they are not much dependent on markets for their own subsistence needs. Finally, this study recommends that promoting farmers to produce their own food and diversify commercial crops would be a good strategy for farmers to survive the crisis.</jats:p>"

Shrimp as a well-known, rich, and sought-after seafood, is generally obtained from either marine environments or aquaculture. Central prominence of Shrimp Supply Chain (SSC) is brought about by numerous factors such as high demand, market price, and diverse fisheries or aquaculture locations. In this respect, this paper considers SSC as a set of distribution centers, wholesalers, shrimp processing factories, markets, shrimp waste powder factory, and shrimp waste powder market. Subsequently, a mathematical model is proposed for the SSC, whose aim is to minimize the total cost through the supply chain. The SSC model is NP-<jats:italic>hard</jats:italic>and is not able to solve large-size problems. Therefore, three well-known metaheuristics accompanied by two hybrid ones are exerted. Moreover, a real-world application with 15 test problems are established to validate the model.

Yet it is unclear what is communicated about this and how and what consequences SC management (SCM) would take away. This research aims at analyzing how text mining can provide insights on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on SCs, focusing on the implications of the pandemic for the SC constructs related to risk, resilience, and sustainability. A method applies text mining of general newspapers as well as SC and logistic newspaper articles employing the open-source software R. This paper shows that certain SC topics like risk, resilience, disruption, and sustainability vary in their news coverage on the type of newspaper and the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. It reassures trends and observations from individual experiences on a broader and global picture and discusses the limitations and possibilities of using text mining in this field. The time period was split into three phases regarding the course of the number of infections and differences in the news coverage of the phases that can be distinguished already: (1) the onset of the crisis, (2) the peak and lockdown, and (3) managing SCs during the crisis. As this pandemic is highly dynamic, is new, and has not yet ended, research implications are too early to make. This research rather serves as a base for further, more detailed research into certain topics and identifies limitations and improvements of the applied method.

This inverter is a complex and expensive electronics system. Many of the rooftop PVs are in fault condition due to the failure of their inverters. Therefore, the trends of applying everything’s DC source has been recently developed. This paper examines the modelling of several home appliances (i.e., refrigerator, television, washing machine, air conditioner, crockpot, laptop, mobile phone charger, and LED lightings) of a DC house, which is powered by the rooftop PV using the MATLAB/SIMULINK platform. This proposed model considers the PV (solar cell) module, chargecontroller, battery, and the home appliances as the end load of the system. As the results, this model then analyses and compares to the PV system that powered the AC home appliances to get better vision of DC home appliances that can be implemented in the community</jats:p>"

Therefore, in 2019, a survey on organic food processing enterprises was carried out. The survey among 55 processing companies concerned supply in raw organic produce, sales channels, and collaboration within the organic food supply chain. The research results show that the providers of organic food processors are mostly farmers and, to a lesser extent – intermediaries. In the process of provider selection, what is most important for processors are the quality and availability of agricultural products as well as the trust and credibility of a producer. In their opinion, the most important problems occurring in organic food processing are irregularity of deliveries and an inadequate amount of raw produce supplied. Consequently, a number of processors import part of the raw material needed for their production. Therefore, in order to improve the functioning of the processing sphere, measures in the area of farmer and processor collaboration and the improvement of the distribution system need to be introduced or intensified.</jats:p>",

In the model developing process, two states were tested and the impacts of dimensional and non-dimensional parameters on model efficiency were assessed. The best applied model dependability was investigated via Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis. In addition, the model accuracy was compared with some available semi-theoretical formulas. It was observed that the applied models were more successful than available formulas. The sensitivity analysis results showed that q (unit discharge of spillway) variable in the state 1 and q2/[gYt3] (g is gravity acceleration and Yt is tail water depth) variable in the state 2 were the most significant parameters in the modeling process. Comparison among applied methods and one other intelligence approach showed that KELM was more successful in predicting process. The obtained results from uncertainty analysis indicated that the KELM model had an allowable degree of uncertainty in the scour depth modeling.</jats:p>",

The development of the number of retail food actors is a phenomenon that occurs due to the support for the ease of opening retail food. Factors that support the growth of retail food at this time is the high level of mobility of people who are busy demanding speed and practicality, in any case, is no exception to the fulfilment of basic needs such as food. In the era of disruption, business change is very visible, the way of doing business which used to emphasize owning (ownership) becomes sharing (sharing roles, collaboration resources). The existence of phenomena such as go food, go send, go shop, goat, grab food, and other application-based media are developing in the latest era. This phenomenon changes the view of the supply chain, one of which is affected by the retail food business. The discussion in this research is about a new era in which there are supply chains, food retail business, the role of technology, marketing, distribution channels, and descriptive effectiveness. The study was conducted using qualitative descriptive methods, namely using literature or literature studies, using journals, books, magazines, and the web that are relevant to research. The conclusion in this research is the development in this era in distribution, warehousing, transportation, and services in food retailing supported by internet application-based providers including go food, grab food, etc. making it easier for retailers and consumers to transact. The development of this new era experienced many improvements in terms of delivery, cost, and time so that the more days the more effective the supply chain in the food retail industry.</jats:p>",

While the literature has introduced Industry 4.0 technologies, the reality in the food industry especially halal related product shows disparity in the contribution of scholars to real-world issue. The disparity between both literature and industry is due to information integration. The issue related to information integration can be solved through Society 5.0 where human and technology are connected through information management, monitoring, and control. Nevertheless, studies related to Society 5.0 are limited and isolated to social and technology area since the concept is still new in the literature. However, the advantages of integrating Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 are able in ensuring integrity in food supply chain especially related to halal. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose a model based on Society 5.0 to provide solution to food integrity in the supply chain. This study has undertaken extensive literature review related to Society 5.0 and integrity practices. The outcome of the paper proposed a model that links Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0 technologies to help organisation manage halal food in the supply chain with integrity as its measurements. The model proposed in this study is useful for any organisation to adopt halal supply chain and understand how to implement Industry 4.0 as well as managing information through Society 5.0.</jats:p>"

The numerical modelling (MODFLOW) has emerged as an effective tool for managing groundwater resources and predicting future responses, especially when dealing with complex aquifers systems and heterogeneous formations. MODFLOW model has been used herein as a management tool for the targeted sub- basins in Sana’a Basin such (Wadi Bani Hawat, Wadi Dhahr &amp; Al-Ghayl, Wadi Hamdan &amp; As Sabrahand Wadi Ghayman); the most important groundwater resources for domestic and agricultural sectors in Sana’a basin. A conceptual model was designed according to the actual groundwater dynamic flow system in the 2010 Hydrosult Sana’a Basin Model. Also, the governing partial parabolic differential equation was defined, including the vertical conductivity flow between the aquifers. Total groundwater abstraction values from previous studies were compiled, including the 2015 well inventory data of National Water Resources Authority –Sana’a Basin.In this study, three simulations of groundwater development scenarios were distinguished. The first scenario is applied for evaluation of the present status and till 2025. The second and thethird scenarios are focused on the effect of water augmentation i.e. decrease the present rate of groundwater abstraction to 30% and 50% respectively, with considering the highly intervention of IWRM structure of Sana’a basin on the on-going activities related to change land use, change crop pattern, value chain, marketing, modern irrigation techniques, water harvesting techniques, treated waste reuse etc…. Also other Modules were used in calculating the groundwater demand, deficit and unemployment in agricultural sector inSana’a Basin. Scenario 3 gives a remarkable improvement of the water resources system in the four sub-basins within a reasonable period (in the year 2025), thus, it will keep the water resources sustainability; but the unemployment in agricultural sector in Sana’a Basin in scenario 3 will be is the highest value if comparing with the other two scenarios. It will reachin 2025 under scenario 2 and scenario 3 to 10432 and 14762 respectively while in scenario 1 the unemployment will disappeared in 2025. This study is recommended that irrigation systems should be improved, usage of harvesting water methods and treated waste water reuse for agriculture to avoid the depletion of Sana’ Basin aquifer and to reduce unemployment in agricultural sector in Sana’a Basin.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Groundwater Flow Model, MODFLOW, Management Scenarios, Sana’a Basin, Targeted Sub-Basins.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the computer simulation model of a grid to vehicle (G2V) wireless power supply using a single-phase matrix converter (SPMC). The proposed system uses the SPMC that operates as a direct AC-AC converter to convert the supply frequency of 50 Hz to reach 20 kHz output frequency. The use of 20 kHz frequency is suitable for wireless power transfer (WPT) operation in order to obtain higher power transfer efficiency between the transmitter and the receiver parts. An advanced of the proposed circuit topology can solve the conventional system for G2V circuit topology that uses multiple stages of power conversion system, resulting in high power semiconductor losses that could lead to low efficiency. In this work, multiple stages of the conventional \"AC-DC-AC\" circuits have been reduced to a single power conversion stage by using the SPMC circuit topology. The use of the proposed circuit topology can reduce the number of devices, thus reduce the semiconductor losses. A part of reducing the semiconductor losses, the proposed circuit topology could also improve the power density and efficiency of the power supply system. A computer simulation model using MATLAB/Simulink has been developed to investigate the behavior of the proposed system. Selected simulation results are presented to verify the functionality of the proposed system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shallow geothermal energy can contribute to a regenerative supply of urban heating and cooling loads and hence, reduce primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In the city of Munich, which hosts a very productive shallow aquifer, conditions are outstanding for the thermal use of groundwater. Therefore, already more than 2800 shallow geothermal systems are installed and due to better economic incentives, numbers are rising. Thus, the future development of this already intensely used urban aquifer holds challenges to avoid conflicting uses, but also opportunities to build synergies and balance the energy budget.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, fostering a sustainable development is only possible with knowledge about the dynamic hydraulic and thermal behaviour of the groundwater and its anthropogenic and natural influences. Currently, this information is missing on a city scale as a decision basis for the responsible growth of thermal groundwater use. As a consequence, water authorities have to become increasingly restrictive when granting licenses to cope with preventive drinking water protection. Therefore, tools for the thermal management of aquifers are needed to enable resilient decision making.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The project GEO.KW (2019-2021), funded by the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, took up this challenge and develops a flexible management and optimisation tool for the thermal use of groundwater. As pilot area for an implementation, Munich offers a dynamic and well-monitored hydrogeology. The tool&amp;amp;#8217;s core element is the coupling between a thermal-hydraulic groundwater model and a linear optimisation model for distributed energy systems. This interdisciplinary approach, allows us to include the heat storage potential of the aquifer and study the coverable heating and cooling demand depending on the thermal resource at high temporal and spatial resolution. The optimisation integrates all regulatory restrictions of water resource management, like temperature or extraction limits, and comparatively analyses conventional heating and cooling systems alongside with thermal groundwater use. As cost factor in the optimisation, greenhouse gas emissions and economic cost is evaluated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The development focuses on using highly parallelised open-source codes and efficient code coupling. The numerical groundwater simulation is performed with &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;PFLOTRAN&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, a code specifically built for scalability on supercomputers. It is coupled to the linear optimiser &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;urbs &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;through the minimally invasive coupling library &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;preCICE &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;and the simulations are performed on the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;SuperMUC-NG&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; in Garching, Germany. Since the parallelisation of optimisation problems is not straightforward, a decomposition procedure is introduced to assure performance with high resolution models.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The optimisation tool and associated methods will also be applicable to other urban areas. Thus, it will offer the decision support for an optimised growth of thermal groundwater use to assure its contribution to emission-free and decarbonised heating and cooling of cities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The principle of operation of the DC power supply uses a high-precision method of controlling a pulse current stabilizer, based on the adaptation of the duty cycle of the pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal to control the inverter when the load mode changes. From the output of the inverter, the signal is converted by the rectifier into a DC signal with subsequent smoothing of the ripple and enters the load circuit. From a precision low-resistance shunt connected to the load circuit, the signal through the ADC in digital form enters the control unit (CU), implemented on the basis of FPGA, which has a embedded programme for controlling the voltage / current stabilization modes in the load circuit. In addition, the paper shows the use of a precision programmable DC power supply for solving the problem of calibrating the BTC-110S spectrometer. The block diagram of the test stand for spectrometer calibration is presented and relations for the correction of the recorded signals of the thermal radiation spectrum of the objects under study are derived.</jats:p>",

In this investigation, the proportions of Escherichia coli (E. coli) that were settleable (due to sedimentation) and those that were at the free phase have been studied. Water samples were collected from different depths in the inspected rainwater storage tank at two different periods (i.e. rainy and dry periods) for 20 days. The samples collected from these periods have been analysed for physical and microbial measures before passing it through the serial filters with pore sizes of 500 μm, 100 μm, 10 μm and 1.5 μm to measure the retained particle mass. From the results, it was observed that: (1) the water quality at the free-phase zone was better than that at the tank's bottom; (2) the settleable bacteria rapidly sank to bottom; (3) the correlation of turbidity, E. coli and total suspended solids (TSS) for all the rain events showed a relatively high Pearson's coefficient of 0.9 to one another; and (4) over 70% of settling TSS occurred within first 36 h. Finally, it has been found that the physical sedimentation process can significantly reduce the microbial measures.</jats:p>",

Land currently under other uses will require tree-plantations or reforestation to achieve this goal. This paper examines the effects of converting cropland to tree or forest cover in the Central India Highlands (CIH). The paper examines the impact of increased forest cover on groundwater infiltration and recharge, which are essential for sustainable Rabi (winter, non-monsoon) season irrigation and agricultural production. Field measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) linked to hydrological modeling estimate increased forest cover impact on the CIH hydrology. Kfs tests in 118 sites demonstrate a significant land cover effect, with forest cover having a higher Kfs of 20.2 mm h−1 than croplands (6.7 mm h−1). The spatial processes in hydrology (SPHY) model simulated forest cover from 2% to 75% and showed that each basin reacts differently, depending on the amount of agriculture under paddy. Paddy agriculture can compensate for low infiltration through increased depression storage, allowing for continuous infiltration and groundwater recharge. Expanding forest cover to 33% in the CIH would reduce groundwater recharge by 7.94 mm (−1%) when converting the average cropland and increase it by 15.38 mm (3%) if reforestation is conducted on non-paddy agriculture. Intermediate forest cover shows however shows potential for increase in net benefits.</jats:p>"

Internet of things (IoT) is one of the key components of the IT infrastructure for the development of smart supply chains that have high potential for creating sustainability in systems. Furthermore, IoT is one of the most important sources of big data generation. Big data and strategies for data analysis as a deep and powerful solution for optimizing decisions and increasing productivity are growing rapidly. For this reason, this paper attempts to examine informative supply chain development strategies by investigating the supply chain in FMCG industries as a special case and to provide a complete analytical framework for building a sustainable smart supply chain using IoT-based big data analytics. The proposed framework is based on the IoT implementation methodology, with emphasis on the use of input big data and expert reviews.

In this paper, we use the game-theoretic approach, which is quite suitable to operation decision research, to model a supply chain consisting of one supplier and one retailer and discuss who should invest in green technology in a decentralized supply chain under demand uncertainty. An important result we found is that the retailer has a stronger investment motivation and higher investment efficiency compared to the supplier. The retailer also tends to invest in green technology himself when customers are not so sensitive to the product’s retail price. We analyze the supply chain sustainability, and find that high levels of green technology investments are not always necessarily good for environmental sustainability, it depends on the environmental impact’s sensitivity to green technology. Lastly, a joint investment mechanism is designed to induce the retailer to join in the green technology investment when he has no investment intention, and that realizes a Pareto improvement of the supply chain. Based on the results, we recommend designing more incentive mechanisms to induce the retailers to join in the green technology investment according to supply chain conditions.</jats:p>"

Earlier studies have pointed out systematic differences between Sea Surface Salinity retrieved from L-band radiometric measurements and measured in situ, that depend on Sea Surface Temperature (SST). We investigate how to cope with these differences given existing physically based radiative transfer models. In order to study differences coming from seawater dielectric constant parametrization, we consider the model of Somaraju and Trumpf (2006) (ST) which is built on sound physical bases and close to a single relaxation term Debye equation. While ST model uses fewer empirically adjusted parameters than other dielectric constant models currently used in salinity retrievals, ST dielectric constants are found close to those obtained using the Meissner and Wentz (2012) (MW) model. The ST parametrization is then slightly modified in order to achieve a better fit with seawater dielectric constant inferred from SMOS data. Upgraded dielectric constant model is intermediate between KS and MW models. Systematic differences between SMOS and in situ salinity are reduced to less than +/-0.2 above 0&amp;amp;#176;C and within +/-0.05 between 7 and 28&amp;amp;#176;C. Aquarius salinity becomes closer to in situ salinity, and within +/-0.1. The order of magnitude of remaining differences is very similar to the one achieved with the Aquarius version 5 empirical adjustment of wind model SST dependency. The upgraded parametrization is recommended for use in processing the SMOS data.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The rationale for this new parametrisation, results obtained with this new parametrisation in recent SMOS reprocessings and comparisons with other parametrisations will be discussed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reference:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Boutin, J.,et al.

Four (4) wells with a depth ranging between 55m and 100m and four (4) monitoring piezometers were drilled which intercepted a pressurized aquifer underlying Pleistocene marine terrace deposits, with a thickness ranging between 20m and 75m, which act as an aquiclude.

To this end, two wells with a total flow rate of about 50 l/s were commissioned and remained active for a period of 8 months (August 2019 - March 2020). About 120 water samples were analyzed from a chemical and isotopic point of view, while the piezometric trend, the electrical conductivity and temperature were recorded by means of multiparameter probes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The results obtained showed that the increased mineralization of the aquifer follows a seasonal trend regulated by the groundwater extraction from the wells that, in some periods of the year, affects the regulated reserves.

Activities in the supply chain for broilers consist of the process of raising chicken products by breeders, then processing them into chicken meat that is ready to be marketed from breeders to consumers. The purpose of this study was to analyze the supply chain for chicken meat products and to determine the availability of chickens in the Chicken Slaughterhouse and the availability of chickens in the city of Makassar. Data collection methods are carried out by observation and interviews. Data processing with the preparation of problems in a hierarchy, Validity and Reliability Examiners, Supply chain mapping and hierarchical determination, Calculation of the actual value of each matrix, Inserting weights into the decision matrix, Calculating the normalization value . Data analysis that has been collected is then processed using the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) method. Of the 15 sub-districts in Makassar city, there are 4 sub-districts which are slaughter centers namely Tamalate (97,643), Manggala (100,762), Biringkanaya (999,554) and Tamalanrea (88,895). where 3 districts are directly adjacent to the buffer area for chicken products, namely Maros and Gowa. The potential supply of chickens to Makassar city will be even greater along with the demand for chicken meat protein. The conclusion is the supply chain channel for chicken products with 3 alternatives, starting from livestock producers, collecting traders, retailers, consumers, then the second alternative is starting from producers, collecting traders and consumers. And the third alternative is starting from the cage, basket, slaughterhouse and consumers.</jats:p>"

The paper aims to assess the potential for implementation of the crowdsourcing technology in the transport system of Bratislava. Methodology: An interview with the entrepreneurs in this area was conducted to assess the potential demand. In the survey, we collected information about type of goods; operations, quantities, and frequency of delivery; willingness to pay for one delivery among others. Based on the results, the freight demand, and its characteristics were assessed. The second part of the paper is devoted to assessing the supply of logistics to meet the demand. A survey of the willingness of ordinary travelers to work as an occasional courier was conducted. In the end, the equilibrium of demand and supply in the crowd shipping market in Bratislava is presented. The regression and correlation analysis were performed to understand the relationship between parameters of demand and delivery quantities in the first part of the research, sociodemographic characteristics of nonprofessional couriers, and the maximum weight of the parcel nonprofessional couriers agree to delivery. The willingness to pay per delivery was determined for respondents of different genders. Key findings: The results of the survey allowed us to estimate the freight demand for the Old Town of Bratislava, as well as to understand the needs of potential demand for crowd shipping services. The results of the second questionnaire show the sociodemographic characteristics of nonprofessional couriers (age, gender, gender, income, travel time) significantly influence the decision to participate in the delivery market.</jats:p>"

To co-ordinate growth adaptation under prolonged exposure to limited water or excess nitrogen supply, plants have processes for signalling and regulation of metabolic processes. There is limited information on the involvement of one of the most important post-translational modifications (PTMs), protein phosphorylation, on plant adaptation to long-term changes in resource supply.<jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic>cv. Nipponbare was grown under two regimes of nitrogen from the time of germination to final harvest. Twenty-five days after germination, water was withheld from half the pots in each nitrogen treatment and low water supply continued for an additional 26 days, while the remaining pots were well watered. Leaves from all four groups of plants were harvested after 51 days in order to test whether phosphorylation of leaf proteins responded to prior abiotic events. The dominant impact of these resources is exerted in leaves, where PTMs have been predicted to occur. Proteins were extracted and phosphopeptides were analysed by nanoLC-MS/MS analysis, coupled with label-free quantitation. Water and nitrogen regimes triggered extensive changes in phosphorylation of proteins involved in membrane transport, such as the aquaporin OsPIP2-6, a water channel protein. Our study reveals phosphorylation of several peptides belonging to proteins involved in RNA-processing and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that phosphorylation events regulate the signalling cascades that are required to optimize plant response to resource supply.</jats:p>"

It includes a flexible manufacturing process, more product delivery to customers, optimum energy consumption, and reduced waste. The manufacturing process can be made more flexible through volume agility. In this scenario, production cannot be constant, and with the concept of volume agility, production is taken as a decision variable under the effect of optimum energy consumption. Considering a two-echelon supply chain, we consider a producer and supplier with two-level-trade-credit policies (TLTCP) with the optimum consumption. To reduce the integrated total inventory cost, we believe that demand is a function of the credit period and selling price. The cost function is analyzed, either with the credit period dependent demand rate or with the selling price dependent demand rate through the numerical examples under energy costs. Energy and carbon emission costs are introduced in setup/ordering cost, holding cost, and item cost for producer and supplier. The effect of inflation on the total cost cannot be ignored; this model is being developed for deteriorating items with the simultaneous impact of volume agility, energy, carbon emission cost, and two-level-trade-credit policies with inflation. This supply chain model was solved analytically and obtained the optimum decision variables in a quasi-closed form solution. An illustrative theorem is being utilized to analyze the optimum result for all the decision parameters. The convexity of the objective function is being obtained analytically as well as graphically. Finally, numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are employed to illustrate the present study and with managerial insights.</jats:p>"

Thermoelectric refrigerators need specific criteria for assessing their energy efficiency. The existing criteria do not take into account the insulation properties of a refrigerator cabinet, which results in a low credibility of the assessment of energy parameters of thermoelectric coolers. The aim of the research was to develop and approve a new universal criterion for assessing the energy efficiency of stationary thermoelectric refrigerators used in supply chains. It was proposed to replace the known criterion of specific power consumption with a new indicator Pk, that takes into account the overall thermal transfer coefficient of the refrigerator cabinet. Based on experimental studies, the approval of the proposed indicator was carried out on the example of a comparative analysis of four thermoelectric refrigerators from different manufacturers. The indicator application resulted in changes in ranking of the examined refrigerators. It was found that the proposed criterion allows us to assess the effectiveness of a thermoelectric cold source more adequately, including the electric power supply and temperature control system. The research results may constitute guidelines for the design and application of standards for assessing the effectiveness of thermoelectric refrigerators.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines the impact of remittances on the labour market decisions of left behind adult family members in rural households in India. Using both selectivity and endogeniety corrected models, the results find evidence of a dependency effect wherein individuals belonging to remittance receiving households are less inclined to participate in the labour market. These effects are much stronger in case of international remittances. Incidentally, the reduction in work participation was found to larger for males than females. While, on the one hand, domestic remittances were observed to increase the intensity of labour supplied by households, international remittances, on the other hand, were found to be lowering hours of work done by left behind family members. Further, domestic remittances increase the proportion of labour supplied to self-employment activities in agriculture; international remittances, on the contrary, were found to be pushing workers into non-agricultural activities. The differences in the impact of domestic and international remittances on labour market participation and work intensity can be attributed to the differences in absolute size of remittances available per capita from the two alternate sources while unobservable household characteristics and locational factors can explain the variations in intra-household labour allocation across activities. </jats:p>",

It also intends to identify a set of sustainable performance indicators (environmental, economic, and social) suitable to evaluate a supply chain 4.0 (SC4.0). To attain this objective, based on the literature review, a conceptual model is proposed. The multiple case study is used with a cross-case comparison to identify the type of advanced technologies more commonly used in SC4.0, and the performance indicators more suitable for assessing a SC4.0 sustainability performance. A sample of ten case studies was considered with companies belonging to different manufacturing SCs, from different countries, and belonging to different echelons. Main findings revealed that the level of adoption of advanced technologies in the Supply Chain SCOR processes varies amongst the case studies. Some technologies are quite commonly used among the several SCOR processes and companies while others are seldom applied. Some indicators were also identified that are regarded as very or extremely suitable to evaluate the sustainability performance of a SC4.0. The main contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is the empirical insights on the SC4.0 field and on Supply Chain Sustainability performance measurement. The results provide guidelines for the selection of advanced technologies to support SC processes and for the design of sustainable SC4.0 performance measurement systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The production and transportation of chemicals is a risky process with high-cost operations for members of the supply chain, where some of the materials deteriorate over time and deal with value-reduction challenges. This paper studies a two-stage hazardous chemicals supply chain with a supplier and a manufacturer in a finite time horizon with a constant deterioration rate for both sides. To prevent potential hazards and improve product quality, the manufacturer invests in risk reduction and quality improvement technologies that can also attract more market demand. Owing to the importance of time in the storage and production of chemical products, this study focuses on a novel lead-time based discount contract to coordinate the channel members. The contract seeks to maximize the total profit of the chain by determining the optimal lead-time and manufacturer’s technology level. By doing so, the supplier provides high-quality products and the manufacturer’s unit supplying cost reduces and can buy more chemicals from the supplier. On the other hand, the supplier will have more time to supply the product and its initial cost will be reduced. As a result, the profit of both sides increases simultaneously. Some numerical examples are applied to examine the applicability of the proposed models. Finally, several sensitivity analyses on the main parameters are conducted to extract some in-depth managerial implications.</jats:p>",

The work solves the problem of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of analytical audit procedures by clustering based on spectral decomposition. The object of the research is the process of auditing the compliance of payment and supply sequences for raw materials.&#x0D;\nObjective. The aim of the work is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the audit due to the method of spectral clustering of sequences of payment and supply of raw materials while automating procedures for checking their compliance.&#x0D;\nMethod. The vectors of features are generated for the objects of the sequences of payment and supply of raw materials, which are then used in the proposed method. The created method improves the traditional spectral clustering method by automatically determining the number of clusters based on the explained and sample variance rule; automatic determination of the scale parameter based on local scaling (the rule of K-nearest neighbors is used); resistance to noise and random outliers by replacing the k-means method with a modified PAM method, i.e. replacing centroid clustering with medoid clustering. As in the traditional approach, the data can be sparse, and the clusters can have different shapes and sizes. The characteristics of evaluating the quality of spectral clustering are selected.&#x0D;\nResults. The proposed spectral clustering method was implemented in the MATLAB package. The results obtained made it possible to study the dependence of the parameter values on the quality of clustering.&#x0D;\nConclusions. The experiments carried out have confirmed the efficiency of the proposed method and allow us to recommend it for practical use in solving audit problems. Prospects for further research may lie in the creation of intelligent parallel and distributed computer systems for general and special purposes, which use the proposed method for segmentation, machine learning and pattern recognition tasks.</jats:p>"

The course design incorporates a synergy between Fink’s integrated course design model, experiential learning activities and formative assessments. The primary aim is to engage students in active learning of the course content. Therefore, all learning activities are designed according to the course learning goals, curricular and assessment requirements, prior knowledge of the students, and learning modes that are available to the students. These aspects allow educators to determine what is to be discussed in the classroom and how to facilitate active learning in-class and out-of-class. The course also leverages on the online learning space to develop both asynchronous and synchronous learning activities in order to engage student in their learning. To achieve the course learning goals, students are stimulated to participate in these learning activities and self-directed learning, in order to gain discipline specific knowledge and skills. This paper provides practical advice for course designers and programme leaders on how they can adopt an integrated course design approach in designing instructional activities for a flipped classroom setting to enhance student engagement and learning.</jats:p>"

An SC has a one‐manufacturer‐one‐retailer structure and competes against a symmetric SC. In each SC, the manufacturer decides both the production volume and the advertising efforts, while the retailer controls both the purchasing volume and the selling price. Firms within each SC can manage their business by adopting either a wholesale price contract (WPC) or a revenue‐sharing contract (RSC). In general, an SC can achieve coordination when shifting from a WPC to an RSC. Nevertheless, this is no longer true when SC competition exists. We show that an RSC is beneficial only when the rival SC uses a WPC. In fact, when both SCs adopt an RSC, the general advantages gained through coordination vanish and both SCs are operationally and economically worse off.</jats:p>",

For this aim, the Mississippi River, with three consecutive hydrometric stations, was selected as the case study. Based on the sediment and flow characteristics during the period of 2005–2008, several models were developed and tested under two scenarios (i.e. modeling based on each station's own data or the previous stations' data). Two post-processing techniques, namely Wavelet Transform (WT) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), were used for enhancing the SSD modeling capability. Also, data post-proceeding was done using Simple Linear Averaging (SLAM) and Nonlinear Kernel Extreme Learning Machine Ensemble (NKELME) methods. Obtained results indicated that the integrated models resulted in more accurate outcomes. Data processing enhanced the models' capability up to 35%. It was found that SSD modeling based on the station's own data led to better results; however, using the integrated approaches, the previous station's data could be applied successfully for the SSD modeling when a station's own data were not available.</jats:p>",

However, in some places people received little or no water at all. This was the case of Chazanga compound where some households experienced erratic water supply daily. Erratic water supply resulted in people drawing water from shallow wells which were usually contaminated. Consumption of contaminated water led to diarrhoeal diseases. This prompted for research to be conducted in Chazanga compound. The main objective was to establish the factors contributing to erratic water supply in Chazanga compound. A questionnaire was administered to 397 households. The generated data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The results revealed that the problem of erratic water supply was real in Chazanga Compound. The other factors were poor management by the water supplier, high demand due to population growth and high cost of water. Erratic water supply in Chazanga made residents resort to drawing water from shallow wells, resulting in the increase in diarrhoea cases. The study further revealed that to avert the erratic water supply, the supplier needed to repair all leaking water distribution pipes, sink more boreholes and erect a bigger water reservoir. The other recommendations were to fit bigger distribution pipes, construct more communal taps, and improve the management of water supply by the water suppliers. The purpose of this research was to have an improved supply of safe and adequate water in Chazanga compound.</jats:p>"

Data was obtained through a questionnaire survey, field observations and oral interviews. A total number of 200 questionnaires were randomly distributed to the households around the metered neighbourhood, 173 responses were retrieved for analysis. It was discovered that the waterworks only have a metering system for 3222 (0.85%) households. It charges a fixed price of ₦2000/month for those without water meters and ₦2700/month for metered households. The percentages of domestic, industrial, religious, governmental and institutional water users were 41.6%, 30.6%, 8.7%, 8.1% and 11.0% respectively and a majority of the water users agreed to be consuming between 75 – 100 litres of water per day. Considering the number of days that households get water, the study found that in a week, 16.8%, 46.8% and 36.4% of the respondents get water for, 1-2, 2-4, and 4-7days respectively. The study revealed that 9.8%, 23.1%, 48.6% and 18.5% of the respondents were 5-20%, 21-40%, 41- 60% and 61-80% satisfied with their billing methods respectively. If water is available all the days of the week, the study found the billing system to be fair. Residents are then advised to subscribe to the metering and billing systems for fair bargaining.</jats:p>",

Its importance primarily lies in the need to ensure the correct function of components and it is necessary to take into account that impurities can affect the assembly and proper functioning of other components if they are connected together in the working circuit. Requirements for technical cleanliness vary according to the type and function of components and can be divided into two basic areas - chemical cleanliness (for example, lubricant contamination) and particulate cleanliness (particles and fibres). So-called clean production must include all areas up until final assembly - production, assembly, storage, transport and the packaging itself. In process chains, measures are taken to minimise contamination or particle generation to achieve a continuous and controllable standard of cleanliness. A special section is the cleanliness of the cable connectors, which is dealt with in this article. The introduction describes the current state of science and research in this field and then summarises the standard requirements in the automotive environment and the basic possible consequences of connector contamination. This is followed by a case study showing the possibilities of preventing contamination by particles and fibres, including a discussion of the effectiveness of these measures.</jats:p>"

The theory of constraints serves as a lens to identify production and market bottlenecks for the dissemination of electric vehicles. The valuable lessons learned from EV1 failure and Better Place bankruptcy paved the way for Tesla’s operations strategy to build gigafactories which bears a resemblance to Ford T mass production last century. Specifically, EV1 relied on external suppliers to develop batteries, while Better Place was dependent on a single manufacturer to build cars uniquely compatible with its charging infrastructure, whereas Tesla established a closed-loop, green, vertically integrated supply chain consisting of batteries, electric cars and charging infrastructure to meet its customers evolving needs. The analysis unveils several limitations of the Tesla business model which can impede its worldwide expansion, such as utility grid overload and a shortage of raw material, which Tesla strives to address by innovating advanced batteries and further extending its vertically integrated supply chain to the mining industry. The study concludes by sketching fruitful possible avenues for future research.</jats:p>"

In this study, the HOR was defined using the water supply method, residential environment, and water consumption data within real blocks. The standard minimum residual pressure criteria were reviewed to quickly and rationally determine the required head for each node. To validate the proposed methodology, the HOR and required head application conditions were configured for different scenarios; the available flow rate of nodes and the water supply capacity of the entire block were evaluated based on PDA results. Through the results for each scenario, the HOR definition method was able to provide a reasonable result reflecting the actual block’s conditions, unlike the conventional orifice-type HOR, and the standard minimum residual pressure criteria as the required head was evaluated to be more efficient than the conventional time-consuming method. The HOR uncertainty and the lack of rationality in the selection of the required heads affected the reliability of PDA results; these problems can be solved using the proposed methodology.</jats:p>"

Today, considering the challenges of environmental, social, and economic sustainability, it is becoming even more vital to coordinate and co-manage company resources, activities, and innovative efforts at the SC level. Consequently, knowledge, which is a critical resource for companies, needs to be managed properly not only in single firms but also across SCs. For the education of business managers, this implies a double challenge: first, to make students and future executives become aware of the knowledge management (KM) practices that can be adopted; second, to facilitate the assimilation of these practices for the effective management of SCs, to ensure higher economic and environmentally sustainable performances. Standard definitions and classifications can be of great help, but the current studies are very fragmented. This study contributes by exploring the literature and examining the KM practices that are proposed and defined by the different authors. A systematic review and a descriptive analysis of selected papers showed the trend and focus of papers in the KM and SC fields. In addition, based on the definitions and classifications drawn from the literature, this paper discusses a possible systematization of the key KM practices in SCs. The major contribution of this paper is the effort of re-definition and re-classification of KM practices and their potential importance for effective and sustainable SC management. This analysis can be especially useful for organizing KM courses targeted to current and future business managers.</jats:p>"

In the competition model, a Stackelberg game between the manufacturer and two retailers and a Bertrand game between two retailers occur simultaneously. It is shown that the channel which attracts more consumers’ purchase preference is charged a higher wholesale price and it meanwhile declares a higher sales price. In the presence of revenue sharing, cooperation issues between the three participants are studied and the change of the revenue of each participant is analyzed when partial cooperation exists. Further, the definition of the optimum two-player coalition is proposed. We demonstrate that the channel which attracts more preference of consumers is definitely in the optimum coalition. The structure of the two-player coalition is analyzed. Finally, under revenue sharing and cost apportionments, the change of each participant’s profit is examined.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the crucial issues in Europe at the moment is securing reliable gas supply. Achieving security of gas supply implies diversifying gas sources, while having enough supply, transportation, and storage capacity to meet demand peaks and supply interruptions. In 2013, the Baltic States still remain disintegrated from the rest of Europe in one crucial way: their natural gas infrastructure isolates them into “energy islands”. The Eastern Baltic Sea European Union (EU) member states of Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are the only ones which remain isolated from the present integrated EU natural gas transmission system. The gas demand in these isolated member states is approximately ten billion cubic meters (bm3) of natural gas per year. The third energy package of EU proposes a new series of measures to promote competition and create a single European energy market. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland now for the first time have a chance to secure their energy independence by connecting their natural gas systems with those of their European allies and evolving them into market-based trading systems. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is an important energy source that contributes to energy security and diversity, therefore a concept of a regional LNG terminal has been proposed. In this paper the authors give an overview of the current situation and present possible future scenarios with the development of Eastern Baltic regional LNG terminal. 2013 is a crucial time as in September the decision will be made regarding weather the regional LNG terminal will be chosen as a project of common interest in the trans-European energy networks.</jats:p>",

Dynamically adapting the allocation strategy to the evolving epidemiological situation could thus be critical during this initial phase of vaccine rollout. We developed a data-driven mechanistic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to explore optimal vaccine prioritization strategies in China that aim at reducing COVID-19 burden measured through different metrics. We found that reactively adapting the vaccination program to the epidemiological situation (i.e., allocate vaccine to a target group before reaching full coverage of other groups with initial higher priority) can be highly beneficial as such strategies are capable to simultaneously achieve different objectives (e.g., minimizing the number of deaths and of infections). The highest priority categories are broadly consistent under different hypotheses about vaccine efficacy, differential vaccine efficacy in preventing infection vs. disease, vaccine hesitancy, and SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. Our findings also suggest that boosting the daily capacities up to 2.5 million courses (0.17% rollout speed) or higher could greatly reduce COVID-19 burden should a new wave start to unfold in China with reproduction number equal to 1.5 or lower. Finally, we estimate that a high vaccine supply in the early phase of the vaccination campaign is key to achieve large gains of strategic prioritizations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Blockchain is an emerging technology in the digitalization age which has the potential to transform the shape of various business and their related activities. Blockchain is known as the transformative technology capable of reforming the modern supply chain network by offering greater transparency in the information and physical products transformations. There are numerous benefits to implementing blockchain technology (BT) within the supply chain. However, the BT implementation in the supply chain domain is relatively low, because it depends on several factors. Hence, the primary objective of this research is to identify and investigate the critical factor in the supply chain to adopt the BT. To achieve this goal, this study identified the ten critical factors for implementing BT through the literature survey and finalized them with expert feedback. Further, an MCDM method TOPSIS is applied to prioritize these critical factors. The finding of this study shows that “develop the framework for blockchain”, “knowledge and expertise”, “communication among supply chain partners” are high priority critical factors. Therefore, this research recommends that organizations should develop the framework for blockchain and create knowledge and expertise in this domain. Further, they also maintain the effective communication SC partners as we as supply chain stakeholder for collaboration and coordination to implement the blockchain at supply chain level. This study analyses the critical factors associated with BT implementation in the context of the supply chain that will assist the managers for effective execution. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to maximize the benefits of the national economy's macro-distribution and redistribution of educational resources, it is necessary to solve the problem of the optimal and reasonable allocation in the education system. Whether it takes the form of urban and rural education regional community, compulsory education school district system, teacher community, and so on, it must be based on the distribution of high-quality resources. Educational resources are limited, and new resources cannot be wasted due to reintegration. Therefore, the government must implement macro-control, seriously conduct investigations and feasibility studies, and adopt relatively reasonable allocations to achieve a relatively balanced target for limited educational resources. The balance of educational resources is not only the core of China's higher education development, but also the key to the good development of each university in China. This article analyzes and studies the balance of higher educational resources in China from the perspective of supply side, from the extension of supply side reform in higher education, the analysis of the balance of higher educational resources, and the optimization of balance of higher education resources. Making in-depth research, this paper points out the problems in the balance reform of higher education resources in China from the supply side, and reasonably put forward the relevant approaches of equity in Education.</jats:p>",

Much research has been done on rectangular plan-form, while other plan-forms warrant attention. The present study focuses on two different plan geometries of PKW, i.e., rectangular (RPKW) and trapezoidal with angle α equal to 9 degrees (TPKW9) for their head-discharge relation in a wide channel of 0.984 m width under free-flow condition. Since the role of CFD is increasingly becoming prominent in present times, a numerical study using ANSYS-FLUENT was also carried out to ascertain its relevance in predicting flows around complex structures like PKW. Further, the tailgate was closed to render the PKW's outlet from partial to fully submerged conditions. The effect of these submerged outlets was studied for any changes in the discharging capacity of the PKW. The study shows RPKW to be more hydraulically efficient than TPKW9 for the model geometry. Further, the study finds that under partial to full submergence of PKW outlets, both PKW units' discharging capability remains unchanged.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The footwear industry has contributed notably to different countries’ economic development. Therefore, it needs to focus on operational excellence in order to achieve a sustainable level of development. Achieving sustainability in the footwear industry, however, is a complex task since various issues are involved in the footwear manufacturing process. Currently, in order to see how firms can sustain their place in the competitive global business environment, researchers and practitioners are giving special attention to operational excellence in the footwear manufacturing industry. Operational excellence is a business term that indicates the actual performance of an organization. To make the supply chain agile, resilient, and sustainable, it is imperative that firms incorporate sustainable practices in the footwear industry, and operational excellence can help in this regard. The sustainability of the footwear industry can be examined by using a set of key performance indicators (KPIs). Therefore, identifying and examining the KPIs for adopting sustainable practices in the footwear supply chain is a very important task. There is still a knowledge gap in research on the KPIs for attaining sustainability in the footwear industry. To fill in this knowledge gap, this study contributes to the existing literature by identifying and assessing the KPIs by using a novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method named the best-worst method (BWM). This study uses a previous study to identify some relevant KPIs, some of which were included in the assessment process based on footwear industry experts’ feedback. After finalizing the relevant KPIs, BWM was utilized to find the most important KPIs for adopting sustainability practices in the footwear industry’s supply chains. The findings of this study reveal that the KPIs “quality production”, “timely order processing” and “accuracy of moulding” received the first three positions in the rankings we performed. The results of this study will help practitioners, industry experts, and decision-makers to find out a pathway for easily adopting sustainability practices in the footwear supply chains.</jats:p>",

Some of the problems that occur, such as delays in the pick-up process of goods to the load that large but not enough for departure, cause the quality of the supply chain system to be poor. So this research needs to be done with the aim of knowing the point of waste in the supply chain, identifying the sigma value, and determining the priority for its improvement. Quality improvement is carried out using the Lean Six Sigma method with AHP integration as a priority selection for improvement. From the research results, it was found that there was waste that caused 3 (three) CTQ, namely delivery was delayed, goods were damaged or leaked, and there was a difference in the number of goods. The company's DPMO value is 34272 with a sigma value of 3.34. The priority for improvements that can be made based on AHP weight, namely check the package packages before they are sent (0,353), make SOP for the preparation of goods (0,167), and apply SOP for goods checking documents (0,142).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on water resource systems, affecting both water quantity and quality. Among other probable impacts on raw water, the increase of sapid compounds such as geosmin and MIB (2-methylisoborneol) is one of the most challenging for urban water supply, as it alters both water taste and odour. Water managers and water utility companies need to anticipate events that increase the concentration of sapid compounds. Proper methods and tools are necessary to design adaptation strategies for future drinking water supply. In this research we analyse the drivers of MIB and geosmin growth, and study the consequence that an increasing occurrence and intensity of sapid compounds events will have on the required water treatments. The research has been developed for a Mediterranean reservoir used for water supply to the city of Valencia, the 3&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;rd&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; largest city in Spain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The methodology applies a chain of models that integrates water quantity and quality processes in the same modelling framework. The modelling framework includes climate models, hydrological and water resource management models at the basin scale, and a reservoir management and quality models. Key environmental variables were selected using statistical analysis and expert criteria.&amp;amp;#160; Fuzzy logic systems were then applied to predict MIB and geosmin concentration under different time periods and climate change scenarios. Two representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and two-time horizons (short term 2020-2040, and mid term 2041-2070) were considered.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Results show a significant increase of MIB and geosmin under climate change, especially during spring and summer. Concentrations of MIB would steadily rise until they double, reaching peaks of up to 0.50 &amp;amp;#181;g/l by 2070 for all scenarios, while the World Health Organization maximum safe concentration is 0.01 &amp;amp;#181;g/l. Geosmin concentrations also increase in all scenarios, reaching 0.05 &amp;amp;#181;g/l by 2070. The microbiological data shows that&amp;amp;#160;benthic cyanobacteria Aphanocapsa delicatissima&amp;amp;#160;could be associated with MIB. Decreasing water storage, higher nitrate concentrations, and higher temperatures would stimulate MIB production, favoured by a likely increased of light penetration and resuspension of cyanobacteria present in the benthos of the reservoir.&amp;amp;#160;These environmental conditions appear mainly during drought events and force water treatment plants to change their processes to face the higher concentration of sapid compounds in raw water.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Acknowledgements&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This study has been supported by the European Research Area for Climate Services programme (ER4CS) under the INNOVA project (Grant Agreement 690462) and the Agencia Estatal de Investigaci&amp;amp;#243;n (PCIN-2017-066), and by the ADAPTAMED project (RTI2018-101483-B-I00), funded by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO) of Spain and with EU FEDER funds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The purpose of this paper is to provide a general understanding of the possible impacts of COVID-19 on food supply in Bangladesh. The paper presents a brief summary of the global COVID-19 situation and the current food supply status concerning COVID-19. In Bangladesh, the trend of COVID-19 cases is increasing and due to the lockdown situation, the food supply is hampering badly. Since most farmers are not adapted to mechanized agriculture and facing labour shortages, their production has fallen at risk in terms of harvesting. Due to buyer shortage and unavailability of supply channels, products are being forced to sell at a low price and it will take years to overcome this shock as the prognosis of COVID-19 is still unknown to all. Though the government has taken some policy measures to maintain a sufficient food supply, protect the agriculture sector, and mitigate the possible losses.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades, modeling approaches of ecosystem services (ES) have been used extensively at the international level, providing useful tools during the decision-making process by integrating both physical and economic information, thus improving its management. The relationship between supply and demand may impact social welfare: for example, a deficit in ES could negatively influence demand (either potential or effective). For this reason, the relational study between supply and demand is necessary for the sustainable management of natural resources; particularly since the demand for some ES must be fulfilled not only on a local scale but also globally (as in the case of regulatory ES). This paper proposes an ES analysis framework that links the flow of services (supply) generated by the interaction between natural, human and social capital with consumption (demand) connected to potential beneficiaries. Specifically, we analyze three ES: Forage production, regulation of local climate (PM10), and carbon sequestration in three national parks (Aspromonte National Park, Circeo National Park, and Appennino Tosco Emiliano National Park). The use of synthetic (biophysical) indicators, on a spatial basis, made it possible to quantify the supply and demand of specific catchments with the aim of accounting for the surplus/deficit through the calculation of the ES supply and demand ratio (ESDR). In fact, sustainable land management requires a balance between supply and demand in relation to the different needs of the stakeholders and local community. The relationship between supply and demand of ES can help identify resource use trade-offs, thus rendering the achievement of management and protection objectives more efficient. Lastly, through the use of monetary coefficients, it was possible to calculate the benefits of increasing the awareness of public decision-makers of ES’s value and the importance of implementing integrated strategies for environmental protection and enhancement.</jats:p>"

The main challenge, therefore, is to develop innovative techniques for treating this wastewater with low production costs and better efficiency. The major objective of this work was to investigate the efficiency of the coupling of the coagulation–flocculation and the anodic oxidation processes on the platinum electrode in the removal of organic, mineral, and microbial pollution contained in textile effluents. A series of experiments is carried out on samples prepared in the laboratory, in which the textile effluent was mixed with a secondary effluent from an urban wastewater treatment plant. The treatment consists of two steps: a coagulation–flocculation process using aluminum salts as a coagulant and an anodic oxidation on the platinum electrode using photovoltaic panels for the production of electric current. The treatment at optimized conditions reveals that the coupling of the two processes made it possible to achieve satisfactory results. The abatement rates were 95.97% for the turbidity, 90% for COD, 100% for BOD, 100% for , 53.6% for , and 100% for . The coupling of the two processes ensured the complete elimination of fecal germs.

The motor speed and torque variations were predicted by simulating the transient law of the three-phase induction motor by adopting the d-q axes theory. The pump model was built by solving the unsteady flow governing equations with the method of characteristics (MOC). The whole model was validated with available tests from literature. Accordingly, the computation of impeller acceleration, the motor torque, the unsteady pressure and flow rate was made for various starting conditions. The results have revealed that during its starting time, the pump hydraulic transients are well influenced by the motor speed acceleration, the flow inertia and the impeller geometry. Through the analysis of the simulation results, the conclusion was that the accuracy of the present method is reasonable, and it can be used for assisting pumping system design.</jats:p>",

Controlling for spousal education and number of children, the main findings indicate an inverse relationship between married women's labour supply and wages, contrary to the evidence from developed countries. The estimated own wage elasticity ranges from −1.70 to −2.40 and the cross elasticity ranges from −0.16 to −0.17, indicating that the impact of own wage on labour supplied is much larger than spouse's wage. The results from disaggregation classified according to different socioeconomic backgrounds also show negative elasticities between own and spouses' wage across all subgroups, except for those with university degrees and higher income.</jats:p>",

The water was analyzed for fluoride (F−), pH, electric conductivity (EC), alkalinity and hardness. The results revealed F− concentration ranges from 0.25–21.3 mg. An inverse relation between depth and fluoride concentration was observed. On the basis of cluster analysis three zones were identified. Highly toxic zone was a strip of 15 km wide and 3 km long, along Multan Road from Sunder to Phool Nagar bypass, with fluoride concentration (08–21.3 mg/L). The highly toxic zone inhabited a number of industrial units, disposing off their wastewater through soaking pits. These units contribute pollution to the shallow water, which further penetrates to the surroundings. Hence the shallow water (depth of 45–50 feet) was the most contaminated. The intensity of toxic effects decreases from highly to mild toxic zone. It was concluded that the problem was actually associated with the industrial wastewater. Therefore, to overcome the issue, measures of supplying fresh drinking water from the deep aquifer as well as treatment of industrial water is suggested.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>HIGHLIGHT</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Industry was actually responsible for fluoride toxicity in the region rather than natural sources.</jats:p>",

People are out of depression getting into substance abuse suffering a lot though Drugs has been with mankind for many centuries. In ancient times we have seen opium and cannabis in the graveyard of dead people for many centuries the use of the drug was limited on certain occasions and rituals. In modern times this problem has become acute. Millions of the people world over is suffering from this problem. Now there are two ways to deal with this, Catch as much you can and punish them which the world over and Governments are doing. Another approach is going to root cause of drug abuse and dealing with the problem. Though that seems an ideal solution it requires lots of patience and hard work though long term approach would be rewarding it needs consistent efforts in Government and Non-Government support. There have many models to deal with demand reduction approaches. This paper would discuss the legal aspect in dealing with supply control. The role of various national and international agencies dealing with this menace. Role of narcotics control bureau, local police and border guarding agencies. And demand reduction which includes various NGOs Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and Health Ministry and various other approaches. After dealing with both the approaches we can reach a mid way solution beneficial to all .at the same time post COVID 19 situation also can be understood properly.</jats:p>"

Several hydropower plants of UP Brantas have the potential to develop PV systems in the <jats:italic>Kolam Tando Harian (KTH)</jats:italic> and the tailrace area. The hydropower as the object of this study, the average needed for the hydropower electricity station service per year can be calculated by calculating the PV system with 5% - 80% of the potential area that has been determined. Due to the station service costs of hydroelectric power stations increases at 0.172 $/kWH, the development of PV systems is an alternative solution to reduce the cost of hydropower station service. Refers to the capital cost of PV &amp; energy storage issued by Lazard in 2019, it is known that the LCOE value for PV development in UP Brantas hydropower ranges between 0.11 - 0.21 $/kWH. Compared to the import energy tariff of 0.172 $/kWH, the development of this PV plant is potential and realistic to implement. This program is aligned with government and company policies in realizing the strategic goals of renewable energy development. The development of this PV plant can be integrated later into the hydropower load center using a hybrid decentralized grid-connected PV system configuration with or without battery energy storage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The problems associated with rice production in Indonesia appear very complicated, due to poor management of the sufficient national rice stock and various unfavorable public policies. Recently, government’s directives on rice importation instigated polemics from several interests, as a result of inappropriate decisions on general rice production, with possible yearly increment. Therefore, there is need to embrace strategy development to balance demand and supply. The purpose of this study was to analyze the rice supply chain in Demak and Sukoharjo, Central Java Province, in an effort to provide effective and collaborative distribution policies at individual levels. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted for 98 respondents in a bid to acquire relevant and current information for the conceptual framework development. Furthermore, sampling methodologies, termed purposive and snowballing, were applied, followed by the preparation of interview guidelines. The results showed the farmers obtained the lowest revenue margin among other tiers, while several technical challenges were also identified. Consequently, the activities of middlemen with excessive dominant roles in market price determination, were overemphasized, leading to an inefficient supply chain. Meanwhile, government’s position through the Indonesia Logistics Bureau (BULOG) is assumed to be vulnerable in the control of direct supply from farmers or collectors. Based on this study, intense comprehension of rice supply chain was achieved, with further provision of collaborative strategies towards promoting the balance of demand and supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The problem of transport management in a distributed logistics system \"suppliers – consumers\" is considered. Under the assumption of a random nature of transportation costs, an exact algorithm for solving this problem by a probabilistic criterion has been developed. This algorithm is implemented by an iterative procedure for sequential improvement of the transportation plan. The rate of convergence of a computational procedure to an exact solution depends significantly on the dimension of the problem and is unacceptably low in real problems. In this regard, an alternative method is proposed, based on reducing the original problem to solving a nontrivial problem of fractional-nonlinear programming. A method for solving this problem has been developed and substantiated. The corresponding computational algorithm reduces the fractional-nonlinear model to the quadratic one. The resulting problem is solved by known methods. Further, the original problem is supplemented by considering a situation that is important for practice, when in the conditions of a small sample of initial data there is no possibility of obtaining adequate analytical descriptions for the distribution densities of the random costs of transportation. In this case, the available volume of statistical material is sufficient only to estimate the first two moments of unknown distribution densities. For this marginal case, a minimax method for finding the transportation plan is proposed. The first step is to solve the problem of determining the worst distribution density with the given values of the first two moments. In the second step, the transportation plan is found, which is the best in this most unfavorable situation, when the distribution densities of the random cost of transportation are the worst. To find such densities, let’s use the modern mathematical apparatus of continuous linear programming</jats:p>"

Kienböck theorized that lunatomalacia resulted from traumatic disruption of blood supply and bony nutrition to the lunate. Extraosseous supply to the lunate, as far as volar or dorsal vessels are concerned, is still controversial. This study evaluated the extraosseous nutrient foramina from the dorsal and volar aspects of lunate specimens. A total of 913 specimens from the Hamann-Todd Osteological Collection in Cleveland, Ohio, were examined. The nutrient artery foramina on left and right lunate specimens were examined from dorsal and volar aspects. The number of nutrient artery foramen was tabulated. Age, sex, and race data were collected. Specimens were divided into groups according to the number of nutrient artery foramina, and the dorsal and volar foramina were compared. The average number of foramina on the dorsal aspect of the lunate (1.71) was greater than the volar aspect (1.64), except in specimens younger than 35 years. A greater number of specimens had 3 or more foramina on the dorsal side compared with the volar aspect. Based on this study, there was significant contribution of dorsal arterial vessels to the blood supply of lunate specimens older than 35 years, which contrasts with findings in earlier studies. The disruption of dorsal intercarpal and radiocarpal ligaments leading to the disruption of the dorsal arterial arches may contribute to vascular insufficiency of the lunate and should be evaluated further in the etiopathogenesis of Kienböck disease.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Tourism supply chain management has become an important research topic as individual firms no longer compete as isolated entities but rather as supply chains in the tourism industry. Despite the evidence that benefits can be gained to improve profitability, competitiveness, and customer satisfaction, the research on how to manage the tourism supply chain is very limited. This research contributes to the literature by applying the theory of constraints (TOC) with systems thinking to tourism supply chain management. It proposes that the key issue in tourism supply chain management is the coordination of business activities and the TOC with systems thinking can effectively support tourism supply chain coordination of the various links and processes. The article examines the TOC performance measures and the drum–buffer–rope model in the context of tourism management and applies the focusing process of the TOC as a continuous improvement approach for tourism supply chain management. The research findings suggest that, given modifications to the TOC terminology and the principles, the TOC principles can work as an excellent approach to facilitate the tourism supply chain management. </jats:p>",

The water demand of the growing population of Municipality is supplied by CAMWATER (Cameroon Water Utilities Corporation) and the local communities involved in potable water management. This study employed the use of a purposive systematic random sampling technique and focus group discussion among the community dwellers to evaluate the implications of potable water scarcity. A total of 350 questionnaires were administered in the field, interviews were conducted with water supply authorities and various stake holders in the municipality to identify the major problems faced by the inhabitants of Buea as a result of potable water supply challenges. Results revealed that about 27% of the population of Buea faces frequent water shortages, 32% and 41% of the respondents stated that the main causes of water supply challenges are poor management of potable water by the authorities concerned and over exploitation of water sources by the increasing population respectively. Besides the human factors mentioned above, changing climatic conditions worsen these challenges. In conclusion, over exploitation of potable water sources by the population and poor management by the authorities concerned stands as a major driver of the challenges of water scarcity in the Buea municipality. As such, we recommend an integrated water management approach as a means of making potable water supply challenges less problematic to the population of Buea.</jats:p>"

Invariably, such disruptions lead to reduced supply from the primary supplier, encouraging the supplier to place fresh orders with the backup suppliers. In order to mitigate the adverse effect of supply disruption, in this article we use the concepts underlying the well‐known Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method, used in cricket, to revise the supply target of the primary supplier and to decide a target for the backup supplier. We simulated the supply disruption scenarios in an experimental setting by conducting a two‐round questionnaire survey among 300 purchase managers. The means and variances of the participants’ estimates of probabilities of meeting the revised targets within the scheduled time for various model‐generated supply scenarios were used to find the participants’ risk preferences. In the second‐round survey, the participants, clustered in groups of 10, ranked their own risk preferences. These ranks were used to find the optimal portfolio choices. Finally, we validated the theoretical predictions for the risk options using two approaches—one, at the group level by estimating the within‐ and the between‐group risk preferences of buyers, and, two, at the aggregate level, by considering all the participants, fitting quantile regression model to the experimental results, and estimating the risk preference structures for different quantiles of the relative risk–return trade‐off distributions.</jats:p>",

Yet, decades of groundwater use beyond sustainable yield have left rural communities highly vulnerable to shortages and contamination of their drinking water supply. As state regulation begins to address these issues, a need exists to design adaptive and appropriate management systems to increase resilience of rural communities. Targeted managed aquifer recharge on agricultural land (Ag‐MAR) near rural communities is one such strategy that could potentially stabilize groundwater tables and maintain or improve groundwater quality in domestic supply wells. Here we present a geographic information system‐based multicriteria decision analysis that combines biophysical data (soils, land use, and surface water conveyance) with groundwater modeling and particle tracking to identify suitable agricultural land parcels for multibenefit groundwater recharge within well capture zones of 288 rural communities. Parcels are prioritized using a vulnerability index to change in groundwater supply, derived from well reliance and failures, pesticide applications, land subsidence, and socio‐economic data. Our analysis identifies 2,998 suitable land parcels for Ag‐MAR within the well capture zones of 149 of the 288 communities, of which 144 rely mainly on groundwater for drinking water. The majority of identified Ag‐MAR parcels serve communities ranked as having extreme or very high vulnerability to changes in groundwater supply. Our research produces new understanding of factors contributing to community vulnerability and resilience to changes in drinking water supply and can be used to discuss actions to help achieve a stable and high‐quality water supply.</jats:p>",

The main objectives of this experiment were to evaluate the effect of supplementing different sources of FA during late gestation on offspring plasma metabolite concentrations, growth, and on a glucose tolerance test (GTT) during the finishing phase. Fifty-four lambs (18 pens, 3 lambs/pen) were born from ewes supplemented during late gestation with one of three treatments: (1) no FA (NF); (2) a source of monounsaturated FA (PDS, 1.01% of Ca salts); or (3) a source of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (EDS, 1.01% of Ca salts containing). At birth (day 0), supplementation ceased, and all ewes and lambs were placed in a common pen. On day 60, lambs were weaned, grouped by sex, blocked by body weight (BW), and placed on a common finishing diet for 54 days (FP). One lamb per pen was used for the GTT after the FP. There was a tendency for FA × Sex × Day interaction (p = 0.08) on lamb growth during the finishing period, with PDS females being heavier than PDS males, while EDS males were heavier than EDS females at day 60. There was a tendency for FA × Sex interaction (p = 0.06) for plasma insulin concentration for the GTT. Plasma insulin concentration of wethers increased as FA unsaturation degree increased during the GTT; the opposite happened with the plasma insulin concentration of female lambs. In conclusion, FA supplementation during late gestation tended to modified growth and insulin response to a GTT; these changes differed with the degree of FA unsaturation of the supplement and lamb sex.</jats:p>"

We find no such responses for conventional wells. We interpret the supply pattern of shale oil wells to be consistent with the Hotelling theory of optimal extraction. Reserves are an inventory, and the decision to produce is an intertemporal choice of when to draw down below‐ground inventory.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The problem of providing the population with drinking water with guaranteed quality, safety, and physiological usefulness is highly relevant for many regions of Russia. The use of chlorination for disinfection of the water is a potential cause of the formation of excess concentrations of organochlorine compounds in it, including trihalogenomethanes, which leads to elevated levels of carcinogenic risk. The study’s object was: data on the content in water of centralized water supply systems of carcinogenic organochlorine compounds - chloroform, dichlorobromomethane and chlorodibromomethane. Material and methods. information on the incidence of the population of malignant neoplasms; the results of an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the preliminary ammonization method. The paper used methods of health risk assessment, variation statistics, and mathematical modeling. Results. The use of preliminary ammonization in Taganrog prevents the formation of trihalogenomethanes and ensures the maintenance of an individual multi-route carcinogenic risk at an acceptable level (9.933 · 10-6). Systematic unreasonable hyper chlorination of river water without prior ammoniation is the main reason for the excess content of chlororganic compounds and the high level of individual carcinogenic risk in the Primorsky rural settlement of the Neklinovsky District - up to 3.234 · 10-3 in 2015. Modeling on the basis of experimental chlorination of natural water indicates the high efficiency of preliminary ammonization in the disinfection mode, which ensures the content of free total active chlorine in tap water in the range from 0.8 to 1.2 mg/l. Conclusion. The high efficiency of the application of preliminary ammonization of natural water to prevent the formation of trihalogenomethanes and reduce carcinogenic risk has been confirmed. The priority factor for the formation of excess amounts of organochlorine compounds in drinking water is its hyper chlorination. Promising measures to reduce the carcinogenic risk of trihalogenomethanes in tap water include the systematic monitoring of their content, the use of preliminary ammonization, the exact dosage of chlorine, the deep purification of the source water before chlorination, the replacement of primary chlorination with ultraviolet disinfection, and others.</jats:p>",

Following the liberalization of parts of the energy sector, this regulation has been supplemented with new instruments to regulate monopoly areas. This form of regulation was introduced in connection with a new electricity supply regulation from 1999. The detailed design of the income-cap regulation has been left to the Minister responsible for the energy sector and the supervisory authority (currently the Danish Utility Regulator). Income-cap regulation of power grids has given rise to several challenges. Thus, the specific design of the revenue framework has been changed several times. At the same time, however, some experience has been gained with the administrative handling of this form of regulation. Several cases have, in the absence of administrative courts in Denmark, been dealt with by the Danish Energy Board of Appeals. Since the introduction of revenue frameworks, the power (electricity) sector has changed. Furthermore, the sector must adapt to the Green Transition, which will require capacity expansion at both transmission and distribution levels, or other measures must be taken to prevent bottlenecks in the system. In this paper the income-cap experience will be discussed.</jats:p>",

It also highlights the contradictory tensions that can arise between policy aspirations and business objectives and suggests that to be effective, initiatives to enhance labour standards in supply chains need to address adverse market dynamics. </jats:p>",

The solutions provided by different methods were compared in terms of the expected value of cost, variance of cost, and CPU time using Pareto-based analysis and optimality-based analysis. In Pareto-based analysis, a set of preferable solutions were presented using the Pareto front; then optimality-based optimization was chosen as the best method by using a Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method.

One of the efforts that can be done is to increase the efficiency of the procurement process by determining the model to identify important supply chains. This Model was obtained by the analysis of purchase portfolio using the Kraljics matrix. The design is based on a spare part position in the Kraljic portfolio Matrix consisting of a dimension of risk procurement and impact profit. The application of this model enables the determination of the critical company in the high lead time problem and the provider of materials/services involved.

The study adopted descriptive survey design and correlation research design. The descriptive survey design was used to describe characteristics of the population being studied whilst a correlational research was used to describe the degree to which variables under the study were related. The target population comprised 8369 people from which a sample of 382 was considered and out of which 310 responded. The sample comprised of household heads, management committee members and sub-County water officers. The research instruments for this study were: questionnaires, focus group discussion and interview schedules. Stratified proportional sampling, random sampling and census techniques were used to collect primary qualitative and quantitative data. The data was compiled, given codes and input into SPSS version 25 computer program for statistical analysis and presentation. The study findings showed that community participation in scope planning (R=0.580, p=0.00&lt;0.05, R2=0.334), activity planning (R=0.538, p=0.00&lt;0.05, R2=0.288) and resource planning (R=0.511, p=0.00&lt;0.05, R2=0.259) are significant explanatory variables with respect to project performance at 95% confidence level. Therefore, the study concluded that the community should be encouraged to actively participate more during the planning process in order to enhance the performance of their community water supply projects. In this regard, the study recommends that policies to facilitate the structured participation of the community could be enacted to guarantee participation and hence improve the performance of community water supply project.</jats:p>"

A major part of the future bioenergy mix is to be played by biomass. As many hazards have been pointed out when using forest biomass, particular attention is paid to the potential of agro biomass. However, as agro biomass is sourced mostly locally, the supply may not be sufficient to meet the growing demand. Therefore, international trade (including overseas) might become increasingly important to meet the EU renewable energy targets. In this context, it is seaports that may play a major part in developing biomass supply chains. The main purpose of the article is to fill the research gap by identifying the pros and cons for the development of biomass sea-based supply chains through secondary ports and specifying their relevance from the perspective of major stakeholders in the context of decarbonization processes. The supplementary purpose of the study was the verification of the environmental sustainability of biomass sea-based supply chains through secondary ports versus land transport (carbon footprint). This study applied the single case study method (the case of the secondary port in Szczecin). The case study strategy involved qualitative and quantitative research techniques. Our research study showed that (1) overseas agro biomass (wastes and residues) may become a significant tool in the process of decarbonization of economies that are heavily reliant on coal as a transition fuel and as a stable RES in the structure of the future energy mix; and (2) biomass sea-based supply chains may be an attractive alternative for secondary ports affected by negative outcomes of decarbonization. However, a dedicated biomass terminal would make the secondary ports more attractive for this type of cargo. A biomass terminal may provide sufficient port service efficiency and enable harmonization of deliveries. Additionally, the carbon footprint analysis performed in this study has shown that biomass sea-based supply chains generate lower CO2 emissions than alternative land deliveries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We consider a coal supply chain with a coal enterprise and a manufacturer, where the coal enterprise invests in clean coal technology, and the manufacturer invests in carbon reduction technology. The government offers subsidies for the investments of clean coal technology and carbon reduction technology. We examine optimal clean coal technology inputs in a coal enterprise and carbon reduction quantity in a manufacturer under the modes of coal-enterprise-led and manufacturer-led, respectively, using a Stackelberg game theory model. We obtain some interesting results. First, carbon reduction by the manufacturer is restrained when clean coal technology cost and carbon reduction cost are increased, regardless of the dominant modes, and clean coal technology input decreases when clean coal technology cost increases; however, a high carbon reduction cost has no effect on clean coal technology input when the manufacturer leads. Second, the clean coal technology subsidy for coal enterprises promotes clean coal technology inputs and carbon reductions, and the carbon reduction subsidy encourages carbon reduction without supporting clean coal technology input. Last, carbon reduction performance is better achieved under the manufacturer-led model than the coal-enterprise-led model. However, it should be noticed that the capital resource only relies on government subsidy in this article. In the future, this study could be used for green supply chain investment, and could be helpful for sustainability development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As the complexity of supply chains increases, the enhancement of resilience for mitigating sustainable disruption risks in supply chains is an important issue. Quality function deployment (QFD) has been successfully applied in many domains to solve multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. However, research on developing two houses of quality to connect sustainable supply chain disruption risks, resilience capacities, and resilience-enhancing features in elevator manufacturing supply chains by using the MCDM approach is lacking. This study aims to develop a framework for exploring useful decision-making by integrating the MCDM approach and QFD. By applying the framework, supply chain resilience can be improved by identifying the major sustainable risks and the key resilience to mitigate these risks. Important managerial insights and practical implications are obtained from the framework implementation in a case study of the elevator manufacturing industry. To strengthen resilience and thus mitigate key risks, the most urgent tasks are to connect the working site and the backstage to enhance product development and design and to share real-time job information. When these features are strengthened, agility, capacity, and visibility can be improved. Finally, unexpected events lead to changes in supplier delivery dates, and factors such as typhoon and lack of critical capacities/skilled employees with the greatest impact can be alleviated. This framework will provide an effective and pragmatic approach for constructing sustainable supply chain risk resilience in the elevator manufacturing industry.</jats:p>"

Herd tests, milk production, herbage and feed allocation data were collected during the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 production seasons at Dairy 1, Massey University, New Zealand. Herbage ME was determined from canopy reflectance acquired using PHS. Orthogonal polynomials were used to model lactation curves for yields of milk, fat, protein and live weights of cows. Daily dietary ME supplied per cow to the herd and ME requirements of cows were calculated using the Agricultural Food and Research Council (AFRC) energy system of 1993. A linear model including the random effects of breed and cow was used to estimate variance components for DME. Daily herd MEt estimated requirements oscillated between a fifth above or below the ME supplied throughout the production seasons. DME was mostly explained by observations made within a cow rather than between cows or breeds. Having daily estimates of individual cow requirements for MEt in addition to ME dietary supply can potentially contribute to achieving a more precise fit between supply and demand for feed in a pasture-based dairy farm by devising feeding strategies aimed at reducing DME.</jats:p>"

On the basis of the considered methods and the compiled system of management efficiency criteria, the structural and functional decomposition of the energy complex development management system at the territorial level was carried out. The mismatch of the power system control system was revealed, caused by the complication of the control system and the composition of the decision-makers. Improved models for managing the development of electricity and heat supply systems in the country’s regions are proposed, allowing to take into account modern trends in the expansion of the use of market mechanisms for managing territorial energy and to ensure a balance of interests of management entities at various organizational levels. For their implementation, organizational mechanisms have been developed that describe the interaction of territorial government bodies and territorial generating companies in the implementation of investment programs. The proposed mechanisms for managing territorial energy allow in market conditions to fully use the production potential and incentives for the development of territorial generating companies, which creates conditions for reducing management costs and implementing the goals of state energy policy.</jats:p>",

This temperature threshold is based on the reproduction characteristics of zebra mussels. However, in recent years, zebra mussels have largely given way to quagga mussels in the region. These mussels reportedly reproduce at temperatures as low as 5 °C. The objective of this study was to determine if the current 12 °C trigger point for prechlorination remains appropriate. A 3-year monitoring program using bioboxes recorded mussel veliger concentrations and settlement potential in water drawn from the intakes of three drinking water treatment plants on Lake Ontario. Water temperature was a poor predictor of veliger presence and settlement. Reproduction and settlement were observed outside of the traditional temperature thresholds. Furthermore, no relationship was found between the number of veligers in the water column and those settling, suggesting that there are complex environmental factors that influence mussel activity. Nevertheless, it was observed that settlement occurred consistently between the months of July and November in the 3 years of the study. Therefore, a calendar-based approach to trigger prechlorination, as opposed to a temperature-based approach, is suggested.</jats:p>",

The results show that the water and sediment of the lower Yellow River have a significant downward trend, and the annual sediment decreases significantly compared with the annual runoff. The annual runoff and sediment of the four hydrological stations changed around the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. The water and sediment of hydrological stations have periodic variations on multiple time-scales, but the variation scales are different. Precipitation, human activities and other factors lead to the decreasing trend of water and sediment in the lower Yellow River, and their contribution rates to the change of water and sediment are also different. Precipitation contributed 0.15%–8.71% and 0.06%–22.32% to the reduction of runoff and sediment load at the hydrological stations, while human activities contributed 91.29%–99.85% and 77.68%–102.21% to the reduction of runoff and sediment load, respectively.

Data have been collected through three independent samplings comprising a total of 558 respondents. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are used in a step-wise manner for scale development. Reliability and validity are evaluated. A nomological model is theorized and tested to evaluate nomological validity. For the first time, our study frames SCV as a novel and distinct construct. The findings show that SCV is a hierarchical and multidimensional construct, reflected in organizational structures, organizational resources, dynamic design capabilities, and operational aspects. The findings reveal that a central characteristic of SCV is the dynamic reconfiguration of SC structures in an adaptive manner to ensure survival in the long-term perspective. This research conceptualizes and provides specific, validated dimensions and item measures for SCV.

We used a questionnaire survey to analyze and map six provisioning ecosystem services (ES) focusing on ES supply, social demand and their mismatches. Using the universal soil loss equation (USLE), we mapped the rate of soil loss in the contrasting agro-ecological zones (AEZ). A participatory approach was employed to evaluate smallholder farmers' well-being in the study region. Radar diagram was used to identify the links between ES supply, social demand and smallholder farmers' well-being.\nResults\n\nThe results showed that a high supply of provisioning ecosystem goods such as cereal crops, fruits and coffee occurred in humid AEZ, while less supplies were seen in semi-arid AEZ of the study region. The ES supply was not in accordant with ES social demand and different factors such as population size and level of production are among the main factors causing ES supply-demand mismatches. Due to the undulating topography, high rate of soil loss was seen in humid AEZ. Smallholder farmers have given higher values for soil erosion control compared with individuals from semi-arid AEZ. Of all indicators of smallholder farmers well-being, income had the highest weight while receiving the least well-being satisfaction level both in humid and semi-arid AEZs.\nConclusion\n\nThe mismatches between supply and demand in provisioning ecosystem supply had strong and immediate impacts on smallholder farmers well-being. Therefore, we suggest policies that effectively control population growth, applying intensive crop production and strengthening integrated watershed management. These policies would help ES to recuperate and enhance its continuous flow and improve smallholder farmers' well-being both in the humid and semi-arid AEZ of the study region.</jats:p>"

Here, we used a larval dispersal model to explore coral larvae dispersal patterns under variable oceanographic conditions, densities of parental colonies, and taxon-specific biology of propagules. Model predictions were validated with observed settlement and recruitment data to test the robustness of larval dispersal modelling for forecasting the recovery potential of study reefs. The model was applied to the western Pacific archipelago of Palau for 3 yr before and after major typhoon disturbances, and simulations were run and validated for 2 major broadcast-spawning reef-building taxa:<jats:italic>Acropora</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Porites.</jats:italic>Investigations into the relative role of physical (currents, wind, waves) and biological (taxa, disturbance impact) parameters on overall larval supply show that low wind speeds and the intermittent occurrence of north and southwest oceanic currents contributed significantly to enhancing larval supply at the scale of the archipelago. Reduced parental colony densities on eastern reefs following disturbances did not have a major impact on predicted larval supply patterns. Relatively low larval supply to most of the disturbed eastern reefs is predicted during the most common oceanographic conditions, forecasting low recovery potential through larval recruitment. Mapping the spatio-temporal dynamics of larval supply and identifying barriers to dispersal from intact to disturbed reefs can help predict recovery patterns across reef communities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Many existing studies and models of supply chain resilience conceptualize resilience from the perspective of an equilibrium‐seeking focal firm or industry. The term “supply chain resilience” is often discussed as a dimension of firm resilience, as opposed to a standalone concept. In this context, resilience is defined according to how well a firm or industry can respond to a disruption while maintaining existing structures and processes and then “bounce back” to a pre‐disruption equilibrium or “bounce forward” to a new, presumably better, equilibrium in the shortest amount of time with the least cost. In this paper, we argue that equilibrium‐based conceptualizations of supply chain resilience can be misaligned with the notion of a supply chain as complex adaptive system (CAS) that continually adapts and transforms via autonomous actions of the different actors within the system. We offer suggestions on how practitioners and researchers can advance theory and practice by adopting a <jats:italic>CAS</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>complexity‐based</jats:italic> perspective on supply chain resilience. Specifically, we address the importance of scale and the challenges associated with mismatched scales.</jats:p>",

This method evaluates the new nitrogen input for food production in both the country of interest and the countries from which food is imported. The food N-footprints in China and Japan were 21.96 kg N capita<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> and 18.44 kg N capita<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>, respectively, which were similar to published values estimated with the N-calculator method, which evaluates nitrogen loss to the environment during production and consumption.

Some methodological differences in food N-footprint estimation methods were discussed.

This should take into account factors such as the high cost and shortage of electricity, types and nature of production, natural conditions and conditions of water disposal, capacity and features of the regime of water sources. In the early 1990s, the construction of the main water supply system, which consisted of pumping stations, pipelines, reservoirs and canals, began in rural areas of Central Yakutia in order to provide the population with drinking and technical water. This system consists of three branches of main water pipelines: 1 – Lena-Tuora Kuel-Tatta, 2 – Bedeme-Tungulu and 3 – Lena-Muru. The object of study is the main conduit Lena – the Muru. The article presents the results of the study of the main water pipeline «Lena – Muru» for 2014 – 2016 years, compiled schedules of water supply pumping stations in the reservoir, power consumption of electricity and financial costs for it.

For agricultural water supply and irrigation of land plots located above the water source, the equipment for lifting water using the energy of the water flow - a hydraulic ram - fully meets the requirements of all known means of mechanizing the water lift. The cascade hydraulic unit operates due to dispersed energy of open water flows and hydraulic impact energy. The use of a cascade hydraulic ram plant on the river will allow the water supply of individual consumers without the cost of electricity, which is absolutely safe for the environment.

This specialized technique uses Dar-Zarrouk (D-Z) parameters in the estimation of longitudinal unit conductance, transverse unit resistance, and longitudinal resistivity to examine the groundwater level, to distinguish the fresh, brackish, and saline water interface, and to assess the storage capacity of groundwater in the Triassic sandstone aquifer system in the Tataouine region (South-Eastern Tunisia). In this context, 23 vertical electrical soundings (VESs) were carried out in the Tataouine region using the Schlumberger configuration with a current electrode with a maximum spacing of the current electrodes (AB) of 500–600 m. The results indicate that the study area consists of three types of aquifers: (i) silt/clay saline water (&amp;lt;20 Ωm), (ii) a mixture of sand and clay freshwater (20–40 Ωm), and (iii) sand freshwater (40–200 Ωm). These sand freshwater aquifers are characterized by low longitudinal unit conductance (0–2.8 S), high values of transverse unit resistance (more than 9,000 Ωm2), and longitudinal resistivity (more than 35 Ωm) and are mainly concentrated in the north, south, and south-west regions of the study area. It should also be noted that the coefficient of anisotropy (λ) overlaps and does not clearly differentiate the characteristics of the aquifers of fresh, brackish, and saline water. An interpretation of VESs can also determine the storage capacity of groundwater by determining yield index values. Groundwater supply for the entire study area was classified as low yield, with a percentage of 13% and a maximum of 31% of the study area and 56% of moderate yield. Lastly, the real data from the drilling confirm all these results presented previously. The findings suggest that D-Z parameters are useful for making a distinction of various aquifer zones.</jats:p>",

An effective simulation approach is crucial to know the role of plastic mulch in a soil ecosystem, which can save water in agriculture. A field experiment was conducted at Gifu University in a rainfed soybean cultivation under plastic mulch and bare soil treatments to clarify the soil water and heat flow mechanism. Furthermore, the two-dimensional numerical software HYDRSUS-2D model with different boundaries at the soil surface was used to simulate water and heat flows. Firstly, soil hydraulic parameters were estimated by inverse solution using laboratory-measured data and then coupled soil-water and heat flows were simulated by optimizing soil thermal parameters by inverse solution. The HYDRUS-2D model simulated water and heat flow through the root zone depths satisfactorily. The root-mean square error (RMSE) was 0.015–0.030, and 0.046–0.055 cm3 cm−3 for the plastic mulch, and bare soil, respectively, in estimating soil moisture and 0.66–1.28, and 0.70–1.54 °C, respectively in estimating soil temperature. Water infiltration was 61% lower in the plastic-mulched soil, which reduced soil evaporation as well as soil-moisture storage changes compared to bare soil. This study can be applied to design and manage different plastic mulching patterns in rain-fed crop cultivation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is frequently used in semiconductor manufacturing to polish the surfaces of multiple layers in a wafer. The CMP uses a slurry that aids in fabricating a smooth surface by removing the excess materials. However, excessive use of slurry affects the environment and is expensive. Therefore, we propose a hybrid slurry supply system that combines ionization and atomization to reduce slurry consumption and improve the polishing quality. The proposed hybrid system atomizes the ionized slurry using electrolysis and a spray slurry nozzle. We compared the material removal rate (MRR) and polishing uniformity based on the slurry supply systems used in Cu and SiO2 non-patterned wafers. Additionally, the step height reduction and dishing were compared in the Cu-patterned wafers. The experimental analysis using the hybrid system confirmed a 23% and 25% improvement in the MRR and uniformity, respectively, in comparison with the conventional slurry supply system. This improvement can be attributed to the chemical activation and uniform supply of the ionized and atomized slurries, respectively. Moreover, a significant reduction was observed in dishing and pitch-size dependence. Furthermore, the proposed system prevents heat accumulation between the CMP processes, serving as a cooling system.</jats:p>"

Mathematical models of hybrid filter compensating devices based on parallel and series active filters have been developed. Based on these mathematical models, computer simulation models of the indicated hybrid structures have been developed. The results of simulation showed the effectiveness of the correction of power quality indicators in terms of reducing the level of higher harmonics of current and voltage, as well as voltage deviations. The degree of influence of filter-compensating devices on the power quality indicators, which determine the continuity and stability of the technological process at the enterprises of the mineral resource complex, have been revealed. It has been established that a hybrid filter-compensating device based on a parallel active filter can reduce the level of higher harmonics of current and voltage by more than 90 and 70 %, respectively, and based on a series active filter, it can reduce the level of higher harmonics of voltage by more than 80 %. Based on the simulation results, the possibility of compensating for the reactive power of a hybrid structure based on parallel active and passive filters has been revealed. The possibility of integrating hybrid filter-compensating devices into more complex multifunctional electrical systems for the automated improvement of the quality of electricity is substantiated, as well as the expediency and prospects of their use in combined power supply systems based on the parallel operation of centralized and autonomous sources of distributed generation.</jats:p>"

It stipulates that supply chains should strive to improve along the dimensions of agility, adaptability, and alignment, as opposed to focusing exclusively on cost and efficiency improvements. While various strategies have since been adopted across different industries to foster the Triple‐A, the digitalization movement poses both new challenges and opportunities for developing Triple‐A supply chains. In this article, we shall discuss an emerging mode of supply chain innovation, known as the consumer‐to‐manufacturer (C2M) model, and how it enables new possibilities for achieving Triple‐A “digital” supply chains. C2M establishes digital links between end consumers and upstream manufacturers and product designers, and provides a variety of tactics to shorten the information flow process of the supply chain. Our discussion focuses on the implementation of C2M at JD.com, a leading online retailer in China. </jats:p>",

The problems align with the lack of proper maintenance, ageing infrastructures, unplanned settlements, rapid population growth, inefficient communication plans, rapid urbanization and failure of roads infrastructure. Such measures as systematic maintenance coupled with functional critical assets replacement plans, increasing system interconnectedness, ensuring availability of alternative facilities and additional capacities for critical components and clear and functional communication plans with a Public–Private Partnership (PPP) approach will assist in enhancing the system’s capacity to survive disasters.

Considerable attention is paid in the paper to the diagnostics of the technical state of order of the sub-system which must be performed in scheduled car maintenance intervals in accordance with the developed method and algorithm. The deviation of the fuel pressure in the fuel rail from the setpoint in the electronic control unit was taken as the diagnostic parameter for the evaluation of the technical condition of the subsystem. Using Microsoft Excel, an analytical equation was selected that describes the dependency of the diagnostic parameter deviation versus the running time of the vehicle allowing for the substantiation of its rated values.

The question arises, however, whether these comprehensively discussed topics in literature, ie rigour, have a direct impact on the concerns and topics discussed by the purchasing practice, ie relevance. This paper is based on a previous study conducted by the authors that consolidates current scientific discussions on purchasing trends and provides a first indication on how they support current problem sets of the purchasing practice. The topics identified include traditionally established ones, such as new product involvement of suppliers and green supply management, as well as initial publications on customer-centricity and creative methods.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Water Quality Index (WQI) is a unique and effective rating technique for assessing the quality of water. Nevertheless, most of the indices are not applicable to all water types as these are dependent on core physico-chemical water parameters that can make them biased and sensitive towards specific attributes including: (i) time, location and frequency for data sampling; (ii) number, variety and weights allocation of parameters. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate these indices to eliminate uncertainties that make them unpredictable and which may lead to manipulation of the water quality classes. The present study calculated five WQIs for two temporal periods: (i) June to December 2019 obtained in real time (using the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes) at inlet and outlet streams of Rawal Dam; (ii) 2012–2019 obtained from the Rawal Dam Water Filtration Plant, collected through GIS-based grab sampling. The computed WQIs categorized the collected datasets as ‘Very Poor’, primarily owing to the uneven distribution of the water samples that has led to class imbalance in the data. Additionally, this study investigates the classification of water quality using machine learning algorithms namely: Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LogR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Naive Bayes (NB); based on the parameters including: pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, fecal coliform and temperature. The classification results showed that the DT algorithm outperformed other models with a classification accuracy of 99%. Although WQI is a popular method used to assess the water quality, there is a need to address the uncertainties and biases introduced by the limitations of data acquisition (such as specific location/area, type and number of parameters or water type) leading to class imbalance. This can be achieved by developing a more refined index that considers various other factors such as topographical and hydrological parameters with spatial temporal variations combined machine learning techniques to effectively contribute in estimation of water quality for all regions.</jats:p>",

In a previous study, researchers proposed an empirical equation to compute the discharge coefficient of a triangular plan form weir. The prediction error on the discharge coefficient was ±7% from the line of agreement. In the present study, an ANN model has been utilized to train randomly selected 70% data, with 15% tested and validation made for the remaining 15% data. The model predicts the discharge coefficient with a prediction error in the range of ±2.5% from the line of agreement, thereby decreasing the prediction error in Cd by 64%. Also, the sensitivity analysis of the developed ANN model has been performed for all the parameters (weir height, skew weir length and flow depth) involved in the study and the weir height was found to be the most sensitive parameter. Furthermore, the linked ANN–optimization model has been developed to find the optimal values of design parameters of a triangular plan form weir for maximum discharge.</jats:p>",

Waste from wood processing is still one of the cheapest energy sources. Therefore Russia is actively developing and introducing technologies for processing waste from the forest industry. The technology for producing fuel pellets and briquettes is widespread. One of the operations of this technology is the preliminary grinding of the feedstock. Nowadays, traditional hammer mills are used for this, which are used in the feed industry. As a result of the analysis of the designs of such crushers, it was revealed that when grinding materials with a low specific gravity, their potential is not fully utilized. A hypothesis has been put forward that an increase in the productivity of hammer crushers when grinding materials with a low specific gravity is possible due to a change in the conditions for introducing raw materials. To test this hypothesis, a crusher with two feed necks and a vortex chamber was developed. Research has been carried out to study the influence of the conditions for entering the shredded material into the crushing chamber. The performance of the crusher is determined with three ways of feeding the shredded material.</jats:p>",

The Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm is a sampling algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method proposed in recent years. The algorithm satisfies ergodicity and is good at handling problems with multivariate nonlinearity, high dimensionality, and multi-peaks, and as such the algorithm is a new global optimization solution. This paper elaborated the solution mechanism of the standard DREAM algorithm, and the algorithm was applied to the optimal operation model of the reservoir group in Jialing River. First, we optimized and analyzed the multi-objective supply operation model of the reservoir group water in Jialing River. Then the multi-attribute decision-making and evaluation index system of water supply operation rules for the reservoir group to assess the optimization of the operation model was adopted. Finally based on the results of the evaluation, the best water supply operation scheme for the reservoir group of Jialing River was selected. The results show that the Baozhusi Reservoir can fully meet the planned water supply requirements in dry years, while the two reservoirs, Shengzhong and Tingzikou, need to be weighed against the evaluation indexes of water supply operation. The research provides a theoretical basis for the DREAM algorithm in the optimal operation of the reservoir group and the actual operation scheme for the reservoir group of Jialing River.</jats:p>",

The developed design of the engine does not have a displacer rod, which provides better sealing and reduces mechanical friction losses. Synchronization of the piston and the displacer movement is ensured by the permanent magnets interaction. The analysis of the results of computer simulation of the PV diagram with an increased diameter of the displacer in relation to the piston diameter plays a positive role in increasing the efficiency and power of the engine. Increasing the diameter of the displacer also leads to increasing the area of the PV diagram and its approach to the ideal thermal Stirling cycle. The simulation results show that increasing the diameter of the displacer above 17/1 does not lead to increasing the area of the PV diagram, and with a larger ratio, on the contrary, it reduces the parameters of the engine efficiency. Further increasing the diameter of the displacer is not advisable in terms of technical and economic ratios. The proposed engine with external heat supply is capable of converting heat from geothermal or industrial wastewater, as well as heated water using a solar collector.</jats:p>",

Specifically, considering the demand uncertainty as one of the main challenges faced by pharmacies, we analyze how applying contracts to coordinate the inventory policy of a pharmacy with that of its supplier can affect their profits and the CSL offered to society. Having shown the advantages of the centralization compared to the decentralization, we design a coordination scheme based on the quantity discount contract to encourage the players move towards centralization. Under the proposed scheme, we first obtain the minimum and maximum acceptable amounts of discount from each actor’s viewpoint. Then, we propose a benefit-sharing strategy in order to make the plan interesting to both sides. The proposed discount contract and benefit-sharing strategy distribute the extra profits equitably between the two participants according to their bargaining power, which can make a win–win condition for two actors. Our results suggest that coordinating review period and order-up-to-level of the retailer and replenishment multiplier of the supplier will be of benefit in terms of both economic profitability and social responsibility.</jats:p>",

To evaluate directly the variation of nitrogen transport due to fluctuations in groundwater depth, the prediction model of groundwater depth and nitrogen transport were combined and applied by least squares support vector machine and Hydrus-1D in the western irrigation area of Jilin in China. The calibration and testing results showed the prediction models were reliable. Considering different groundwater depth, the concentration of nitrogen was affected significantly with a groundwater depth of 3.42–1.71 m, while it was not affected with groundwater depth of 5.48–6.47 m. The total leaching loss of nitrogen gradually increased with the continuous decrease of groundwater depth. Furthermore, the limited groundwater depth of 1.7 m was found to reduce the risk of nitrogen pollution. This paper systematically analyzes the relationship between groundwater depth and nitrogen transport to form appropriate agriculture strategies.</jats:p>",

The medicine supply chain is a part of the health system that if not properly addressed, the concept of health in that community is unlikely to experience significant growth. To fill gaps and available challenging in the medicine supply chain network (MSCN), in the present paper, efforts have been made to propose a location-production-distribution-transportation-inventory holding problem for a multi-echelon multi-product multi-period bi-objective MSCN network under production technology policy. To design the network, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model capable of minimizing the total costs of the network and the total time the transportation is developed. As the developed model was NP-hard, several meta-heuristic algorithms are used and two heuristic algorithms, namely, Improved Ant Colony Optimization (IACO) and Improved Harmony Search (IHS) algorithms are developed to solve the MSCN model in different problems. Then, some experiments were designed and solved by an optimization solver called GAMS (CPLEX) and the presented algorithms to validate the model and effectiveness of the presented algorithms. Comparison of the provided results by the presented algorithms and the exact solution is indicative of the high-quality efficiency and performance of the proposed algorithm to find a near-optimal solution within reasonable computational time. Hence, the results are compared with commercial solvers (GAMS) with the suggested algorithms in the small-sized problems and then the results of the proposed meta-heuristic algorithms with the heuristic methods are compared with each other in the large-sized problems. To tune and control the parameters of the proposed algorithms, the Taguchi method is utilized. To validate the proposed algorithms and the MSCN model, assessment metrics are used and a few sensitivity analyses are stated, respectively. The results demonstrate the high quality of the proposed IACO algorithm.</jats:p>",

An experimental network solar power plant has been developed and tested, which makes it possible to assess the possibility of using this type of power plant in rural areas of the central Chernozem region, in a private courtyard. The calculation of the characteristics and the selection of brands of the main components used in the installation of the station, including an induction meter of electric energy, were made. The authors analyzed the consumption of electrical energy from a centralized electrical network without using a solar power plant and during its operation according to the readings of an electric meter. On the basis of the analysis carried out, conclusions were drawn about the reduction of electricity consumption from the centralized network during the operation of a network solar power plant. The operating modes of the electricity meter generated by the solar power plant, the consumption of electricity from the centralized network and the load of the consumer of electrical energy are described mathematically. The relationship between the direction of the current flowing through the counter, the magnetic fluxes induced on the counter disk and the direction of rotation of the disk is described on the basis of mathematical relationships. The authors draw conclusions about the possibility of using induction meters of electrical energy in parallel operation of solar power plants with a centralized network as devices for offsetting consumed and supplied electricity to the network.</jats:p>",

However, preferences for proximity likely represent inability to access schools farther away from home, especially for disadvantaged students. I test whether distance and district boundaries constrain access to high-performing and effective schools for Detroit students where families choose between intradistrict, interdistrict, and charter schools, as well as an assigned school. I employ a unique data set that includes enrollment records, addresses, and commute times for Detroit residents regardless of where they attend school. Results show that disadvantaged students have little access to the highest quality schools available, specifically those outside Detroit.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Technological advances result in new traceability configurations that, however, cannot always secure transparency and food safety. Even in cases where a system guarantees transparency, the actual consumer involvement and a real consumer-based perspective cannot always be ensured. The importance of such consumer centricity is vital, since it is strongly associated with effective supply chains that properly fulfil their end-users’ needs and requests. Thus, the objective of this paper was to explore the level of consumer centricity in food supply chains under a traceability system. The methodological approach employed a framework of two studies validating subsequently a similar set of variables, using initially consumers data and then supply chain actors data. The supply chain of sustainable tomato was selected to design the studies. The level of agreement between datasets suggested the level of the supply chain consumer centricity. Findings showed health, trust, quality, nutrition, and safety-related values to be significant for the consumers towards accepting a traceability system. The supply chain actors also accepted a traceability system based on the fact that their customers’ needs rely on the exact same beliefs, indicating a high level of consumer centricity. The current work underlines the magnitude of consumer centricity in food supply chains and provides an easy and straightforward framework for its exploration. Key implications suggest the design of more effective supply chain and consumer-based strategies for the food industry. Policymakers could also adopt the concept of consumer centricity to further improve the food industry.</jats:p>"

This study developed a new approach for calculation of suspended sediment load (SSL) using historical flow discharge data and SSL data of the Idanak hydrometric station on the Marun River (in the southwest of Iran) from 1968 to 2014. This approach derived sediment rating relation by observed data and determined trend of flow discharge time series data by Mann-Kendall nonparametric trend (MK) test and Theil-Sen approach (TSA). Then, the SSL was calculated for a future period based on forecasted flow discharge data by TSA. Also, one hundred annual and monthly flow discharge time series data (for the duration of 40 years) were generated by the Markov chain and the Monte Carlo (MC) methods and it calculated 90% of total prediction uncertainty bounds for flow discharge time series data by Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) on Monte Carlo (MC). It is observed that flow discharge and SSL will increase in summer and will reduce in spring. Also, the annual amount of SSL will reduce from 2,811.15 ton/day to 1,341.25 and 962.05 ton/day in the near and far future, respectively.</jats:p>",

The study utilizes the cross‐sectional data of 341 rural households of the Punjab, Pakistan through random sampling technique. In Pakistan, like other developing countries, gender‐based wage data are almost nonexistent, and functioning of labor market is imperfect. Therefore, reservation wages are calculated through production function analysis. Our results reveal that literacy rate, social status, and rural infrastructure are key determinants in the rural labor market. Hypothesis of separability in agricultural household models is tested by applying three tests. Separability hypothesis is rejected on the bases of results indicating the presence of imperfect labor market in rural settings of Pakistan. The findings suggest that policy makers should focus on educational opportunities, infrastructure development, and minimizing entry barriers in labor market, especially for females, regarded as socially backward class in order to raise economic conditions of rural dwellers in Pakistan.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Generating economies of scale is one of the most desirable goals when developing modular product systems. Since complex products are commonly developed in collaboration between an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and its suppliers, pursuing this goal inherently establishes interdependencies between the development process, supplier integration and supply chain design. To fully reap the benefits of modular product systems requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses these fields and addresses the inter-dependencies between them via a coherent collaboration between development and purchasing. This is the main focus of this work. In this paper, we first describe how the product development process has to be restructured for the concerted development of modules and overall products within the scope of a modular product system. Secondly, we propose a new collaboration model between the OEM and its suppliers, since OEMs need to collaborate directly with suppliers of lower levels of the value chain in order to facilitate the standardisation of components and modules across different products. Finally, we delineate an awarding process for both development services and production volumes for series supply that resolves the conflicting priorities of economies of scale and avoiding over-dependence on single suppliers. The process models described in this paper have been conceived based on systems engineering principles and have been successfully tested and further refined throughout several industrial projects carried out with two automotive manufacturers. The resulting approach will be demonstrated using a generic example taken from the automotive industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT With the rapid development of public health construction, the supply of public sports services and the demand of residents at this stage are gradually divergent. In order to solve the contradiction between the supply and demand of public sports services, this study, from the perspective of public health, combined with the current situation of demand for public sports services, used the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to build the supply-side optimization model of public sports services, and to verify it. The results show that the weight of the model optimization index from high to low is service level &gt; resource conditions &gt; public degree &gt; service content &gt; location and type of facilities; the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation result of the model is 85 points, which shows that the index of the optimization model has good applicability. The supply-side optimization model constructed in this study is evaluated by community residents and experts in related fields, so the evaluation results are closer to the residents' demand and have high practical value. The results of this study have reference significance for the supply-side reform of public sports services, and fundamentally ensure the close relationship between the supply-side reform measures and the actual demand of residents.</jats:p>"

It is a global public health problem with no cure; therefore, it is highly important to study and understand the intricate phenomena of HIV. In this article, we focus on the numerical study of the path-tracking damped oscillatory behavior of a model for the HIV infection of CD4+ T-cells. We formulate fractional dynamics of HIV with a source term for the supply of new CD4+ T-cells depending on the viral load via the Caputo–Fabrizio derivative. In the formulation of fractional HIV dynamics, we replaced the constant source term for the supply of new CD4+ T-cells from the thymus with a variable source term depending on the concentration of the viral load, and introduced a term that describes the incidence of the HIV infection of CD4+ T-cells. We present a novel numerical scheme for fractional view analysis of the proposed model to highlight the solution pathway of HIV. We inspect the periodic and chaotic behavior of HIV for the given values of input factors using numerical simulations.</jats:p>"

We study the model for deteriorating items where the deterioration occurs at different rates in the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s level considering a fixed lifetime of the product. Discussing the six possible cases of credit policy analytically, we analyze the behavior of the model under an integrated system concerning production lot-size, quality effort and promotional effort such that the integrated average profit is maximum. To obtain the optimal solutions of the model, we design an operative solution algorithm. A numerical example is provided to test feasibility of the model, and the effect of the variation of the key parameters is also studied. The outcomes of this proposed model show that the manufacturer and the retailer have to be more careful about their offered credit periods in aspect of the profit. It is observed that the integrated profit is maximum when both credit periods provided by the manufacturer and the retailer belong to the manufacturer’s cycle. Moreover, we identify that the extended product lifetime does not meet with higher profit all times. This study directs that quality effort and promotional effort stimulate the market demand while it is not always economically profitable for the supply chain.</jats:p>",

The authors used mathematical methods and algorithms based on the application of limiting regime equations. Transitional processes were analysed for various points in the space of controlled mode parameters according to the simulation modelling in Matlab using the Simulink and SimPowerSystems packages. On the basis of the obtained results, an effective technique for analysing stability margins in electrical networks with distributed generation units was implemented. This method is applicable in design problems, as well as in operational and emergency control. The conducted theoretical analysis and computer modelling showed the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for calculating stability margins; the nondegeneracy of the Jacobi matrix of limiting regime equations at the solution point ensures the guaranteed reliability of the results. It was shown that an alternative approach to solving the problem of timely determination of aperiodic stability margins can be implemented on the basis of limiting regime equation with increased nonlinearity. Dynamic modelling of an electrical network with distributed generation units confirmed the correctness of determining the stability margins calculated using limiting regime equations. The developed technique can be recommended for practical use in the design of power supply systems or in operational control of synchronous generators. In particular, the presented methodology can be used to implement a multi-agent emergency control system for distributed generation installations located in generalpurpose distribution electrical networks. </jats:p>"

Using the Stackelberg model, we derive the optimal strategies on the insured level, production and wholesale price. The result shows that farmers with low risk aversion tend not to be insured, while those with high risk aversion tend to insure. Further analysis indicates that, as the degree of the farmer’s risk aversion increases, the farm size decreases, but the yield per unit area and the wholesale price of the agricultural product increases. In addition, yield insurance and premium subsidies can lead to a decrease of the yield per unit area. However, the expansion of the farm size can compensate for the inhibitory effect of the decrease of yield per unit area on the total yield, and thus the total yield increases. We also find that when the premium subsidy rate is low, the yield insurance’s value to farmers is negative. Moreover, the yield insurance’s value to farmers increases with respect to the bank’s interest rate.</jats:p>",

The emerging packaging technology trends and the participation of foreign direct investment (FDI) companies have led to fierce competition between all packaging enterprises in Vietnam. This paper aims to calculate the productivity performance of 10 packaging companies in Vietnam from the past to the future by combining the additive Holt-Winters (LTS(A,A,A)) model to predict key variables in the financial statement for the next 4 years (2020–2023) and an epsilon-based measure of efficiency (EBM) model of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to define the developing trend, efficiency, and ranking of packaging operations. The empirical results will assist packaging enterprises to identify their positions, suggest feasible solutions to overcome shortcomings and catch up with the global trends, and propose superior partnerships for manufacturers, which have packaging service demands and support investment decisions for investors. Overall, all the enterprises in the packaging industry have high productivity. In particular, SIVICO JSC is identified as the most efficient packaging company in Vietnam, as it continuously maintains the first ranking over the observation time, followed by Agriculture Printing &amp; Packing JSC and Bien Hoa Packaging Company. In the past, Tan Dai Hung Plastic JSC was identified as the most unproductive unit, while in the future term, the inefficient decision-making units (DMUs) are Tan Tien Plastic Packaging JSC, Sai Gon Packaging JSC, Dong A JSC, and PetroVietnam Packaging JSC. The suggestion for incompetent enterprises is changing the value of inputs proportionally to optimize for better performance.</jats:p>"

The methodological approach was based on the top-down mass flow analysis at all steps of the FSC for the 2007–2017 period (most recently available data), including different food commodity groups (CGs), such as cereals, roots and tubers, oil seeds and pulses, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish and seafood, and milk. Results show an annual average of FLW of 12.8 million tonnes, which represents 47.76% of the national food supply. Regarding per capita quantities, the average amount of FLW was 426.56 kg per year when considering the entire FSC, and 67.34 kg per year when considering only the consumption step. This study suggests which steps of the FSC and CGs are the most promising targets for FLW reduction strategies in Peru.</jats:p>"

The imperfection of the systems of collecting, processing, and systematization of financial information does not allow to fully use the above methods and techniques, as well as to formulate objective conclusions.\nBased on the systematization of evaluation methods, the indicators of the level of business reputation (reputation indices) of the surveyed enterprises are calculated and interpreted.\nIt is proved that the system of information-analytical support allows to form the general list of strategies of the enterprise taking into account its features – adaptation to the environment or formation of influence on it. A system of management decisions is proposed, which contains two blocks. The information-analytical block identifies the main subjects of interaction for each parameter of business reputation, identifies the available labor and financial resources to implement measures to improve business reputation. If these conditions are met, the implemented measures are implemented, if not – there is a return to the initial stage. Next, the effectiveness of the proposed measures is analyzed. If measures to improve business reputation have achieved their goal, those responsible for their implementation are selected. The implementation of measures to increase the level of business reputation of water supply and sewerage companies is also constantly monitored. If the selected measures are not effective enough or not effective at all, they direct the adjustment by changing the input data. Then the whole process is repeated again, starting from the first stage, but taking into account the adjustments. The second block contains the overall effect of the implementation of the measures proposed in the first block for certain groups of stakeholders.\nIt is proved that taking into account the specifics of the water supply and sewerage companies, it should be noted that increasing the area of reputable radar will not lead to an immediate increase in profitability. However, the management of business reputation will achieve some stabilization through the formation of trusting and mutually beneficial relationships with stakeholder groups. Flexibility of interaction and feedback contribute to the achievement of the company's strategy. As a result of the study, a strategic monitoring of the business reputation of water supply and sewerage companies is proposed, the implementation of which will increase the importance of services provided, attract more qualified employees of all levels, – private partnerships, plan payments, effectively manage accounts payable and increase resilience to adverse impacts and crises.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper aims to design a supply chain network for producing double glazed glass from the recycling of waste glass. All three pillars of sustainability are taken into consideration. The economic objective tries to maximize total profits. The environmental objective considers the energy consumption, the generated waste, the greenhouse gas emission, the water consumption, and the fuel consumption of vehicles. The social objective addresses created job opportunities, the worker safety, the regional development, the worker benefit, and training hours. To solve the model, a two-stage framework based on the group best-worst method and an interactive fuzzy programming approach is developed. The proposed model is validated through a real case study based on waste glass management in the city of Shiraz. It is revealed that when sustainable development goals are approached, a great degree of improvement will be attained in environmental and social aspects without a significant decrease in the economic sustainability. The results also demonstrate that the locations of glass recycling centres are different under economic, environmental, and social pillars, and the proposed model yields an optimal system configuration with a proper satisfaction degree of all objectives. Moreover, applying the proposed solution procedure enables system designers to obtain the most desirable trade-off between different aspects of sustainability. </jats:p>",

Knowing how to use the valuable resource water consciously and sustainably requires well-informed and ecologically aware citizens. Environmental education approaches should help develop long-term environmental knowledge, pro-environmental attitudes, and behavior with the overall goal of promoting environmental citizenship. The present study, thus, examines the influence of environmental values on students’ environmental knowledge in a German primary school sample (9–10-year-old students) by providing an authentic, out-of-school learning experience on the topic of fresh water supply. Our approach goes beyond mere correlation analyses by using structural equation modeling (SEM) to measure effects between the two variables. Environmental values were monitored using the Two Major Environmental Values Model (2-MEV) with its two dimensions, Preservation and Utilization of nature. Following a quasi-experimental design, we assessed the learners’ knowledge before (T0), directly after (T1), and six weeks after (T2) module participation. Confirmatory factor analysis verified the two-factor-structure of the 2-MEV. Preservation turned out as a direct positive predictor of pre-knowledge (T0) but did not show any significant effect on post-knowledge (T1) and knowledge retention (T2). Utilization displayed a larger albeit negative direct effect on knowledge across all testing times, especially for pre- and post-knowledge. Our findings shed light on the significant impact of anthropocentric attitudes on knowledge acquisition within primary school samples and provided valuable insights into feasible environmental learning approaches.</jats:p>"

In this simple framework, we show that altruism always guarantee a positive resource level at the steady state. However, studying the dynamics, we point out that the stability of the steady state crucially depends upon both altruism and forestry productivity: under low forestry productivity the steady state is always stable, while under high forestry productivity two period cycles (flip bifurcation) can emerge near the steady state if and only if altruism is sufficiently high which raises the question of resource preservation and leads to the conclusion that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</jats:p>",

При проведении процесса редуцирования паровой фазы пропан-бутана в регуляторах давления надземных шкафных газорегуляторных пунктов наблюдается выпадение конденсата, а при минусовых температурах - образование льда и кристаллогидратов. Для предотвращения указанного явления применяются методы в виде нанесения тепловой изоляции и обогрева внутреннего пространства шкафа, что значительно увеличивает стоимость конструкции и процесса редуцирования. В качестве альтернативы авторами предложена подземная камера редуцирования. В статье приводится научное обоснование применения подземной камеры в практике газоснабжения потребителей. Результаты. Обоснована конфигурация камеры редуцирования. Проведено математическое моделирование теплообменных процессов камеры с окружающим грунтовым массивом. Подобрана толщина тепловой изоляции восходящего участка паровой фазы и камеры редуцирования. Сделано моделирование процесса редуцирования паровой фазы в регуляторах давления. Выводы.

When reducing the vapor phase of propane-butane in the pressure regulators of the above-ground closet gas control points, water falls out in free form and at subzero temperatures of ice and crystalline hydrates formation. In order to prevent this phenomenon, methods are employed in the form of applying thermal insulation and heating the inner space of the cabinet, which significantly increases the cost of the structure and the reduction process. As an alternative, the authors set forth an underground reduction chamber. The article provides a scientific rationale for the use of this underground chamber in the practice of gas supply to consumers. Results. The configuration of the reduction chamber has been substantiated, mathematical modeling of the heat exchange processes of the chamber with the surrounding soil massif has been performed, the thickness of the thermal insulation of the ascending section of the vapor phase and the reduction chamber has been selected, and the process of reduction of the vapor phase in pressure regulators has been simulated. Conclusions. According to the results of the studies, the cylindrical shape is optimal for the reduction chamber, which provides the minimum total surface of the enclosing structures. The implementation of the economic and mathematical model made it possible to recommend the optimal thicknesses of the thermal insulation of the chamber and the ascending section of the vapor phase, enabling the process of throttling of the liquefied petroleum gas vapor phase in pressure regulators without the release of free water and the formation of ice and hydrate plugs.</jats:p>",

Butane-and-air mixture is fully adaptable to natural gas, tak-ing into account the requirements for the interchangeability of combustible gases. However, we need to solve the problems of determining the mixture composition and developing a scheme for mixing butane with air taking into account the physical and chemical properties of butane that govern its operating at low inlet pressures providing a constant supply of source gas for mixing from an underground tank regardless of the climatic features in the region. De-veloping well-founded recommendations to obtain a mixture of butane with air will ensure the widespread introduction of such systems into the gas supply practice and enhance the uninter-rupted operation of gas supply systems when using alternative combustible gases. On the basis of our research, we suggested a scheme for producing a mixture of butane with air using a dosing valve to ensure a constant supply of butane from an underground tank with alternating extraction of vapor and liquid gas phases and feeding the gas phase for mixing at the recommended pressure.

The high penetration level of photovoltaic units increases their injected fault current that may result in a lack of coordination of fuse reclosers in distribution networks. One of the main protection devices that is generally used in rural distribution networks is the fuse. A correct size selection is key for ensuring good operation and coordination with other protection devices. The DG implementation makes the selection above more difficult, as the current flow both in steady state and in case of short-circuit is subject to alterations. A new protection fuse selection method for distribution networks with implemented DG is proposed in this paper with the aim of ensuring an effective coordination between them, avoiding untimely behaviors. Different case studies have been analyzed (for diverse locations of DG in the network with various penetration levels which represent 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the total installed load), using an IEEE 13-node test feeder. Besides, a new model to analyze fuse performance is proposed in this work. This model has proven to fit the manufacturer’s data well, with a maximum error of 2% within the normal trip current values.</jats:p>"

The marketing of three different energy-flexibility measures—bivalence, inherent energy storage and adjusting process parameters—both at the spot market and at the balancing power market, are investigated from a technical as well as an economic point of view. Furthermore, the simulation-based methodology also considers pressure and temperature fluctuation induced by energy-flexibility measures. First, different energy-flexibility measures for industrial steam supply systems are introduced. Then, the physical modeling of the steam generation, distribution, and consumption as well as measure-specific control strategies will be discussed. Finally, the methodology is applied to a steam supply system of a chemical company. It is shown that the investigated industrial steam supply system shows energy-flexibility potentials up to 10 MW at peak and an annual average of 5.6 MW, which highly depend on consumer behavior and flexibility requirements.</jats:p>"

Recently, however, more and more attention is paid to environmental protection issues. The aim of the research is to substantiate the methodology for choosing sources of energy supply to agricultural consumers in distributed energy systems. For a comprehensive assessment of the environmental friendliness of energy production, we have proposed an energy environmental friendliness factor. The coefficient simultaneously characterizes the cost of energy production and the amount of generated environmental pollutants. This value turned out to be convenient for comparing a number of production technologies.</jats:p>",

First, the numerical simulation of the flow field in the nozzle chamber was conducted using FLUENT software to analyze and compare the impact of the curve parameters and Reynolds number on the cleaning effect. Next, the flow field was captured by a high-speed camera in order to study the cavitation cycle and evolution process. Then, experiments were performed to compare the cleaning effect of the new nozzle with that of the Helmholtz nozzle. The study results demonstrate that effective cavitation does not occur when the diameter of the cavitation chamber is too large. For the new nozzle, with the increase of the Reynolds number, the degree of cavitation in the chamber first increases and then decreases; the cleaning effect is much better than that of a traditional Helmholtz nozzle under the same conditions; the nozzle has the best cleaning effect for the stand-off distance of 300 mm.</jats:p>",

The experimental results show that the power generation of the three fuel cells is almost the same, which are 9475W, 9385W, and 9512W. When carrying out multi-stack load-up experiments, it was found that as the number of stacks increased, the voltage efficiency continued to decrease. The Analysis revealed that the parallel gas supply method caused uneven gas distribution, which caused some fuel cells to be in a state of hydrogen deficiency.

At the same time, open systems have significant advantages that, in some cases, give preference to: low corrosion rate of metal in pipelines and equipment due to the use of boiler-quality heat transfer agent that has been processed at a heat source, low cost of ITP, due to the lack of heat exchange devices that increase the cost of thermomechanical equipment, the use of exhaust steam from turbines of thermal power plants and thermal power plants, which increases the efficiency of heat supply. The disadvantage is the low quality of water for hot water supply systems and the need to replenish open heating networks with large volumes of prepared and treated water. A comparative analysis of costs in the transition from an open heating system to a closed one is devoted.</jats:p>",

The water-shortage index (SI) and generalized water-shortage index (GSI) used in this study are evaluated and modified slightly by considering both the damage cost due to water-supply failure and the construction cost of water-supply systems in Korea. The modified indices are then applied for performance evaluation of 16 multipurpose dams in Korea, whose results are evaluated using different units: each dam, each river basin, and all dams. In the analysis of the dam level and basin level, water-supply problems are detected in several dams and in some river basins. However, the SI and GSI estimated for all dams are found to be lower than 1. This result indicates that, even though the total amount of storage capacity is enough to satisfy the design supply, water resources are not well spatially distributed in Korea. It is also found that the modified indices are valid to describe the performance of each dam in water deficient regions during occurrence years of major droughts. In conclusion, the SI and GSI can offer alternative ways of evaluating dam water supply under different environmental conditions and potentially help determine optimal water-storage capacity of dams.</jats:p>"

The microbiological interactions that occur in these environments are still poorly known, especially between bacteriophages and their host bacteria, as well as between cyanophages and cyanobacteria. Lake Bologna, from Belém, capital of the Brazilian State of Pará, is a source of water that supplies the city and its metropolitan region, yet it remains unexplored regarding the contents of its virome and viral diversity composition. Therefore, this work's main aim is to clarify in terms of taxonomic diversity the species of DNA viruses that are present in this lake, especially bacteriophages and cyanophages, since they can act both as transducers of resistance genes and reporters of water quality for human consumption.   <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For this work, we used the metagenomic sequencing data generated by Alves et al. (2020), and we analyzed it at the taxonomic level using the tools Kraken2, Bracken, and Pavian; later, the data was assembled using Genome Detective, which performs assembly of viruses. The results observed in this work suggest the existence of a widely diverse viral community and an established microbial phage regulated dynamics in the Lake Bolonha.      <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> This work is the first-ever to describe the virome of Lake Bolonha using a metagenomic approach based on high-throughput sequencing, as it contributes to the understanding of water-related public health concerns regarding the spreading of antibiotic resistance genes and population control of native bacteria and cyanobacteria.</jats:p>"

Simulation results were validated with experimental results, after which four case studies were performed to analyze their effects on human comforts and observe an optimal condition of each case. The four cases considered were: both windows and doors open (additional window) (Case 1), closed doors and windows open (additional windows) (Case 2), additional ventilation system (Case 3), and exhaust with half closed valve (Case 4). It was observed that Case 1 provided best indoor condition with the room temperature only at 296.4 K, which was 8.3 K lower than that of the original kitchen. The peak temperature for this case was also found the smallest. The addition of electronic valve between the main ventilation pipe and the negative outlet reduced the room temperature less efficiently compared to Case 1.Keywords: Air-conditioning, indoor temperature, humidity, air discharge, air inlet</jats:p>"

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Molecular ions usually exist only in the low-altitude (&amp;lt; 300 km) ionosphere and cannot escape to space without a fast ion upflow/outflow to overcome a rapid loss due to dissociative recombination (e.g., Peterson et al., 1994). Thus, molecular ion escape from the terrestrial atmosphere to space can be used as a tracer of effective ion loss from the deep ionosphere. Reports on molecular ion observations in the ring current are limited to some event studies (e.g., Klecker et al., 1986) and their statistical properties are far from understood. Here we report observations by the Arase (ERG) satellite which enables definitive identification of molecular ions (O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/NO&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) by frequent TOF (time-of-flight) mode observations (Seki et al., 2019) and a simultaneous observation by the EISCAT radar and Arase to investigate the mechanisms to cause the fast upward ion transport in the deep ionosphere (Takada et al., submitted, 2021).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Statistical properties of molecular ions in the ring current are investigated based on ion composition measurements (&amp;lt;180 keV/q) by MEPi and LEPi instruments onboard Arase. The investigated period from late March to December 2017 includes 11 geomagnetic storms with the minimum Dst index less than -40 nT. The molecular ions are observed in association with geomagnetic disturbances with Dst &amp;lt; -30 nT. During quiet times, molecular ions are not observed. The tendency is consistent with previous observations. The molecular ions are observed mainly in the region of L=3.5-6.6 and clearly identified at energies above ~14 keV with molecular&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;to O&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; ion energy density ratio of the order of 1 percent. Detection probability of molecular ions in the ring current becomes higher with increasing size of geomagnetic storms (minimum Dst index). Their detection probability also tends to be higher during substorms as well as during high-speed solar wind period. The observation probability of the molecular ions in the ring current is comparable or higher than that in the high-altitude auroral regions, suggesting the importance of the subauroral zone. Existence of molecular ions even during small magnetic storms suggests that the fast ion outflow from the deep ionosphere occurs frequently during geomagnetically active periods. In order to understand the mechanism of the molecular ion supply to the magnetosphere, we will also briefly report on an event study of the ion upflow in the low-altitude (250-350 km) ionosphere observed by EISCAT during the storm main phase on September 8, 2017, when Arase observed molecular ions in the ring current.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;References:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Klecker et al., Geophys.

In this study, the capability of the Gaussian Process Regressions (GPR) kernel-based approach was assessed in predicting the daily river stage–discharge (RSD) relationship. Three successive hydrometric stations of the Housatonic River were considered, and based on the flow characteristics during the period of 2002–2006 several models were developed and tested via GPR. To enhance the applied model efficiency, two pre-processing techniques, namely Wavelet Transform (WT) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), were used. Also, two states of the RSD modeling were investigated. In state 1, each station's own data was used and in state 2, the upstream stations’ datasets were used as input to model the RSD downstream of the river. The single and integrated model results showed that the integrated WT- and EEMD-GPR models resulted in more accurate outcomes. Data processing enhanced the models' capability between 25% and 40%. The results showed that the RSD modeling in state 1 led to better results; however, when the station's own data were not available the integrated methods could be applied successfully for the RSD modeling using the previous stations’ data.</jats:p>",

The model in MATLAB Simulink has been created to investigate the essentials of the power supply operation and adjust the voltage controller. To compensate the voltage drop across the cable (over 500 V) the current signal correction was introduced. This correction proved to be a reliable method to provide a stable load voltage of 1200 V±2% in steady-state operating modes of electric equipment within the autonomous object structure. This will significantly enhance the overall performance of the equipment that is placed on the considerable distance from the power supply.</jats:p>",

Based on the five principles of constructing the recipient satisfaction index, the PCSSI model of the comprehensive evaluation system of public sports service supply was constructed using scale design. Large-scale stadiums in seven districts of Shenyang were selected for investigation. The recipient satisfaction index model was established to compare the satisfaction index of the 7 regions, and analyze the influencing factors of the satisfaction index of public sports service supply, and put forward some suggestions for improving the service level of large stadiums and gymnasiums in Shenyang. Practice has proved that the application of the PCSSI model has a positive effect on improving the performance level of public sports service supply in China.</jats:p>"

The amount of water supply will be limited and provided in a short period of time by the Government. According to the climate and environmental changes the amount of water will be varied. Now many private companies have emerged in the field of water supply to sell water to gain huge profit. But still Government water supply is the main source for common people in urban areas of India. Most of the water connections are given to the individual home by plastic or steel pipes through underground or overground. It is very easy for a person to steal the water from the pipeline illegally. Others cannot identify the theft easily and they will be cheated. Consequently, water availability/supply for the homes in that area will be reduced. A system has been proposed in the paper to find and stop the water theft in an area using the sensors and IoT technology. This system can also identify the leakage of pipes anywhere in the line.</jats:p>",

The differences in the adoption of RF between the two countries stem from the availability of programs for suppliers at different supply levels, their efficient implementation and a robust regulatory framework, but especially from the cooperative approach adopted. The motives and enablers of RF adoption in the automobile industry can be explained under a framework of different supply chain management models. The RF programs driven by self-interest financial motives are characterized by an asymmetric distribution of benefits among supply chain participants. The RF programs that combine self-interest with cooperative motives are partially characterized by balanced benefits. In addition, they favor involvement practices and strengthen long-term relationships among supply chain participants. In this cooperative approach, trust, transparency and especially sharing information are considered relevant enablers. Finally, the specific automobile industry's features that determine RF adoption are linked to the structure and governance mode of the supply chain. The structure in terms of length – multiple supply levels – conditions the design of RF programs based on the buyer's position in the supply chain. The governance mode, particularly how the relationships are established, conditions the factors and requisites for efficient adoption of the RF programs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This research analyzes the RF framed in the dynamics of buyer–supplier relationships and different models of supply chain management, allowing us to identify cooperation motives and their impact on RF adoption, beyond the traditional economic and financial motives highlighted by previous literature.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The possibilities created by such visibility are endless—from risk reduction and continuity planning to inventory management and cost reduction, nothing is off the table when end‐to‐end visibility is a possibility. Because of such enticements, there is usually much buzz in the industry every time a new technology that promises visibility and transparency is brought forward. Yet, years later, stories sometimes emerge that said technologies either failed to deliver or were not everything they were made out to be. Blockchain is yet another emerging technology in this space. Some consultants promise that it will be the final answer to the transparency and visibility woes that companies currently face. Yet, there is little empirical investigation regarding how the technology may benefit adopters, what the bottlenecks may be, and to what extent it may be able to deliver on these promises, without massive system‐wide upgrades of extant hardware and computing prowess. The current study takes a step in this direction by investigating a blockchain‐driven proof of concept across an industry consortium to identify promises, possibilities, and challenges of blockchain.</jats:p>",

We adopt a modelling approach based on the costs and benefits associated with food safety standards and use our theoretical framework to assess the empirical net effects of MRLs for pesticides on African mango production and trade with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. On the one hand, we theoretically highlight that for a given production technology and a level of elasticity of production costs with respect to the MRL gap, producers will likely (probability and quantity) produce standard-compliant products if they are able to completely pass through the standard-compliance costs to the unit price they receive from exporters; otherwise, they will exit standard-compliant products market. On the other hand, we theoretically show that the net effects of the MRL gap on bilateral trade can be positive, zero or negative depending on the effects of consumers’ perceived quality (positive), trade costs (negative) and standard-compliant production cost (negative). We use a cross-sectional data set for 12 African countries that produced and exported MRL-compliant mangoes to 31 OECD countries in 2016. On the one hand, we find that the net effect of MRLs is positive for the level of standard-compliant mango production and negative for the probability of producing. On the other hand, they are positive in mango trade between African and OECD member countries. Our results highlight that the tightening or imposition of strict MRLs for pesticides in developed countries may be trade promoting, while they severely impede production in African countries.</jats:p>",

Amongst this criticism, Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs) have emerged as a promising sustainable alternative to the industrialized agri-food supply systems. In recent years there have been some attempts to explore the relationship between SFSCs and sustainability, but these are mostly theoretical discussions and lacks empirical validation. This study, therefore, attempts to provide empirical validation of the SFSCs and sustainability linkages. Additionally, from the theoretical perspective, our work extends the traditional triple bottom line constructs and explores two extra dimensions of sustainability in the food supply chain system, namely, governance and culture, thus exploring five dimensions of sustainability. Furthermore, while SFSCs have proven to improve farmers’ livelihoods and reconnect producers with consumers, little or no attention has been given to understand the consumers' attitudes towards the SFSC practices. Therefore, this study aims to explore the customers’ attitudes towards participating in SFSCs through the concept of a moral economy and personal relationship. Based on the 532 valid responses from Chinese consumers, our study shows that all five pillars of sustainability, moral economy and Chinese relationship have a positive influence on consumers’ participation in SFSCs. With its intuitive benefits, the economic pillar emerged as the most approved factor by the participants. Interestingly our findings show that the social aspect is less prominent than others, which is contrary to existing studies conducted in developed countries.</jats:p>",

Therefore, based on the perspective of the coal supply chain in the steel industry, this paper constructs a multi-objective planning model to achieve a balanced optimization of total economic costs and carbon emission reduction, and verifies the effectiveness of the model through specific case data. This paper sets three different emission reduction scenarios, discusses and analyzes the changes of economic total cost and carbon emission under different emission reduction scenarios, and finds that suppliers with good coal mining technology and low carbon emission factor have more opportunities to be selected and can obtain more coal market orders. At the same time, steel plants with mature processing technology and low carbon emission factor can further gain market competitive advantage and undertake more steelmaking tasks. Finally, based on results, management suggestions for coal suppliers and steel plants are provided.</jats:p>",

Gas supply has been shown to impact chain elongation performance. In the present study, the effect of nitrogen gas (N2) supply on lactate metabolism, conversion rates, biomass growth, and microbiome composition was evaluated in a lactate-fed upflow anaerobic reactor with continuous or intermittent N2 gas supply. Successful MCC production was achieved with continuous N2 gas supply at low superficial gas velocities (SGV) of 0.22 m∙h−1. Supplying N2 at high SGV (&gt;2 m∙h−1) either continuously (2.2 m∙h−1) or intermittently (3.6 m∙h−1) disrupted chain elongation, resulting in production of short-chain carboxylates (SCC), i.e., acetate, propionate, and n-butyrate. Caproiciproducens-dominated chain-elongating microbiomes enriched at low SGV were washed out at high SGV where Clostridium tyrobutyricum-dominated microbiomes thrived, by displaying higher lactate consumption rates. Suspended growth seemed to be dominant regardless of SGV and gas supply regime applied with no measurable sludge bed formed. The highest MCC production from lactate of 10 g COD∙L−1∙d−1 with electron selectivities of 72 ± 5%was obtained without N2 gas supply at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 1 day. The addition of 5 g∙L−1 of propionate did not inhibit chain elongation, but rather boosted lactate conversion rates towards MCC with n-heptylate reaching 1.8 g COD∙L−1∙d−1. N2 gas supply can be used for mixing purposes and to steer lactate metabolism to MCC or SCC production.</jats:p>"

Bacteria play an important role in the removal of organics in reservoirs, but some of them can pose a health risk to consumers. Knowledge of bacterial community composition in drinking water sources can favour the drinking water security safeguards. This study investigated the monthly composition and diversity of bacterial communities in three cascade reservoirs using high-throughput Illumina HiSeq sequencing over one hydrological year. The diversity and structure of the bacterial community showed distinct spatiotemporal variation. Mycobacterium, Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas, Sphingobacterium and Pseudomonas were the genera resistant to chlorine. In addition, Acinetobacter, Arcobacter, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus were the main potential pathogenic genera. The bacterial community diversity and the average relative abundance of potential pathogenic genera detected in the wet season were higher than those in the dry season. Water temperature was found to be the main factor for the temporal variation. The spatial variation of bacterial community diversity and the average relative abundance of potential pathogenic genera were related to water current and the degree of water pollution, respectively. The results of this study can conduce the beneficial management of drinking water treatment processes.</jats:p>",

In the second stage, two membrane combinations were tested for additional water extraction from the brine generated by the NF process. The simulation results showed that using a hybrid forward osmosis (FO)–reverse osmosis (RO) system is more efficient than using the RO process alone for the further extraction of water from the brine generated by the NF process.

Physical and numerical modelling efforts have improved understanding of the modes and styles of island change in response to increasing wave and water level conditions. However, the impact of sediment supply on island morphodynamics has not been addressed and remains poorly understood. Here we present evidence from the first physical modelling experiments to explore the effect of storm-derived sediment supply on the geomorphic response of islands to changes in sea level and energetic wave conditions. Results demonstrate that a sediment supply has a substantial influence on island adjustments in response to sea-level rise, promoting the increase of the elevation of the island while dampening island migration and subaerial volume reduction. The implications of sediment supply are significant as it improves the potential of islands to offset the impacts of future flood events, increasing the future physical persistence of reef islands. Results emphasize the urgent need to incorporate the physical response of islands to both physical and ecological processes in future flood risk models.</jats:p>"

The shortage of one chip can be compensated by another chip of the same type with a higher‐end feature at an additional cost. Therefore, the automobile manufacturer can divert the on‐hand inventory of chips to product lines that are more profitable in the event of shortages caused by supply chain disruptions. To cope with this, we propose a max‐min robust optimization model that captures the uncertain supplies of chips. We show that the robust model has a mixed‐integer programming equivalence that can be solved by a commercial IP solver directly. We compare the max‐min robust model with the corresponding deterministic and two‐stage stochastic models for the same problem through extensive numerical experiments. The computational results show that the max‐min robust model outperforms the other two models in terms of the average and worst‐case profits.</jats:p>",

To extend the cost-effective gas production at the final stage of development modern technologies are introduced at the fields. One of these technologies is the technology of distributed gas compression. As a result, a multiple increase in the electrical load is observed and new power transmission lines and substations are being constructed to provide electricity to gas fields. For example, at Vyngapurovsky gas field MCU (9 PCs) were to be put into operation and the 6 kV OHL with a length of 22 km were needed to be built, at Yamburg gas field at the moment MCU (52 PCs) are to be set up and it is required to build the 10 kV OHL with a length of 480 km. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to conduct an experimental study of the existing supply and distribution grids of the gas fields’ power supply system in Western Siberia. To achieve this goal the following tasks have been solved: the method of the mathematical models development was selected; the main influencing factors on the voltage class were identified; variation ranges of the selected factors were defined; the optimization of the power supply schematic diagrams for the choice of voltage with minimal discounted costs was completed by the computer program PRON. The problems have been solved using the empirical method (measurement, comparison) of the study, the method of experiment planning (full factorial experiment), and computer programming methods. The analysis shows that all distribution grids of the power supply system in Western Siberia need to be converted to a higher voltage class of 20 kV or the additional overhead lines should be built.</jats:p>",

The purchase schedule curve optimization for the case of energy storage usage is an ill-posed problem. Within the framework of solving the problem, the form of the curve was formalized to a piecewise constant function, which made it possible to solve it by applying multi-criteria optimization based on a modified method of directed random search.

The main purpose of the study is to investigate the transformation of the implementation of state customs in the context of anti-crisis response to the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodology of this study is based on such general scientific research methods as analysis and synthesis, systematisation, and generalisation. The study has defined the basic areas of reengineering of customs bodies' operation which have to work continuously and in the conditions of time restrictions; organisational response design; anti-epidemic protection of officials; digitalisation of customs procedures; customs regulation; trade facilitation measures. In particular, the study noted that in crisis conditions, the urgent task is to form operational groups for anti-crisis response, as introduced by China. The paper outlines the main responsibilities of such task forces and focuses on the need for rapid changes in legislation and consultation with stakeholders. The authors have identified the main measures to ensure the safety of personnel, which should be developed by customs administrations in close cooperation with healthcare authorities and other stakeholders. Trade facilitation measures have also been identified, in particular through the collection of data and their submission to the World Trade Organization repository.

Simulating the SLOPOL10 model, an econometric model of the Slovenian economy, we analyse the effectiveness of various categories of public spending and taxes during the period 2020 to 2030, assuming that no crisis occurs. Our simulations show that those public spending measures that entail both demand- and supply-side effects are more effective at stimulating real GDP and increasing employment than pure demand-side measures. This is due to the fact that supply-side measures also increase potential and not only actual GDP. Measures which foster research and development and those which improve the education level of the labour force are particularly effective in this respect. Employment can also be stimulated effectively by cutting the income tax rate and the social security contribution rate, i.e. by reducing the tax wedge on labour income, which positively affects Slovenia’s international competitiveness. Successful stabilisation policies should thus contain a supply-side component in addition to a demand-side component. We also provide a first simulation of potential effects of the Covid-19 crisis on the Slovenian economy, which is modelled as a combined demand and supply shock.</jats:p>",

The clear cut of biomass characteristics in proximate analysis and ultimate analysis makes it possible to produce reliable energy resources. Biomass is multi-faceted fuel; thereof, it produces biofuel, which can be used in transportation and bioenergy to generate cleaner and affordable electricity throughout the world. In that sense, in this article, the characteristics and functionality of different thermochemical processes such as direct combustion and gasification have been discussed, and the reliability and new findings in various aspects in the bioenergy field.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of technology, globalization of the economy and the unpredictable behavior of customers have eventuated in a dynamic and competitive environment in the complex product systems (CoPS) market. Besides, CoPS economic pricing is one of the key factors that dramatically reduces production costs and increases competitiveness. In this regard, this paper unveils a hybrid data envelopment analysis (DEA)-fuzzy mathematical model for economic pricing of CoPS in a competitive closed-loop supply chain network under uncertainty. In the first stage, different CoPS suppliers are evaluated exploiting a DEA model based on a set of economic, technical, and geographical criteria. The advantage of this evaluation is choosing appropriate suppliers, and reducing the complexity of the original model. Next, using a robust optimization model, the strategic and tactical decisions are simultaneously determined, providing a fully optimal solution to the model. In the concerned model, the costs and capacities of facilities are considered to be hemmed in by uncertainty. Eventually, to evaluate the proposed approach, a case study is conducted to derive the important managerial results. The numerical results corroborate that the presented robust model is capable of providing a stable structure under different realizations.</jats:p>",

To do this, we propose three contracts to improve supply chain performance: the advanced payment contract, penalty contract, and time insurance contract. To assess these contracts, we considered the supply chain of one e-retailer and one express delivery provider. We discussed which contract is better for the supply chain partners when the three contracts can coordinate the supply chain. We found that when its unit cost of delayed orders is lower, the e-retailer will choose the advance payment contract among three contracts. When its unit cost of delayed orders is medium, the e-retailer will opt for the time insurance contract. When its unit cost of delayed orders is high, the e-retailer will not choose the advanced payment contract. In this case, whether the e-retailer chooses the time insurance contract and penalty contract depends on the value of wholesale price.</jats:p>",

By calculating and copying dynamic equations, the asymptotic stability analysis of the three parties of the game is performed and the stability of the Jacobian matrix proposed by Friedman is used to analyze the local stability of the model equilibrium point and the evolutionary stability strategy of the system. Secondly, the evolution results and evolution paths of the model under different strategies are simulated by system dynamics and the influence of different parameters on the main body selection strategy of the tripartite game is analyzed. Finally, the paper puts forward corresponding policy suggestions from the perspectives of local government, suppliers and downstream enterprises in order to provide new ideas for the governance of China’s environmental problems from the perspective of low carbon.</jats:p>"

The hospitals’ navigation system is considered to be the most important part of the visualization system and one of the basic criteria for the quality of the space of health facilities when forming a new model of a medical organization providing primary health care in the framework of the federal project «Development of a primary health care system» of the national project «Healthcare». From the viewpoint of the management concept of lean production, the hospitals navigation system should be aimed at the complete elimination or reduction of unnecessary movements of visitors, as well as other types of basic and additional losses. The accumulated experience in implementing projects with the implementation of the concept of lean production in outpatient medical institutions of the Russian Federation suggests that a rationally designed and deployed navigation system can be an effective tool for visualization in a lean production methodology. Structural and technological solutions of an effective hospitals navigation system introducing the concept of lean production should take into account the possibility of perceiving navigation information by all population groups, including people with limited mobility: people with disabilities, people with disabilities, people with prams, etc. Technical means of informing, orienting and signaling for people with limited mobility is a complex of various technical means for providing visual, tactile, sound information, orientation in space. In addition, they indicate possible directions of movement and places of receipt of services that contribute to the accessibility, safety, information content and comfort of the healthcare facility. Modern hospitals must meet the requirements of ensuring accessibility and safety for people with disabilities and other people with limited mobility due to the implementation of a complex of architectural and planning, engineering, ergonomic, structural and organizational measures of the state program «Accessible Environment». The navigation system can be a key tool for these activities.</jats:p>"

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allows for differentiation of total coliforms from faecal coliforms by specific amplicons: 1,285 bp of amplicon is specific for six non-faecal coliform genera and 1,009 bp of amplicon is specific for faecal coliform ie. E. coli. If drinking water was contaminated with both faecal and non-faecal coliforms then two amplicons of 1,285 bp and 1,009 bp by combination of the three primers are observed. A multiplex PCR assay based on the 16S rRNA gene should be a beneficial tool kit for the rapid identification of total coliforms in a large number of water samples compared with traditional methods. Results can be acquired within 3 hrs compared with the classic most probable number (MPN) method (3–4 days). This assay will be useful in diversification and detection of seven genera of total coliforms by using variable regions of 16S rRNA.</jats:p>",

Based on a comparative study around Dhaka and Lahore—two key apparel manufacturing hubs—this study elucidates that supplier factory senior managers experienced similar market tensions but different social tensions after the Rana Plaza incident. Crucially, similar market tensions helped create market fear and anger, but different social tensions led to social fear and anger in Bangladesh but not in Pakistan, therefore influencing the way supplier factory senior managers take decisions regarding CSR practices. By conceptualizing communal alignment and competitive CSR, this research finally advances the global value chain literature and contributes to the current conversations on negative emotions in organizations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The complex structure of supply chains makes them vulnerable to risk, so enhancing their resilience is an important goal. In particular, fashion supply chain research has identified two important issues that need to be addressed: sustainability and risk. However, investigation of these issues is relatively sparse and has primarily been independent with little combinatory research. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a risk mitigation method that can maximize the resilience of sustainable supply chains for fashion companies. The objective of this study is to develop an integrated quality function deployment approach and to mitigate supply chain risk by deploying resilience capabilities and resilience-enhancing features, thus ultimately providing the fashion industry with a useful approach for the development of resilient, sustainable supply chains. Using a fashion company as an example, the practicability of the proposed approach is verified. To strengthen resilience and thus mitigate key risks, it is found that the most urgent tasks are to reallocate the company’s resources, to carry out the real-time monitoring of risk on the spot, to share the risk responsibility, and to establish an incentive system. When these features are strengthened, agility and adaptability can be improved, and finally, the risks of supplier delays, natural disasters, political instability, and problematic supplier materials with the greatest impact can be alleviated. This study provides a new strategy for the fashion industry for the implementation of resilient, sustainable supply chains to mitigate risks.</jats:p>"

Besides Tanjung Lesung Special Economic Zone, Pandeglang Regency has many tourism potentials, which contributes significantly to the regional revenue. As a critical element of tourism, hotels provide accommodation and services for tourists. To provide the services, the flow of goods, services, and information must be designed efficiently and effectively. Unfortunately, the December 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami had impacted hospitality industry and its supply chain severely since then. To support the recovery from the impact of the tsunami, it is important to understand the relationship between each component in the hospitality supply chain in Pandeglang. Hence, this study aims to identify the hospitality supply chain in Pandeglang. The study uses the qualitative approach to describe the main components of the hospitality supply chain and with samples of interviews mostly from official governments and other related organizations within the industry. The result finding indicates that the components in the hospitality business in Pandeglang consist of three main components, namely: supplier, distributor, and customer. In addition, the relationship between components can be more efficient to increase product competitiveness in the tourism market and to support the Pandeglang recovery.</jats:p>",

The modern development of mobile devices, network computer technologies, cellular communication and mathematical methods opens up new prospects in the automation of operational monitoring of water supply structures. The technical part of the mobile device for conducting operational monitoring includes various technical schemes of frames for each water supply structure separately. It can be used for conducting operational monitoring of the technical condition and determining the remaining life of the protective coating of water supply channels and soils under them, identifying dangerous defects and damages, as well as evaluating and predicting its technical condition and further suitability for operation. The technical result achieved by this mobile device is to identify the influence of defects and damages, both of the protective coating itself and the condition of the soil located under it, on the formation of decompressions and subsidence at an early stage of their formation. The mobile device is developed using the Data Mining database management system and Microsoft Access. The use of a mobile device makes it possible to improve the quality of operational monitoring of water supply channels due to the fact that the survey is carried out over the entire cross-section of the water supply channel for defects, damages, decompression and subsidence of the soil under the structure by non-destructive testing methods. And the presence of a vehicle that transports the complex allows you to speed up significantly the survey of water supply channels.</jats:p>",

In an environmentally awaken atmosphere GSCM has an indispensible role to play to reduce the carbon foot print of different manufacturing operations. In the Indian context, the small and medium scale enterprises are unaware of environment friendly supply chain operations. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop a scale for implementing GSCM practices in those manufacturing domain. The objective of this paper is to investigate in formulating a widely acceptable scale for evaluation of green supply chain (GSC) system practices among those manufacturers. On the basis of the data collected from 119 Indian enterprises, measurement models of GSCM practices were evaluated. The assessments are done though the questionnaire from Small and Medium size enterprises (SMEs). Role of environmental performance in the green supply chain system for those enterprises is critically analyzed in this work.

This paper presents a new method for an automated, near-real-time recognition of failure events at WTWs by the application of combined statistical process control and machine-learning techniques. The resulting novel hybrid CUSUM event recognition system (HC-ERS) uses two distinct detection methodologies: one for fault detection at the level of individual water quality signals and the second for the recognition of faulty processes at the WTW level. HC-ERS was tested and validated on historical failure events at a real-life UK WTW. The new methodology proved to be effective in the detection of failure events, achieving a high true-detection rate of 82% combined with a low false-alarm rate (average 0.3 false alarms per week), reaching a peak F1 score of 84% as a measure of accuracy. The new method also demonstrated higher accuracy compared with the CANARY detection methodology. When applied to real-world data, the HC-ERS method showed the capability to detect faulty processes at WTW automatically and reliably, and hence potential for practical application in the water industry.</jats:p>",

In particular, the occurrence of uncertain emergencies increases the risk of interruption of the closed-loop supply chain, making it insufficient to analyze its complex changes from the perspective of material flow alone. Based on this analysis, the paper constructs a closed-loop supply chain material flow and capital flow coupling system composed of manufacturers, sellers and recyclers to explore the impact of material flow sudden interruption on the closed-loop supply chain system when an uncertain emergency occurs. In this paper, based on the closed-loop supply chain system coupled with logistics and capital flow, a system dynamics simulation model was established by using Vensim simulation software to analyze the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on manufacturers, sellers and recyclers under five scenarios. The results show that when COVID-19 outbreaks occur, the material flow of each main enterprise in the closed-loop supply chain is more easily influenced than the capital flow. At the same time, it can be found that the recyclers in the main enterprises of the closed-loop supply chain are more easily influenced by the material flow. The model constructed in this paper has applicability and can be used for related studies of closed-loop supply chain under other emergencies, but the scene design should be carried out according to the characteristics of emergencies themselves.</jats:p>",

The components of water losses should be accurately assessed and their priority should be determined. Generally, water balance analysis is used to quantify different components of water losses and identify the main contributor to high leakage rates. The leak flow rate is assumed to be static within a given calculation period during the calculation of real losses. Errors will inevitably arise during this process. This is mainly due to our limited understanding of a leak's growth process. To overcome this problem, the current work proposes the use of growth functions to represent a leak's growth process and establish a functional relationship between the leak flow rate and the leak duration. A leakage development model is adopted to simulate a leak's growth process and optimize the parameters of growth functions. The results show that the Richards function performs better than other growth functions and its mean absolute percentage error is 15.33%. Furthermore, the growth function could be used to calculate real losses and has the prospect of evaluating the effects of leakage detection.</jats:p>",

Moreover, when the degree of altruistic preference is kept within a limit, the profit of the decentralized system is higher in a model with altruistic preferences, which indicates that altruistic preference can contribute toward maintaining a friendly, harmonious, and cooperative a relationship between the platform and manufacturers. Contrary to a traditional offline supply chain, where the sales price is the lowest in the centralized model, the sales price is highest in a centralized eSC model. In the proposed coordination contract, the platform with a certain degree of altruistic preference offers zero-commission sales service and charges a certain amount for a fixed professional service fee. The proposed contract is more applicable to products whose market demands are less affected by sales prices and more affected by the sales service level.</jats:p>"

Nitrogen (N) is one of the major nutrients limiting the growth and yield of crop plants, among which wheat is probably the most substantial to human diet worldwide. Physiological status and photosynthetic capacity of two contrasting wheat genotypes (old Slomer and modern semi-dwarf Enola) were evaluated at the seedling stage to assess how N supply affected osmotic stress tolerance and capacity of plants to survive drought periods. It was evident that higher N input in both varieties contributed to better performance under dehydration. The combination of lower N supply and water deprivation (osmotic stress induced by polyethylene glycol treatment) led to greater damage of the photosynthetic efficiency and a higher degree of oxidative stress than the individually applied stresses. The old wheat variety had better N assimilation efficiency, and it was also the one with better performance under N deficiency. However, when both N and water were deficient, the modern variety demonstrated better photosynthetic performance. It was concluded that different strategies for overcoming osmotic stress alone or in combination with low N could be attributed to differences in the genetic background. Better performance of the modern variety conceivably indicated that semi-dwarfing (Rht) alleles might have a beneficial effect in arid regions and N deficiency conditions.</jats:p>"

With the use of a UPS, the supply of electrical power to the system will not be interrupted. When the UPS operates, the voltage go through dual conversion process, from AC to DC by the rectifier and from DC to AC by the inverter. The DC voltage in the UPS is used to supply the battery charger and the AC voltage is used to supply the load system. The switching process of the inverter can produce disturbances at high frequency. In this study, a 1 KVA UPS is connected to a capacitive load 3.6 µF, 7.2 µF, 14.4 µF and 28.8 µF which generate the highest disturbances voltage of 309.53 mV at a frequency of 9.8 kHz at a load of 28.8 μF and the lowest of 1.33 mV at a frequency of 110.6 kHz at a load of 3.6 μF. The disturbances voltage occur at three dominant frequencies of 19-24 kHz, 35-44 kHz and 105- 114 kHz and increases as the increase of capacitive load level.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Risks play an important role in supply chain vulnerability, performance maintenance, and competitive advantage. Therefore, appropriate risk assessment and ranking are among the top priorities of managers and experts in the supply chain. Because there are several quantitative and qualitative risks in the supply chain, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and, in particular, multi attribute decision making (MADM) methods are used to rank them. Depending on the type of supply chain, the difference in criteria and information available, it is possible to use existing MCDM methods to rank supply chain risks or introduce new methods. In these methods, options are compared on the basis of different criteria according to mathematical methods. Each of these methods uses their own approaches and assumptions. Therefore, there will be different solutions to the ranking. In this case, one or more methods may be selected as the best method. But it cannot be sure that the superior method is chosen correctly. In this paper, decision making methods are compared with each other for an appropriate method to be chosen. Case examples from the related literature have been compared with the proposed method (three-dimensional integrated mean method). To evaluate the validity of the proposed method, the results were sent to experts in various industries along with the proposed method. For analysis the accuracy of experts’ opinions, One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Frequencies and Explore tests have been used in SPSS software with 95% confidence level. The obtained results show high reliability of the proposed method for determining an appropriate decision-making method in supply chain risk assessment. However, the proposed method is used for ranking of supplier selection in this paper, but it can be used for many decision-making procedures. </jats:p>",

For this purpose, several jar test experiments were performed in order to identify the most influencing factors. Afterwards, RSM was done to investigate the effects and the interactions of three chosen variables (coagulant concentration, flocculant concentration, and initial pH), whereas the responses were the DOM removal in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD), in terms of absorbance at the wavelength 254 nm (UV-254), and the final pH. The optimal conditions were as follows: 133 mg/L of coagulant, 60 mg/L of flocculant and an initial pH equal to 6.91. Under these conditions, the efficiency removals were 56% in terms of COD and 59% in terms of UV-254 with a final pH equal to 6.78. High variance coefficient R2 values, with 0.96 for the removal in terms of COD and 0.92 in terms of UV-254, confirm the reliability and the validity of the obtained model.</jats:p>",

The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Bangladesh on 8th March, 2020 and consequently the country went into lockdown on 26 March, 2020. This study has made a survey of vegetables farmers through a mobile phone to understand the impact of COVID-19 on vegetables supply chain, gross margin and the future production plan of the growers. In Bangladesh, the lockdown has disrupted the food supply chain and increases the likelihood of food insecurity. Lockdown has impeded vegetable farmers’ access to markets, thus limiting their productive and sales capacities. The price of yield has dropped by more than half resulting in huge loss for vegetable growers. The loss incurred by the farmers for producing Brinjal, Cucumber, Pointed gourd, Yardlong beans and Bottle gourd are BDT 4900, BDT 10900, BDT 57400, BDT 52500 and BDT 18500 per acre respectively as a result of COVID-19. The decreased income increases farmers’ likelihood of vulnerability and food insecurity and poses a challenge to continued produce. ‘Cash support’ is more important than ‘food support’ in order to keep vegetable farmers in farming, to ensure a ready supply of necessary low-cost resources, and to help fight against the upcoming food shortage.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Electric vehicle batteries are usually retired when the performance drops to about 70% of factory performance. At this point, they can be remanufactured into raw materials for the production of new batteries. This paper studies a two-period vehicle supply chain consisting of government, an electric/gasoline vehicle manufacturer, a EV battery manufacturer and consumers with and without retired batteries’ remanufacturing process. The purpose is to understand government subsidy policy in these two different periods. By adopting Stackelberg game theory and Nash equilibrium, a mathematical model was developed. The study gives the optimal subsidy with and without battery remanufacturing process in different two periods. We also consider the quality and recycling rates of retired batteries, as well as the impact of raw material costs for new batteries and government environmental spending on subsidies and commodity prices such as vehicles and batteries. Meanwhile, the results show that government subsidy to EV manufacturers can be reduced when retired battery remanufacturing process exists. Increasing in retired batteries’ quality, recycling rates, and the cost of raw materials for new batteries will lead to a reduction in government subsidies; but a rising of government spending on environmental protection will lead to the need for more subsidies to electric vehicle manufacturers.</jats:p>",

In this context, our study used the multi-period difference-in-difference method to systematically examine the impact of the policy implementation on product price and profit distribution in the supply chain. The results showed the following: (1) the price of raw milk in the implementation area of the price support policy is 13.54% higher than that of the unimplemented area; (2) the effect of price increase in the western region (15.5%) is higher than that in the eastern region (13%), and the central region (10.73%); (3) furthermore, the purchase price guidance policy of raw milk drives price increase or price suppression in the links of the supply chain to promote a balanced distribution of profits among the participants in the chain. These conclusions all have good stability and have reference significance for further improving and adjusting the price support policy of raw milk to realize the sustainable development of the Chinese dairy industry. This will enhance the production confidence of Chinese raw milk producers and improve Chinese consumers’ expectations and consumer psychology regarding domestic dairy products.</jats:p>"

One of the first stages of its implementation is an inventory of surface and ground water bodies that are promising for drinking water supply. Water storage basins are of particular interest in this regard. The present work deals with the assessment of water quality of Vetlyanskoye, Polyakovskoye and Chernovskoye reservoirs by a set of hydrochemical indicators. It is shown that the water of Polyakovskoye and Chernovskoye reservoirs generally meets the requirements of standards for drinking water, while the water of Vetlyanskoye water storage basin has a high salinity and a significant excess of the MPC for manganese compounds. In this regard, the prospects for using of the water of Vetlyanskoe reservoir seem to be dubious due to the need to organize a technically complex stage of demanganation in the process of water treatment. The decision on the possibility of using the water resources of Polyakovskoe and Chernovskoe reservoirs for drinking water supply can be made after additional safety studies on microbiological indicators.</jats:p>",

This research was conducted to determine the effect of installing anti-slamming bulbous bow and Anti-slamming height on the total resistance of the ship using numerical methods with the help of CFD software. The method used is to vary the height of anti-slamming and the type of bulbous bow on the bow of the ship. Ship modeling is carried out with CAD Software, and while the obstacle analysis uses CFD Tdyn software. Based on the analysis that has been done, the effect of the anti-slamming bulbous bow on the total resistance value of the ship without an anti-slamming bulbous bow is reduced by 3.75%. The ship model, with the use of the anti-slamming bulbous bow, which has the smallest total resistance, is the ship with the form of anti-slimming bulbous bow type Delta (Δ - Type).</jats:p>",

It is possible to realize the indicated advantages of diesel engines only if the parameters that characterize the fuel supply are ensured and maintained. The nature of the fuel supply predetermines the indicators that characterize the quality of the workflow in a diesel engine. As you know, during the operation of a diesel engine, there are significant differences between the real characteristics of the fuel supply to the optimum. These differences arise due to the fact that the technical condition of the elements of the high pressure fuel system (HPF) changes. Establishing the optimal parameters that characterize the fuel supply during the operation of the fuel equipment (FE) is a rather difficult task, which is caused by the interconnectedness and interdependence of these parameters. It is especially necessary to take into account that while optimizing some fuel supply parameters, others often deteriorate. In order to ensure a high-quality fuel combustion process, the fuel system of a diesel engine is faced with the task of ensuring guaranteed injection of a metered cyclic fuel supply (CFS), taking into account the specified phases and injection characteristics, which will have a beneficial effect on the fuel combustion process in any operating modes of the diesel engine. Thus, with a change in the technical characteristics of the HPF during operation, the characteristics of the injection also change. When studying the influence of the HPF parameters on the fuel supply characteristics, the change in the injection characteristics is often not taken into account, which is explained by the complexity and laboriousness of these studies. Considering the above, the optimization of the characteristics of diesel engines fuel supply is an urgent problem.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Nyangatom, in South Omo, Ethiopia, are a group of agro-pastoralists whose access to land is affected by large-scale sugarcane development projects. An informed selection of appropriate livestock management measures by local communities requires a spatially explicit representation of prevailing and changing supply–demand relationships for livestock herds among the Nyangatom. This study addresses this caveat and identifies seasonal and location-specific ‘hotspots’ in Nyangatom, where fodder demand exceeds supply. Assessments of fodder production are based on primary data collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field observations. Overall, annual fodder availability is estimated at 508,967 tonnes against the requirement of 584,205 tons, resulting in a deficit of 12.9% annually after out-migration. Under the implementation of the Omo-V sugarcane project and climate change, the fodder supply deficit will worsen to 219,977 tonnes annually. The most critical dry matter hotspots are found in the western and central parts of Nyangatom near the Kibish River, which shows the highest livestock density. In contrast, better fodder supply is estimated around the southwestern and northeastern parts. Change in policy, the frequency of droughts, conflict, and the large-scale irrigation schemes-induced reduction of the Omo River floods are accounted for the changes. Thus, there are strong signals to the local community and government to collaborate to reduce the potential constraints that affect sustainable rangeland management and food security and ensure sufficient attention to the interest of the agro-pastoralists.</jats:p>"

Both are involved in water footprint and water consumption Nexus, meaning that industrial water consumption is impacting the water footprint of water treatment plants within the same area. Therefore, in order to achieve the environmental sustainability of water resource, the requirement of having effective approach in water utilisation accounting is crucial. Thus, water consumption for industrial activities and water footprint of Semambu water treatment plant has been a case study to link the nexus. As the industrial development is expanding each year, water demand for water supply also increases. Generally, heavy industrial activities consume more water than the other types of industries. In this study, heavy industrial activities of water consumption show an impact towards total water footprint of the particular water treatment plant in Kuantan river basin. In 2018, the percentage of highest industries that exist is manufacturing sector with 32% while the lowest is 1% compared to 2015, 2016 and 2017 that only scored 30% for manufacturing sector respectively. This shown that there is an increment growth in manufacturing sector in 2018 when they suddenly go up 2% higher compared to 3 years previously. The results focus on total water footprint accounting of Semambu water treatment plant (WTP) and the impact of total blue water consumptions for industrial activities. Finally, total water footprint of water treatment plants in Kuantan river basin will be sustained to cater the industrial needs except for Semambu WTP since Semambu is a gazetted area for industrial. Hence the new method of water utilisation for the industrial activities must be proposed to decrease the dependent towards WTP, especially in Semambu area.</jats:p>",

The design variables are tributary discharges and the target variables are the required concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) at CCMS. The relationship between target variables and design variables was identified using an artificial neural network (ANN). The database was obtained by Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) and the optimal tributary discharges were obtained by a genetic algorithm (GA) coupled with well trained ANN. The results showed the following results: (a) The relative prediction errors of ANN are mostly less than 5%. (b) When the inlet flow rate is 0 m3/s, 30 m3/s, 50 m3/s, 100 m3/s and 200 m3/s, the optimization total discharges of tributaries are 5.7 m3/s, 12.5 m3/s, 18.6 m3/s, 33.4 m3/s and 61.8 m3/s, respectively. (c) Most of optimization plans entirely satisfy the water quality requirements at CCMS except a few plans, in which the relative errors between optimized results and required values of COD and DO are less than 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.

Then, a case study is presented to illustrate the applicability of FNPP in the Bohai Sea for the enhancement of oil recovery.

The ubiquity of river meandering is evident from remotely sensed imagery, which has allowed for long‐term, high‐resolution studies of river channel change and form‐process relationships. Empirical, experimental, and theoretical research approaches have described two distinct relationships between channel curvature and river channel migration rates. In this study, we employ a novel application of time‐series algorithms to calculate migration rates and channel curvature at sub‐meander bend length scales using 6 decades of aerial imagery spanning 205 km of the Minnesota River and Root River, Minnesota, USA. Results from the Minnesota River provide the first empirical evidence demonstrating how migration‐curvature relations break down for rivers with low sediment supply, which is supported by the Root River data set. This not only highlights the importance of sediment supply as a driver of river migration, but also supports a simple means to detect river reaches lacking sediment supply. Furthermore, results from both rivers demonstrate that sub‐meander bend measurement scales are most appropriate for studying channel migration rates and further indicate that a quasi‐linear relationship—rather than the more commonly inferred peaked relationship—exists between channel curvature and migration rates. The highest migration rates are associated with the highest measured channel curvatures in our data set, after accounting for a spatial lag of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/jgrf21322-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:21699003:media:jgrf21322:jgrf21322-math-0001\" /> channel widths.

The basin is now punctuated by several dams, successful in attracting both international investors and fierce criticisms for their environmental and societal impacts. Surprisingly, no attention has been paid so far to the actual performance of these infrastructures: is hydropower supply robust with respect to the hydroclimatic variability characterizing Southeast Asia? When water availability is altered, what are the implications for power production costs and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions? To answer these questions, we focus on the Laotian–Thai grid—the first international power‐trade infrastructure developed in the region—and use a power system model driven by a spatially distributed hydrological‐water management model. Simulation results over a 30‐year period show that production costs and carbon footprint are significantly affected by droughts, which reduce hydropower availability and increase reliance on thermoelectric resources. Regional droughts across the Mekong basin are of particular concern, as they reduce the export of cheap hydropower from Laos to Thailand. To put the analysis into a broader climate‐water‐energy context, we show that the El Niño Southern Oscillation modulates not only the summer monsoon, but also the power system behavior, shaping the relationship between hydroclimatological conditions, power production costs, and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. Overall, our results and models provide a knowledge basis for informing robust management strategies at the water‐energy scale and designing more sustainable power plans in the Greater Mekong Subregion.</jats:p>",

The evidence from Arctic Russian settings is scarce. Aim: To assess blood mineral composition among residents of areas with low mineralization of water from underground sources distributed by centralized water supply systems in Arctic Russia. Methods: The study was performed in the town of Kirovsk, Murmansk region. Only permanent residents of the town aged 18-23 years participated. Concentrations of Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Si, Sn, Sr, Ti, Tl, V, Zn, Y in tap water and whole blood were determined by atomic emission spectrometry. Results: Tap water in Kirovsk has an increased pH value, with a total mineralization of 65.0 mg/l with the legal limit of 1000 mg/l). Magnesium and calcium concentrations were 1 000-1 500 and 150-300 times below maximum permissible (MPC) concentrations, re spectively. The concentration of aluminum exceeded MPC by 30-50 % while concentrations of other elements were tens to hundreds times below MPC. In blood, calcium concentration was slightly below the average value for healthy individuals while and the magnesium content corresponded to normal values. An increased concentration of boron (2.45 ± 0.11 mg/l) was revealed. Conclusions: Contrary to expectations, residents of the area with low mineral content of tap water did not have a significant decrease in concentrations of calcium and magnesium in whole blood. No signs of increased concentration of heavy metals in blood of the residents were observed. Despite the high concentration of aluminum in water, its concentration in whole blood is within the physiological limits. At the same time, an increased blood concentration of boron was revealed warranting further research.</jats:p>"

Taking the Zhuankou–Yangluo Reach (ZYR) of the Middle Yangtze River as an example, the spatial and temporal behaviors of leaked oil in the river under uniformly arranged piers with varying densities were studied based on a MIKE21 hydrodynamic and oil drift model. The results show that the oil spill spread is less affected by the piers when the upstream oil spill point is located on the other side of the shoreline with piers. However, the influence of the piers on the same shoreline of the oil spill point on oil spill transportation cannot be ignored. The piers significantly reduce the oil spill drift speed in the engineering area, resulting in a significant increase in slick retention time and slick area, especially when the density of piers is greater than 1.25 units/km. These results will provide useful reference for river management, for example, in the upstream river of the water conservation area, especially on the same bank as the water intake, where a large number of piers should not be built.</jats:p>",

We addressed this topic by conducting full factorial experiments with tomato plants to investigate the effects of NO3− or NH4+ supply under diurnal light (DL) or CL. We used plants at ages of 26 and 15 days after sowing to initiate the treatments, and we modulated the intensity of the stress induced by CL and an exclusive NH4+ supply from mild to strong.

Under strong stress, CL and exclusive NH4+ supply synergistically inhibited plant growth and reduced chlorophyll content. Under mild stress, when no synergetic effect between CL and NH4+ was apparent on plant growth and chlorophyll content, we found a synergetic effect of CL and NH4+ on the accumulation of several plant stress hormones, with an especially strong effect for jasmonic acid (JA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), the immediate precursor of ethylene, in xylem sap. This modulation of the hormonal composition suggests a potential role for these plant hormones in plant growth responses to the combined application of CL and NH4+. No synergetic effect was observed between CL and NH4+ for the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates or of mineral ions, indicating that these plant traits are less sensitive than the modulation of hormonal composition in xylem sap to the combined CL and NH4+ application. Under diurnal light, NH4+ did not affect the hormonal composition of xylem sap; however, N deficiency strongly increased the concentrations of phaseic acid (PA), JA, and salicylic acid (SA), indicating that decreased N concentration rather than the presence of NO3− or NH4+ in the nutrient solution drives the hormone composition of the xylem sap. In conclusion, N deficiency or a combined application of CL and NH4+ induced the accumulation of JA in xylem sap. This accumulation, in combination with other plant hormones, defines the specific plant response to stress conditions.</jats:p>"

The declaration of the Indonesian government in meeting the MDG’s target for zero slums has been followed by the district government of Klungkung with a focused policy and strategic direction. The identification of slum issues is carried out on several indicators for the conditions of water supply and wastewater services. The purpose of this paper is to make long-term planning to realize integrated domestic wastewater treatment until 2033. This research uses a qualitative approach with descriptive methods and data analysis was performed by data display, verification, and conclusion drawing. To overcome the problem of fulfilling raw water, efforts are made to handle it through plans for phases I, II, III, and IV. In the period from 2019-2023, a drinking water supply system will be developed by utilizing raw water from the Muara Unda Reservoir, which is 300 L/sec. In phase III, a transmission unit will be built in the raw water delivery system from the Penida Spring with an additional capacity of 20 L/sec. In Klungkung Regency, there is no centralized wastewater treatment plant to treat wastewater from this domestic activity. Most residents in Klungkung Regency dispose of their domestic waste/water through septic tanks (for black water), while gray water is directly channeled into drainage channels or directly discharged into rivers.</jats:p>",

Therefore, to make efficient use of diesel fuel requires a renewable energy-based power generation model by utilizing the natural potential around the area. This study to analyse the system models hybridization of Photovoltaic System with Palm oil Diesel (POD) to get power plants that have high reliability, low energy costs and low emissions for powering BTS in remote area located at a Sungai Ketupak Village of Ogan Komering Ilir-South Sumatera (Latitude 3o19.9’S and Longitude 105o38.9’E). The Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable Energy (HOMER) has been carried out to obtain an optimal design based on energy cost/kWh, annual operating costs, the daily loads demand, the NPV cost. The combination PV system and palm oil diesel will provide benefits for telecommunications companies in the savings for fuel generators. This system could also reduce gas emissions from hydrocarbon fuels. Therefore, the join of PV and palm oil diesel systems shows a good prospect of alternative energy for BTS tower energy sources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Local business leaders, policy makers, elected officials, city planners, emergency managers, and private citizens are responsible for, and deeply affected by, the performance of critical supply chains and related infrastructures. At the center of critical supply chains is the food-energy-water nexus (FEW); a nexus that is key to a community’s wellbeing, resilience, and sustainability. In the 21st century, managing a local FEW nexus requires accurate data describing the function and structure of a community’s supply chains. However, data is not enough; we need data-informed conversation and technical and social capacity building among local stakeholders to utilize the data effectively. There are some resources available at the mesoscale and for food, energy, or water, but many communities lack the data and tools needed to understand connections and bridge the gaps between these scales and systems. As a result, we currently lack the capacity to manage these systems in small and medium sized communities where the vast majority of people, decisions, and problems reside. This study develops and validates a participatory citizen science process for FEW nexus capacity building and data-driven problem solving in small communities at the grassroots level. The FEWSION for Community Resilience (F4R) process applies a Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR) framework to map supply chain data for a community’s FEW nexus, to identify the social network that manages the nexus, and then to generate a data-informed conversation among stakeholders. F4R was piloted and co-developed with participants over a 2-year study, using a design-based research process to make evidence-based adjustments as needed. Results show that the F4R model was successful at improving volunteers’ awareness about nexus and supply chain issues, at creating a network of connections and communication with stakeholders across state, regional, and local organizations, and in facilitating data-informed discussion about improvements to the system. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of F4R and discuss four recommendations for the successful application of the F4R model in other communities: 1) embed opportunities for co-created PPSR, 2) build social capital, 3) integrate active learning strategies with user-friendly digital tools, and 4) adopt existing materials and structure.</jats:p>"

That pressure has been placed on the resources available, resulting in increased environmental degradation as a result of the traditional linear model of make‐use‐dispose. Circular economy (CE) practices offer the opportunity for sustainable production based on the reuse‐remanufacture and recycling of resources for small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) to increase their sustainability, resulting in enhanced performance levels in terms of business strategies and environmental perspectives. But in academic literature, the role of people‐driven factors (PDFs) in the adoption of CE practices in the supply chains (SCs) of SMEs is limited. Therefore, to fill this literature gap, this research looks at analysing PDFs for the implementation of CE in the SMEs in developing countries in two phases. PDFs are identified from an extensive literature review; a DEMATEL technique is then employed to understand the significant influence of each factor in the adoption of CE practices in SCs by dividing them into cause–effect groups. The findings show that PDFs such as training and knowledge sharing, employee participation, leadership and management plus strategic alignment are considered to be the most important significant factors in the adoption. The findings of this study will help industrial managers to understand the significance of the role of PDFs for enhancing business strategies; these findings can reduce the negative environmental impact in the adoption of CE practices in the SCs of SMEs.</jats:p>",

However, as the scale of self-service payment terminals becomes larger and terminal equipment functions become more abundant, the failure rate of terminal equipment is also on the rise. Cloud computing can provide a large number of low-cost computing and storage resources, and has the characteristics of easy deployment and strong scalability, which can meet the software and hardware needs of big data analysis. Therefore, the effective integration of cloud computing and big data technology and the use of their respective advantages have important practical significance in the big data analysis of equipment failure. Completing the prediction of the failure rate of the terminal equipment according to the designed big data analysis framework will help to arrange the maintenance plan of the terminal equipment reasonably and improve the reliability of the power self-service payment terminal.</jats:p>",

The traditional agri-food production system does not offer easy traceability of the produce at any point of the supply chain, and hence, during a food-borne outbreak, it is very difficult to sift through food production data to track produce and the origin of the outbreak. In recent years, the blockchain based food production system has resolved this challenge; however, none of the proposed methodologies makes the food production data easily accessible, traceable and verifiable by consumers or producers using mobile/edge devices. In this paper, we propose FoodSQRBlock (Food Safety Quick Response Block), a blockchain technology based framework that digitises the food production information and makes it easily accessible, traceable and verifiable by the consumers and producers by using QR codes. We also propose a large-scale integration of FoodSQRBlock in the cloud to show the feasibility and scalability of the framework, as well as give an experimental evaluation to prove this.</jats:p>"

The method used is case study qualitative research through interviews, observation, documentation, document review &amp; corporate websites that produce data analysis. The results of this research data analysis produced the first proposition related to supply chain management practices, namely coordination in the flow of material, information, and finance that is being increased by PG Krebet efforts in maintaining better cooperative relations with farmer groups as suppliers. The second proposition relates to lean management practices, namely the efficiency of human resources and natural resources, reduction of lead time, and reduction of inventory is an activity that can increase added value to the company. The third proposition is related to green management practices, namely environmentally-friendly innovation in the operating system is a strategy to improve the application of environmental management. The synergy between the practice of lean and green supply chain in improving operational performance also results in a fourth proposition, namely the commitment of suppliers (farmer groups) to PG. Krebet will improve company efficiency and environmental performance which may improve product quality and flexibility and reduce costs. Suggestions for further research, which in this case study, can be continued in the entire supply chain from suppliers to consumers to better understand lean and green management practices in all sugar industry supply chain members.</jats:p>",

In mid-to-high latitudes, L-band measurements still suffer from large-scale and time-varying errors. Here, a simple method is proposed to mitigate the large-scale and time-varying errors. First, an optimal interpolation using a large correlation scale (~500 km) is used to map independently Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) level-3 (L3) data. The mapping is compared with the equivalent mapping of in situ observations to estimate the large-scale and seasonal biases. A second mapping is performed on adjusted SSS at the scale of SMOS/SMAP spatial resolution (~45 km). This procedure merges both products and increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the absolute SSS estimates, reducing the root-mean-square difference of in situ satellite products by about 26%–32% from mid- to high latitudes, respectively, in comparison with the existing SMOS and SMAP L3 products. However, in the Arctic Ocean, some issues on satellite retrieved SSS related to, for example, radio frequency interferences, land–sea contamination, and ice–sea contamination remain challenging to reduce given the low sensitivity of L-band radiometric measurements to SSS in cold water. Using the International Thermodynamic Equation Of Seawater—2010 (TEOS-10), the resulting level-4 SSS satellite product is combined with satellite-microwave SST products to estimate sea surface density, spiciness, and haline contraction and thermal expansion coefficients. For the first time, we illustrate how useful these satellite-derived parameters are to fully characterize the surface ocean water masses at large mesoscale.</jats:p>",

There are two factors that restrict the performance of RPC, one of which is the reactive power of the load, and the other is the system error. In order to eliminate the compensation error, a compensation optimization method is proposed. First, calculate the reactive power compensation value for the reactive power of the load. Second, introduce the amplitudes and phases of the primary currents of the V/v transformer as references for the compensation error caused by the system loss and then use fuzzy control to optimize compensation. The compensation method proposed in this paper is actually a feedforward control. In addition, this method balances the three-phase currents and enables RPC to be used in railway power supply systems with low locomotive power factors. The effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper has been confirmed by the simulation results.</jats:p>"

A limited search was carried out on PubMed and Web of Science for published scientific articles on oral health workforce planning models between 2010 to 2020. No restrictions were placed on the type of modelling philosophy, and all studies including supply, demand or needs based models were included. Rapid review methods guided the review process. Twenty-three studies from 15 countries were included in the review. A majority were from high-income countries (n = 17). Dentists were the sole oral health workforce group modelled in 13 studies; only five studies included skill mix (allied dental personnel) considerations. The most common application of modelling was a workforce to population ratio or a needs-based demand weighted variant. Nearly all studies presented weaknesses in modelling process due to the limitations in data sources and/or non-availability of the necessary data to inform oral health workforce planning. Skill mix considerations in planning models were also limited to horizontal integration within oral health professionals. Planning for the future oral health workforce is heavily reliant on quality data being available for supply, demand and needs models. Integrated methodologies that expand skill mix considerations and account for uncertainty are essential for future planning exercises.</jats:p>"

In the present paper, quantitative models are applied to support the decision-making purchasing management department of a retail company. Specifically, a multiperiod mathematical model was developed with the aim of optimizing decision-making of the purchasing managers. The developed model consists of a multiperiod Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming model, with the objective to minimize the ratio between how much is costing the company to move the products along the Supply Chain and the products’ costs. It is discussed how to order the product, what is the most advantageous storage mode and whether it is preferable to order once or twice a week. Real instances, provided by a Portuguese retail company, regarding the demand for one year are tested for two scenarii, which are used currently by the company. The results show that the proposed model can reduce, on both scenarios, the ratio between operational costs and merchandise costs, for almost all products, and therefore it can be an important tool for supporting decision-making of the purchasing manager.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to observe whether the Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has influenced consumer behavior regarding dairy products delivered directly from producers in Suceava County, Romania. The research is based on a survey conducted between April and May, 2020, and the analysis relies on both quantitative and qualitative methods (namely, anthropological and ethnographic). From the provided responses, it a change was observed in the future buying behavior on short food supply chains, in a positive sense. One of the key findings was that family represents the main environment for passing on the values that influence the buying behavior. Another key finding was that the behavioral changes on the short food supply chains exert pressure on their digital transformations.</jats:p>"

This study employed Microcystis aeruginosa for coagulation experiments. Effects of polyaluminum chloride (PAC), cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM), and pH value on cyanobacterial removal at exponential and decline phases by coagulation were investigated by measuring chlorophyll a. A mathematical model between factors and response variables was established using response surface methodology (RSM). Results showed that factors of CPAM dosage, PAC dosage, and pH value could strongly affect the removal ratio of Microcystis at both exponential and decline phases. RSM revealed that the order of influence factors on the removal of chlorophyll a was CPAM &amp;gt; PAC &amp;gt; pH for Microcystis at the exponential phase, and these orders of CPAM &amp;gt; PAC &amp;gt; pH (PAC coagulation) and CPAM &amp;gt; PAC &amp;gt; pH (CPAM coagulation) were for Microcystis at the decline phase. It suggested that the growth phase of cyanobacteria was also quite important to optimize the coagulation process. Besides, a fitted model was developed, and it could well predict the removal ratio of chlorophyll a by coagulation with various treatments. The model recommended dosages of CPAM (3.72 mg/L) and PAC (10.23 mg/L) for Microcystis at the exponential phase with a pH value of 8.25, and dosages of CPAM (5.98 mg/L) and PAC (17.81 mg/L) were for Microcystis at the decline phase with a pH value of 8.21. Overall, these results would provide a technical guideline of combining PAC and CPAM to treat cyanobacteria at exponential and decline phases.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we use the differential game theory considering the above two effects under an O2O (online to offline) environment. We investigate how these two effects impact supply chain performance. By the extended maximum principle, the optimal analytical solutions of the decision variables in two different game scenarios are obtained, i.e., with and without advertising cooperation. We conclude that the optimal wholesale price (advertising effort level, product quality level, and retail price) increases or decreases exponentially to its steady state, which depends on whether the initial goodwill is lower than the static goodwill or not. The analysis shows that the advertising lag effect has a negative impact on the supply chain, while the reference quality effect is positive. The vertical advertising cooperation strategy is effective in facilitating the channel performance. From a comparison analysis, we obtain that the manufacturer concentrates more effort on quality improvement if the advertising lag time is larger or if consumers are more sensitive to quality, and the manufacturer pays more attention to advertising relative to quality improvements with a higher advertising cost sharing ratio.</jats:p>",

These include restricted purchasing and consumption for certain individuals. In 2017, the Banned Drinker Register (BDR) was (re)introduced – a policy that involves placing persons who consume alcohol at harmful levels to themselves or others onto a register which prohibits the purchase of alcohol from take‐away liquor outlets. As a result, there is an incentive for banned drinkers to obtain alcohol through friends, family, and through the black market – referred to as secondary supply. Though the phenomenon of secondary supply is not new, the recent evaluation of the BDR highlighted a number of challenges of tackling the secondary supply of alcohol. Informed by Head's framework for assessing ‘wicked’ policy problems, this policy analysis uses data from interviews with stakeholders undertaken as part of two studies on alcohol policy and services. The findings present the limitations of the policy design and implementation context in preventing secondary supply of alcohol to banned drinkers. The paper concludes with implications for policy and research that better recognise the implementation context.</jats:p>",

The main objective of this study was to analyze the behavior of limnological parameters and the correlation with land use and land cover in the contribution basin of the Doutor Jo&amp;atilde;o Penido reservoir (CBJPR). The methodology was based on the analysis of water quality parameters, related to water samples collected from 2012 to 2015. Six sampling points were chosen from different locations: spring, medium course, main tributaries of the reservoir and the reservoir catchment. The parameters analyzed were turbidity, total solids (TS), oxygen consumed (OC), dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), E. Coli, temperature, pH and total dissolved solids (TDS). The Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau test was used to analyze the correlations between the parameters of water quality, land use and land cover in the CBJPR. In general, measured parameters showed better results in spring and in reservoir catchment, showing a worse quality of the water along the tributaries and the dilution power of the reservoir. The correlations pointed to the need for protection and preservation of forests in strategic locations to ensure good water quality.</jats:p>"

To date, very limited data exist on the range of environmental conditions in areas containing deep‐sea sponge grounds and which factors are driving their distribution and sustenance. We investigated oceanographic conditions at a deep‐sea sponge ground located on an Arctic Mid‐Ocean Ridge seamount. Hydrodynamic measurements were performed along Conductivity‐Temperature‐Depth transects, and a lander was deployed within the sponge ground that recorded near‐bottom physical properties as well as vertical fluxes of organic matter over an annual cycle. The data demonstrate that the sponge ground is found at water temperatures of −0.5°C to 1°C and is situated at the interface between two water masses at only 0.7° equatorward of the turning point latitude of semi‐diurnal lunar internal tides. Internal waves supported by vertical density stratification interact with the seamount topography and produce turbulent mixing as well as resuspension of organic matter with temporarily very high current speeds up to 0.72 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. The vertical movement of the water column delivers food and nutrients from water layers above and below toward the sponge ground. Highest organic carbon flux was observed during the summer phytoplankton bloom period, providing fresh organic matter from the surface. The flux of fresh organic matter is unlikely to sustain the carbon demand of this ecosystem. Therefore, the availability of bacteria, nutrients, and dissolved and particulate matter, delivered by tidally forced internal wave turbulence and transport by horizontal mean flows, likely plays an important role in meeting ecosystem‐level food requirements.</jats:p>",

Based on the original “dual system” teaching mode of college sports talents, this study incorporated the LDTA model to optimize and adjust it, so as to establish a new college sports talent training system. In order to prove the feasibility of the new sports talent training system, after analyzing the market economy of the local social sports industry and the basic situation of students, this paper studies the application of the new sports talent training system to the practical teaching of physical education students in 2017 in university X from 2019 to the first half of 2020, and compares the final scores of the students under the original teaching mode and the new sports talent training system. At present, the students' final scores under the new PE talent training system are generally higher than those under the original teaching mode. It is also found that for some practical skills courses, the students' performance under the new PE talent training system is obviously better than that under the original teaching mode. All these results show that the new sports talent training system established by the research is feasible, and has high practical value for promoting the reform of the supply of sports talents in Colleges and Universities and improving the professional skills and knowledge level of sports talents.</jats:p>"

Since 1980/1981, this phenomenon inspired a technological shift in rice production to Directly-seeded flooded rice on rainfed land. Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara province achieved self-sufficiency of rice in 1984, a year before national self-sufficiency in 1985. This research aims to analyze the impact of directly-seeded flooded rice as a climate change adaptation strategy on output supply and input demand. Time series data from 2000 to 2015 was analyzed by employing Translog Profit Function and Seemingly Unrelated Regression. The results showed that Directly-seeded flooded rice as a climate change adaptation strategy has a positive impact on output supply and input demand. It indicated (1) elastic output supply subject to self-price change of rice and labor, yet inelastic to the price of seed, Urea fertilizer, TSP, and NPK fertilizer. (2) All demand inputs were inelastic subject to self-price except casual labor and herbicide, and elastic subject to output price. Herbicide and fertilizers are complementary inputs to the directly-seeded flooded rice, while herbicide and casual labor are substitution inputs. The output and inputs price changes faced by farmers have both positive as well as negative impacts on output supply and input demand. It means that inputs such as seed, fertilizers, pesticides, and energy such as petrol for hand tractors are the main physical inputs to Directly-seeded flooded rice. Those inputs were very strategic economic goods, meanings that when the price changes occurred, it disturbed supply directly and performance of rice farming, either the production side, profits, or price risk. It also has food security impacts in Lombok.</jats:p>",

Ascorbic acid and sodium sulfite quenched the residual free chlorine to below detection within 5 seconds. Ammonium chloride did not quench the chlorine to below detection with up to a 70% molar excess, which agrees with published ammonium chloride-chlorine chemistry. With respect to the DBPs, ascorbic acid worked well for the trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, except for dibromoiodomethane, which exhibited 2.6–28% error when using ascorbic acid compared to non-quenched control samples. Sodium sulfite also worked well for the trihalomethanes (and performed similarly to ascorbic acid for dibromoiodomethane) and was the best performing quenching agent for MX and the inorganic DBPs, but contributed to the decay of several emerging DBPs, including several halonitromethanes and haloacetamides. Ammonium chloride led to considerable errors for many DBPs, including 27–31% errors in chloroform concentrations after 24 hours of storage. This work shows that ascorbic acid is suitable for many of the organic DBPs analyzed by gas chromatography-electron capture detection and that sodium sulfite may be used for simultaneous chlorite, chlorate, and bromate analysis.</jats:p>",

При оценке качества работы топливной аппаратуры учитывались: изменение характеристики подачи топлива; особенности распыливания топлива в начальной и конечной фа­зах впрыскивания; повышение стабильности последовательных циклов впрыскивания за счет увеличения активного хода плунжера; колебания остаточного давления в трубопро­воде высокого давления при последовательных циклах впрыскивания.

As a result of the research, the features of the fuel supply processes and the effect of alternative fuel on the serial fuel equipment injection characteristics during operation in nominal and partial modes were identified. Considering the quality of fuel equipment operation the following features were taken into account, they are: changing fuel supply characteristics; features of fuel atomization in the initial and final phases of injection; increasing stability of the injection in sequential cycles by increasing plunger active stroke; residual pressure oscillations in the high pressure line during injection consecutive cycles. Using the water-fuel emulsion it is possible to significantly increase a quality of marine diesel engine operation, to extend the stable fuel supply range of the serial fuel equipment both from the possibility of speed modes reducing during fine fuel feed and providing forced fuel feed due to absence of repeating injections.</jats:p>",

The retailer takes advantage of an online platform to sell vouchers and to get access to borrowing from a bank. By formulating a Stackelberg game model, we show the retailer’s possible order quantities in the cases without and with bank loan and analyze the impact of voucher sale on the retailer’s optimal choice of order quantity and the supplier’s optimal wholesale price. We find that a smaller voucher’s price induces the retailer to be more likely to order with loan from a bank while a larger voucher’s value induces an order quantity with the loan more difficult to be repaid. In addition, if voucher’s price is large, the supplier decides a wholesale price which leads the retailer not to borrow from a bank; and if voucher’s price is small, the supplier’s optimal decision is obtained by anticipating the retailer to borrow from a bank. We also analyze the impact of voucher sale in the presence of trade credit financing on the firms’ decisions. The results show that the voucher’s price should be small so that the large; otherwise, the retailer either does not borrow from the supplier or may not repay the supplier. Besides, the supplier decides a wholesale price so that the retailer does not borrow or can repay the supplier, except that the voucher’s value is large and the voucher’s price is medium.</jats:p>",

The performance of AWD practice was compared with the conventionally (CON) irrigated rice using non-weighing lysimeters. The study resulted that by managing the alternate wetting and drying up to 15 cm below the ground level, a significant reduction in water input (26–29% in kharif and 22–27% in rabi season) could be achieved under AWD. A reduction in evapotranspiration (about 6% in both kharif and rabi seasons) was also observed under AWD. Reduction in consumptive water footprint (about 2–3% in kharif and 2–5% in rabi) was obtained under AWD. Reductions in blue water footprints (7% in kharif and 4–5% in rabi) was also observed under AWD. On average, crop water use efficiency was significantly enhanced by 27–33% and 20–29% in the respective kharif and rabi seasons under AWD practice. Significant improvement in total water productivity by 29–37% and 23–35% in the respective two seasons exhibited the superiority of AWD over CON during the two years of field experiments.</jats:p>",

However, the loss of fresh produce in the supply chain has existed for a long time and is difficult to overcome. Some companies use their own information management systems or use information systems built by other companies to release and manage fresh agricultural product information in a timely manner, thereby reducing product loss caused by the “bullwhip effect.” However, this will also bring pressure on construction costs and the risk of information leakage. Based on the evolutionary game model, this paper conducts process modeling and analysis on the behavior of enterprise groups participating in information sharing. It is concluded that the greater the difference between the income obtained through information sharing and the cost of building information system, the higher the likelihood of enterprises participating in information sharing. In addition, the greater the profit from the construction of information platform, the smaller the profit of “free rider,” and the smaller the risk of information leakage, the greater the enthusiasm of enterprises to participate in information sharing. Finally, some suggestions are proposed from the perspective of maximizing supply chain benefits.</jats:p>",

It is shown that the key indicator of the development of renewable energy technologies in the Arctic zone and remote regions is the level of economically justified reduction of the “northern import” of fuel in the zone of decentralized energy supply, as well as cross-subsidization of energy tariffs for consumers of different target groups.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>A vast community of developing countries, like India, is still deprived of a proper water supply system. Such communities often depend on hand‐pumps, ponds, and ravines for their daily water needs. Government‐subsidized PV‐based water pumps have emerged as a boon for such communities. But intermittent nature of solar irradiation and unavailability at night time poses a big challenge. To mitigate this challenge, the present article proposes a stand‐alone PV‐based induction motor‐driven water pumping system serving a dual‐head, that is, an overhead storage tank and ground level supply. A single‐stage three‐phase high‐gain resonant inverter (HGRI) is proposed for driving the induction motor. A back‐ended wide bandgap (WBG) device‐based boost converter is used to extract maximum power from PV by employing the MPPT algorithm. HGRI injects sinusoidal current to the induction motor while operating it through PV power matched modified V/f control algorithm, thus minimizing the torque ripple. HGRI coupled with boost converter provides a high‐gain voltage boost at the output; enabling wide input voltage operation, which increases the operability of the system in high as well as low irradiation level. The practicality of the system is validated on a laboratory‐developed hardware test bed with a 1.5HP induction motor.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The modern food supply faces many challenges. The global population continues to grow and people are becoming wealthier, so the food production system must respond by creating enough high-quality food to feed everyone with minimal damage to our environment. The number of people suffering or dying from diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, continues to rise, which is partly linked to overconsumption of highly processed foods, especially high-calorie or rapidly digestible foods. After falling for many years, the number of people suffering from starvation or malnutrition is rising, and thishas been exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The highly integrated food supply chains that spread around the world are susceptible to disruptions due to policy changes, economic stresses, and natural disasters, as highlighted by the recent pandemic. In this perspective article, written by members of the Editorial Committee of the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, we highlight some of the major challenges confronting the modern food supply chain as well as how innovations in policy and technology can be used to address them. Pertinent technological innovations include robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced diagnostics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, gene editing, vertical farming, and soft matter physics. Many of these technologies are already being employed across the food chain by farmers, distributors, manufacturers, and consumers to improve the quality, nutrition, safety, and sustainability of the food supply. These innovations are required to stimulate the development and implementation of new technologies to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and efficient food production system. Where appropriate, these technologies should be carefully tested before widespread implementation so that proper risk–benefit analyses can be carried out. They can then be employed without causing unforeseen adverse consequences. Finally, it is important to actively engage all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain throughout the development and testing of these new technologies to support their adoption if proven safe and effective.</jats:p>",

Taking into account the directed search proposed in the algorithm and excluding non-optimal combinations at each iteration, the number of calculations is significantly reduced compared to a simple enumeration of options. In addition to practical application, the algorithm allows you to study the “heat load density” indicator, which affects the decision on the degree of centralization of the heat supply scheme, and at the same time take into account the uneven distribution of consumers on the ground, their number, the heterogeneity of heat loads and achieving a balance in the environment.</jats:p>",

Using multivariate statistical analysis, the current study investigated the spatial variations of water quality in the Chaobai River restored by reclaimed water during the high-flow period. Hierarchical cluster analysis (CA) classified the 11 sampling sites into four clusters, namely most polluted, highly polluted, moderately polluted, and lowly polluted sections. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that pH, TDS, EC, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl−, SO42−, NO3−-N, and TN had significant spatial differences among four clusters (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean value of total nitrogen (TN) in the most polluted site exceeded the guideline (15 mg/L) of the Water Quality Standard for Scenic Environment Use, reaching 22.3 mg/L. Principal component analysis (PCA) extracted three principal components (PCs) accounting for 81.5% of the total variance in the data set of water quality. The three PCs reflected the chemical characteristics of reclaimed water, mineral pollution, and nutrient pollution, respectively. With the ordination biplot of sampling sites defined by the first and second PCs, PCA provided a classification of sampling sites based on the similarity of pollution sources, which supported the results of CA. The results revealed that water quality of the Chaobai River restored by reclaimed water was affected by untreated domestic and agricultural sewage with nitrogen and minerals being the main pollutants along the river basin. This study showed rivers restored by reclaimed water had significant spatial variations of water quality, demonstrating effectiveness of multivariate statistical methods on water quality analysis.</jats:p>",

To reduce DC power consumption, the drain voltage was set to 0.5 V with competitive performance in the gain and the noise figure. High-Q shunt capacitors were employed at the gate terminal of the core transistors to move input matching points for easy matching with a compact transformer. The four stages amplifier fabricated in 40-nm bulk complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) showed a peak gain of 24.5 dB at 71.3 GHz and 3‑dB bandwidth of more than 10 GHz in 68–78 GHz range with approximately 4.8-mW power consumption per stage. Gate-bias control of the second stage in which feedback capacitances were neutralized with cross-coupled capacitors allowed us to vary the gain by around 21 dB in the operating frequency band. The noise figure was estimated to be better than 5.9 dB in the operating frequency band from the full electromagnetic (EM) simulation.</jats:p>"

To understand the ecological trajectory of lakes used as freshwater supply, we conducted a paleolimnological assessment on two supplemental sources in Igloolik, Nunavut, Arctic Canada. A stratigraphic examination of biological indicators (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) allowed for paleotemperature reconstructions with decadal and centennial resolution over the past 2000 years. Between 200 and 1900 CE, the sub-fossil chironomid community was comprised of cold-water taxa, such as Abiskomyia, Micropsectra radialis-type, and Paracladius. Reconstructed temperatures were consistent with known climate anomalies during this period. A rapid shift in the composition of the chironomid assemblages to those with higher temperature optima ( Chironomus anthracinus-type, Dicrotendipes, and Tanytarsus lugens-type) in the late 20th century was observed in both systems. Our results demonstrate that these ecosystems are undergoing marked transformations to warmer, more nutrient-rich environments, and suggest that water sustainability pressures will likely continue in tandem with ongoing climate change. To contextualize the influence of recent warming and elucidate the status of freshwater resources over the longer term, paleolimnological methods can be usefully applied as components of vulnerability assessments. </jats:p>",

Hence, the groundwater samples from three sources (deep well, semi-deep well, and aqueducts), located in six basins of Iran (Urmia Lake (UL), Sefid-rud (SR), Karkheh (K), Kavir-Markazi (KM), Gavkhouni (G), and Hamun-e Jaz Murian (HJM)) with various climate conditions, were collected during 2004–2018. The results of the WGEP model with data de-noising showed the best performance in estimating the EC variable, considering all types of groundwater resources with various climatic conditions. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values of the WGEP model were varied from 162.068 to 348.911, 73.802 to 171.376, 29.465 to 351.489, 118.149 to 311.798, 217.667 to 430.730, and 76.253 to 162.992 μScm−1 in the areas of UL, SR, K, KM, G, and HJM basins. The WGEP model's performance (R-values) for deep wells, semi-deep wells, and aqueducts of the areas of the KM basin associated with the arid steppe cold (Bsk) dominant climate classification was the best. Also, the WGEP's extracted mathematical equations could be used for EC estimating in other basins.</jats:p>",

Retailers receive the products from the manufacturer with paying partial pre-payment to ensure the replenishment of order. On the other hand, the manufacturer provides partial free transportation facility to the retailers due to pre-payment. The corresponding problem has been formulated mathematically as a profit maximization problem and then solved it analytically.

Through the development and usage of a multi-choice goal programming model solved by an improved algorithm, this article investigates sustainability strategies for carbon regulations mechanisms. We first propose a sustainable logistics model that considers assorted vehicle types and gas emissions involved with product transportation. We then construct a bi-objective model that minimizes total cost as the first objective function and follows environmental considerations in the second one. With our novel robust-heuristic optimization approach, we seek to support the decision-makers in comparison and selection of carbon emission policies in supply chains in complex settings with assorted vehicle types, demand and economic uncertainty. We deploy our model in a case-study to evaluate and analyse two carbon reduction policies, i.e., carbon-tax and cap-and-trade policies. The results demonstrate that our robust-heuristic methodology can efficiently deal with demand and economic uncertainty, especially in large-scale problems. Our findings suggest that governmental incentives for a cap-and-trade policy would be more effective for supply chains in lowering pollution by investing in cleaner technologies and adopting greener practices.</jats:p>",

This paper will make up for these literature gaps. From the perspective of the green supply chain management, this paper integrates various authoritative standards and adopts two methods, “R clustering” and “variation coefficient analysis”, to establish a CSR performance evaluation system of China’s transportation industry. Applying the mean square error index weighting method analyzes the performance of 74 companies in China’s transportation industry in 2018 to verify the rationality of the evaluation system. The results find that this industry generally scores low and the performance of responsibilities of different sub-sectors in this industry is different, but the overall performance trend is improving. This research has implications for China’s transportation industry to improve CSR levels from the perspective of green supply chain management, for managers and stakeholders who are committed to improving China’s CSR green and sustainable development, and for the development of CSR in developing countries and emerging markets.</jats:p>"

In this work, the most important SD variables associated with inventory management were identified. These variables were integrated as cost elements within a nondeterministic inventory control model to include SD criteria within inventory supply strategies. Through the assessment of the proposed integrated model, it was determined that, although SD practices involve additional investments, specific practices such as reuse/recycling and government incentives can increase revenue and profits.

The research problem considers the relationship between human critical success factors and the adoption of low‐carbon management practices. Quantitative analysis through structural equation modeling shows the three branches of hypothesis to be accepted—the first with a higher coefficient than the second and the second with a higher coefficient than the third. It was observed that human factors influence low‐carbon product management practices the most, followed by process practices and finally logistics practices. Qualitative multiple‐case study research shows that companies are at different stages of maturity in relation to low‐carbon management organizational practices, ranging from the highest stage to the lowest. It was found that the intensity of the presence of human critical success factors was higher where organizations had greater adoption of low‐carbon management practices.</jats:p>",

Optimal pricing strategy and profits of supply chain members under dual channels are investigated respectively in this paper. Comparing the optimal profit under traditional single-channel and dual-channel supply chain, we obtain the condition that the internet operating cost should satisfy. Given the situation where the supplier obtains profit while the retailer loses after the supplier introduced the internet channel, this paper proposes a revenue-sharing contract to make up for the loss of the retailer and achieves a win–win situation.

Studies have revealed that various organisms are directly dependent on microalgae, as well as being primary producers, they are irreplaceable sources of food. Therefore, the aimed of the study was to evaluate the limnological conditions and carry out a survey of planktonic microalgae in the Chlorophyta division of the Chlorophyceae class of the supply weir and an effluent from the Carlos Eduardo Matiazze Fish Farming Center, Presidente Médici, RO, Brazil. For that, the physical-chemical parameters temperature, oxygen dissolved in water (ODA), pH, transparency, alkalinity, hardness, electrical conductivity in water (CEA), carbon dioxide and total ammonia concentration (CAT) were analyzed. The results were compared with the norms established by CONAMA Resolution 357, of 2005 fresh waters, especially class 2. And also, the survey of chlorophytes was carried out, and the analyzes of the samples were carried out by means of slide preparations for immediate reading through the observation under the binocular optical microscope. The microalgae species of the Chlorophyta division of the Chlorophyceae class were identified in a taxonomic category of order, family, genus and species. The weir water showed acceptable values, according to CONAMA, for the parameters analyzed here for most of the year. The effluent also expressed acceptable values ​​according to the legislation, with the exception of dissolved oxygen with a value of 1.7 mg/L. Concerning the survey of chlorophytes, it was observed that the weir is rich and diversified, which can be an indicator of pollutants and contamination since the weir is exposed to a large amount of effluents.</jats:p>"

The study assessed the complex interactions of the factors using a network approach. The assessment was to understand the complex interaction of the factors resulting from their cause-effect relationship that influence the sustainability of access to improved water services in a rural municipality of South Africa. The results highlighted that limited budget, limited or no water supply and improper operation and maintenance were critical factors resulting from the cause-effect relationship of other factors that influenced the sustainability of access to improved water services in the study area. We conclude that critical factors with a cause-effect relationship can influence the sustainability of access to improved water services. As a result, this deprives rural communities of the benefits derived from accessing improved water services. We recommend the use of the findings by the relevant authorities responsible for water services provision to inform planning, management policies to address challenges identified to contribute to sustainability of access to improved water services.</jats:p>",

The coupling of both models enables a detailed agent- and activity-based demand model, in which travelers have the option to use ride-pooling based on real-time offers of an optimized ride-pooling operation. On the one hand, this approach allows the application of detailed mode-choice models based on agent-level attributes coming from mobiTopp functionalities. On the other hand, existing state-of-the-art ride-pooling optimization can be applied to utilize the full potential of ride-pooling. The introduced interface allows mode choice based on real-time fleet information and thereby does not require multiple iterations per simulated day to achieve a balance of ride-pooling demand and supply. The introduced methodology is applied to a case study of an example model where in total approximately 70,000 trips are performed. Simulations with a simplified mode-choice model with varying fleet size (0–150 vehicles), fares, and further fleet operators’ settings show that (i) ride-pooling can be a very attractive alternative to existing modes and (ii) the fare model can affect the mode shifts to ride-pooling. Depending on the scenario, the mode share of ride-pooling is between 7.6% and 16.8% and the average distance-weighed occupancy of the ride-pooling fleet varies between 0.75 and 1.17. </jats:p>",

This assumption, however, requires validation by further studies that focus on mechanisms that regulate the water availability in mixtures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Construction and demolition waste (CDW) substantially contributes to environmental degradation because of its intrinsic characteristics of fast and high generation volume, low recycling rate, and low revenue margins. A systemic problem is that recycling facilities are not usually a part of a reverse supply chain (RSC) specific for CDW. This makes the recovery process costs prohibitive, especially where companies are unable to receive and process large volumes of waste continuously. This paper presents a systematic analysis of the extant literature and utilizes the results accrued to develop a conceptual RSC model for CDW. In so doing, the research seeks to provide clarity on this phenomenon, while simultaneously stimulating wider academic discourse and further research endeavours. A mixed philosophies epistemological design was adopted using both interpretavism and constructivism to undertake a qualitative systematic analysis of the literature. A process diagram was produced to represent the conceptual model (CM) and thematically group the nodes into three key swim lanes that delineate the boundaries between distribution, manufacturing, and sourcing and warehousing processes. Within each swim lane, stakeholders were incorporated as key actors. A further layer of nuanced complexity was added to illustrate the key actors involved in the process, government strategies, and activity flow paths. This novel CM offers both practical and theoretical contributions to existing knowledge and signposts a future research direction. Such work will demystify reverse logistics for managing CDW, and assist government policy-makers to develop informed policies that reduce the negative environmental impact of construction activities. </jats:p>",

However, the roles of SLs and their downstream genes in NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>‐induced root elongation remain unclear.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The enhancement of the potential for reducing food insecurity and poverty through potato cultivation in Mali is largely limited by difficult access to quality seed. In trying to find ways to reduce these shortcomings outlined above that work has been done. The objective of this work was to assess the economic profitability of the local potato seed sourcing scheme from in vitro propagation and to analyze the competitiveness of the sourcing scheme from imported elite seed. The technical and economic feasibility of the local potato seed supply scheme was assessed at five levels. The first concerns the production of vitro-plants in the laboratory, the second the production of mini zero generation tubers (G0). Regarding the other three levels of evaluation, they were carried out in collaboration with the seed cooperatives by successive multiplication from mini-tubers to obtain seeds of one “G1”, two “G2” and three “G3” generations\". The profitability of the procurement scheme from the elite imported and multiplied once seed was evaluated in order to analyze its competitiveness in relation to the local circuit. The valuation indicates positive profit margins. However, it should be noted that the economic efficiency coefficients of vitro-propagation (0.77) and tunnel multiplication (0.75) are less than 1. The production cost of one kilogram of G3 is equal to at 463.39 F CFA. A profit margin of 456.61 F CFA / kg emerges between this unit production cost and the selling price of imported seeds, which amounts on average to 920 F CFA / kg. The production of plants is technically feasible and profitable with a cost price of one kg of G3 in the order of 500 to 600 F CFA against 900 to 1000 F CFA / kg for imported seed.&#x0D;\nLa valorisation du potentiel de réduction de l’insécurité alimentaire et de la pauvreté à travers la culture de la pomme de terre au Mali est limitée en grande partie par l’accès difficile à la semence de qualité. En essayant de trouver des moyens pour réduire ces insuffisances soulignées ci-dessus que ce travail a été effectué. Le présent travail avait pour objectif d’évaluer la rentabilité économique du schéma d’approvisionnement locale en semences de pomme de terre à partir de la vitro propagation et d’analyser la compétitivité du schéma d’approvisionnement à partir de la semence élite importées. La faisabilité technico-économique du schéma d’approvisionnement local en semences de pomme de terre était évaluée à cinq niveaux. Le premier concerne la production de vitro-plants au laboratoire, le deuxième la production de mini tubercules de génération zéro (G0). Pour ce qui concerne les trois autres niveaux d’évaluation, ils ont été réalisés en collaboration avec les coopératives semencières par multiplications successives à partir de mini-tubercules pour obtenir des semences de génération une «G1», deux «G2» et trois «G3». La rentabilité, du schéma d’approvisionnement à partir de la semence élite importée et multipliée une fois, a été évaluée en vue d’analyser sa compétitivité en rapport avec le circuit local. L’évaluation indique des marges bénéficiaires positives. Cependant, il faut remarquer que les coefficients d’efficacité économiques de la vitro-propagation (0,77) et de la multiplication sous tunnels (0,75) sont inférieurs à 1. Le coût de production d’un kilogramme de G3 est égal à 463,39 F CFA. Une marge bénéficiaire de 456,61 F CFA / kg se dégage entre ce coût de production unitaire et le prix de vente des semences importées qui s’élève en moyenne à 920 F CFA / kg. La production de plants est techniquement faisable et rentable avec un coût de revient d’un kg de G3 de l’ordre de 500 à 600 F CFA contre 900 à 1 000 F CFA / kg pour la semence importée.</jats:p>"

Esta condição ficou evidenciada no município de Foz do Iguaçu em 2015, quando a população foi atingida por uma forte chuva de granizo que causou danos sociais e estruturais. Desde o ocorrido, inexiste uma cadeia de suprimento humanitária que atenda as necessidades frente a um estado de calamidade. Sendo assim, esta pesquisa objetivou-se propor a fase de preparação de uma cadeia de suprimento humanitária para o município e, neste contexto, a pesquisa foi conduzida sob a abordagem qualitativa, de natureza aplicada, caracterizada como um estudo descritivo e propositivo. Os procedimentos adotados foram a pesquisa documental e bibliográfica, com coleta de dados realizada por meio de entrevistas não estruturadas e questionário.

Evaluating the supply of bus service requires the consideration of demand from various urban activities, such as residential and job-related activities. Although various evaluation methods have been explored from different perspectives, it remains a challenging issue. This study proposes a spatial statistical approach by comparing the density of the potential demand and supply of bus services at bus stops. The potential demand takes jobs-housing locations into account, and the supply of bus services considers bus stops and their associated total number of daily bus arrivals. The kernel density estimation (KDE) and spatial autocorrelation analyses are employed to investigate the coupling relationship between the demand and supply densities at global and local scales. A coupling degree index (CDI) is constructed to standardize the measurement of demand-supply balance. A case study in Wuhan, China demonstrated that: (1) the spatial distribution of bus stops is reasonable at global level, (2) Seriously unbalanced locations for bus services have been detected at several stops. Related adjustments that can improve these defects are highly recommended.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Leveraging the potential flexibility of large electrical loads has become an attractive option for maintaining grid reliability, especially in electric grids with high penetrations of variable renewable energy. The water sector is a particularly attractive option for demand‐side flexibility due to its vast water storage infrastructure, large interruptible pumping loads, and energy generation opportunities. Shifting the timing of water supply and wastewater utility operations can reduce peak load and temporally align energy‐consuming activities with periods of cheap electricity prices and/or high renewable energy generation. This paper presents a general overview of demand‐side management strategies in water and wastewater systems, focusing primarily on demand‐response measures. We find that while there is consensus in the literature about the potential for water systems to provide flexible demand‐side management services, there is a need for developing comprehensive water‐energy models to examine the value of load management as a source of revenue for water utilities and as a source of flexibility for the electric grid. More experimental studies and simulation efforts are also needed to address the technical complexities and water quality concerns associated with interrupting water and wastewater utility operations.</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:<jats:list list-type=\"simple\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>Engineering Water &gt; Sustainable Engineering of Water</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Engineering Water &gt; Planning Water</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p>",

The freight trains number should be 107 pairs per day, a raft of pushing locomotives in the odd direction up to 19 units. The section transportation capacity will increase to 116.7 million tons per year. According to the specified operation parameters, with the growth of cargo turnover on the Irkutsk – Slyudyanka section by 2023, the available capacity shortage will be 14 pairs of trains. In freight traffic, if all provided reserve lines of the the regulatory schedule are used, the capacity deficit will be 11 pairs of various categories trains. The article offers a solution of the existing section power supply devices strengthening problem until the inter-train interval of 8 minutes is reached, for this purpose, the technical parameters of the section substations are considered, and the performance indicators that can provide reliable and cost-effective working conditions are determined. The operation conditions of a traction power network (TPN) of the Bolshoy Lug – Slyudyanka-II section under the existing traffic schedule and under the prospective train schedule are compared. Traction calculations have a special role, since they serve as the basis for drawing up optimal train schedules, determining the railway lines capacity, effectively placing separate points, traction substations, fuel depots, determining the locomotives electricity and fuel consumption rate, solving other practical problems. Traction operation calculation of the electrified mountain pass section of the Bolshoy Lug – Slyudyanka-II railway line was performed using the KORTES software package. The power supply parameters of a given section were used as input data: the separate points number and location, the current speed limits for trains on this section, the longitudinal profile of the railway track, the categories and types of trains that pass through the section, the trains weights and the electric rolling stock types used in the calculation.</jats:p>",

A gill-piece separation device is used for the removal of viscous sediment, which helps to reduce the sediment concentration and decrease the burden on the filter. In this study, using the water–sediment separation efficiency as an evaluation index, a uniform orthogonal experiment was conducted to study the flow rate, sediment concentration, and gill-piece spacing using a physical model. Based on the experimental results of the physical model, multiple linear regression and projection pursuit regression were used for analysis. The results showed that the order of the factors affecting the water–sediment separation efficiency was as follows: flow rate at muddy water inlet &amp;gt; gill-piece spacing &amp;gt; sediment concentration. The correlation coefficients of the water–sediment separation efficiency models established using multiple linear regression and projection pursuit regression were 0.93 and 0.98, respectively. Both models could predict the water–sediment separation efficiency and determine the optimal working conditions of the gill-piece separation device.</jats:p>",

The present study investigated the ultimate strength and collapse behavior of the simply supported curved plate under a longitudinal compressive load. To do this, experimental apparatuses for evaluating the buckling collapse test of the curved plates was developed. Then, a series of buckling collapse experiments was carried out by considering the flank angle, slenderness ratio, and aspect ratio of plates. To examine the fundamental buckling and collapse behavior of the curved plate, elastoplastic large deflection analysis was performed using the commercial finite element analysis program. On the basis of both the experimental and FE analysis, the effects of the flank angle, slenderness ratio, and aspect ratio on the characteristics of the buckling and collapse behavior of the curved plates are discussed. Finally, the empirical design formula for predicting the ultimate strength of curved plates was derived.

Even pregnant females with initially iron‐replete stores develop iron‐deficiency anemia, due to inadequate iron absorption. In anemic females, the maternal iron supply is dedicated to maintaining iron metabolism in the fetus and placenta. Here, using a mouse model of iron deficiency in pregnancy, we show that iron recycled from senescent erythrocytes becomes a predominant source of this microelement that can be transferred to the placenta in females with depleted iron stores. Ferroportin is a key protein in the molecular machinery of cellular iron egress. We demonstrate that under iron deficiency in pregnancy, levels of ferroportin are greatly reduced in the duodenum, placenta and fetal liver, but not in maternal liver macrophages and in the spleen. Although low expression of both maternal and fetal hepcidin predicted ferroportin up‐regulation in examined locations, its final expression level was very likely correlated with tissue iron status. Our results argue that iron released into the circulation of anemic females is taken up by the placenta, as evidenced by high expression of iron importers on syncytiotrophoblasts. Then, a substantial decrease in levels of ferroportin on the basolateral side of syncytiotrophoblasts, may be responsible for the reduced transfer of iron to the fetus. As attested by the lowest decrease in iron content among analyzed tissues, some part is retained in the placenta. These findings confirm the key role played by ferroportin in tuning iron turnover in iron‐deficient pregnant mouse females and their fetuses.</jats:p>",

This paper takes the kitchen waste producing biodiesel as the object to design and optimize the biodiesel supply chain in order to improve the sustainable development of biodiesel industry and the operational efficiency of the biodiesel supply chain. By designing a sustainable biodiesel supply chain model under defined conditions, it proposes strategic and tactical decisions related to location, production, inventory, and distribution within multiple planning cycles. In order to effectively solve the model, a Pareto optimal NSGAII heuristic algorithm is proposed and applied to a practical case study of restaurants in Jiangsu Province. The efficiency of the method and the optimal solution are verified by a case study.

We performed an untargeted serum metabolomic analysis in 14 controls, 16 patients with ALD without cirrhosis (NC), 27 patients with compensated cirrhosis, and 79 patients with decompensated ALC. We identified two metabolic fingerprints associated with ALC development (38 metabolites) and those associated with hepatic decompensation (64 metabolites) in ALC. The cirrhosis‐associated fingerprint (eigenmetabolite) showed a better capability to differentiate ALC from NC than the aspartate aminotransferase–to‐platelet ratio index score. The eigenmetabolite associated with hepatic decompensation showed an increasing trend during the disease progression and was positively correlated with the Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score. These metabolic fingerprints belong to the metabolites in lipid metabolism, amino acid pathway, and intermediary metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">Conclusion:</jats:italic> The metabolomic fingerprints suggest the disturbance of the metabolites associated with cellular energy supply as an underlying mechanism in the development and progression of alcoholic cirrhosis.</jats:p>",

In this article, a hybrid nanogenerator that contains two working parts, —the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) in sliding independent layer mode and the electromagnetic generator (EMG) in rotating mode, is reported. The hybrid generator can effectively broaden the output voltage range while shortening the voltage boost time.

Also the hybrid nanogenerator can stably power 200 light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) and hygro‐thermograph after working for 2 s. Compared with the method of supplying power to electronic devices after a long period of energy storage, the triboelectric‐electromagnetic hybrid nanogenerator that is designed can realize real‐time power supply for wireless sensor nodes and Bluetooth modules at a wind speed of 10.5 m s<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>, and the voltage at both ends is always maintained dynamic equilibrium.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main challenge facing greenhouse designers is to achieve environment-appropriate greenhouses, especially in tropical regions. The excess radiant energy transmitted into the greenhouse predisposes plants to photo-inhibition and consequently reduces crop production. Lately, photovoltaic (PV) modules are equipped as a greenhouse rooftop to minimize the level of irradiation and air temperature in the greenhouse, simultaneously improving its energy consumption. Nevertheless, due to the low level of irradiation, denser conventional PV internal shading would influence the cultivated crops’ growth. Thus, Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) possesses several attractive features such as transparent, sensitive to low light levels, and various color options that render DSSC a perfect choice able to serve substantially in energy buildings. This study assessed the microclimate conditions inside the greenhouse with semi-transparent DSSC mounted on top of it, describing the Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD) (µmol m−2 s−1), Vapor Pressure Deficit VPD (kPa), relative humidity (%), and also temperature (°C). The Overall Thermal Transfer Value (OTTV), which indicates the average thermal energy transmission rate across the external layer of a structure envelope, is also presented. The effects of colored DSSC in altering the spectral of sunlight in reference to the Orthosiphon stamineus growth responses were determined. The information of the condition of DSSC greenhouse microclimate helps to identify the information for designing PV greenhouses and to produce income from both electric power and agronomic activity.</jats:p>"

Rapid immunization of the world human population against a widespread, continually evolving, and highly pathogenic virus is an unprecedented challenge, and many different vaccine approaches are being pursued to meet this task. Engineered filamentous bacteriophage (phage) have unique potential in vaccine development due to their inherent immunogenicity, genetic plasticity, stability, cost-effectiveness for large-scale production, and proven safety profile in humans. Herein we report the design, development, and initial evaluation of targeted phage-based vaccination approaches against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by using dual ligand peptide-targeted phage and adeno-associated virus/phage (AAVP) particles. Towards a unique phage- and AAVP-based dual-display candidate approach, we first performed structure-guided antigen design to select six solvent-exposed epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein for display on the recombinant major capsid coat protein pVIII. Targeted phage particles carrying one of these epitopes induced a strong and specific humoral response. In an initial experimental approach, when these targeted phage particles were further genetically engineered to simultaneously display a ligand peptide (CAKSMGDIVC) on the minor capsid protein pIII, which enables receptor-mediated transport of phage particles from the lung epithelium into the systemic circulation (termed “dual-display”), they enhanced a systemic and specific spike (S) protein-specific antibody response upon aerosolization into the lungs of mice. In a second line of investigation, we engineered targeted AAVP particles to deliver the entire S protein gene under the control of a constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, which induced tissue-specific transgene expression stimulating a systemic S protein-specific antibody response. As proof-of-concept preclinical experiments, we show that targeted phage- and AAVP-based particles serve as robust yet versatile enabling platforms for ligand-directed immunization and promptly yield COVID-19 vaccine prototypes for further translational development.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance</jats:title><jats:p>The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has accounted for over 2.5 million deaths and an unprecedented impact on the health of mankind worldwide. Over the past several months, while a few COVID-19 vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization and are currently being administered to the entire human population, the demand for prompt global immunization has created enormous logistical challenges--including but not limited to supply, access, and distribution--that justify and reinforce the research for additional strategic alternatives. Phage are viruses that only infect bacteria and have been safely administered to humans as antibiotics for decades. As experimental proof-of-concept, we demonstrated that aerosol pulmonary vaccination with lung-targeted phage particles that display short epitopes of the S protein on the capsid as well as preclinical vaccination with targeted AAVP particles carrying the S protein gene elicit a systemic and specific immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompetent mice. Given that targeted phage- and AAVP-based viral particles are sturdy yet simple to genetically engineer, cost-effective for rapid large-scale production in clinical grade, and relatively stable at room temperature, such unique attributes might perhaps become additional tools towards COVID-19 vaccine design and development for immediate and future unmet needs.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Three game theory models, including the manufacturer Stackelberg (MS) model, retailer Stackelberg (RS) model, and vertical Nash (VN) model, are developed to study the pricing and greenness level decisions in a two-echelon sustainable supply chain, where one risk-averse manufacturer sells green products through one risk-averse retailer. This paper shows that when selling through a more risk-averse retailer, the risk-averse manufacturer prefers to provide a product with a higher level of greenness and achieve a greater utility regardless of the power structure. A manufacturer as a follower may have stronger motivation to increase the product’s level of greenness than one in a more balanced supply chain when the green technology investment coefficient is sufficiently low. With regard to the power structure, the channel leadership is not necessary to for the manufacturer to achieve higher utility, which depends on the green technology investment coefficient, greenness level sensitivity, and players’ risk aversion.</jats:p>",

Among the largest fires was the 280 000 ha Green Wattle Creek Fire, which burned large forested areas of the Warragamba catchment. This protected catchment provides critical ecosystem services for Lake Burragorang, one of Australia's largest urban supply reservoirs delivering ~85% of the water used in Greater Sydney. Water New South Wales (WaterNSW) is the utility responsible for managing water quality in Lake Burragorang. Its postfire risk assessment, done in collaboration with researchers in Australia, the UK, and United States, involved (i) identifying pyrogenic contaminants in ash and soil; (ii) quantifying ash loads and contaminant concentrations across the burned area; and (iii) estimating the probability and quantity of soil, ash, and associated contaminant entrainment for different rainfall scenarios. The work included refining the capabilities of the new WEPPcloud-WATAR-AU model (Water Erosion Prediction Project cloud-Wildfire Ash Transport And Risk-Australia) for predicting sediment, ash, and contaminant transport, aided by outcomes from previous collaborative postfire research in the catchment. Approximately two weeks after the Green Wattle Creek Fire was contained, an extreme rainfall event (~276 mm in 72 h) caused extensive ash and sediment delivery into the reservoir. The risk assessment informed on-ground monitoring and operational mitigation measures (deployment of debris-catching booms and adjustment of the water supply system configuration), ensuring the continuity of safe water supply to Sydney. WEPPcloud-WATAR-AU outputs can prioritize recovery interventions for managing water quality risks by quantifying contaminants on the hillslopes, anticipating water contamination risk, and identifying areas with high susceptibility to ash and sediment transport. This collaborative interaction among scientists and water managers, aimed also at refining model capabilities and outputs to meet managers' needs, exemplifies the successful outcomes that can be achieved at the interface of industry and science.

We applied the newly developed WEPPcloud-WATAR tool (Water Erosion Prediction Project cloud model—Wildfire Ash Transport And Risk estimation tool) to this catchment to predict risks to water quality from contaminants contained in eroded soil and wildfire ash. This collaboration between scientists and managers served as a test bench and helped in improving model capabilities and in adapting its outputs to water managers' needs. The tool now predicts spatial distribution of ash and pollutants on the hillslopes, loads of ash, soil, and pollutants reaching water assets for single rain events; probabilities of water contamination in the medium term; and location of hotspots for soil, ash, and contaminant transport.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change, population growth, the development of industrialization and urbanization are increasing the demand for water resources, but the water pollution is reducing the limited water supply. In recent years, the gap between water supply and demand which shows water scarcity situation is becoming more serious. Clear knowing this gap and its main driving factors could help us to put forward water protection measures correctly. We take the data of Huaihe River Basin from 2001 to 2016 as an example and use ecological water footprint to describe the demand, with the water carrying capacity representing the supply. We analyze the water supply-demand situation of Huaihe River Basin and its five provinces from footprint view in time and space. Then we apply the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index model to analyze the driving factors of the ecological water footprint. The results show that: (1) the supply and demand balance of Huaihe River Basin was only achieved in year 2003 and 2005. There is also a large difference between Jiangsu province and other provinces in Huaihe River basin, most years in Jiangsu province per capital ecological footprint of water is more than 1 hm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/person except the years of 2003, 2015, and 2016. But other provinces are all less than 1 hm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/person. (2) Through the decomposition of water demand drivers, we concluded that economic development is the most important factor, with an annual contribution of more than 60%. Our study provides countermeasures and suggestions for the management and optimal allocation of water resources in Huaihe River Basin, and also provides reference for the formulation of water-saving policies in the world.</jats:p>"

The asymmetrical supply of anode potential is thought to be the cause. To investigate their relationship, a bias voltage is applied on one piece of a quartered anode to realize the asymmetrical supply of anode potential. Variations of both the current and temperature of each anode piece are measured and analyzed. The results indicate that the disruption of the anode potential symmetrical supply does not affect the total anode current; however, it enhances the current oscillation. As the bias voltage increases, the current concentrates gradually on the high-potential part of the anode, accompanied by an increase in the local temperature. Changes in the Ez × Br drift direction, magnetic field strength, discharge voltage, and anode flow rate do not affect the above-mentioned laws. Preliminary analysis shows that the formation of a local electric field near the anode and the generation of an extra Eθ × Br drift are the main causes, which can affect the movement of electrons in the near-anode region greatly.</jats:p>",

A series of batch experiments with ICME alone and CO alone was designed to investigate the effects of process parameters, such as initial pH, dose of Fe-C, time of micro-electrolysis, ozone flux, dose of TiO2/activated carbon (TiO2/AC), and time of ozonation, on the removal rates of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), CODMn and Chl-a. The process parameters were optimized using response surface methodology. The results showed that initial pH, dose of Fe-C and ozone flux had significant effects on removal of TN, TP, CODMn and Chl-a. Within the range of selected operating conditions, the optimized values of initial pH, dose of Fe-C, time of micro-electrolysis, ozone flux, dose of TiO2/AC, and time of ozonation were 3.8, 13.7 g/L, 29.6 min, 3.19 L/min, 294.74 mg/L and 106.73 min, respectively. Furthermore, ICME alone had significant advantages in TP and CODMn removal and CO alone favored TN and Chl-a. Under the optimal process conditions, the final removal rates of TN, TP, CODMn, and Chl-a by the hybrid ICME-CO process reached 75.33%, 86.29%, 94.42% and 97.57%, respectively. The present research provides a new alternative technology with promise for treatment of eutrophic lake water.</jats:p>",

This paper focuses on a duopolistic supply chain consisting of one MNM and one local manufacturer (LM) in an emerging market with low willingness-to-pay (WTP). Within the game analytical framework, we consider different market power structures and investigate the impact of PI on the manufacturers’ price competition, and we further discuss the MNM’s countermeasures in high and low WTP markets. We find that PI does not occur when the WTP ratio is below the threshold or the transaction cost is high. Power structures significantly affect the participant’s profitability, the LM’s gains are maximized if the MNM fully dominates the market, and the MNM loses the minimum if the LM exclusively rules the market. When in codominant structure, the parallel importer achieves maximum gains while the MNM’s profits rise in the market WTP ratio interval. PI activities boost the benefits for the LM and the parallel importer, whereas increasing transaction costs diminish those effects and promote the MNM’s profitability. PI promotes or deters price competition in duopolistic supply chains depending on power structures. In addition, increasing either the level of product substitution or quality perception restrains PI and improves the LM’s earnings, but the latter expands the MNM’s losses.</jats:p>",

Directions of development, production capacity, types of produced products – all these parameters require analysis, systematization and accounting. The responsibility of all levels of administration for the efficiency of production, economic and financial activities is increasing. The authors studied the procurement process at sausage production enterprises, including the procedures for the purchase, delivery, acceptance, storage and pre-sale preparation of products. It has been determined that the following factors influence the organization of accounting system in this industry: finished products are obtained as a result of processing of primary raw materials; features of technological process depend on the type of raw materials, recipes; sausage production is distinguished by high level of mechanization and automation. The conducted studies show that management accounting does not always ensure the fulfillment of all tasks assigned to it. According to the authors, they can be supplemented with the following list: provision of information on the availability of raw material base; formation of budgets and forms of management reporting for raw materials supplied by the customer; control over compliance with sanitary and hygienic standards, quality of raw materials and finished products; providing data on product line, availability of ecological packaging. The solution of these problems contributes to the increase in the efficient and effective management; reduction of labor costs for executives and managers who make decisions on information and settlement processes.</jats:p>",
