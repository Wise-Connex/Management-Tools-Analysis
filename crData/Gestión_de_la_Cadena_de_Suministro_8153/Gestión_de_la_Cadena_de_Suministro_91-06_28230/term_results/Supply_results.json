In experiments with Phaseolus vulgaris, grown in sand culture under controlled conditions, increasing the nitrogen concentration in the nutrient solution from 52.5 to 315 mg/L released the bud at the primary leaf node from inhibition. Precise measurements (± 1 μm) with a strain gauge transducer showed that the bud growth response was initiated ca. 3 h after increasing the N supply. The increase in the total N content of the buds of the high-N plants was significantly correlated with their uptake of water. Increases in the amino-N content of the buds of the high-N plants over the first 24 h of the treatment period were correlated with significant increases in their total water potential and pressure potential, but their solute potential was unaffected. The absence of any reduction in their solute potential was attributed to the dilution effect of the increased uptake of water. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that N initiates the release of buds from apical dominance by an osmotic effect that increases their capacity to compete for water with the parent shoot. Key words: apical dominance, nitrogen, Phaseolus, water potential. </jats:p>",

If sufficiently diluted, it can be supplied to a polymerization process from large, cooled but unstirred vessels. We present a number of extensions to the existing homogeneous explosion theory, namely a practical definition of the critical condition, its calculation, and expressions for the available time before runaway in the case of a supercritical condition, taking into account the effects of natural convection inside the vessel and the reactant conversion. The extensions of the theory were confirmed by adiabatic and non‐adiabatic runaway experiments on bench scale, and natural convection cooling experiments with liquids in various packages.</jats:p>",

In all diets, lipid supply increased pH, but variations in VFA concentration and pattern were low. Interactions between the nature of concentrate and lipid supply were moderate, but were higher in the group fed maize silage than in the group fed hay, especially for total digestibility.</jats:p>",

An econometric approach was employed in which data on utility costs and characteristics were used to estimate a total water supply cost function from which average and marginal costs were derived. The results suggest that although average and marginal costs decline with output, the rate of decline rapidly approaches zero, and unit costs therefore appear to remain relatively constant over a wide range of output. Implications of the results for pricing policy are examined.</jats:p>",
