All three approaches gave similar results.</jats:p><jats:p>The pattern of phosphate supply for the four low phosphate‐fixing soils could be predicted by assuming the phosphate released was a desorption phenomenon as described by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The pattern of phosphàte supply for the three high phosphate‐fixing soils could be predicted by assuming that in the presence of water a saturated solution of a chemical compound was formed.</jats:p><jats:p>The level of phosphorus in the initial water extract was not a good indication of plant‐available phosphorus. Both the intensity of soil phosphate supply and the capacity of the soil to rapidly renew this supply must be evaluated to adequately describe plant‐available phosphorus in the soil.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the first two parts of this paper attention has been directed to determination of the stresses in a disk as dependent upon elastic and plastic strain, including creep effects which may occur at the rim region. The problem has so far, however, been treated without complication introduced by the blade fastenings and therefore, in effect, the disk has been investigated as far as the base of the blade grooves or slots. It has, however, been realized that the projections forming blade root fastenings present their own problems, differing from those of the disk, and these problems have been left to be dealt with in this third portion of the paper. Nevertheless, in Parts I and II the fact that the root fastenings applied an interrupted radial loading at the outside, and not a perfectly distributed load as assumed in the analysis, was not overlooked.</jats:p>",
