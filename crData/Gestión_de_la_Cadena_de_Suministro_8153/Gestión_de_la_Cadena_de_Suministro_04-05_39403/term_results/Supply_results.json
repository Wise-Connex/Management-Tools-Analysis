Although these analysts purport to be scientific, they are in fact merely curve fitting. Within a fixed, geologically homogenous basin it is possible to model discovery sizes. But at the national level, political factors such as fiscal regimes, access to perspective areas, technological challenges in different basins, and the economics of given plays tend to be determining. At the global level, demand determines production while politics heavily influences discoveries. That most of these analysts rely heavily on unproven-or disproven--assumptions is indicative of the quality of their research.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In fact, forecasting of both discoveries and supplies is extremely difficult, because of the uncertain nature of field size and because of the heavy influence of individual national economic conditions-infrastructure as well as fiscal regimes-and heavy restrictions on drilling by the private sector. Scarcity can be very roughly estimated by looking at a number of factors, including costs and reserve values, discovery size, drilling density, and well productivity, and none of these supports the alarmist views of a peak in world oil production over the next decade or two.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The importance of petroleum to world economy can hardly be overstated and is not at issue, nor is the importance of the adequacy of future oil supplies. But consideration of these topics should be based on real evidence and hard research rather than polemics. Much of the writings of the past few years, while aimed at a general audience, have not added to our knowledge of the subject and have often been misleading. There is a significant body of research on petroleum supply behavior, but much of it is ignored in the current debate.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>All that's old made new again</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>A number of the arguments being heard have been around for quite a long time, including the general concern about resource depletion, fears of the inadequacy of capital to meet investment needs, as well as worries about concentration of petroleum resources in unstable areas. The fact that these concerns have never had any operational value does not mean they can simply be ignored. Nor does the fact that many mistakenly have predicted resource exhaustion for decades mean that current warnings should be ignored, rather they should be considered carefully in the context of past failures.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Unquestionably, there are numerous articles by industry insiders describing the difficulties and challenges which the explorationist faces when trying to find and produce oil. But the fact that it may be getting harder to find a given amount oil, or that capital needs may be growing, does not really tell us much about long-term oil production. It usually indicates a desire for tax breaks, or an appeal for more capital or easier access to prospective areas, rather than concerns that supply is about to peak. Similar warnings have been made for decades, without proving valid or relevant.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Coming from a journalist's standpoint of neutrality, this paper will assess the impacts of both the depletionist and antidepletionist scenarios for future oil supply on the petroleum industry and on global society.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The highly polarized debate over the prospect of an imminent peak and precipitous decline in global oil production has seen a sharp resurgence in the petroleum industry in recent years.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This is no longer a mere academic exercise, as it has been in the past. The claims of those who believe in an imminent peak-oil scenario are gaining greater credence among media and government circles, pulling the debate into the mainstream of society. In this latest incarnation of the debate, the depletionist school is garnering wider attention because of the debate's currently topical linkages to the volatile geopolitics of war and terrorism and concerns over the postulated catastrophic climate change caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Energy security and environmental issues for decades have been significant drivers of government policymaking affecting the oil and gas industry in major ways. Thus it is apparent that the peak-oil debate will factor into future decisions by government bodies and by the public at large in ways that could have extreme impacts affecting even the future viability of the petroleum industry.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Therefore, it is critical to assess the impacts, in terms of public acceptance, of both the depletionist and antidepletionist scenarios for future oil supply on the petroleum industry and on society overall.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>However, there is nothing approaching consensus on the peak-oil debate, as was ascertained in a series of articles this author developed on the theme of Future Energy Supply in the Oil &amp; Gas Journal in summer 2003.1 While there is a spectrum even among centrist positions, the debate remains highly polarized and even rancorous at times.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Unfortunately, as the debate seeps into the mainstream consciousness, it is exactly this sort of polarization that has tremendous appeal to the mainstream media and to political idealogues. It is possible that crucial decisions on this issue will be made by policymaking entities and by consumers that will have a tremendous bearing on the industryâ??s prospects, much as was the case in the wake of the 1970s oil price spikes and the environmental disasters involving the 1969 Santa Barbara Channel oil spill and the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker oil spill. Given the apocalyptic scenarios offered by the peakoil theory proponents, however, these choices could entail much more far-reaching impacts on the industry, including its very survival.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>So it follows that it is imperative that the petroleum industy places a top priority on arriving at some sort of consensus on the peak-oil issue-sooner rather than later.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the recent technological feasibility of electronic commerce over the Internet, much attention has been given to the design of electronic markets for various types of electronically-tradable goods. Such markets, however, will normally need to function in some relationship with markets for other related goods, usually those downstream or upstream in the supply chain.  Thus, for example, an electronic market for rubber tires for trucks will likely need to be strongly influenced by the rubber market as well as by the truck market.    In this paper we design protocols for exchange of information between a sequence of markets along a single supply chain.  These protocols allow each of these markets to function separately, while the information exchanged ensures efficient global behavior across the supply chain.  Each market that forms a link in the supply chain operates as a double auction, where the bids on one side of the double auction come from bidders in the corresponding segment of the industry, and the bids on the other side are synthetically generated by the protocol to express the combined information from all other links in the chain.  The double auctions in each of the markets can be of several types, and we study several variants of incentive compatible double auctions, comparing them in terms of their efficiency and of the market revenue.</jats:p>"

The process is complex because it involves many interrelated business decisions, and a wide range of companies at different levels. So far, little is available to assist managers in analysing and monitoring a supply network performance. This paper proposes a tool, supply network analysis process (SNAP), to address this gap. SNAP can be implemented in a three‐stage process. The tool enables managers to explore, connect, and visualise the interaction of network decisions in such a way that it is easy to understand and communicate, that engage more people within an organization, and that unlock the creativity of participants. A case study is used to illustrate the application of the SNAP tool. Finally, the implication of this research to managers and academics is discussed.</jats:p>",

During the summer of 2003, increasing demand for groundwater caused Avondale to pursue methods of nitrate removal at well 8, which is located next to a new commercial development. Well 8 had a nitrate level of 13 mg/L as nitrogen, which exceeds the federal standard of 10 mg/L. In addition, it also had a sulfate level of 77 mg/L, which usually makes conventional nitrate removal very expensive. Avondale decided to contract with Basin Water Inc., whose packaged ion exchange system is specifically designed and engineered for wellhead treatment. Also, this system simultaneously removes arsenic and uranium, an important consideration in areas that may have multiple contaminants in groundwater. Other key benefits of the system are listed. Deployment of the system is discussed along with operational aspects.</jats:p>",

The parties are assumed to renegotiate bilaterally and sequentially. Potential trade distortions then arise in addition to the usual investment problem. Following Edlin and Reichelstein (1995, 1996), we consider fixed-quantity contracts. First-best allocations are shown to be attainable if the parties are able to commit to a ‘forced-compliance’ regime where a central office monitors the consistency of the bilateral renegotiations.</jats:p>",

By superimposing sensor profiles for defined sampling window, the identification of data points outside these normal sensor response patterns was used to represent potential pollution episodes or other abnormalities within the process stream. Principle component analysis supported the detection of outliers or rapid changes in the sensor responses as an indicator of chemical pollutants. A model based on the comparison of sensor relative responses to a moving average for a defined sample window was tested for detecting and identifying sudden changes in the online data over a 6-month period. These results show the technical advantages of using a non-specific based monitoring system that can respond to a range of chemical species, due to broad selectivity of the sensor compositions. The findings demonstrate how this non-invasive technique could be further developed to provide early warning systems for application at the inlet of wastewater treatment plants.</jats:p>",

The productivity of various hybrids, each with its own genetic characteristics, was tested for three different sowing times and five different fertilizer doses. The highest yields were achieved at the third sowing time (17. V.), which is unusual, because the second half of the summer was rainy and was favourable for late sowing. The seed moisture content at harvest was higher than the optimal 14-15% at the third sowing time, the hybrids, which have intensive bleeding dynamics, couldn’t reach the lower seed moisture content at harvest of the early sowing. In that case we have to decision whether the plus yield of the third sowing time cover the drying costs.Some hybrids produced the highest yields by N 120, P2O5 75, K2O 90 kg/ha active agent but the higher fertilizer doses depress the yield. The other part of the hybrids were able to produce high yield by bigger fertilizer doses. On the whole the agro-ecological optimum of the NPK fertilization was N 120-160, P 25-100, K 90-120 kg/ha active agent, but the N 80, P2O5 50, K2O 60 kg/ha fertilizer doses was the most effective.</jats:p>"

Trace organic contaminants come from many sources in wastewater. Their health significance is unknown and a problem for toxicologists to define. Analytical technology now enables measurement of many organic contaminants at very low concentrations and for which no adequate understanding of health significance has been developed. The study was conducted to show how a class of contaminants (pharmaceutical residuals) can be described and to demonstrate the presence of unmeasurable residuals. Regulators will increasingly be faced with pressure to assure safety without a clear toxicological basis for measuring risk. This work provides a blueprint for describing the presence and distribution of other groups of trace organic contaminants. It also underscores the urgent need for development of fundamental toxicological principles for assessing potential significance to human health from exposure to trace and ultratrace contaminants and mixtures.</jats:p>",

We used the native tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, which germinates in the postfire environment and copes with large changes in soil N during postfire succession, to compare a suite of Manduca sexta- and elicitor-induced responses in plants grown under high- and low-N (LN) supply rates. LN supply decreased relative growth rates and biomass by 35% at 40 d compared to high-N plants; furthermore, it also attenuated (by 39 and 60%) the elicitor-induced jasmonate and salicylate bursts, two N-intensive direct defenses (nicotine and trypsin proteinase inhibitors, albeit by different mechanisms), and carbon-containing nonvolatile defenses (rutin, chlorogenic acid, and diterpene glycosides), but did not affect the induced release of volatiles (cis-α-bergamotene and germacrene A), which function as indirect defenses. M. sexta and methyl jasmonate-induced transcriptional responses measured with a microarray enriched in herbivore-induced genes were also substantially reduced in plants grown under LN supply rates. In M. sexta-attacked LN plants, only 36 (45%) up-regulated and 46 (58%) down-regulated genes showed the same regulation as those in attacked high-N plants. However, transcriptional responses frequently directly countered the observed metabolic changes. Changes in a leaf's sensitivity to elicitation, an attacked leaf's waning ability to export oxylipin wound signals, and/or resource limitations in LN plants can account for the observed results, underscoring the conclusion that defense activation is a resource-intensive response.</jats:p>",

Quadratic production and restricted profit functions are estimated using farm‐level survey data from Ethiopia in 1994. The results indicate that farmers respond only modestly to price incentives. The own‐price output supply elasticity is very low and output supply is not responsive to fertilizer prices or the wage rate. Non‐price factors are far more important in affecting production and resource use than price incentives. The results are robust to whether the primal or dual approach is used to estimate elasticities. The results underscore the need to strengthen market incentives through effective policies that will improve farmers' access to fertilizer, land and credit, public investment in roads and irrigation.

The methodology used to produce the projections is still fundamentally a demand‐requirements approach that implicitly assumes that labor supply is infinitely elastic for every occupation.

The SGF is used most frequently for otologic reconstruction. Reviewing the literature, however, showed many contradictory findings about dissection of an independent SGF layer, its blood supply, and the possibility of harvesting it as part of a combined flap. Our study, carried out on ten fresh cadavers, presents a detailed view of the blood supply of the SGF to develop a safe method of harvesting an inferior‐based SGF. Our systematic plane‐by‐plane approach, associated with a transparent grid applied on each dissection, allowed us to quantify the branches from each plane and to localize precisely their entering sites from a reference “zygomatic point.” The SGF had no ascending axial vascular supply entering from its base; according to our results, therefore, the SGF could not be harvested alone as an inferior pedicled flap down to the zygomatic arch. It may be feasible, however, to harvest a SGF flap when a strip of the superficial fascia is associated with its middle third. Therefore, we suggest that an average height of 5.4 cm of superficial fascia should be included in an inferior‐based pedicle of a SGF. Clin. Anat. 17:392–399, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

The activities of three enzyme classes functionally involved in resistance (chitinase, chitosanase and peroxidase) were quantified over 8 d following treatment as resistance markers. Constitutive levels of three markers and the induced level of peroxidase and chitinase activity were significantly lower under limiting nitrogen supply. Under such conditions the increase of chitosanase activity after resistance induction was severely delayed, although the induced maximum activity of chitosanase was not significantly affected. Total soluble protein content decreased during the first 12 h after resistance elicitation. Thereafter, the induced plants cultivated under high N conditions reached higher protein contents than controls, whereas N‐limited induced plants continuously had reduced protein contents. A plant's investment in resistance‐related compounds can be severely constrained under limiting nitrogen supply.</jats:p>",

Opportunistic behaviour and/or repetitive patterns of behavioural actions, resulting in gamesmanship, are explored to determine whether, under certain situations, the behaviours lead to win-lose situations and reduced trust. Transactional analysis (TA) is used to model games, which have been identified and observed in collaborating industrial partners. The experiments carried out to date have led to the formation of a preliminary relationship model which can be used, firstly, to identify correlations to the established library of TA games and hence, secondly, to investigate methods of mitigating the effect of some of the more negative form of games. It is proposed that this technique can be used as a mediating tool within holonic manufacturing systems or, at the ultimate, result in the establishment of relationship holons that could establish and maintain standardized co-operative patterns of behaviour between interacting partners, or holons, in the supply chain. </jats:p>",

In both plant species, the latitudinal variation in plant morphological and growth characteristics most probably indicates the differentiation of genotypes adapted to local geographical conditions. The plants of both species originating from all geographical locations tested responded to the respective nutrient treatments in a similar manner. Exceptions were found in growth characteristics related to reproduction in <jats:italic>L. salicaria</jats:italic>, indicating that better nutrient supply could enhance the reproductive ability of certain genotypes.

For this study, isolates from 291 patients in Singapore were genotyped by this method. One hundred sixty-six distinct MIRU-VNTR patterns were detected. One hundred sixty-two strains were grouped into 1 of 35 different MIRU-VNTR clusters and 131 isolates were unique. In this sample collection, 9 of the 12 MIRU-VNTR loci were moderately or highly discriminative according to their allelic diversities. The Hunter-Gaston discriminatory index was 0.975, indicating the high power of discrimination of MIRU-VNTR typing. By direct comparisons with previously typed MIRU-VNTR patterns and by genetic relationship analyses, we could identify and clearly define four epidemic groups of<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>in our sample, corresponding to the W/Beijing, East-Africa-Indian, Haarlem, and Delhi genotype families. Furthermore, MIRU-VNTR typing was able to clearly distinguish ancestral and modern<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>strains as defined by TbD1 genomic deletion analysis.
