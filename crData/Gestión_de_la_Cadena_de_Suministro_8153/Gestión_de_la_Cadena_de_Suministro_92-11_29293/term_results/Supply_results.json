Such reports were relatively prevalent among poor women. those without relatives nearby, and those willing to entrust the care of their children to nonfamily members. Only one-tenth of the sample reported a similar child care constraint on fertility, a phenomenon unrelated to income but relatively prevalent among women with strong labor force attachment. The results suggest that policies to increase the supply of child care or to lower its cost could increase female labor supply by a substantial fraction, with an even greater rise among women most at risk of poverty and reliance on public assistance, but probably would not raise fertility significantly.</jats:p>",

Cities in a \"rust belt\" state such as Michigan do not appear to be moving in that direction and still rely heavily on traditional supply-side inducements such as tax incentives, infrastructure investment, and marketing strategies. In the face of numerous questions about the effectiveness of supply-side incentives and the promise suggested by demand-side activities, it is a matter of concern that cities appear to continue to widely embrace such supply-side initiatives. </jats:p>",

In the great commercial revolution of Europe in the thirteenth century it was the increasing availability of money which allowed the payment of knights and civil servants and thus broke the hereditary grip on these functions, enabling the first post-feudal states to emerge. So in the Roman world the availability of money permitted the creation of a professional standing army and of a system of salaried officials.</jats:p>",

Results indicate that short‐term supply reacts positively to an increase in stumpage price, while the long‐term (total) elasticity is negative and small in absolute terms. Capital is a complement while labor is a substitute for roundwood input.

In Experiment 1, quantity supplied was varied by manipulating reinforcement rate while keeping session length constant. In Experiment 2, quantity supplied was varied by manipulating reinforcement rate while keeping reinforcers per session constant. In Experiment 3, quantity supplied was varied by manipulating reinforcer magnitude while keeping number of reinforcers constant. As predicted by economic theory, the obtained behavioral cost (responses per reinforcer) increased as supply decreased. The results could not be explained by simple artifacts such as satiation and time available to respond.

The segmental arrangement of the nerve supply in the sacral and pudendal plexuses was compared to that of Lacertilia and Urodela as a basis for a morphologiccal analysis of the pelvic outlet muscles. From the viewpoint of innervation, the pelvic outlet muscles of fowl are classified into two groups: a sphincter muscle group and a levator muscle group. These two groups are closely related to the ventral muscles of the pelvic limb. In contrast to the morphology of pelvic outlet muscles in lacertilians, in fowl the caudal muscle element does not contribute to the formation of these muscles. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Much has been written concerning the supply chain demand amplification problem, best described by the ‘law of industrial dynamics’. Broadly speaking, if a supply chain can find a way to fluctuate, it will. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper defines supply chains and reviews their current state of development. By way of a simulation example, the importance of good, shared, information flow is highlighted, as are several other strategies that lie more within the control of individual businesses. Good supply chain operation requires adequate design, led by a product champion committed to systems change. Persuasive evidence to support the product champion is therefore offered. Examples include internally generated demand amplification caused by human schedulers; an industrial supply chain case history; supply chain redesign via simulation; and a review of a proposed effectiveness framework which offers the possibility of integrating both modelling and design phases. </jats:p><jats:p> The methodologies that are described herein may be universally applied to any industrial or commercial sector in which there is a value-added process. They have found great favour in the automotive industry, which is manifestly an area of endeavour where customer selectivity leads directly to the ‘demand chain’ viewpoint. However, a health care supply chain example also appears in the paper because it contains an important feature which could be duplicated to great advantage in many other applications. This is the opportunity taken to build customer-driven ‘phase advance’ or predictive capability into the system in order to improve the flow of both orders and products. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A study of the effects of three levels of silicon nutrition, representing low, intermediate, and high levels, shows that silicon does not enhance the vegetative growth of <jats:italic>Bromus secalinus</jats:italic> (cheat), yet it increases the rate of seed development and the efficiency of seed set. Grasses supplied with silicon have a higher percent of viable seeds compared to those grown in very low levels of silicon. Silicon supply, however, is not an absolute requirement for cheat reproduction, since grasses growing in low silicon levels set flowers and seeds, and the average weight of individual seeds or the mean number of inflorescences per plant are not influenced by silicon nutrition. Concentrations of silicon in tissues of cheat increase over time and with higher levels of silicon supply. Considerable differences are found in the silicon content of various vegetative and reproductive parts of cheat. Among vegetative parts, levels of silicon are lowest in stems and highest in green and senescent leaf blades. Among reproductive parts, silicon is most highly concentrated in the husks (glumes, lemmas, and paleas) surrounding filled seeds and is almost nonexistent in the seed itself. Mechanisms influencing silicon deposition and the ecological significance of the present findings are discussed.</jats:p>",

In this study, we analyzed the feasibility of mass spectrometry in measuring intraosseous oxygen and carbon dioxide. The partial pressures were also measured in intraosseous blood samples, and blood flow in bone was measured with the radioactive microspheres technique. The average partial pressure of oxygen in the lateral femoral condyle was 34 ± 1.6 mm Hg when measured in intraosseous blood samples and 36.3 ± 2.3 mm Hg when measured with the on‐line mass spectrometer, with significant correlation between the methods. The absolute value of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide measured in situ with mass spectrometry was correlated with the value in the withdrawn blood. There was no significant difference in partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the two sides or between repetitive measurements. Arterial occlusion resulted in severe hypoxia, whereas more moderate changes followed venous occlusion.</jats:p>",
