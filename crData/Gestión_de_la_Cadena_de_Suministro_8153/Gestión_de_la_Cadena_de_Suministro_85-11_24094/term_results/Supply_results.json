The presence of pockets of loose fat in the cheese structure, which can lead to downgrading in the late winter and spring, was not related to the chemical composition of the milk and may arise from the handling of the milk before cheesemaking. Generally the composition of the forage and the milk varied with date, but not between the different farms, whereas the composition and properties of the cheese were dependent on the manufacturers but were fairly constant during the period of study.</jats:p>",

We also determined whether blood cardioplegia has any advantage over crystalloid cardioplegia in this setting. Patients with preserved left ventricular myocardial function and without anterolateral wall infarct or aneurysm were included to the study. Intermittent cold blood and crystalloid cardioplegia were used in 10 patients (group BC) and 9 patients (group CC), respectively. From myocardial biopsies, obtained before and after ischemia, complete electron transport system (ETS) enzyme activities (NDH, SDH, NCCR, SCCR, and COX) and lactate content were analyzed. Biochemical and hemodynamic analyses also were done. Myocardial and blood temperatures were monitored.</jats:p><jats:p>Ischemic time was longer in group CC (p &lt; 0.05). There were no important differences in biochemical and hemodynamic variables between the two groups. In addition, there was no difference in NDH and SDH activities as well as COX/SCCR and COX/RS‐NCCR ratios between the two groups before and after ischemia. After Ischemia, RS‐NCCR in group CC and SCCR and COX activities in both groups were lower than the control. For all enzymes, activity change ratios were not different between groups. Myocardial lactate content was increased in both groups after ischemia. However, the increase in group BC was less (p &lt; 0.01).</jats:p><jats:p>Based on our findings, we believe that the superiority of blood cardioplegia over crystalloid cardioplegia does not depend on oxygen content, but on other factors such as buffering and free oxygen radical scavenger effects among others. However, with the warm and continuous blood cardioplegia technique, oxygen content might be more important.</jats:p>",

The 50% lethal dose at 24 h after injection was found to be 64 +/- 5 mg of freeze-dried culture per kg of mouse. The principal lesion produced was centrilobular to massive hepatocyte necrosis, but various degrees of injury were also seen in the kidneys, adrenal glands, lungs, and intestine.
