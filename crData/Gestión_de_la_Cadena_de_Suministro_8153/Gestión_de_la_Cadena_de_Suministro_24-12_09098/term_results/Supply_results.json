      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The coronavirus pandemic exposed global supply chain vulnerabilities, causing fluctuating demand for products. This resulted in the bullwhip effect, which posed a substantial challenge for supply chain management. This study focusses on the analysis of the effect of supply chain configurations and structure on the bullwhip effect.Objectives: The research quantitatively studies the effect of the strategic supply chain structure at the design phase on amplifying the bullwhip effect. Furthermore, it studies the expected interaction during operation, which may further amplify or dampen it.Method: The study introduces a simulation model and examines the influence of several design decisions and operations parameters and their interactions on the efficiency of supply chain operations. A simulation model is created for several supply chain configurations, each with distinct structure complexity. The bullwhip effect measures are collected and a factorial analysis is conducted to examine the interactions among the parameters and their impact on the performance.Results: The findings indicate that an increase in demand unpredictability results in a greater bullwhip effect, irrespective of the inventory strategy or structural intricacy. But the level of increase does not necessarily match the increase in complexity and can be amplified or damped by interactions between operating parameters.Conclusion: Supply network architects should consider the level of structural complexity to mitigate amplifications of demand variations and to optimise the supply chain’s overall operation.Contribution: The research represents a novel work to quantitatively link the bullwhip effect of a supply chain to the complexity of its supply chain structure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: South Africa has successfully enhanced its manufacturing sector by incorporating green technologies and fostering sustainable job opportunities, demonstrating the importance of material transformation in supplying necessities and promoting economic growth. The manufacturing sector’s rapid economic growth has led to environmental concerns, prompting a push for green supply chain management (GSCM). This study explores green purchasing (GP), manufacturing and distribution practices.Objectives: By examining how GSCM techniques affect green economic performance (GEP) in Gauteng province’s industrial sector, the current study aims to close this gap. Green supply chain management techniques were examined in this study in the areas of green distribution (GD), manufacturing and purchasing.Method: The study surveyed 450 manufacturing companies in Gauteng province using a quantitative approach. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (version 28.0) and SMART PLS (version 3.0) (using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling path analysis) to test research hypotheses.Results: The results of the study showed that in the manufacturing industry GSCM practices through GP, green manufacturing and GD greatly influence GEP. In addition, GD has the strongest effect on GEP compared to GP and GD.Conclusion: To enhance GEP and safeguard the environment, the industrial sector must implement GSCM strategies.Contribution: This study is significant for South African manufacturing companies because it offers opportunities for achieving GEP by adopting and comprehending GSCM practices. The findings will aid in the implementation of these practices in Gauteng province’s manufacturing firms.</jats:p>"

This study analyzes a dataset from A-share listed companies spanning 2014 to 2023 to empirically investigate how supply chain finance influences ESG performance and the moderating role of supply chain concentration. Results indicate that advancements in supply chain finance positively impact ESG performance, providing companies with a pathway to strengthen sustainable practices. However, a higher supply chain concentration has a significant negative relationship with supply chain financing, indicating that companies with more concentrated supply chains may face challenges in fully leveraging supply chain finance to enhance ESG outcomes. Additionally, supply chain concentration negatively mediates the relationship between supply chain finance and ESG performance, suggesting that supply chain structure influences the effectiveness of financial strategies on ESG outcomes. This research provides theoretical and empirical insights to guide companies toward sustainable decision-making and improved supply chain practices aligned with ESG objectives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the contrasting supply chain policies of the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations, emphasizing the implications of their strategies amid the complexities of global economic dynamics. Trump’s \"America First\" approach prioritized domestic manufacturing through tariffs and trade barriers, attempting to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers, particularly from China. However, these measures led to increased consumer costs, strained international relations, and highlighted vulnerabilities in critical supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the Biden-Harris administration advocates for a resilient, sustainable, and cooperative supply chain framework, focusing on global alliances, significant infrastructure investments, and technological advancements. This administration's emphasis on sustainability aligns with growing consumer demand for environmentally friendly practices, whereas innovation plays a crucial role in adapting to ongoing global challenges.The study explores the lessons learned from the contrasting approaches regarding resilience, sustainability, and geopolitical considerations, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to adapt its supply chain strategies to navigate future uncertainties more effectively. Ultimately, the essay underscores the importance of innovation, collaboration, and sustainability in shaping robust supply chains that not only respond to immediate challenges but also secure long-term economic prosperity and national security in an increasingly interconnected world.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, both customer dependence and supplier dependence have different effects on corporate performance. Heterogeneity testing found that the impact of supply chain dependence on firm performance is more significant in non-state-owned enterprises and enterprises in western provinces and regions. Based on the lifecycle, the inhibitory effect of supply chain dependence on short-term performance is more significant in growing enterprises; The improvement of long-term performance is more effective in mature enterprises.

These technologies can leverage the collection of data across a wide variety of supply chain sources, bringing optimisations to everything from customer engagement to business intelligence, but they are not without risks. The process of implementing AI into supply chain management practices can easily lead to noncompliance without a robust data governance strategy at a company level. In order to mitigate these risks, as well as ensure standards of safety and quality, a critical examination of all AI technologies across their entire life cycle is required. This paper serves to outline recent developments in AI technology and how they have been implemented in supply chain management across industries. The risks of implementing AI solutions in the supply chain are discussed through case studies as well as recent litigation involving breaches of data privacy laws, licensing agreements and other liability stemming from inappropriate use of AI technologies. A summary of the current state of AI law and policy in the US and European Union (EU) serves as a basis for recommendations for adoption of responsible AI practices. Through the establishment of AI governance frameworks that assess risks at all stages of the implementation process, AI solutions can be designed and implemented that are reliable, secure and resilient.</jats:p>"

The Kenya government has identified Access to Government Procurement Opportunities (AGPO) as a tool for sharing national procurement opportunities with these vulnerable groups. The objective of these paper is to identify Opportunities and Challenges the above groups face as they compete for these reserved opportunities.\r\nMethodology: Four thematic areas were identified as the points of focus. These were training, information access, funding and legal framework as areas that require to be looked at to enhance accessibility and utilization of these reserved Procurement opportunities.\r\nFindings: So far, apart from the advertisement of these opportunities and a few organizations undertaking training of Women, Youth and People Living with Disabilities about the availability of these reserved opportunities, there is little evidence if any that the said groups have benefited from these opportunities.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: This Study provides a framework for understanding how the policies that have been put in place for inclusivity in procurement and Supply Chain Management and how they can contribute to economic development.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Transport affordability is a significant concern for South African households, who spend nearly a fifth of their budgets on transport. Contributing factors include a lack of affordable public transport options and spatial mismatch. Since 2015, stagnating national budgets and a declining share allocated to the transport portfolio have exacerbated household transport expenses, limiting economic mobility.Objectives: This article examines how changes in household transport expenses impact other essential expenses such as food, housing, clothing, recreation and education. Understanding these expenditure trade-offs provides insights for policy, especially as the National Public Transport Subsidy Policy is being prepared.Method: Using data from the Living Conditions Survey of 2014/2015, the study applies fractional logit regression models to estimate the impact of varying household transport expenses on other expenditure categories across diverse household demographics.Results: Findings indicate that increased household transport expenses significantly reduces allocations to essential items, notably food and housing, with the effects varying by income level, settlement type, and household composition.Conclusion: A core recommendation is to reduce transport expenses for low-income households through government intervention as this will increase these, mostly previously disadvantaged households’, economic mobility.Contribution: Results show that if low-income households allocate no more than 10% of their expenditure budgets to transport, they could potentially increase their expenditure share on food (+1.30%) housing (+1.18%) clothing (+0.86%) recreation (+0.31%) and education (+0.08%).</jats:p>"

This Paskas farm has a supply chain business process, namely small-sized cattle imported from the island of Java, namely Yogyakarta, Banyuwangi and Kediri. Then the cows are bred at the farm until they are large and have enough weight to be distributed for the benefit of Eid al-Adha. One of the supply chain risks at Paskas Farms related to animal welfare is during transportation and distribution. The transportation of this sacrificial cow takes a long time, namely for 16 hours, causing this sacrificial cow to experience stress during the distribution trip. The tight capacity in the truck also makes the sacrificial cattle experience stress because they do not implement animal welfare. Mitigation plans really need to be done to prevent or reduce the emergence of causes of risk. This study aims to determine the supply chain business process flow for qurban cattle from Paskas Farms, find out what risk events and the causes of priority risks that can arise in the supply chain business processes for sacrificial cattle at Paskas Farms, find out the appropriate handling strategy for priority risk causes in the process supply chain business for sacrificial cattle at Paskas Farm. Therefore, risk identification is carried out using the House of Risk phase 1 method which is grouped based on 5 main processes plan, source, make, deliver, return. From this process it was identified that there were 38 risk events and 24 risk agents. The recommended mitigation action or treatment strategy for the cause of the risk with the highest ranking is by using the House of Risk phase 2 method and get the result that there are 9 recommendations for mitigation actions that can be implemented by Paskas Farms.</jats:p>"

An often overlooked fourth aspect, however, is around the environmental cost of retail returns, specifically the carbon footprint generated from moving returned products through second life retail distribution channels. This paper examines the case of returned general merchandise retail products — in particular, a UK reverse supply chain for homewares, furniture, white goods and other non-apparel items. It focuses on investigating the environmental cost by determining how much CO2 is created during the return transport processes until a product is retained by a customer and not returned again. Two disposition routes for unwanted retail stock items are examined in detail: first, the more desirable option of premium processing and resale of returned or unwanted items; and second, resale of items that are beyond economic repair through an auction house. The case study presented determines the CO2 emissions generated for each disposition route and highlights the inefficiencies that arise from the fragmented transportation of items sold via the auction house that lead to significantly increased carbon emissions.</jats:p>"

In this study, based on the fact that business processes in the world now include components such as Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity (VUCA) under the influence of different factors, new approaches in supply chains are discussed under the concept of VUCA as a flow process. Different important developments affecting the world such as political developments, digital transformation, epidemics and natural disasters make the classical supply chain dysfunctional. When the literature is examined, it is seen that the historical development of lean, agile, flexible and green (LARG) supply chains and digital supply chains under the VUCA era are not discussed in relation to each other. In this respect, this historical development, industrial revolutions and their interaction with each other are revealed within the scope of the study. Developments were obtained by conducting a literature review on supply chain management and industrial revolutions while preserving historical integrity, and these developments were correlated with each other and the historical development process was presented in tables. In addition, all concepts are explained with the support of literature and a flow that provides bedside information is provided. It has been determined that there is a deficiency in the literature in theoretically explaining this evolutionary development. The information presented in the article reveals the development of supply chain management as a whole along with industrial revolutions.</jats:p>"

Their abilities provide the tools companies need to evolve and meet the changing needs and business conditions, ensuring they remain afloat. The challenge, however, is understanding how companies can incorporate the technologies into their systems. There are also concerns over the low adoption rates among small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and the paper looks into the issue to assess the barriers and solutions. The other goal is to determine strategies companies use to optimize AI and IoT to ensure proper supply chain management. This paper contributes to supply chain management by providing a structured framework for integrating AI and IoT technologies to enhance operational efficiency, real- time decision-making, and supply chain visibility. It addresses barriers faced by SMEs, such as financial constraints and lack of skilled personnel, offering strategies like innovative leadership and collaboration through ecosystems to overcome these challenges. Additionally, the research highlights how AI and IoT strengthen supply chain resilience, optimize inventory, and ensure seamless operations, especially in adapting to post-pandemic vulnerabilities. The literature review was done on recent scholarly research papers and case studies. The findings showed that SMEs can overcome challenges such as limited funds and human resource constraints by collaborating with others and getting innovative leaders to lead the supply chains. Supply Chain Systems (SCS) that adopt AI and IoT can leverage them to ensure optimized inventory management, tracking and quality control, predictive analysis abilities, and continuous monitoring, which provide constant system improvement.</jats:p>"

This study provides a comprehensive model for managing and optimizing the BSC in real-world scenarios, including emergency and routine circumstances and with consideration of health equity concepts. Method: Classic time-series models are applied to predict future supply chain circumstances, addressing uncertainty in blood demand and the need for timely supply. A structured framework and medical preferences are prioritized to optimize distribution, minimize blood shortages, minimize wastage due to expiry, and maximize blood freshness. Genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used to solve mathematical models quickly and efficiently, ensuring reliable operation. Result: The model’s outcomes can effectively meet the daily needs of the BSC and assist decision-makers managing blood inventory and distribution, improving robustness and resilience. Conclusions: Utilizing weights allows for the effective management of each objective function to convert the model into a single-objective mixed-integer linear programming (SO-MILP) based on unique conditions, enabling the system to self-adjust for optimal performance, boosting the sustainability of the blood supply chain, and promoting the principle of health equity under diverse real-world settings.</jats:p>"

This paper, examines the price fluctuations and the status of demand, supply and exports of onion crop. The paper highlights that the supply shocks must be addressed through technology, which can increase yields and also be leveraged for creating advanced storage structures in place of traditional ones, often used by farmers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the concept of a circular economy has gained significant traction as a sustainable approach to resource management and economic development. Unlike the traditional linear model of take-make-dispose, a circular economy aims to minimize waste generation and maximize resource efficiency by promoting product reuse, recycling, and regeneration. This paradigm shift has profound implications for supply chain management, where organizations play a pivotal role in shaping the transition towards more sustainable practices. Despite the growing interest in circular economy concepts, the integration of these principles into supply chain management remains a complex and evolving challenge. Organizations, especially in the construction industry, face various barriers, including technological limitations, regulatory constraints, and cultural inertia. This chapter interrogates the nexus between circular economy practices in supply chain management from a construction industry perspective.</jats:p>",

Key factors for success include liberalization of a 1.4 billion consumer market. India's industrial growth is largely driven by the manufacturing sector. However, the growth rate of the manufacturing sector could not be adequate for the requirement of an employable population. The service sector, which accounts for over half of India's GDP, has seen a high growth rate after liberalisation. Agribusiness supply chain management (SCM) involves managing relationships between businesses responsible for efficient production and supply of products to meet consumers' requirements. Government agencies are implementing legal reforms to encourage private investment in agricultural marketing infrastructure and promote coordinated supply chains and traceability.

It is imperative for clothing manufacturing SMEs in developing nations like Zimbabwe, with reference to Bulawayo Province, which lacks digitization to integrate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions into their supply chain operations to improving efficiency and maintain competitiveness in the global market. Thus, the purpose of the study was to evaluate ICT and supply chain efficiency in the clothing manufacturing SMEs in Bulawayo Province. Employing the pragmatic approach, data were collected using semi-structured questionnaires from a sample of 107 from a total population of 147 that were triangulated with 15 interviews from clothing manufacturing SMEs in Bulawayo. A simple linear regression analysis through Ordinary Least Squares was conducted to test the relationship between ICT and supply chain efficiency. The results show that ICT has a positive and statistically significant effect on cost performance, agility and delivery performance in Bulawayo clothing manufacturing SMEs. By prioritizing ICT adoption, managers can achieve better cost management, increased responsiveness to market demands, and enhanced delivery capabilities. It is recommended that clothing manufacturing SMEs in Bulawayo should embrace the ICT. Further studies should examine the relationship between ICT and supply chain efficiency in manufacturing SMEs across different industries and nations.</jats:p>",

It leverages the organization information processing theory as a theoretical lens to analyze the proposed relationships.

The results show that the innovation capability mediating effect is higher between BA and supply chain integration than between BA and supply chain resilience link. However, supply chain resilience and integration are equally effective in translating innovation capability influence to organizational performance. The authors find that developing countries reap more benefits from BA in driving innovation, and country culture plays a vital role in driving innovations.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study offers multiple theoretical implications. First, deriving from organization information processing theory, the authors recognized that BA and innovation capability complement each other, which improves the information processing capacity of the organizations, enabling supply chain integration, resilience and organizational performance (Bahrami <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2022; Gupta <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2020; Chatterjee <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2022). This study is one of few that analyzed how BA and innovation capability work together to drive supply chain integration, resilience and organizational performance, which was not collectively studied in existing studies, meta-analyses or reviews to ascertain the direct and mediating mechanisms (Aryal <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2020; Oesterreich <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2022; Ansari and Ghasemaghaei, 2023; Bag and Rahman, 2023; Alvarenga <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2023). Second, our study offers integrated and more definitive results regarding identified relationships. More precisely, the study provides statistically significant direct effects with the help of meta-analysis and meta-structural equation modeling to remove the ambiguity in the literature. Third, apart from the above definitive relationships, mediation analysis contributes to academia in identifying significant mediating mechanisms related to innovation capability, supply chain integration and resilience. Innovation capability partially and significantly mediates between BA and supply chain integration/resilience. Fourth, meta-regression provides valuable insights related to DCS, national culture and type of economies in the supply chain context. In fact, this study is the first one to examine the effects of DCS and all dimensions of national culture on the BA−INV relationship and overcome certain limitations that exist in the literature (Oesterreich <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2022; Ansari and Ghasemaghaei, 2023; Nakandala <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2023).</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Big data is captured through evolving digital technologies such as intelligent sensors, radio frequency identification tags, global positioning system (GPS) locations and social media, which generate large data sets. Thus, managers must extract value from such a large data set and transition from big data to BA. This transition encompasses retrieving unknown patterns and insights from big data, its interpretations and extracting meaningful actions (Gupta <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2020; Hallikas <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2021). This study confirms that organizational capabilities in terms of BA and innovation enable supply chain integration and resilience. Managers must concentrate on BA and innovation capability simultaneously rather than making a trade-off between capabilities (Morita and Machuca, 2018) to drive supply chain integration, resilience and performance. For example, Morita and Machuca (2018) study revealed that many companies are doing trade-offs between capabilities and innovation. Hence, the findings clarified confusion among practitioners and confirmed that BA improves innovation capability, consequently enabling higher supply chain integration and resilience. Thus, managers investing in innovation capability will be more confident about integration, resilience and performance outcomes.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This is one of the early studies that examine the underlying mechanisms of innovation capability, supply chain integration and resilience between BA and organizational performance.

An empirical analysis was performed utilizing data gathered from 350 respondents from enterprises across several industries in Bangladesh through a quota sampling strategy. We used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the direct and indirect effects. Ethical Dilemma (ETD) and Leadership (LED) quality were used as mediating variables. The results indicate that SSC and SCMP have a beneficial effect on SCP, with LED quality as a significant mediator. However, less directly impactful, ETD creates an essential framework for ethical practices inside the supply chain. The Importance-Performance Map highlights LED quality and SCMP as critical elements to improving SCP, suggesting that firms must prioritize these areas for optimal performance. The study's weaknesses include its cross-sectional methodology and concentration on a small geographic area, which may impact generalization.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper discusses how ML can be leveraged to enhance supply chain forecasting through demand prediction, risk mitigation and demand-supply match optimization. Even deterministic and time-series supply chain approaches dont have an edge over volatile and challenging data environments, making them imprecise and inflexible. Through the use of ML models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) agents, this study shows the accuracy in demand prediction, risk detection, and supply-demand match. The primary findings include: the RNN decreases the mean squared error by 15% over traditional approaches and the RL agent minimizes inventory turnover and lead times to enhance supply chain efficiencies. These results highlight the potential of ML to react rapidly to real-time shifts and drive better decisions. The report provides a comprehensive approach to data-driven predictive models, and useful advice for companies looking to improve supply chain resilience and profitability. </jats:p>"

Recent advancements in video AI applications allow for detecting when workers cross safety lines, but determining their height and the spatial distance between them and live equipment is still a challenge. This article proposes a pre-control system using LiDAR, an edge processing module, and a warning module to ensure safe operations in power distribution scenarios. The system scans the area in real time, uses deep learning to identify objects like distribution stations, human bodies, high-voltage equipment, and transmission lines in point clouds, and calculates the distance between operators and high-voltage equipment. When this distance approaches or exceeds safety limits, the warning module issues voice alerts. Experimental results show that this system significantly reduces false alarms compared to video-based methods, accurately measures distances, and provides timely warnings, making it a practical solution for enhancing worker safety in power distribution operations.</jats:p>",

In this study, the combined effect of temperature and chlorine concentration on kb was investigated. A central composite design (CCD) was employed. Ten scenarios were conducted on a pilot-scale pipeline network with initial chlorine concentrations from 0.38 to 4.62 mg/L and water temperature from 22.93 to 37.07 °C. A statistical analysis of the kb obtained in the experiments was conducted using STATGRAPHICS software. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) for Log10(kb) was also performed to segregate the combined contributions of chlorine and temperature effects. Chlorine concentration and temperature are factors that significantly affect kb. However, the temperature effect is marginal compared to that of the chlorine concentration. A quadratic model obtained from CCD data effectively predicted the kb within the proposed experimental zone, although its utility may be limited at lower temperatures. The combined effect of chlorine concentration and temperature on the Log10(kb) is shown on the response surface obtained from the quadratic prediction model of kb. Analysis of the response surface revealed that the operating conditions of 22.3 °C and 3.33 mg/L, respectively, yield the minimal value of kb = 0.0347 h−1.</jats:p>",

This chapter analyses the environmental and social data of companies involved in the logistics sector of the Italian ceramic industry. The linear regression statistical model shows that, for logistics companies, increasing social responsibility practices significantly reduces emissions. The chapter highlights the relevance of investing in social responsibility practices as this contributes to emission reduction and, consequently, the transition toward eco-logistics.

The outcome is operational challenges with some areas not getting adequate supply because of inappropriate pipe routing and sizing, and pressure build up in some sections resulting in pipe bursts during operation. The study evaluated the hydraulic performance of the Lawra township water distribution system for improved service delivery using hydraulic-based models. The Flowius application, Google Earth, Geographical information system (GIS) were the data collection tools employed, while EPAnet and Microsoft Excel software were used to analyse the data. The hydraulic parameters within a 24-hour period in the existing and proposed network were monitored. The existing system runs for a maximum of five hours (00:00am-05:00am) when tested with pressure value (5.3 m) not meeting the minimum pressure requirement of 10 m. The remaining hours of the day depicted negative pressures signifying system unbalance. There were significant head losses in all the three (3) zones (A 24.25 m/km, B 161.66 m/km and C 72.96 m/km) with zone B recording almost thirty-two (32) times higher than the recommended standard of 5 m/km. Series of velocity fluctuation occurred (0m/s – 2.81m/s) across the entire network during the simulation period. The existing network coverage is 70 % with 1360 households. The remodelled network, using EPAnet software for improved performance, was balanced with hydraulic parameters (pressure, velocity and head loss) meeting designed standards and peak hourly demand occurred at 18:00 hours across all the three (3) pressure zones. </jats:p>"

The relevant 384 respondents were selected from the targeted SMEs using standard random sampling techniques. Using the structural equation model (SEM) and AMOS software, this study investigated the link among green innovation and its mediating impact. The SEM results further supported the notion that green supply chain strategies have a direct influence on green innovation. The results demonstrate that enhanced firm performance is a direct result of growing green innovation. The standardized coefficient of 0.683 approaches statistical significance at p &amp;lt;.01(0.009). The results imply that a greater degree of firm performance was achieved through partial mediation of green innovation. Therefore, policy makers, institutions, non-governmental organizations, and other interested parties should concentrate on providing MSEs with green innovation.</jats:p>",

The main objective of the study is to investigate the effects of\nSupply chain management on Organisational performance of Supermarket in Buea case of Njeiforbi The research\ndesign adopted for this study was descriptive research survey. A stratified sampling technique was used for this study\nwith a sample size of 35 respondents from Njeiforbi Supermarket, Buea. Pearson's correlation was used to test the\nhypothesis of the study using SPSS version 21. The finding revealed that there is a positive relationship between supply\nchain management of Supermarkets, Buea; case of Njeiforbi and their organizational performance. The results\nconclude that Supply chain management strategies (that is; supply chain integration, customer relationship management,\ninformation sharing, strategic supplier partnerships, supply chain collaboration and outsourcing) are actively\ncarried out in Njeiforbi. Also, supply chain integration and collaboration were concluded to be greatly impacting organisational\nperformance of Supermarkets, Buea case of Njeiforbi. The study also concludes that Njeiforbi faces lots\nof problems like high complexity of supply chain, poor inventory management techniques, poor customer service,\nand high supply chain volatility. The study therefore recommends that management should ensure a constant review\nand implementation of supply chain management practices especially lean practices which has not been exploited by\nthe supermarket to enable them avoid obsolescence, auction sales, stock out, increase customer service and suppliers'\nrelationship to maintain a constant trend of profit growth in the organization.\t</jats:p>"

This study draws on the contingent natural resource-based view (NRBV) to theorize and validate how pressure from supply chain (SC) stakeholders could amplify the effect of green logistics practices (GLPs) on carbon-neutral supply chain performance (CNSCP) among firms in developing countries. Specifically, this study contends that high levels of supply chain pressures (SCPs) (customers and suppliers) amplify the influence of GLPs on CNSCP.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>An integrated model was tested using survey data gathered from 208 managers of logistics firms in Ghana.

This study identified five practices and demonstrated how these practices uniquely drive CNSCP, as opposed to previous studies that examined GLPs from a one-dimensional perspective. This study also expands the borders of sustainable logistics literature by theorizing and empirically validating SCPs (customers and suppliers) as necessary conditions to amplify the benefits of GLPs. In essence, the novelty of the present study lies in the integration of NRBV and stakeholder theories to unearth the mechanism for optimizing the GLP-CNSCP relationship, which is rare in the sustainable logistics literature.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

Key aspects such as filtration efficiency, operational benefits, and coagulant incorporation, are assessed by comparing rapid filters with traditional slow sand filtration methods. The study employs empirical analysis, evaluations of existing systems, and case studies of filter-loading materials. Findings indicate that rapid filters significantly enhance water treatment efficiency, particularly when using advanced filter media that increase surface area. The integration of rapid filtration into water treatment facilities in Kyrgyzstan can provide significant environmental and economic benefits. This method offers a strategic framework for modernizing water treatment plants to improve public health and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

The Service oriented paradigm called Cloud production and manufacturing systems is one the enablers of Industry 4.0 paradigm. For the realization of the distributed manufacturing and logistics serviced in the form of global service perspective, an evolution roadmap is proposed which considers three perspectives. The first perspective has contributed to platforms and architectures for globalized service-oriented production and manufacturing systems. The research conducted on this theme contributed to the integration and interoperability of stakeholders and processes to enable the fulfillment of services. The second perspective has elaborated the idea of Cloud production and manufacturing systems by encompassing transportation and logistics as service paradigm. The main contributions of the research studies in this theme can be interpreted as mutual and synergic production and transportation service alignment. Moreover, the research studies have contributed to the development of operations research (OR) models for Cloud service network management and planning. The third perspective has extended and contributed to the application of Blockchain and emerging Web 3 technologies in Cloud manufacturing networks. These research studies have accomplished the early steps for improving the effectiveness of the second perspective and have also provided an insight to the perspective of share economy and tokenization models in service-oriented networks. The studies emphasize the potential and capabilities of Web 3 for establishment of new business models in this network. The convergence of the research perspectives concentrates on more realization of service-oriented production and supply networks. The globalized interaction frameworks which operate with autonomous structures capable of resembling the preferences of Cloud stakeholders. From the point of view of sustainability pillars high research potential can be of investigated. Moreover, the thesis proposes the future studies with motivation of more globalized, sustainable, and autonomous Cloud networks in form of tokenization paradigm.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sulphur is an essential nutrient that fulfils various important functions in plants, including the formation of amino acids, proteins, chlorophyll and the support of nitrogen uptake, e.g., in legumes. The sulphur content of the atmosphere due to industrial combustion has fallen sharply in recent decades, which has ultimately led to yield and quality deficiencies on farms. In this summarised study, data from 98 sites in Europe were recorded from 1998 to 2023. The sulphur fertiliser trials were conducted on farms, and experimental stations under organic farming conditions. A total of 1169 treatment variants and 598 standard variants without S-fertilisation were analysed. Fertilisation was carried out with various sources of sulphur in different quantities and forms, usually directly before or during crop cultivation. The amounts of plant-available S in the soil were determined at depths of 0–90 cm. Site characteristics such as Smin, Nmin, soil type, pH value, precipitation and the extent of livestock farming were recorded. A sufficient amount of data was available for each experimental aspect to quantitatively describe the influence of increasing S supply to the soil or plant species groups (permanent grassland, lucerne-clover-grass, grain legumes and cereals) from severe deficiency to oversupply. The analyses therefore focused on establishing relationships between yield responses, correlations with the nitrogen uptake of crop species and N2 fixation in legumes and the nutrient supply with plant-available sulphur. An assessment procedure was drawn up for soil supply with available sulphur that is too low (classes A, B), optimal (class C: 20–30 kg S ha−1) and too high (classes D, E). The results were also used to develop practical methods for determining fertiliser requirements for different crop species and the crop rotation in organic farming.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>For voting to contribute to democratic ends, citizens must vote congruently with their preferences. This requires citizens to acquire and process information to identify the ballot options that best match their preferences and then express those preferences effectively through the act of voting. The latter, which this article focuses on, becomes increasingly relevant with complex voting rules that entail a multitude of ballot options and elaborate tools for casting ballots. Drawing on an original large-scale experiment in the field, I provide novel insights into how an interplay of the institutional setting (complexity of voting rules), the supply side (degree of selectivity of congruence and overall congruence between ballot options and citizens’ preferences), and individual characteristics (political sophistication) shapes vote congruence on an individual level. I demonstrate that, first, citizens on average vote more congruently under complex rules, providing evidence that they possess sufficient capacities to utilize enhanced voting tools effectively. Second, the more selectively citizens support the supplied ballot options, the more congruently they vote with complex rules. This suggests that in more diversified societies, where citizens’ preferences align less with distinct parties, complex rules likely have a stronger positive effect on vote congruence. Third, I find no conclusive evidence that casting ballots under complex rules disproportionately disadvantages less politically sophisticated citizens. Instead, the informational demands of complex rules appear to reinforce biases, echoing prior research. These findings underscore that beyond acquiring and processing information, the act of voting itself is crucial for understanding the determinants of vote congruence.</p>"

The main purpose of the research was to examine the tourism situation in the micro-regions of the Southern Great Plain region, using a complex tourism performance indicator and cluster analysis. Based on the results of the complex tourism performance indicator, the Gyulai micro-region performed the best in the region. The results of the indicator show that tourism is not only concentrated in the tourist areas defined by the government in the region. These micro-region are thus excluded from the target areas for tourism investment. In the future, it would be important to examine the situation of areas that are not included in the defined tourism areas and to integrate them into the tourism target areas, since tourism is a means of balanced development of the areas and can contribute to the convergence of disadvantaged areas.</jats:p>"

The study further investigates how these factors affect the quantitative performance of logistics operations. For the analysis of the research model, interactional justice was divided into interpersonal and informational justice, and trust was divided into cognitive and emotional trust. Subsequently, surveys were conducted with employees in supply chain-related departments in South Korea to explore the pathway that leads to quantitative performance. Hypotheses were then tested through structural equation modeling. An empirical analysis revealed that both interpersonal and informational justice have a significant positive impact on both dimensions of trust and that both cognitive and emotional trust positively affect logistics performance. Based on this study's results, we concluded that interactional justice and trust are key intangible assets within the supply chain that influence quantitative logistics performance. Global supply chains are rapidly changing, undergoing repeated dismantling and reorganization. In such an environment, it is challenging to assert sustainability through existing assets and practices, and the discovery of new growth drivers is gaining attention. This study proposes a new driver for the supply chain by defining justice and trust as intangible assets and deriving a method to quantify them.</jats:p>",

The analysis employs the Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) methodology, categorizing relationships between activities into three types: Type A (3 relationship connections), Type I (2 relationship connections), and Type O (2 relationship connections). Two factory layout designs were developed based on this analysis. Layout 1 achieves a total movement distance of 2,014.72 meters from drying to daily shipping, resulting in a significant reduction of 1,160.06 meters compared to the original layout, representing a 37.69% decrease. Layout 2 reflects a total movement distance of 2,073.46 meters, which corresponds to a reduction of 1,218.80 meters from the original layout, or a 35.88% decrease. Qualitatively, the new factory layout enhances workplace safety by reducing the risk of accidents from collisions involving cloth carts, fostering a more positive work environment and increasing employee satisfaction. The design optimizes space efficiency, improving overall organization and workflow within the facility. Furthermore, although the article does not directly address service quality, the reduction in movement distance and time for transporting clean clothes indirectly contributes to improved service quality. This efficiency allows for quicker delivery of clean clothes to various departments, thereby enhancing responsiveness and operational effectiveness.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In supply chain management (SCM), the flow of goods and services from raw materials to the end user involves significant complexities and uncertainties at each stage. Computer modeling and simulation offer powerful tools to address these challenges, as they can efficiently analyze operational issues that are otherwise time-consuming and difficult to explore. Inaccurate estimation of raw materials, labor, or equipment often leads to financial losses and environmental impact, a concern for many manufacturing companies. The purpose of this study is to explore the application of system dynamics modeling (SDM) in the manufacturing of hemp-reinforced polymer composite (HRPC), with the goal of optimizing material, labor, and equipment usage. By applying system dynamics (SD), the manufacturing unit can enhance sustainability by minimizing the use of materials, labor, and equipment, thereby lowering energy consumption. For this research, the SDM software STELLA® was chosen for its affordability, ease of use, and comprehensive features, making it a strong choice compared to other leading software options. Our literature review revealed a significant gap in existing research, as we could not identify any study currently exploring the simulation of HRPC material manufacturing using SDM. Our study concludes that SDM simulation serves as an effective method for optimizing materials, labor, and equipment in the manufacturing of HRPC materials. By simulating various supply chain scenarios in a risk-free environment, the model reduces resource consumption and improves manufacturing efficiency, hence promoting sustainability. Furthermore, outputs from the STELLA® model can serve as inputs for life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantitatively evaluate environmental impacts.</jats:p>"

This aspect is frequently underappreciated, yet studies indicate it could be a significant area of environmental impact. For instance, research has shown that a typical electric vehicle needs around six times the mineral resources of a conventional vehicle, while an onshore wind turbine requires nine times the mineral input compared to a gas power plant of similar capacity.\nThis paper seeks to analyze the environmental effects linked to the critical miner-als required by certain renewable energy technologies.

Next, it calculates the specific mineral quantities necessary for each model, followed by an assessment of the environmental repercussions tied to their extrac-tion and processing.

Still, there’s been limited focus on the impact of digital twin (DT) technologies and supply chain disruption mitigation (SCDM) strategies on SCR. This study addresses this gap by examining how DT and SCDM strategies enhance SCR and whether strategic fit (SF) moderates these relationships. Using the dynamic capability view (DCV) as the theoretical foundation, we developed our conceptual framework and research hypotheses. Data were collected from 200 Bangladeshi manufacturing organizations through a survey-based approach, and the partial least square (PLS) technique was utilized to assess the framework and research hypotheses. The findings reveal that both DT technologies and SCDM strategies significantly boost SCR. Besides, while SF plays a critical moderating role in the relationship between DT and SCR, it does not moderate the association between SCDM strategies and SCR. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of SCR by integrating DT and SCDM strategies within the DCV framework, offering insights into their roles in managing supply chain disruptions. Additionally, it provides practical guidance for managers on effectively leveraging DT and SCDM strategies to build resilient supply chains while emphasizing the importance of strategic alignment in optimizing digital interventions.</jats:p>",

While freight markets have limited direct contact with Russia and Ukraine, global logistics have exposed supply chains to an increasing number of risk factors, including airspace restrictions, uncertainty about the future path of consumer demand, and China’s ongoing interventions regarding the COVID-19 process. The effects of various economic and geopolitical risks on the supply chain are the main analysis subject of this study.    \nMethodology- In accordance with the scope of the study, the causality analysis suggested by Toda Yamamoto was applied between the Baltic Dry Cargo Index (BALTIC) and Brent oil prices (BRENT). In the study, data covering the period 2020:1-2023:12 at monthly frequency was used. In order to examine the relationship between Baltic Dry Cargo Index (BALTIC) and Brent oil prices (BRENT), data regarding the causality analysis proposed by Toda and Yamamoto are shared in tables.  Extended Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test was used to analyze the data. The results are presented in tables and interpreted.\nFindings- The effects of risks, conflicts and crises that arise in different ways in different geographies on the supply chain are examined in detail with country examples. The problems experienced by countries against supply chain problems, steps taken towards solutions, the effects of crises experienced in the supply chain, and future scenarios are presented in detail in different regions. This study clearly states that geopolitical tensions and the pandemic have dealt a significant blow to the supply chain, and that the disruptions in the supply chain have reached a level that will leave countries helpless\nConclusion In the study, the relationship between the Baltic Dry Index (BALTIC) and Brent oil prices (BRENT) was empirically examined. Contrary to studies in the literature, no significant causality relationship was found between the two variables. In the study, it was emphasized that the cost increases in the supply chain and transportation axis were not due to oil prices, but geopolitical and economic risks. Geopolitical and economic risks arise from pandemics, political instability at international borders, trade conflicts and legislative changes. Increases in risks, tariffs, trade restrictions and sanctions disrupt supply chains, increase costs and hinder market access. The increase in risks experienced in recent years has been a determinant in the disruption of supply chains and the increase in costs.\n\nKeywords: Economics, supply chain, Toda Yamamoto, geopolitical risk, cost of economic risk\nJEL Codes: A10, E00, R40\n</jats:p>"

Gasoline holds the second highest market share, and with the increasing number of gasoline-fueled vehicles, its proportion in the transport fuel mix is continuously expanding. The main objective of this study is to assess the ecological burden associated with the gasoline supply chain in Sri Lanka by conducting a life cycle assessment from a ‘well-to-tank’ perspective. In the scenario analysis, the environmental impacts of four potential gasoline distribution scenarios were assessed and compared with the existing distribution model. According to the results, the refining process was predominant, contributing more than 50% to climate change, terrestrial acidification, marine and freshwater eutrophication, human toxicity, and terrestrial and marine ecotoxicities. Meanwhile, crude oil extraction dominates in its contribution to ozone depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, freshwater ecotoxicity, and fossil depletion. The results of the scenario analysis show a remarkable reduction in the environmental load when rail transport is solely used to transfer gasoline from bulk terminals to regional depots. The reduction is over 65% in most impact categories compared to the existing distribution method, which involves a combination of both road and rail transport. This study identifies the key areas that need to be further analyzed to lower the environmental impacts while also establishing a foundation for conducting comparative environmental assessments of alternative fuel options in the Sri Lankan context.</jats:p>"

Likely reasons were to increase the regular supply of garden fruit, legumes, and medicinal herbs for expanding monastic communities. Regular supply of textile fibres for those communities is likely too. Some rural monasteries bought gardens in towns and they had shops there; a network of roads was available and there was plentiful provision of draught animals, the necessary elements of a distribution system. It looks as if some textiles—and plant dyes—were provided for urban communities. Garden plots may well have been acquired in order to focus on textile and dye plants for cloth production for distribution; monastic enterprise took a new direction, with a corresponding shift in garden product.</jats:p>",

The efficiency and robustness of these supply chains, which are driven by the underlying risk culture, have a direct impact on patient outcomes, operational efficiency, and overall healthcare quality. This study investigates the significance of supply chain risk culture in order to identify its impact on supply chain capabilities and performance. This includes the attitudes, beliefs, and practices that determine a company's risk management strategy inside its supply chain, as well as how it perceives and responds to uncertainty. The research study gathered 294 samples from hospital employees in selected hospitals to evaluate the qualities that impact Supply Chain performance, with a focus on agility, collaboration, and adaptability. In the healthcare industry, supply chain capabilities have been shown to have a significant influence on hospital performance. Risk culture also had a substantial negative moderating effect on the connection between SC capability and SC performance. A severe aversion to risk, to put it simply. The relationship between supply chain capabilities and SC performance is weakened by risk culture when it takes a high value, and vice versa.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades, fluctuating unemployment rates and welfare state retrenchment have led to increased levels of economic insecurity in some countries. At the same time, cultural norms and family policies have become more gender-egalitarian. While earlier research related these trends to the decline in the male breadwinner model, little is known about whether recent cohorts who entered adult life against the backdrop of a new socio-economic opportunity structure have established new configurations of household labour supply. Using sequence analysis and cluster analyses across harmonised longitudinal data (GSOEP, BHPS and Understanding Society) for a sample of adults born between 1961 and 1973 in Germany and the United Kingdom (UK), this study introduces an innovative indicator of household labour supply types and new descriptive findings on the cohort replacement of household labour supply in these two countries. Descriptive findings show that recent cohorts in both Germany and the UK are forming more gender-egalitarian households, as reflected by the decline in the male breadwinner model as well as by the rise of 1.5-male breadwinner households in Germany and dual-earner households in the UK. However, the proportion of single and low labour intensity households in recent cohorts has declined in the UK, while there has been no meaningful change in East Germany and a strong increase in West Germany. The evolution of household labour supply types can be attributed to the replacement of cohorts who entered adulthood and established their households under shifting socio-economic contexts and gender ideologies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The way organizations function in today's dynamic market landscape has been changed by the integration of data analytics inside supply chain management. Within the supply chain domain, data analytics pertains to be methodical procedure of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting diverse data kinds produced along the chain in order to extract significant understandings and practical intelligence. It entails applying methods from the fields of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics to boost operational effectiveness, optimize decision-making, and raise overall performance in the ecosystem of the supply chain. Organizations may make well-informed decisions, spot trends, and proactively handle problems by analyzing data from a variety of sources, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. This results in more efficient resource allocation and streamlined procedures. Data analytics is playing a more and more important role as businesses look to improve operational efficiency, cut costs, and successfully satisfy customer needs. This study examines the role that data analytics plays in supply chain optimization, helping firms to increase the precision of their forecasts, simplify their logistical procedures, and make well-informed decisions through literature review. Most of the literature that is currently available agrees that big data analytics goes far beyond simply reimagining the supply chain. It may help the next generation of multinational corporations function more adaptably in a setting that is becoming more demanding and unpredictable. This conceptual paper applies  relevant review literature and draw conclusions.\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.52783/pst.1315</jats:p>"

Also false disconnections can lead to stoppage of rolling stock on the guiding gradient and, thus, reduce throughput and transportation capacity. To solve the problem, namely to exclude false tripping of fast-acting switches, the paper proposes a method of using GPS/GLONASS transmitters to improve protection devices on supply lines. Methods: the research is carried out on the basis of theoretical knowledge of new developments related to geopositioning of rolling stock, theory of electric and magnetic circuits and theory of traction power supply. Results: this paper formulates and studies the concept of loading the set point of feeder line protection devices based on the data of current collector location on the electric rolling stock relative to the isolating coupling. Also each block of the complex of devices and principles of their operation are described in detail. The graphs of change of current setting of fast-acting switches are constructed and the variant of modernization of their design for operative change of current setting is offered. Practical significance: the result of the work is of importance, first of all, for ensuring reliability, uninterrupted operation of the traction power supply system and increasing the throughput and carrying capacity. The presented work sets a new direction for the development of protection devices in the DC traction power supply system using a new type of transmitted data – the geographical position of the rolling stock. Thus, the work demonstrates the possibility of introducing new technologies for determining the position of the object in the relay protection system of the contact network.</jats:p>",

Significant discrepancies were found: humanitarian SCM prioritizes functional logistics, while business SCM places a larger emphasis on information technology, customs, transportation, and port/airport management. These findings suggest a dynamic skillset evolution, where functional skills, essentialat entry-level positions, give way to general management capabilities as one progresses. This shift is more pronounced by experience rather than job title in the humanitarian sector.

The escalation in greenhouse gas emissions, environmental pollution, and resource depletion has underscored the urgency for such transformations. Consequently, studies have increasingly focused on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). This review synthesizes existing literature on SSCM practices, drawing from research outputs from various industries and geographical regions. The synthesis relies on the Systematic Literature Review Methodology in gathering and analyzing relevant articles published between 2014 and 2024. A total of 29 articles were reviewed, and they met the inclusion criteria for detailed content examination. The review identifies three main dimensions of SSCM: environmental, economic, and social. Environmental considerations feature prominently in the literature, with studies addressing issues such as waste management, carbon footprint reduction, and resource conservation. Economic performance, including cost management and market competitiveness, is also a significant focus, particularly in studies conducted in emerging economies. Additionally, the review highlights the growing and critical position of social sustainability within supply chain management, although it remains relatively understudied compared to environmental and economic dimensions. Overall, the findings underscore the multifaceted nature of SSCM practices and their imperative attributes for organizations in adopting holistic approaches that integrate environmental, economic, and social considerations. The review contributes to a deeper understanding of current research trends and emphasizes the need for further investigation into social sustainability within SSCM, particularly in the context of emerging economies.</jats:p>"

Second, it adapts and optimizes DC-DC converters to the output of PV panels for higher energy conversion efficiency by stabilizing energy outputs due to weathering issues. Additional area for research includes the choice and tuning of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms that will enable this system to follow maximum power point under diverse weather and light conditions in order to maximize energy harvesting. Moreover, the paper also performs an in-depth study of coupling transformer design and optimization of main circuit parameters for better energy transmission efficiency and System stability. The feasibility and effectiveness of the PV-powered wireless charging systems are validated by simulation verification as well as experimental testing in this paper.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The burgeoning size and complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce significant challenges in ensuring data integrity. The proliferation of \"deep fakes\" and manipulated information raises concerns about the vulnerability of LLMs to misinformation. Traditional LLM architectures often lack robust mechanisms for tracking the origin and history of training data. This opaqueness can leave LLMs susceptible to manipulation by malicious actors who inject biased or inaccurate data. This research proposes a novel approach integrating Blockchain Technology (BCT) within the LLM data supply chain. With its core principle of a distributed and immutable ledger, BCT offers a compelling solution to address this challenge. By storing the LLM's data supply chain on a blockchain, we establish a verifiable record of data provenance. This allows for tracing the origin of each data point used to train the LLM, fostering greater transparency and trust in the model's outputs. This decentralised approach minimises the risk of single points of failure and manipulation. Additionally, the immutability of blockchain records ensures that the data provenance remains tamper-proof, further enhancing the trustworthiness of the LLM. Our approach leverages three critical features of BCT to strengthen LLM security: 1) Transaction Anonymity: While data provenance is recorded on the blockchain, identities of data contributors can be anonymised, protecting their privacy while ensuring data integrity. 2) Decentralised Repository: Enhances the system's resilience against potential attacks by distributing the data provenance record across the blockchain network. 3) Block Validation: Rigorous consensus mechanisms ensure the validity of each data point added to the LLM's data supply chain - minimising the risk of incorporating inaccurate or manipulated data into the training process. Using the experimental approach, initial evaluations using simulated LLM training data on a blockchain platform demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing data integrity. This approach has far-reaching implications for ensuring the trustworthiness of LLMs in various applications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The essence of any business is flow. The flow of materials and/or services from suppliers — perhaps through multiple manufacturing plants and then through delivery channels to customers. The flow of information to all parties about what is planned and required, what is happening, what has happened and what should happen. The flow of cash returns from the market to the organisation and through to the suppliers. This paper makes a critical connection between the concept of flow and the material requirements planning (MRP) inputs, processing logic and assumptions and introduces a necessary change in processing logic to address the challenges companies experience today. The true purpose of planning — to promote and protect the flow of relevant information and materials — was the driving purpose behind the development of MRP. Throughout this planning and information system evolution, MRP’s basic requirements, assumptions and processing logic have remained unchanged. Despite newer and more powerful planning, and control applications powered by cloud-based infrastructure, the basic approaches to planning manufactured and purchased items have remained largely a constant since the 1960s. This paper proposes an innovative pragmatic proven methodology that enables a company to successfully sense and adapt to changes in the volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA) world.</jats:p>"

In this regard, the article examines the processes of diversification of energy resources and the project of the Eastern Mediterranean gas pipeline (EastMed). The main purpose is to consider the prospects and difficulties that arose during the EastMed development. The objective of the study includes exploring the positions of the core regional states (Greece, Republic of Cyprus, Italy, Turkey, Israel) and the global powers (the EU, the USA, Russia). A systematic approach and situational analysis were applied to achieve the set objectives. The article reveals that in the current geopolitical conditions the EastMed project has acquired strategic importance for the EU, its member states and partners. For the Republic of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, and Israel the implementation of EastMed will strengthen their own energy security, existing and new interregional ties, and increase their role in the EU’s common energy policy. Turkey is the main opponent, which will do everything to prevent EastMed from taking place. The United States, which was initially interested in the project, due to environmental and financial reasons, stopped supporting it after Joe Biden came to power.</jats:p>"

The application of big data technology enables the utilisation of data to enhance comprehension of these imbalances, thereby informing the formulation of policy. We put forth a model for analyzing the housing supply and demand based on big data, which employs a comprehensive approach to examine both the demand and supply sides. With regard to the demand side, the model incorporates a multitude of data sources to ascertain and delineate the pivotal elements influencing housing demand. These include population growth rate, household income level, employment opportunity distribution, migration and flow trends, and cost of living. By constructing cubes, the model is capable of capturing the characteristics of dynamic demand changes in different regions. With regard to the supply side, the model assesses land use, building materials and labor costs, the timeliness of building permitting and approval processes, and the impact of regional policies and regulations. By means of a quantitative analysis of the aforementioned factors, the model is able to identify housing supply bottlenecks in different regions. The model's efficacy in identifying significant imbalances between supply and demand in the United States housing market was validated through experimental analysis of historical data.</jats:p>"

An initial examination of definitional quandaries over drought paves the way for a discussion of the problematics of governing through drought, in particular, the ways in which, following Urciuoli, \"strategically deployable [linguistic] shifters\" contribute to consensus-building, and the ways in which legal and regulatory regimes, as well as politics, help shape settler economic practices during droughts. The discussion then turns to social justice and unequally distributed vulnerabilities intensified by groundwater depletion and drought governance practices. The article concludes by critically considering several possible approaches to drought governance that take the coproduction of nature and culture as integral. The introduction argues, and the Special Section articles support this, that a reconfiguration of drought economics and governance, along with a prioritizing of Native American sovereignty in the US, is imperative.</jats:p>"

France encourages a swift return of mothers to the labour market, whereas Germany does not. Using harmonized administrative data, we analyse labour market trajectories of 24,112 French and 74,258 German women who were employed prior to birth and had their first child between 1997 and 2014. Our results reveal that women with higher pre-birth income, education, and employment in higher-wage firms experience less employment loss in both countries. Among these dimensions, pre-birth income emerges as the strongest stratifying factor when analysed jointly. Motherhood penalties are significantly smaller in France, predicting less than a third of the overall employment reduction found in Germany during the five years after birth. However French penalties are more stratified than across all three dimensions of stratification. For instance, in France, a mother from the lowest income quintile faces a participation reduction that is 3.14 times greater than that of a mother from the highest quintile, whereas in Germany, this ratio is 1.17. Within Germany, East Germany exhibits smaller but more stratified penalties.  Finally, we test if the observed macro-level patterns - where bigger penalties correspond to less stratification - generalize to local labour markets. An analysis of 65 NUTS-2 regions in both countries rejects this hypothesis. These findings suggest that in regimes promoting rapid labour market reintegration, mothers from lower socio-economic backgrounds may face greater challenges.</p>"

Through profit comparison and numerical simulation, we uncover the following insights: (1)When logistics services are heterogeneous, even if sales is homogeneous, the two platforms adopt distinctly different control strategies for both sales and logistics, resulting in a single separated Nash equilibrium in the game. (2)Neither platform has a dominant strategy, and any combination of sales and logistics under self-operation or third-party operation may become the platform's strategic choice, leading to multiple separated Nash equilibria between the two parties. (3)Both parties cannot simultaneously maximize their profits, but a platform that adopts full centralization, especially in logistics, achieves a higher profit level than a competitive platform. Therefore, both parties have a need for integrated operations that seek centralized logistics and sales, which can easily lead them into a \"prisoner's dilemma\" where both suffer losses.</p>"

An analysis of literary sources was carried out regarding the effectiveness of the existing methods of wastewater treatment that contain compounds of heavy metals. The efficiency of iron ion extraction was investigated by processing of steel pickling solutions using the ferritization with various activation methods of the reaction mixture. X-ray phase analysis of the obtained ferritization sediments confirmed the presence of highly dispersed ferromagnetic phases of iron oxides and oxyhydroxides. The sorption capacity of magnetite sediment obtained by ferritization on the efficiency of zinc ion extraction from the wastewater of the galvanic line was studied. The influence of pH value and ultrasound on sorption treatment of washing wastewater by magnetite sediment was determined. When using ultrasound for sorbent treatment and raising the pH to 10, the residual concentration of zinc ions in the washing wastewater decreases to 0.31 mg/dm3, the degree of purification is 98.9%. Such water meets the standards for its use in the operations of washing parts at electroplating facilities or discharge into the city's central sewage system. The prospects for the utilization of spent sorbents in powder paint and varnish materials as a result of the inclusion in their composition of ferritization products obtained from electroplating waste are considered. The use of ferromagnetic waste from sorption treatment improves the corrosion resistance of the resulting coatings compared to traditional ones. The implementation of research results at enterprises will prevent environmental pollution by toxic substances, change outdated production technologies and obtain from production waste materials for corrosion protection of metal construction.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A multitude of Supply Chain Administration issues could make it difficult for commodities, information, and services to move effectively within the construction sector. Poor collaboration and communication may be the outcome of several stakeholders and the fragmented nature of the building industry. This dispersion makes it difficult to coordinate tasks effectively, which can cause delays and ineffectiveness. Additionally, a lack of transparency regarding material availability, location, and status can lead to miscommunication and poor decision-making. Unreliable lead times for materials and equipment, along with inventory management complexities, further exacerbate supply chain issues. Inefficient transportation and logistics, quality control and inspection problems, project complexity, and environmental sustainability concerns are other key challenges. Overcoming these obstacles requires proactive planning, effective communication, and the implementation of technologies to enhance visibility and coordination throughout the chain of supply in construction. The research significance of studying Construction Supply Chain Administration Issues lies in its potential to address critical industry challenges. By identifying and understanding the specific issues faced in construction supply chains, researchers can develop strategies and solutions to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and minimize delays in construction projects. Improved Supply Chain Administration can lead to streamlined operations, optimized inventory management, better coordination among stakeholders, and enhanced sustainability practices. This research contributes to the advancement of the construction industry by enabling more effective decision-making, improved project outcomes, and increased competitiveness for construction companies. Since TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-analytical method, it is given priority. A decision-making technique called TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) ranks alternatives according to how closely they resemble the ideal solution and how far they are from the unfavorable ideal answer. Alternative Parameters taken as Supllier1, Supllier2, Supllier3, Supllier4. Evaluation parameters taken as Quality, reputation, technology, level, compatibility, cost, distance. The highest-ranking Supply Chain Administration Issues in the Construction Industry utilizing the TOPSIS Analysis approach is shown in Table 5 along with the preference score. Supplier 1 is in first place, followed by Supplier 2 in second, Supplier 3 in third, and Supplier 4 in last. The TOPSIS approach is used to produce the end product. Construction Supply Chain Administration Issues pose significant challenges in the modern era. Embracing technology, fostering collaboration, and optimizing logistics are vital for tackling issues like supplier reliability, cost control, quality assurance, and distance-related inefficiencies. By addressing these challenges head-on, the construction industry can achieve improved project outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability. It is imperative to prioritize transparency, agility, and innovation to transform the supply chain and adapt to the evolving needs of the modern construction landscape. This will drive industry-wide progress, foster resilience, and ensure successful project delivery in an increasingly complex and competitive environment.</jats:p>",

Using a demand‐pull, supply‐push framework, qualitative analysis assesses two potential scenarios: ‘Blue Sky’, where China‐Gulf supply chains grow stronger through ambitious renewable energy targets and expanded foreign direct investment, and ‘Sand Storm’, where geopolitical tensions and export restrictions could weaken these ties. The findings indicate that while supply chain engagement with China has risks, on balance China‐Gulf supply solar and wind technology supply chains are currently robust and projected to remain so in the future.

This paper will describe and analyze the structure of energy power sources and their characteristics from the perspective of power sources, divided into those that derive energy from external sources and those that derive energy from the body’s biochemical reactions and movements. As technology advances, the battery’s energy source will become more versatile. Initially, rigid metal batteries were unsuitable for flexible implantable devices, but research has improved the structure of metal batteries and better-sealed packaging to avoid harming the human body. It has also developed remote power supply and human chemical energy batteries. The characteristics of these batteries are designed to serve the patient better and alleviate subsequent pain, which is also the direction of development.</jats:p>"

This study examines the supply side of rural lodges within the oasis, focusing on their characteristics, pricing, and key factors influencing the rural tourism market. Descriptive analysis revealed a diverse range of rental prices (SAR 350–3000 per night) and lodge sizes (90–10,000 m2). Three types of rural lodges emerged: chalets, resorts, and istrahas, catering to various guest preferences and budgets. Resorts, with their larger sizes and comprehensive amenities, commanded the highest average prices. A hedonic price model was employed to analyze the factors affecting rental prices. We find that the number of bedrooms, the availability of pools, and car garages positively impacted prices. In contrast, the presence of pool fences and “family-only” designations negatively affected prices, suggesting limited appeal to some market segments. These findings provide valuable insights for tourism stakeholders and policymakers seeking to optimize the rural tourism sector in Al-Ahsa Oasis. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding supply-side dynamics, catering to diverse visitor needs, and investing in amenities that enhance guest experiences. By promoting quality standards and encouraging infrastructure investment, policymakers can contribute to the sustainable development of rural tourism in Al-Ahsa Oasis.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Flaring in oil and gas production is used to combust flammable hydrocarbons that otherwise would be vented to the atmosphere. One potential cause of flaring is intermittent disruptions in gas supply chains between oil and gas production sites and gathering and boosting operations. Since gathering and boosting facilities serve multiple production facilities, these types of supply chain disruptions would be expected to cause simultaneous flaring at multiple upstream sites in the regions served by a gathering and boosting facility experiencing a disruption, unless production sites are able to use other gathering and boosting facilities or the production sites immediately shut-in production. To assess the potential magnitude of this type of event, the overall frequency of multiple flares being detected in a localized area (&lt;5 km radius from another flare) was assessed using spatiotemporal patterns in satellite based daily flare detections using the VIIRS Nightfire (VNF) product. Multiple detections in a localized area are unlikely if flaring is caused by independent conditions at individual sites. In contrast, multi-site detections in a localized area may be indicative of potential supply chain disruptions. Hundreds of flares in the Eagle Ford production region in south central Texas that are detected infrequently (&lt;18% observations) were evaluated. For these infrequently detected flares, which account for approximately half of flared gases in the region, 87% had 80-100% of their detections classified as multi-site events. This suggests that efforts to reduce flaring should consider impacts of supply chain disruptions.</jats:p>"

For example, soil contamination with free nitrogen has led to a tenfold increase in nitrate concentrations in well water in the Poltava region over recent years.\r\nThe analysis revealed insufficient observation points for surface water and a lack of systematic soil contamination surveys. It was demonstrated that monitoring of the Kremenchuk Reservoir should encompass not only the water quality of the reservoir itself but also the water-bearing streams, tributaries, and parts of the basin forming the reservoir, in accordance with the proposed structural-logical schemes.\r\nIt was identified that only 0.1% of the 35 billion UAH allocated over the past 12 years to the Dnipro River rehabilitation program was spent on water monitoring, while water rental payments account for only 20% of state and municipal water management expenditures.\r\nA structural-logical scheme for the development of hydro-ecological monitoring of the water environment in part of the Dnipro basin has been proposed.\r\nStructural-logical schemes for the development of a spatial monitoring framework for the integral system of the Kremenchuk Reservoir's components have been suggested.

It analyzes factors such as supply, market dynamics, labor, and consumer behavior and elements like price, time, weather, and taxes influence market conditions and consumer choices. This research paper examines the dynamics of supply in Bangladesh, focusing on its definitions, functions, and effects on market behavior. This study employs a qualitative research method using secondary data from various sources such as academic databases, newspapers, books, and Reports. Utilizing a qualitative research methodology, the study explores the determinants of supply such as price, time, climate, tax, and technical efficiency, and their influence on both the open market and consumer behavior. The findings highlight the critical relationship between supply and market fluctuations in Bangladesh’s economic landscape. The law of supply is emphasized, illustrating the direct correlation between price changes and supply levels, while exceptions to this law are also discussed. The paper further identifies barriers to effective supply, including natural disasters, political instability, and inadequate transport systems, contributing to market inefficiencies and consumer dissatisfaction. Recommendations for improving supply dynamics are proposed, such as enhancing transportation, ensuring political stability, and fostering international relations. Overall, this study underscores the significance of understanding supply determinants to foster a more structured and efficient economic environment in Bangladesh.</jats:p>",

SCM in industry refers to the systematic coordination and integration of all activities involved in the procurement, production, and delivery of goods and services, from the sources of raw materials to the end customer.  It ensures the right products are delivered in the right quantities, at the right time, and at the lowest possible cost. In this context, enhancing SCM has become a fundamental necessity for organizations aiming to improve operational efficiency, effectiveness, market share, and customer satisfaction. In this effort, LSS is a systematic methodology for improving process efficiency and effectiveness through continuous improvement by eliminating waste, minimizing defects, reducing lead time, and improving customer satisfaction. This research presented a comprehensive literature review focusing on applying the LSS methodology in SCM, as no comprehensive review is available. This study highlights the integration of LSS practices into SCM and provides a roadmap for future studies that focus on exploring the applications of LSS and its impacts on SCM. In conclusion, by aligning LSS principles with SCM strategies, organizations can achieve operational excellence, reduce costs, and improve overall supply chain efficiency while effectively meeting customer demands. Furthermore, this study aims to propose a framework that can be used to explain how the LSS methodology can be applied in different SCM fields. This comprehensive analysis aims to guide academics and professionals in improving supply chain performance using LSS tools.\n</jats:p>"

The introduction of the latest technologies reduces the weight and size of equipment, expands their functionality, but these technologies are based on nonlinear and asymmetrical power consumers, which causes a negative impact on the power grid. The power supply system of the Baltic Shipyard \"Yantar\" is characterized by a significant share of nonlinear, asymmetrical loads, often single-phase. An integrated approach to the analysis of the plant's power supply system included experimental studies of nonlinear power consumers, during which a high level of higher current harmonics (3rd, 5th and 7th orders) was established. One of the effective methods for reducing zero-sequence voltage asymmetry is to replace a transformer with a Y/Y0 winding connection diagram with a Δ/Y0 diagram. Circuit and technological solutions (separation of nonlinear loads to a separate bus system; increasing the phase of semiconductor converters; connecting a nonlinear load to a system with greater short-circuit power) and filtering devices (narrow-band filters, filter-balancing devices and active filters) are used to increase the efficiency of the power supply system when it operates under conditions of increasing distorting loads.</jats:p>",

Consequently, the empirical study evaluates the power output of renewable energy technologies through simulation modelling based on vehicle specifications and energy requirements, which is followed by numerical modelling to assess economic viability. Furthermore, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) modelling is undertaken to examine the performance levels of vehicular-mounted wind turbines. The solar modules are placed on the rooftop and sides of the bus, generating 15.9 kWh/day, and the wind turbine in the front bumper of the bus generates 8.3 kWh/day. However, the piezoelectric material generated only 22.6 Wh/day, thereby rendering this technology impractical for further analysis. Therefore, both the solar modules and wind turbines combined generate 24.2 kWh/day, which can increase the driving range by 16.3 km per day, resulting in savings of 19.36 min for charging at the stations. Investing in such projects would have a positive return as the internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) are 2.8% and £11,175, respectively. The annual revenue would be £6712, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction would be two metric tons annually. Electricity generation, the electricity generation rate, and the initial investment are identified as key factors influencing power outages in a sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, this numerical modelling study paves the way for experimental validation toward the implementation of renewable energy technologies on electric bus fleets.</jats:p>"

But the polarized nature of Peruvian politics is a significant obstacle to realizing this potential. Political instability and the steady turnover of ministers and civil servants in relevant ministries over recent years have affected the capacity of the Peruvian state to promote an inclusive national vision for its mining industry. At the same time, fragmentation among political parties has hampered the capacity of the political system to represent consistent and coherent policy interests.\n\nAhead of presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for 2026, now is the time to initiate a broad dialogue with different layers of society – including government, citizens and the private sector – over the future vision and agenda for Peru as a mining economy. To make this happen, this research paper argues that convening a series of broad-based multi-sectoral dialogues is essential to develop inclusive points of consensus on mining, development and to secure Peru’s place in global supply chains.</jats:p>"

A significant issue is their lack of adequate knowledge regarding the assessment and utilization of land quality, which results in both the quantity and quality of their crop yields falling short of acceptable standards. Consequently, this deficiency adversely affects the market prices of their produce. To address this knowledge gap, it is essential for relevant institutions, particularly the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, to offer training programs that focus on modern agricultural techniques aimed at enhancing both the quantity and quality of crop production. Additionally, the study highlights the absence of an institution dedicated to analyzing land types and quality in Cambodia.

The issue of work-life balance is at the intersection of economic behaviour and the emotional state of the individual. Each component of the work-life system is fundamentally important for individuals, but the desire for a high level of consumption and ensuring financial security may push them to skew the balance in favour of work. However, a higher level of wages could provide sufficient levels of consumption for individuals and return to the desired work-life balance through the choice of free time for non-work activities.\n\nPurpose of the article: The purpose of this article is to investigate the labour supply of individuals that seek to maintain a life-work balance.\n\nResearch methods: A model was constructed and analyzed in order to find the optimal labor supply of an individual, taking into account time free from work. As part of the study, a survey was also conducted among 200 individuals in Poland in 2024, which revealed some personal and psychological aspects regarding work-life balance among the respondents.\n\nMain findings: The analysis of the constructed model, as well as the survey conducted among individuals, proves that the higher the wage level, the more individuals are willing to supply their labour. With the need to maintain individuals’ work-life balance, the motivational function of wages remains crucial. The results also show that individuals with alternative sources of income have more opportunities to maintain a work-life balance.</jats:p>"

It can lead to destabilization of economies, price increases, and disruptions in the availability of key products worldwide. Therefore, identifying the dimensions of supply chain transformation in times of disruption is seen as an important economic challenge due to the growing threats to the economic security of countries and, in particular, their logistics sectors. The objective of the article is to identify the main disruptions that destabilize global supply chains and supply chains in Ukraine, investigate the nature of disruptions and structure them. The chosen disruptions are the spread of the COVID-2019 pandemic, the RF war in Ukraine, the anticipation of a global food crisis, and inflationary expectations. To achieve the goal general scientific and special methods were used, in particular, a bibliometric analysis, dialectical and abstract-logical methods to generalize the theoretical and methodological foundations of the functioning of the world economy and its reflection in the functioning of global supply chains and the Ukrainian logistics sector under the influence of various types of disruptions. The analysis carried out presents in detail the challenges supply chains are currently facing, the adaptation mechanisms necessary to overcome or reduce the impact of disruptions in relation to supply chains, and the tasks logistics should meet in the context of individual disruptions. The research indicates the need to transform one of the most important links in the economy, which are transportation systems and supply chains.\n\n</jats:p>"

However, a significant part of the underground sources of water supply is characterized by a high iron content, and the water from them needs to be deironed before being supplied to consumers. Removal of excessive iron content from underground water can be carried out by reagent or reagent-free methods, using water deiron installations of various design schemes and resorting to measures that increase the efficiency of their work. On the basis of the analysis of existing technologies for removing iron from groundwater and modern trends in the field of water purification, it is proposed for local water supply systems to use a filter with an automatic control valve and a technology that provides for reagent-free iron removal of groundwater due to the oxidation of dissolved iron with air cushion oxygen and further detention of the sediment formed in the layer of the multicomponent filter load. This technology is characterized by low cost and wear resistance of natural filter materials, ease of operation, environmental friendliness, which excludes secondary contamination of purified water with reagents, compactness and automation of control processes, which is especially relevant for small settlements.</jats:p>"

This is enabled by taking into account these multiple criteria often in conflict with one another: cost, emission, and delivery time. It combines fuzzy logic with the Hybrid Minkowski Consistency Operator for managing uncertainties that may usually come up in a real-world supply chain system, hence making the decisions more precise.

In addition, besides this optimization of transport, the paper discusses a hybrid multi-objective optimization methodology that involves Ant Colony Optimization (ANT) and Firefly Algorithm (FA).

Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), JIT, and linear programming are well known for their supply chain optimization approaches, but they rarely take the challenge of an evolving supply chain into account. Such methods ignore real-time information and the non-linear dynamics of supply chain variables. Instead, the LSTM model takes historical and real-time data and calculates demand with high precision, making it easier to manage your inventory, avoid stockouts, and improve customer experience. As shown in the paper, LSTM provides an accuracy rate of 91% for forecasting demand, which is superior to the use of other conventional statistical methods like Moving Averages and Exponential Smoothing. The impact of this advanced machine learning technology for optimizing supply chain performance is huge, it reduces the operating cost, optimizes the use of resources, and delivers the best service.

The main tool for developing the methodology was neural network technologies, with the help of which it is most likely possible to correctly estimate the boundaries for indicators’ values that characterize consumers and reflect their history of purchasing behavior, to select potential clients and the possibility of further cooperation with existing ones. The information base for the work is the data on consumers of a given company’s products, data from the 2GIS electronic directory, as well as the results of the primary statistical analysis and forecasts made based on neural networks of various topologies. The author presents his methodology for selecting a consumer. It has the potential for development and implementation for solving a number of other management problems. As part of the testing, the best configuration (topology) of the neural network was determined, and standard values of entry barriers when consumer choice accomplished were assessed. The methodology we developed was tested using the example of a company operating in the wholesale and retail fuel market in Novosibirsk and the Novosibirsk region. When verifying the neural network model, the quality of client classification was compared based on logistic regression, decision tree and random forest models and we found that the neural network approach provides the best results for assessing the degree of client suitability. As a result of testing the methodology, recommendations for improving neural network models were developed, including expanding the set of factors that determine the characteristics of consumers, as well as optimizing the internal structure of neural networks.</jats:p>",

Based on this, analyzing the supply chain to determine performance and recommend improvement strategies is necessary. The purpose of this research is to determine the current organic rice supply chain system, analyze supply chain performance, and develop strategies to improve the performance of the organic rice agroindustry supply chain in Jember Regency. The method used in this research is supply chain performance analysis using supply chain operation reference (SCOR) and strategy formulation using analytical network process and benefit opportunity cost risk (ANP-BOCR). These methods were chosen because they synergize with each other and have been widely used in previous studies to analyze similar problems. The results showed that the performance of the organic rice agroindustry supply chain in Jember Regency received a score of 66.01 or classified into the average range. Hence, there is a need for improvement in the supply chain that is carried out through strategy. The results show that the sub-criteria benefit (0.198205), opportunity (0.164375), and economic (0.109545) get the highest value. Based on the results of pairwise comparisons, it is also found that the most appropriate strategy is to improve all KPIs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> How to decarbonize transportation, which is now, unfortunately, the largest source of carbon emissions among all sectors? The entire industry is heavily driven by economies of scale. When more freight is collected in a lane, it can be shifted to a greener transport mode (e.g., from less-than-truckload to full-truckload, and further to rail transport), and costs and emissions are saved. To support firms achieving such benefits, we develop novel supply chain contracting models that capture supply chain partners’ strategic orders, as well as freight transportation modes with trade-offs on costs, emissions, and flexibility (in the form of a minimum transport quantity for the green mode). We find that even a conventional price-only contract with an option to shift freight mode can already boost the use of the green transport mode and considerably improve supply chain efficiency. Furthermore, we design a revenue-sharing contract that can incentivize even larger order quantities from the retailer and strongly promote the use of the green transport mode. We characterize the conditions under which the contract can achieve a win–win situation, that is, increasing economic as well as environmental sustainability of the supply chain. In a follow-up case study using realistic industry-level data, we numerically evaluate how the supply chain parameters affect this win–win situation. </jats:p>"

A business entity capable of supporting the smooth process of international transactions is required. Freight forwarding as one of the businesses engaged in logistics has an important role in facilitating the movement of goods and services from one point to another that crosses the borders of a country. The challenge faced by freight forwarding is fluctuations in foreign exchange rates involving suppliers and consumers from various countries so that they are vulnerable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The purpose of this paper is to understand the financial business processes of freight forwarding companies by managing financial risks and dealing with currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, to explore information on how to minimize the negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the company's financial condition. The research methodology is descriptive by conducting surveys and interviews with freight forwarding companies and the logistics industry. Data triangulation analysis with relevant agencies in order to obtain more valid information about industry operations in the face of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Freight forwarding companies can minimize losses from exchange rate fluctuations by implementing hedging systems and supply chain finance on an ongoing basis. </jats:p>"

In a decentralized decision-making approach, FPSC members individually and independently optimize their decision variables (retailer’s selling price and sales effort level, the supplier’s wholesale price, and the service price and freshness-keeping effort offered by the logistics service provider), while in a centralized approach, the FPSC decision variables are optimized from an overall and holistic perspective. To move from a decentralized to a centralized decision-making structure, this paper proposes a new coordination approach using wholesale and maintenance price agreements to coordinate decision variables in the investigated FPSC. After, numerical results for decision variables of the proposed FPSC members and the overall profit in two decision-making structures, decentralized and centralized decision-making, are examined and compared to analyze the performance of the models. The results show that the proposed mechanism for achieving the coordinated model not only improves the overall profit of the FPSC but also improves the service level, freshness level of products, and profit of the FPSC members. Sensitivity results show that reducing storage and supply prices for fresh products increases the attractiveness of the retail sector for investment, leading to the adoption of broader product sales policies and boosting overall FPSC profitability.</p>"

Therefore, this worrying information made us curious to document this topic. \r\nThe scope of the paper is to investigate, from an interdisciplinary point of view, the way in which the legislator deals with the issue of access to public water supply services, from a national perspective but also from a comparative law perspective. The research can contribute to enriching the literature and developing the state of the art on the issue, supporting authorities to identify new solutions for access to water services for the whole society. By way of law-specific research methods, the conclusion of the paper will be that on the one hand, the state must guarantee access to water for citizens and on the other hand, people must respect the law and be more responsible towards water. The result of the research shows that the administration is at the service of the citizen so that water services provided to the population must be carried out effectively in order to make sure that water is available for as many people as possible</jats:p>"

Further more, both technologies showed highest correlations with the effects of DSC transformation process. Moreover, based on the results of factor analysis, we claim that only a decisive and comprehensive introduction of technologies related to the digital transformation of supply chains can give positive effects, while a partial implementation of DSC technologies may even worsen the company’s results. The presented research allows for a better understanding of the context that determines DSC transformation, especially in the case of applied technologies and achieved effects of operations, as well as complex interdependencies between analyzed items of each variable.

Through factor analysis, this study identified four latent variables associated with environmental factors, three with social factors, and four with governance factors. A structural equation model was then developed to present a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of the three ESG dimensions and digital intelligence on SCR, while also examining the interplay among these ESG factors. The findings reveal that environmental factors positively influence SCR, whereas social and governance factors exert a negative impact. This study further observes that digital intelligence enhances ESG factors but does not directly influence SCR. These results underscore the intricate dynamics between ESG indicators, digital intelligence, and SCR, highlighting the imperative for supply chain entities to make balanced decisions. This research offers novel insights into the effects of ESG factors from the employees’ viewpoint, providing implications and recommendations for supply chain management.</jats:p>"

This systematic literature review (SLR), following PRISMA guidelines, and conducted with two search rounds, addressed questions of resilience and efficiency of post-harvest GSCs, key decision factors of stakeholders influencing the sustainability and operational success of GSCs, and methods that can be used to develop robust decision-making for managing risks and uncertainties in GSCs. A comprehensive database of post-2000 journal articles from the Web of Science and Scopus was analysed using bibliometric and content analysis. This research identified five key themes: (1) operational complexity requiring strategic resilience, (2) comprehensive risk management strategies, (3) critical role of transport and storage infrastructure, (4) significant impact of stakeholder decisions on GSC dynamics, and (5) diverse methodological approaches for robust analysis. These themes illustrate the multifaceted challenges and opportunities within GSCs, suggesting that integrating operations research with behavioural economics is vital for improving strategic decision-making. The results advocate for adopting advanced technologies and innovative multidisciplinary methods to improve GSC efficiency and resilience, which are essential for navigating geopolitical tensions, market fluctuations, and complex stakeholder behaviours. It identified under-researched areas such as farmer transport decisions and logistics provider selection, and integrated emerging themes (such as resilience and behavioural aspects), contributing to the body of knowledge and supporting enhanced decision-making in GSCs for a stable global food supply system.</jats:p>"

As a result, the pharmaceutical industry depends heavily on medical sales representatives to promote\nproducts to healthcare providers, who subsequently prescribe these products to patients, with significant investments dedicated to promotional activities.\nHowever, evaluating the return on investment in medical sales representatives' efforts to influence healthcare providers' prescribing decisions to increase\nproduct prescriptions to end users is crucial for assessing overall marketing effectiveness. This study investigated whether organizational investments in\nmedical sales representatives’ promotional efforts via healthcare provider endorsements significantly enhance organizational performance.

Peacekeeping has been a key component of the liberal international order at least since the end of the Cold War, if not before. Peacekeeping boomed in the era of US unipolarity, with twenty new United Nations (UN) operations alone launched between 1989 and 1994. At the time of writing, c. 60,000 blue helmets are deployed around the world, and a peacekeeping operation is being mooted for postwar Gaza. Given the growing geopolitical rivalry between East and West, a relative erosion of US power, and much talk of a new age of multipolarity, where does this leave peace operations and peacekeeping? This paper explores the impact of different distributions of power in the international system (namely, multipolarity, bipolarity, and unipolarity) on peace operations. The paper goes through relevant military interventions beginning with the post-1815 Congress system and reaching up to the present day. The paper shows that a multipolar distribution of power is most propitious for the global deployment of peacekeepers, and suggests that peace operations may in future express international cooperation more than unipolar power.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Supply chain optimization is a significant challenge faced by modern industries. This necessitates the use of advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, which can enhance forecasting accuracy, minimize inventory usage, and improve logistical efficiency. Therefore, this study introduces a novel framework for improving supply chain efficiency using data-driven analysis and advanced modeling techniques. The process begins with the collection of relevant supply chain data, which includes historical data on analysis, forecasting, and time series data. The core of the methodology is the integration of a novel Levy Flight Binary Dragonfly Optimization strategy with a Multi-Head SwifT recursive neural network model. One of the most popular architectures combines recurrent networks, such as SwiftRNN, with Multi-Head Attention which aims to capture time dependencies and emphasize essential patterns in data. Enhancing model performance involves utilizing optimization techniques like Binary Dragonfly Optimization with Levy Flight. This method optimally tunes hyperparameters by striking a balance between exploration and exploitation, mitigating the risk of local minima, and yielding more robust outcomes. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, better inventory management, and enhanced logistics optimization, with a 0.134 reduction in prediction error and improved operational metrics outperformed the existing models, with an impressive 95% on-time delivery rate, 2% defect rate, and 95% logistic cost efficiency rate. Overall, the proposed framework exhibits significant potential for optimizing supply chain efficiency.</p>"

A quantitative approach was implemented, which involved the application of the structural equation modeling analysis for the survey data from 345 managers in the industrial sector in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Region. The results revealed that GSCM directly makes a significant contribution to LM, CSR, and BP. Also, the study found that LM was the positive factor that mediated the relationship between GSCM and BP. Nevertheless, no such associations were found between CSR and BP, nor was there an indirect effect of CSR as the mediator variable. The research underscores the supreme role lean management plays in translating environmentally friendly supply chain practices into better business performance. It reveals that industrial companies wishing to gain the advantages of narrowing their supply chain by using green practices should also simultaneously implement a lean management system to improve efficiency.</jats:p>"

Initial surveys identified Wells #8 and #9 as primary contamination points, revealing that the contamination originated from a leaking oily water drain beneath the boilers at HTPS. The contamination plume was confined to an area of approximately 0.5 km2 at a depth of around 50 m, confirmed by additional boreholes near the plant boundaries. To remediate the polluted groundwater, the Central Electricity Generating Company (CEGCO) applied a pump-and-treat approach, extracting about 16,200 m3 of contaminated water over 3 months at a rate of 90 m3/h, twice daily. This process reduced total petroleum hydrocarbon levels from initial concentrations of over 10 mg/L to below detectable limits (&amp;lt;0.5 mg/L). The pH-REdox-EQuilibrium modeling revealed that biodegradation of HFO led to increased levels of total dissolved solids from 1,400 mg/L to over 2,600 mg/L and elevated sulfate concentrations, impacting the aquifer's overall water quality. The remediation plan not only addressed immediate contamination but also focused on preventing further leaks and restoring groundwater quality in the long term.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several theories elucidate the correlation between money supply and gross domestic product (GDP). Money supply refers to the total amount of money in circulation within an economy, encompassing currency, printed notes, funds in deposit accounts, and other liquid assets. Assessing the valuation of money supply assists analysts and policymakers in formulating or adjusting monetary policies, whether to increase or decrease the money supply. This valuation is crucial as it directly influences the business cycle, thus impacting the overall economy. This study delves into the relationship between money supply and economic growth in Nepal from 1975 to 2021 using co-integration, VECM, and causality tests. ADF tests reveal non-stationarity at the level but stationarity at the first difference, affirming long-run equilibrium with a single error correction term. VECM analysis unveils a notable ECT coefficient (-1.095592, p-value: 0.0042), indicating adjustments from past year deviations at a rate of 0.42%. Short-term dynamics demonstrate varying significance levels, with money supply (M2) leading to GDP, GDP leading to private investment (PI), private consumption (PC) leading to GDP, money supply (M2) leading to private investment (PI), money supply (M2) leading to private consumption (PC), and private investment (PI) leading to private consumption (PC), all showing significant unidirectional causal relationships at the 5% level. The study proposes increasing the money supply as a means to attain higher and swifter economic growth in Nepal.</jats:p>"

By providing a step-by-step framework, companies can use this paper as a guide for large business transformations. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance for leaders to shift mindsets to cultivate an innovative environment, because the previous culture set in place was built for an entirely different structure. The selection of team leaders at the business unit level is just as important as selecting the right software applications and processes. The paper concludes by stating the importance of domain knowledge and technical skills focused on team leads who possess both to bridge the gap between leadership and innovation.</jats:p>"

The supply corps is part of the Indonesian Navy organization which is tasked with supporting the organization in the fields of finance, supplies, and general administration. The shortage of personnel in the Indonesian Navy, especially the supply corps at the officer level, is an implication of the imbalance between the positions that must be manned and the actual personnel currently available. Human resources (HR) are a very important asset in an organization, including military organizations. Every military organization, including the Indonesian Navy, is a career organization that has strict rules regarding HR recruitment so the recruitment and promotion system is the key to successful HR planning in the organization. HR planning is oriented towards the availability and balance of the number of personnel for each rank in the future. Therefore, an analysis is needed that can see and plan the condition of Indonesian Navy personnel in the future, one of which is Markov chain analysis. There are several stages in the Markov chain process, namely determining states, calculating opportunities between states, forming a transition probability matrix, creating a stochastic process model, initial vector values, and projections of the number of personnel. Based on the analysis of the four scenarios tried in this research, it appears that scenario 2 is a combination of treatments that has the smallest impact on the organization, in terms of the ratio of the number of personnel formed to the available position space. So, the treatment combination of scenario 2 was chosen with the number of recruits in 2021-2030 following the Indonesian Navy personnel strength development program regarding the basic policy of developing the Indonesian Navy towards minimum essential force until 2030, then in 2031-2045 the number of recruits becomes fixed every year, namely 108 personnel, taking into account the balance between the number of personnel in the organization and the available position space.</jats:p>"

These can be anything from traditional threats, such as a lack of supplies or delays\nin transportation, to more contemporary problems like cyberattacks and political instability (both domestic and\nforeign). Conventional supply chain risk management methods — which are built on recognizing and counteracting\nrisks that companies face at an organizational level — will not be sufficient for the growing required adaptability\nof modern, complex supply chains. In this paper, we discuss several more advanced methods for risk totaling,\nincluding a proactive approach in identifying risks and modeling only those specific scenarios focused on a supply\nchain network, data analytics used to identify worst-case supply chain scenarios, and, finally, collaborative risk\nmanagement approaches. New technologies like Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things\n(IoT) are explored that could be used to optimize the supply chain resilience and scope for real-time risk factor\nmonitoring. The challenges and opportunities of these technologies to reduce risks across the supply chain, from\nraw material acquisition to the final delivery of products, are also elaborated in several parts of this paper. This\npaper offers a novel approach to contemporary supply chain risk management, drawing on best practices, case\nstudies, and theoretical frameworks to provide guidance on how organizations can optimize their risk management\nprocesses in order to maintain continuity of operations amid both dynamic and evolving risks. It also assesses where\nAI, IoT, and blockchain can play into existing or innovative risk management strategies, allowing companies to\nbecome more nimble to disruptable events. In conclusion, it illustrates that an integrated approach to risk\nmanagement through technology provides organizations the opportunity to take a proactive stance while\nmaintaining organizational agility under uncertainty and competition — improving supply chain efficiency and\ncustomer service.\nKeywords\nSupply Chain Risk Management, Risk Mitigation, Supply Chain Resilience, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence,\nInternet of Things, Proactive Risk Identification,</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Residential real estate is an important asset class for both institutional and individual investors. The housing bubble in the US led to a global financial crisis in 2007 – 2008. As such, understanding the factors that influence property prices is central to the investment process and portfolio management. The objective of the paper was to first construct a Nairobi house price index and then determine the relationship among economic factors, property supply, and house prices. The study period was ten years (2011Q1 to 2020Q4). Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model was adopted to estimate long run and short run relationships. The Nairobi real estate price index was developed using hedonic model based on the data collected on actual selling price and characteristics of a sample of houses in Nairobi spanning ten years. The paper finds that GDP and inflation have significant positive long run effect on house prices. Property supply has a significant negative long run effect on real estate prices. However, interest rates do not have significant effect on house prices. In the short run however, GDP had a significant negative effect on prices. The speed of adjustments towards equilibrium relationship was 71.9%. The real estate market seems to be efficient despite its illiquid nature. The paper contributes to knowledge through its construction of house price index in Nairobi. Also, it included property supply a departure from past studies. The findings may have implications for investors, banks, regulators of securities and policy makers. The government of Kenya may be motivated to commission an official house price index.</jats:p>"

This creates an increasing challenge for the efficient use of water and energy resources while adequately meeting food demand. Therefore, understanding the interrelations between food, energy, and water resources is crucial. In this study, a multi-objective linear programming model was employed to identify alternative scenarios for optimal cropping areas that minimize water use in agriculture and maximize agricultural income. Different weight coefficients were assigned to these objective functions to generate various cropping scenarios. Once the optimal cropping patterns for each scenario were determined, parameters such as water use, energy requirements, agricultural revenue, and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated based on the food-energy-water nexus. The results for each alternative crop pattern scenario were then analyzed. The results indicate that prioritizing the objective of minimizing water use leads to an average reduction of 3.35% in water use, 1.18% in energy demand, and 0.26% in carbon dioxide emissions, while agricultural income increases by an average of 1% compared to the base scenario. Conversely, when maximizing agricultural income is prioritized, there is an average increase of 2.05% in agricultural income.</jats:p>",

MDPs effectively simulate decision-making problems related to uncertainty, facilitating the determination of optimal inventory policies. The MDP framework addresses various inventory management challenges, including demand fluctuations, lead times, and holding costs. The study investigates the modeling of inventory management as a Markov decision process, detailing the states, actions, and transitions within the MDP model, along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. The research employs policy and value iteration techniques to evaluate and optimize inventory management policies. The paper assesses the proposed MDP-based inventory control system through simulations that utilize supply chain data, aiming to identify optimal policies using the MDP model. A comparative analysis of the MDP approach against conventional inventory management methods is conducted to demonstrate its efficacy in reducing costs and enhancing service levels. Additionally, the paper proposes the incorporation of multiple commodities, multi-echelon supply chains, and perishability considerations into the MDP model. The findings indicate that MDPs facilitate improved optimization of inventory policies, cost reductions, and enhanced customer service, thereby emphasizing the significance of computational complexity and the necessity for accurate data. This research provides a comprehensive investigation into the role of MDPs within inventory control systems, contributing valuable insights to the field of supply chain management. Ultimately, this study lays the groundwork for advancements in MDP-based inventory control methodologies.</jats:p>"

As a source of water supply, as a rule, water from wells is used for this type of water supply. The main problems of drill-fish water are the increased content of iron, manganese, hydrogen sulfide, hardness salts, nitrates, sulfates, chlorides in some regions, high dry residue. The rapid development of technologies based on membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration allow us to adjust the salt composition of water, remove nitrates and make water suitable for drinking needs and production cycles. But before membrane technologies, compounds of iron, manganese, and hydrogen sulfide, which can form inorganic impurities on the surface of membrane elements and cause their premature failure, must be removed. One of the best methods of pre-treatment of water before membrane systems is complex ion-exchange materials, which are simultaneously capable of removing hardness salts, iron, and manganese. But the main disadvantage of such pre-filtration methods is the use of tableted salt, which makes this method expensive and not environmentally friendly. Purification of water from iron and manganese on pressure filters by catalytic loading with subsequent dosing of antiscalant before membrane installations is a modern trend in local water treatment. Catalytic loadings have been used for quite a long time, but most manufacturers do not provide clear and practical recommendations for their use. The use of such materials, as a rule, largely depends on many factors and is based on the experience of the specialist's qualifications. Analysis of the technical parameters of filter materials, analysis of parameters of the source water quality are the main components of the selection and organization of the correct technological scheme of water purification.</jats:p>"

The article, based on the analysis of the views of various researchers, presents the problem of hydrocarbon generation in deep conditions and the influence of fluid-dynamic processes on the location of oil and gas structures within the Terek-Caspian Trough (TCP). The article briefly describes the state of controversy about the deep formation of hydrocarbons and the formation of their accumulations in the depths of the earth, starting with the mineral hypothesis of D.I. Mendeleyev. A fluid-dynamic model of the Starogroznenskoye field is presented as an example of deep formation of oil and gas and the formation of a multi-layer field due to vertical migration of hydrocarbon fluids along fault zones. Ideas are given about the formation of deep fluid-saturated zones in the form of waveguides and oil-supply channels. Similarities and differences in the views of different researchers on the issues of oil and gas formation in deep conditions are noted. Different researchers are unanimous in their opinion that hydrocarbon deposits are formed due to vertical migration of hydrocarbon fluids along fault zones from deep subcrustal centers of oil and gas formation. As one of the arguments for the difference in views of supporters of different hypotheses and concepts of oil and gas formation, their different methodological approaches to the identified problem are given. The periodic nature of fluid migration and the fluid regime of hydrocarbon deposits, associated mainly with the tectonic activity of the territories, is noted.</jats:p>"

Although conventional view holds that in the presence of the investment spillover effect, downstream information sharing surely occurs when the upstream investment cost is low enough, our results show that, due to the decreasing marginal effect of quality investment, the product distributor voluntarily commits to sharing information only when the quality investment cost is in a medium range. And this ex ante sharing behavior can be induced through a precontracted side payment when the quality cost slightly deviates from the range in which voluntary sharing occurs. Given the challenge of predicting consumer preference for perennial crops, we examine the product distributor’s incentives for ordering and ex post sharing under upfront quality improvement, finding that the distributor can partially disclose the acquired information even facing a potential mismatch between supply and demand. An equilibrium ordering scheme is proposed whereby the distributor prearranges transportation capacity. Interestingly, under delayed information acquisition, partially sharing information is more effective in motivating the farming cooperative to invest more at the outset than not sharing at all. </jats:p><jats:p> Conflict of Interest Statement: The authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2021MA079, ZR2021MA088]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11271175]. </jats:p>"

Despite a marked 45% decline in agri-tech sector investments between the financial years 2021-2022 and 2022-2023, attributed to global interest rate hikes and economic uncertainties, startups such as WayCool, Farmers Fresh Zone and Farm again have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing supply chain efficiency and supporting farmer livelihoods through technological innovations. Employing a mixed-methods approach, this study integrates both qualitative and quantitative data derived from surveys, field visits, and interviews. Key performance indicators analyzed include Price Spread, Marketing Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Ratio and Productivity. Advanced econometric tools, including logistic regression and propensity score matching, were used to assess the impact of technology adoption on farmers’ outcomes. The results reveal that farmers utilizing digital platforms for crops such as onion and tomato achieved higher market prices, improved marketing efficiency and superior financial performance compared to those employing the conventional methods. Despite persisting challenges like resistance to technology adoption and inadequate internet connectivity, the findings emphasize the potential for substantial growth in the sector, driven by technological innovations. The study emphasizes the need to develop user friendly digital platforms, strengthen internet and technological infrastructure, and enhance government support through financial incentives and clear policy frameworks to encourage the broader use of agri-tech solutions. Overall, the research highlights the significant potential of digital agricultural technologies to improve farming practices, increase farmer earnings, and serve as a model that can be adapted to similar agricultural regions.</jats:p>"

The hydrological functioning studied through the use of data from the regulation balance sheet for the period from September 1990 to August 2013, concerned a sample of 10 dams (capacity varying from 3 to 200 hm³) whose year of impoundment varies from 1939 to 1987. The results of the statistical and spectral analysis applied to two main terms of the water balance (inputs and rainfalls) indicate a strong relationship between the studied parameters, reflecting a net increase in dry years from September 1990 to August 2002, with a return of wet years from the year 2003, however, interrupted by other very dry years like that of 2007/2008. The outflows (outputs) of the dams reflect considerable water losses in the form of evaporation and also in the form of leaks on karstic sites. However, it is the flood phenomena that are at the origin of remarkable overflows and bottom outlets. In addition to these losses, there are significant variations in the regulated volume of dams, particularly in semi-arid zones and during periods of drought, particularly.</jats:p>",

Studies in the field of environmental management and, particularly, in the areas of green practices, zero waste, and green innovation have suggested that, if executed properly, these organizations are able to promote EP. Under these conditions, organizations’ practices and mechanisms that ensure the enhancement of the EP of these business organizations have gained the wider attention of researchers and management. Focused on the environment and social responsibility, this study explores the complex relationships within sustainable green supply chain management (GSCM) and explores whether GSCM practices significantly impact both zero waste management and green innovation. The analysis also studies whether there are possible beneficial links between zero waste management, green innovation and environmental performance (EP). Additionally, through assessing the level to which these items come together in sustainable strategic actions, the paper shows the correlation among four important topics: GSCM practices, green innovation (GI), zero waste management, and EP. This study explores the relations between zero waste management and EP as well as green innovation and EP, examining whether these aspects of green practices have a positive relationship with effective waste management techniques in the presence of GSCM practices. The paper analyses interactions between GSCM practices and EP, and the mediation role of zero waste management and GI. Moreover, the moderating role of green knowledge sharing (GKS) also been tested. A total of 389 managers in the manufacturing sector completed the survey and the results were analyzed applying SPSS 25.0 and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings confirmed a significant association among GSCM practices, GI, zero waste management, GKS, and EP. Furthermore, findings also revealed that zero waste management GI has a positive intervention role between GSCM practices and EP. GSCM practices facilitate the promotion of EP by incorporating eco-design, green purchasing, new techniques for production or processes, and green marketing that ensures waste reduction and recycling practices.</jats:p>"

Manufacturing unit processes, as critical components of the supply chain, directly influence production efficiency, lead times, and overall supply chain performance. Therefore, a strategic focus on optimizing these processes can significantly enhance the responsiveness and cost-effectiveness of the entire supply chain. However, for large enterprises, determining the unit where optimization will be implemented is intricate, considering the multifaceted nature of the decision-making process. The complexity arises from the presence of diverse criteria, each assigned varying importance levels, along with multiple alternative stages to consider. This paper introduces a decision-making framework tailored for such complexities, employing a synergistic blend of two multi-criteria decision-making methods: Best Worst Method (BWM) and ELECTRE III. The application of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a practical case study involving a prominent healthcare technology company, Philips. First, six experts are carefully selected and interviewed to provide a set of criteria with their respective importance weights. Then, using this information, eight alternative processes within the manufacturing unit are ranked using ELECTRE III. The analysis results reveal that process complexity is the top priority for decision-makers when deciding which manufacturing units require optimization first. The findings delve into the intricacies of optimizing production processes in large health technology companies and offer practical solutions and further recommendations.</jats:p>"

The perishability of items, however, presents significant difficulties for businesses trying to establish an inaugurated supply chain. In this work, we provide an integrated location-inventory-routing model for perishable goods that considers product freshness and carbon emissions. First, an analysis is conducted on the perishable items' economic cost, freshness, and carbon emission levels. Second, a model of multi-objective planning is constructed to obtain the lowest economic cost and carbon emissions as well as the maximum freshness of the product. Based on the real location-inventory-routing scenario, limitations are formed. Third, the model is solved using the YALMIP toolkit, yielding the best answer to this challenging multi-objective issue. Lastly, the case study and the sensitivity of the vehicle speed to the outcomes confirm the viability and efficacy of the suggested approach. From the standpoint of global optimization, it is shown that the integrated model presented in this study can significantly improve the efficiency of the supply chain management of perishable goods. That vehicle speed may significantly affect carbon emissions and associated costs.</p>"

In small emerging economies, proactive risk management is crucial as major disruptions require SOs to redirect resources into recovery efforts. Therefore, SOs prioritize risk reduction, proactively minimizing the possibility of major disruption to ensure the industry’s long-term advancement. However, SOs frequently focus on residual risk mitigation while ignoring their exposure to inherent risk. This study investigated the inherent risks associated with power supply management using the SO’s operations and pertinent third parties. It used a seasonal multivariate strategy to identify risk factors, create univariate distribution models, and generate multivariate distributions using the copula method. Joint risk exposure was calculated using different percentile metrics for each scenario, allowing for a comparison of exposure levels. The study found that risk variables can sometimes reinforce or offset each other, impacting exposure behaviour. Exposure levels indicate periods of increased or decreased exposure to risk variables. Copula-modelled interdependencies captured larger exposure levels but had lower unit likelihoods, presenting less conservative exposure forecasts for SO managers. Case 1 exhibited the highest exposure levels in the early dry season (0.237 and 0.179), while case 2 showed peak exposure levels in the late wet season (1.009 and 0.948), along with cases 3 (0.977 and 0.908) and 4 (0.950 and 0.879).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last years, specifically post Covid-19, pharmaceutical industry has gained a significant place in the healthcare domain. Pharmaceutical companies are the important players in the supply chain of drugs. With increasing competition, growing population and changing complexities of type of diseases, the need of pharmaceutical products has swelled over time, making the sector prone to supply chain risks. The purpose of this paper is to identify and access various risks in the pharmaceutical supply chain in the context of India. To attend this objective, a case of a major pharmaceutical company had been considered. Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) has been used to identify and further prioritize these risks. Further Pareto analysis, also called as 80/20 rule, is conducted to identify the risks that are vital. The \"80/20\" rule suggested prioritizing 17 from 35 potential causes. Second level Pareto analysis identified 6 risk elements out of these 17 elements as most critical. Root cause assessment on these six risks is done through Five Why technique. The results of this study exhibited that Inventory Planning Issues, Labour Issues, Insufficient Storage Space, Raw Material Availability Issues, Inappropriate Forecasting, Communication Issues were the most critical issues in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The major cause to the eruption of these risks is improper Sales and Operations Planning (S&amp;OP). This study suggests that the managers of the pharmaceutical supply chain should first understand the various risks in the supply chain that can disrupt the function. Further through prioritization of risks, the losses or the delays in the supply chain can be reduced.</jats:p>"

Целью данной работы является глубокий анализ и исследование информационных процессов, которые сопровождают функционирование водородной питающей установки. Это необходимо для создания эффективной информационной управляющей системы, способной осуществлять полный набор функций контроля и управления параметрами устройства, обеспечивающего бесперебойное питание водородного топливного элемента. Основная задача такой системы заключается в поддержании стабильной работы устройства, что включает в себя контроль выходных показателей, таких как ток и напряжение. Актуальность данного исследования определяется растущей необходимостью использования водородных питающих систем, особенно в условиях, когда применение традиционных источников энергии становится невозможным или нецелесообразным. Водород, как источник энергии, обладает множеством преимуществ: он экологически чистый, производит только воду в качестве побочного продукта, и его можно использовать в различных отраслях, включая транспорт, электроэнергетику и промышленность. В статье представлена диаграмма на языке моделирования UML, показывающая варианты использования информационной системы пользователем. Представлены внештатные ситуации и способы их решения, описаны основные прецеденты. Определены параметры и их значения, влияющие на функциональность работы данной установки.

The complex is based on a hydrogen power plant. The purpose of this work is a deep analysis and study of the information processes that accompany the functioning of the hydrogen power plant. This is necessary to create an effective information control system capable of implementing a full set of functions for monitoring and controlling the parameters of the device that provides uninterruptible power supply to the hydrogen fuel cell. The main task of such a system is to maintain stable operation of the device, which includes monitoring output indicators such as current and voltage. The relevance of this study is determined by the growing need to use hydrogen power systems, especially in conditions where the use of traditional energy sources becomes impossible or impractical. Hydrogen, as an energy source, has many advantages: it is environmentally friendly, produces only water as a by-product, and can be used in various industries, including transport, electric power and industry. The article presents a diagram in the UML modeling language showing options for using the information system by the user. Emergency situations and ways to solve them are presented, the main precedents are described. The parameters and their values that affect the functionality of this installation have been determined. Thus, this study aims to develop a system that can not only control but also adapt the operating parameters in real time, which will ultimately increase the reliability and efficiency of hydrogen energy supply.</jats:p>"

However, the ways in which IM enhances environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) performance, along with its potential mechanisms, remain unexplored. This study employs a two-way fixed-effects model with panel data from 4417 Chinese listed firms spanning the period 2009–2022 to examine these relationships. It is found that IM significantly improves corporate ESG performance. Robustness tests confirm the reliability of these results, and mechanism analysis highlights the mediating effects of information transparency, green technology innovation, and supply chain collaborative innovation. Furthermore, the heterogeneity analysis indicates that IM has a notably stronger effect in high-carbon-emission sectors, state-owned enterprises, and high-tech industries. This suggests that policymakers should design differentiated policies based on industry and firm characteristics to promote the adoption of IM and foster sustainable development strategies. This research contributes to expanding the theoretical understanding of how IM affects ESG while also providing empirical evidence for enterprises and governments to promote green transformation.</jats:p>"

Accurately predicting product demand is a significant challenge for companies, impacting customer satisfaction, inventory optimization, cost reduction, and operational efficiency. This study focuses on demand forecasting within intelligent supply chains (SCs) and supply chain risk management (SCRM), aiming to enhance overall SC efficiency and mitigate risks, highlighting the use of deep learning hybrid and singles models to address SCRM challenges, specifically in mitigating uncertainty and improving demand prediction accuracy. Our research paper investigates predictive modeling techniques for demand forecasting within the automotive sector. Specifically, we assess the effectiveness of Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a hybrid RNN-ANN model with Gradient Boosting (GB). Through meticulous analysis and evaluation, we demonstrate the superior predictive accuracy of the hybrid model compared to individual models. The results indicate consistent outperformance of the hybrid model, as evidenced by lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) values across electric and thermal product categories. This research aims to provide valuable insights and practical tools for businesses to refine their demand prediction processes. By addressing demand uncertainty, organizations can streamline their SCs, minimize costs, and establish a responsive and adaptable framework for sustainable growth.</jats:p>"

As technology advances, businesses are increasingly prioritizing digital transformation as a key strategy. This paper aims to examine the impact of supply chain digital transformation on enterprises. The paper conducts case studies of three successful digital transformation instances in enterprises and assesses the impact of these transformations on the supply chain through qualitative analysis. Additionally, this paper summarizes the potential challenges of enterprise digital transformation through a literature review. The research indicates that digital transformation significantly enhances enterprise supply chains by enabling comprehensive monitoring and improving the speed and efficiency of responding to real-time market demand fluctuations. Furthermore, digital transformation fosters information sharing within the supply chain, reducing information asymmetry and providing a sound basis for decision-making within enterprises. Moreover, data-driven decisions optimize logistics efficiency. In conducting a literature review, this paper identifies two key reasons for the failure of enterprise digital transformation. The first factor is the lack of unified internal opinions and imperfect planning, while the second factor is the absence of essential personnel and equipment.</jats:p>"

The COVID pandemic led lockdowns acted as catalysts expediting this expansion. But with this progress came the menace of rapid expansion of delivery trucks, vans, 3-wheelers, and 2-wheelers that increased not only the congestions within the cities but also added massively to the already deteriorating air quality. Pollution (both air and noise) and congestion, are the two immediate fallouts of the expansion in delivery fleet.

The research utilised a qualitative methodology, gathering data via semi-structured interviews with 25 supply chain specialists and senior executives possessing extensive experience in the FMCG sector. The study's findings indicate that digital transformation enhances agility, transparency, and data-driven decision-making, which is crucial for bolstering the resilience of the FMCG supply chain. Six themes emerged from the findings: data-driven decision-making, supply chain visibility and transparency, automation and robots, collaborative platforms and ecosystems, predictive analytics and forecasting, and traceability and sustainability. The research will enhance our understanding of the implementation of digital transformation initiatives throughout FMCG supply chains. This involves analysing the application of digital technologies in supply chain operations. The study may ascertain the impact of these technologies on various resilience criteria, including flexibility, agility, visibility, and responsiveness, by analysing the role of digital transformation in FMCG supply chains. The research findings can assist supply chain managers in making educated decisions on investments and strategic planning for digital transformation initiatives.Research on digital transformation in the FMCG sector is limited, particularly on these unprecedented upheavals. Moreover, there is little study connecting digital transformation with sustainability and resilience in FMCG supply chains, which is essential for comprehending how these projects might collaboratively enhance robust supply systems.</jats:p>"

Achieving the goal implies solving the problem of forming the formula for calculating the stocks of everyday goods. The relevance of the study is due to the need to improve the sustainability of supply chains in the context of risks and uncertainties caused by changes in the geopolitical and economic environment. In the article, the author systematized the key parameters that determine the volume of required inventories and proposed a mechanism to account for their influence through coefficients. Among these parameters are highlighted: the application for the period, suppliers' capabilities, supply routes, methods of mutual settlements, risks and possible deviations, as well as the economic component of supply. The conclusions of the study confirm that the implementation of the mechanism for calculating inventories, which takes into account all key factors, contributes not only to the fulfillment of the company's obligations, but also to the effective use of working capital, which allows to optimize logistics and financial processes. The scientific novelty of the study lies in the creation of a universal algorithm that combines simplicity of application with high adaptability, takes into account the turbulence of the external environment and is able to maintain the stability of supply chains in conditions of uncertainty. The author's recommendations will make it possible to effectively plan inventory levels taking into account probable risks and deviations. The proposed mechanism of using the coefficients allows to take into account the influence of each parameter on the volume of stocks, increasing the accuracy of calculations.</jats:p>"

A survey was used to obtain data from managers and customers. Data from 40 managers’ and 250 digital banking customers’ surveys were collected, of which 220 were valid to be analyzed using IBM SPSS V26 and PLS-SEM V4; 30 responses were excluded due to invalidity issues such as zero standard deviation and outliers identified using Cook’s distance. This study empirically demonstrates the significant positive impact of cybersecurity practices on Jordanian banking supply chain performance. Specifically, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability dimensions strongly correlate with the banks’ supply chain performance. The results indicate that managers have a high degree of cybersecurity awareness and implementation, emphasizing the significance of regular cybersecurity practice training and discussions. Customers desired improved communication and explanation on cybersecurity issues from their banks despite being generally satisfied with cybersecurity. This study’s significant contribution lies in identifying the actual levels of cybersecurity practices and supply chain performance in the Jordanian banking sector and their interaction from both managers’ and customers’ perspectives. Future investigations into the long-term impacts of cybersecurity investments and the comparative examination of cybersecurity methods across other sectors or locations would benefit greatly from this research’s insightful findings. Practically, the results highlight the value of investing in cutting-edge cybersecurity measures, training staff, and effectively explaining procedures and protocols to clients. All of these measures together improve efficiency, trust, and collaboration throughout the banking supply chain.</jats:p>"

It guarantees collective defense of the Alliance members based on its core tasks, namely: deterrence and defense, crisis prevention and resolution, and security through cooperation. An important component of Ukraine's integration into the global security space is cooperation with international intergovernmental organizations. Ukraine's military cooperation with NATO member countries is considered a key element of partnership with the organization as a whole.\n\nNATO's medical support issues are viewed exclusively in the context of national responsibility by member states. NATO's new operations have drawn increased attention to the need for coordination in providing medical aid during disaster relief and humanitarian operations. NATO operations in special (extreme) conditions have led to further development in the field of medical support. Today, NATO military medicine involves the use of advanced practices to optimize care for the wounded. The foundation is basic training (planning), which allows adaptation to challenges posed by the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of casualties, extreme environmental conditions, logistical constraints, and the reality that mission completion may take precedence over medical needs. This concept is based on real-world experience and lessons learned from ongoing military conflicts. The Strategy for the Development of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine until 2035 defines long-term tasks aimed at gradually creating the Medical Forces of the future. It envisions the development and implementation of modern, effective medical technologies for the provision of medical care, treatment, and rehabilitation, as well as conducting medical and preventive measures. The implementation of NATO countries' positive experience in organizing medical support in emergency situations in Ukraine will bring the state's capabilities closer to international basic requirements.

The formulas for the load connection factors depending on the number of connections are derived. The received analytical expressions allow to model values at possible additional load connections. The obtained dependences allow to determine the probability of failure-free operation time of low-voltage electrical equipment, as well as the schemes of the in-house power supply.\r\n\r\nConclusions. The proposed methodology simplifies the forecasting of reliability parameters of the scheme of the internal shop power supply and the assessment of the technical condition of the most important and critical nodes. The modeled values of the load connection coefficients can be used in technical and economic calculations, namely for further increase of the number of outgoing lines from the switchboard and distribution point or increase of the load on the line taking into account the permissible probability of failure-free operation of the scheme.

This heritage is evident in various architectural structures such as bazaars, bridges, hammams, clock towers, and mosques. While some of these sites are actively used for tourism, many remain untapped, each offering unique historical, cultural, and architectural significance. This study explores the potential of developing Ottoman heritage tourism products in North Macedonia. The research aims to identify and establish new tourism routes in the Northeast, East, and Southeast regions, by adopting an experiential approach. Through in-depth interviews with informants experienced in tourism, the study utilizes spatial intuition to map significant sites and designs routes highlighting the richness of Ottoman heritage. The research identifies Kratovo, Shtip, and Strumica as key cities within these regions, serving as pivotal points for the proposed routes. The study reveals that informants strongly believe that Ottoman heritage tourism can attract visitors, foster cultural understanding, and contribute to local economic development. The core appeal of these routes lies in the authenticity, unique aesthetics, architectural significance, and educational value of the Ottoman heritage sites. This study contributes to the existing literature by emphasizing the value of Ottoman heritage and advocating the critical importance of its preservation. From a practical standpoint, the proposed routes, interconnected across three regions, cater to diverse visitor interests and might offer a unique tourism experience.</jats:p>"

The technological advancements associated with the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) have witnessed an upsurge in emerging technologies adoption such as drones in the food supply chain. However, research on the factors affecting the adoption of drones in the food supply chain is limited. This study therefore addresses the research gap. The study’s main objective is to explore factors affecting the adoption of drones in the food supply chain. The study conducted a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed articles. This quantitative study adopted the Technology-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) framework as the theoretical lens to explore the factors influencing drone adoption. The study indicates that technological factors (cost, relative advantage, and perceived usefulness), organizational factors (strategic objectives), and environmental factors (market structure) affect the adoption of drones in the food supply chain. Despite the study’s limitations, such as secondary data rather than empirical data, the study contributes to the body of knowledge on the factors influencing the adoption of drones in the food supply chain.</jats:p>"

These are a growing section of the market, but with regional differences in factors that affect demand and supply. We estimate a time series cross-sectional (TSCS) model within a simultaneous equation framework to analyse the number of ERMs (a proxy for the demand for ER debt) and the average loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, a proxy for supplied loan terms. We include variables that cover demographics, demand, pricing, risk, macroeconomic factors and regional dummies. For the number of ER loans, we find positive effects from net pension income and holiday costs, and negative effects from the average LTV ratio levels, state benefits, first-time buyer interest rates, female life expectancy, mortgage price differential, house price growth and gross value added (GVA). For the average LTV ratios, there are positive effects from gross pension income, average borrower age, holiday costs, and the risk premium, as well as negative effects from the number of ERM loans, female life expectancy, and the level of real house prices. Overall, households who are living in southern, wealthier areas have greater access to, and take greater advantage of, ERM loans but require lower LTV ratios. Our key findings are generalisable across the many countries that offer similar mortgage products and so our analysis offers insights for borrowers, lenders, and regulators.</jats:p>"

A survey was undertaken to collect data from processed seafood producers in the Rayong and Chonburi provinces, which are the main areas of processed seafood production in Thailand. The final 32 valid responses provided a response rate of 54.24%. The Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, a nonparametric test statistic, was utilized to compare the mean difference between the Rayong and Chonburi groups of processed seafood producers. The results indicated that SMEs have a significantly higher potential than community enterprises in terms of plan, source, make and delivery. Semi-structured interviews highlighted issues regarding SSCM practices, such as a lack of knowledge of how to achieve sustainable benefits, a lack of technology use, and the instability of raw material supply from the sea, related to weather conditions, leading to difficulties in production planning and sourcing. The results of this study can be used to reflect the current status of SSCM practices. Therefore, the findings should assist both community enterprises and SMES implement more efficient processes, leading to higher performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background – The importance of sustainability in supply chain management has grown significantly, drawing global attention to sustainable practices across various industries. The halal logistics sector must also consider how to incorporate sustainability into its operations. Effective integration of sustainability into halal logistics and supply chain management (HLSCM) is vital to meet global sustainability objectives and to maintain practices that are environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable.\nPurpose – This research aims to address the key themes and gaps in integrating sustainability practices that encompass environmental, economic, and social dimensions by systematically reviewing the literature on sustainability in HLSCM\nDesign/methodology/approach – This research utilizes a systematic literature review approach. Articles were sourced from the Scopus database, focusing on research published in the Journal of Islamic Marketing (JIMA) from 2011 to 2024. Keywords used included 'halal logistics' and 'halal supply chain.' The data collection involved indexing relevant publications and analyzing 41 articles. Thematic analysis was employed to quantify key themes, while content analysis was used to synthesize the information and identify research gaps.\nFindings – The review reveals a notable increase in publications focusing on sustainability in HLSCM, particularly emphasizing sustainable production, cost optimization, and promoting ethical practices. However, it highlights several key gaps that form the research purpose: a fragmented approach where studies often address sustainability dimensions (environmental, economic, and social) in isolation and the underexplored role of emerging technologies such as blockchain and IoT in enhancing sustainability within HLSCM. These gaps indicate a need for more integrated and holistic approaches to sustainability in halal logistics and supply chain management.\nResearch limitations – The study is limited by the scope of articles reviewed, such as database and publication period restrictions may not cover all aspects of HLSCM. Furthermore, the rapidly evolving nature of technologies such as blockchain and IoT means their potential impacts may not be fully captured in the existing literature.\nOriginality/value – The originality of this research lies in identifying the fragmented approach to sustainability in HLSCM and the underexplored potential of emerging technologies like blockchain and IoT. This study provides valuable insights for future research and practical applications in integrating comprehensive sustainability practices in halal supply chains by addressing these gaps.</jats:p>",

We find that demand informationand marketing materials alone do not increase vendor sales, but only in combination with thetransportation grant. Yet, overall sales are still too low to deliver noteworthy take-up at thehousehold level.

Leagility, an amalgam of “lean” and “agile”, enables them to integrate both advantages. Lean strategy improves efficiency by minimizing waste and costs, while agile strategy allows businesses to rapidly adapt to market trends. Despite its importance for businesses, leagility has received little attention in the literature. Moreover, research on the relationship between IT capability, supply chain practices and leagility, is limited. This systematic literature review addresses these concerns. Based on an analysis of 30 related articles, this study finds increasing interest in the topic, but notably in China, India and the US, with fewer studies from other developing countries. Moreover, most leagility studies are quantitative. These findings challenge previous studies claiming that a majority of the studies are qualitative. Additionally, a sound majority of leagility studies relate to the manufacturing sector, which questions other studies expressing the need for more research on this sector. Further conclusions from the present study indicate that efficiency, effectiveness, responsiveness, and flexibility are the most important dimensions of leagility for successful supply chain performance. Also, leagility requires IT capability, comprising especially IT infrastructure, IT human resources, and IT integration. Also, to help businesses adjust swiftly to market changes, while being efficient, information sharing, information quality, strategic supplier partnership, and postponement, are essential to leagile supply chain practices. This study suggests the need for further research in understudied locations on leagility, IT capability, and supply chain practices, using qualitative and mixed-method approaches to fully comprehend the issue. Studying how emerging technologies and global crisis influence these interactions may also help in developing more robust, flexible and successful supply chain strategies.</jats:p>"

Traditional SCM processes are subject to inefficiency, manual intervention, destruction, etc. This paper\nevaluates the contribution of Pega’s Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in effecting transformation in SCM\nefficiency. Powered by AI and Machine Learning, Pega’s RPA streamlines processes like order management,\ninventory tracking, demand forecasting and so much more, moving supply chains from reactive to predictive. This\nwas a mixed methods approach combining case studies, surveys, and interviews with industry professionals. Results\nindicate significant operational improvements: This resulted in a 40 percent reduction in processing times, an 85\npercent decrease in manual errors, and a 30 percent reduction in operational costs. Another case example illustrates\nhow Pega’s RPA improves scalability, decreases errors and is cost-efficient.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bioethanol-blended gasoline fuel is one of the alternatives for reducing CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. Since its production is still dependent on demand fluctuations and feedstock availability, an optimal supply chain design needs to be evaluated. A two-stage stochastic optimization model with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) was developed for designing the optimal bioethanol supply chain under the constraints of multi-feedstock second-generation biomass based on seasonal availability and demand uncertainty. Two optimization models were implemented. The goal of the first model was to maximize the expected profits of the supply chain based on the optimal combination of biomass type, plant location and biomass-bioethanol pathways. The second extension model focused on maximizing expected profits of the supply chain with the least amount of impact on the environment via the reduction of net emission to result in an optimal supply chain. The validation process was then performed by comparing the stochastic and deterministic models in terms of plant location and operating decisions. The first model was applied to actual data of a Thailand case study involving 26 existing plants and agricultural residue availability. The optimization result illustrates that the stochastic model is 16% more profitable than the deterministic model for all random data sets. Furthermore, the extension model shows that carbon credit can contribute to around 5% of the total profit earned. Thus, the proposed models can address demand uncertainty in supply chain design and can be implemented by policymakers to achieve sustainable bioethanol production.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Under the conditions of agricultural insurance and the uncertainty of agricultural product output, this study considers farmers constrained by funding and government subsidies during disaster years. An order contract supply chain is constructed, comprising farmers, distributors, and insurance companies. Farmers exhibit varying risk preferences and cultivate agricultural products with different levels of greenness. A three-stage game model is employed to derive the optimal planting scale for farmers, the optimal wholesale price for distributors, and the optimal premium rate for insurance companies. The results indicate that government disaster year subsidies directly increase the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of farmers, although a maximum subsidy rate exists to prevent inequity. Enhancing the greenness of agricultural products has a positive impact on agricultural production. As the probability of disaster years increases, loan guarantee insurance becomes more effective in expanding farmers' planting scales, while yield guarantee insurance demonstrates superior performance in improving farmers' CVaR. The practical value of this study lies in providing farmers with optimal decision-making frameworks and profit calculations for loan guarantee insurance and yield guarantee insurance under varying disaster-year probability scenarios. Additionally, it explores the impact of government subsidies during disaster years, the greenness level of agricultural products, and the risk of crop failure on changes in farmers' value. These findings contribute to the optimization of farmers' decision-making processes, enhancement of their economic welfare, and the promotion of sustainable agricultural development, ultimately improving the livelihoods of farmers.</p>"

Such technologies include blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain creates the opportunity to access data and information in a decentralized manner, resulting in increased customer satisfaction. This study develops a smart newsvendor model of the food industry with consignment contracts and blockchain technology. Under a consignment policy, the central division (manufacturer) can utilize the retailer’s warehouse for storage. The producer may also have the opportunity to share the holding cost with retailers without losing the ownership of products. The main contribution of this study is to analyze the profitability of the retailing and supply chain when the blockchain technology is implemented by the food industry. Moreover, a thorough investigation of profit and loss is conducted under a consignment contract when uncertain demand is encountered. This study mainly concerns perishable food items, and increasing volatility in market demand. Two cases of probabilistic uncertainty are considered, including uniform and normal distribution. The key investigations of this study are presented in terms of (a) the effect of adopting blockchain on market demand for the food industry, (b) analysis of company profitability for perishable food items and demand uncertainty, and (c) the effect of the consignment contract under blockchain technology in the food industry. Finally, this research develops an optimization tool to numerically analyze the effect of several factors of the blockchain technology on demand. Moreover, the optimal values of the design variables and the resulting maximum profitability provide valuable insights that support industry in formulating effective policies and making informed strategic decisions.</jats:p>"

However, the costs associated with sludge treatment and disposal account for the lion's share of the operational expenses of wastewater treatment plants. The sludge contains harmful and toxic substances. On the other hand, sludge is a source of carbon, nutrients, and trace elements, meaning it can be effectively utilized. An important stage in sludge disposal is its dewatering, particularly with the use of electric current. The study investigated the electro-dewatering of activated sludge with a moisture content of 98% from secondary clarifiers at the Ternopil wastewater treatment plant using direct electric current. Experiments were conducted on a laboratory setup with a U-shaped glass tube and carbon rod anode and cathode. The effect of the electric field was observed during the fading period, when, after a significant amount of water had been separated from the sludge, the electro-dewatering process slowed down. The obtained results were compared with those from the electro-dewatering of activated sludge with a moisture content of 98% from secondary clarifiers at the Ternopil wastewater treatment plant on a setup with a graphite rod anode and a flat cathode, as reported by other researchers. Electro-dewatering of activated sludge on both setups produced practically the same effect. It was confirmed that sludge dewatering using direct electric current can be applied on sludge drying beds at wastewater treatment plants.</jats:p>"

Hence, it is a promising technology to reduce net CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission. The first step of the artificial photosynthetic production is harvesting solar energy to supply energetic charge carriers, which is common to solar cells (SCs) used for solar photovoltaics. In this Review, we discuss the means to improve the efficiencies of the first step. The steadiest means is to split solar spectrum into plural ranges using plural light-absorbing materials with different bandgaps. Indeed, this means has been successfully applied to solar photovoltaics to realize highly efficient multijunction SCs. We review concrete implementations of the solar-spectrum splitting on the three types of the artificial photosynthetic devices: the combination of SCs and electrochemical reactors, photoelectrochemical reactors using photoelectrodes, and photocatalytic reactors. In particular, we highlight the similarities and differences in the design criteria between the artificial photosynthetic devices and SCs used for solar photovoltaics; the differences originate from that the former operates at a specific narrow voltage (or carrier energy) range slightly higher than the thermodynamic threshold of the target reaction whereas the latter at the maximal power (product of voltage and current) point. Application of new concepts originally developed for solar photovoltaics including photon upconversion, two-step excitation via intermediate bands, and hot-carrier extraction would be attractive, in particular for the photocatalysts to balance the high efficiency and simple configuration. Some of these concepts on the photocatalysts have been proven, however, not yet improved the performance. Thus, this Review serves as a guide for the strategies to supply more solar energy to the reactive sites. Technological developments based on these strategies could accelerate the practical and widespread use of artificial photosynthesis, contributing to solving the global warming problem.</jats:p>",

Some suppliers may have longer lead times but offer lower prices, whereas reliable suppliers with quick-response capabilities may have higher prices. Purchasing from a cheaper, less reliable supplier can help a firm lower its inventory cost but will expose itself to potential risks. This paper analyzes a supply chain in which a manufacturer can source from a cheaper, less reliable supplier with a long lead time and/or a reliable quick-response supplier. The manufacturer also has to make demand-generating marketing investments before the selling season. Our analysis shows that if the unreliable supplier’s reliability is low, the reliable supplier will charge a low wholesale price; otherwise, it will choose a high wholesale price. As the unreliable supplier’s reliability improves, the manufacturer is inclined to increase its marketing investment, but there is a drop at some critical threshold. Interestingly, the existence of an unreliable supplier can lead to a win–win outcome for the reliable supplier and the manufacturer. The unreliable supplier’s reliability has nonmonotonic effects on the equilibrium profits of the reliable supplier and the manufacturer. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper explores the potential applications of emerging technologies to develop a blockchain-constructed pharmaceuticals supply chain traceability organization. In essence, a blockchain-based medication tracking system is vital for both government regulation and corporate operations. A reliable drug traceability system would make it simple for patients and those working in the drug supply chain to determine where the drug disappeared or has been.  The drug traceability system is designed according to a number of concepts. First and foremost, the blockchain system for drug traceability must to accurately represent the supply chain's actual drug transaction logic, particularly with regard to drug-related data. Second, privacy and authenticity should be guaranteed by the drug traceability system. We propose Hyperledger Fabric, a potential blockchain-based decentralized architecture, to fulfill important medication traceability requirements, such as privacy, trust, openness, security, authorization and authentication, and scalability. We suggest, talk about, and contrast two possible drug traceability architectures: centralized and decentralized. We enumerate and discuss some open research questions related to medication tracking using blockchain technology. The pharmaceutical business can benefit from the suggested blockchain architectures.</jats:p>"

Data were sourced from official records and analyzed to generate WPI scores for each city. The results indicate that Kermanshah Province experiences medium to high levels of water poverty, with significant inter-city disparities. The WPI values ranged from 30.44 in Salas-e Babajani to 66.25 in Kermanshah, with an average provincial score of 43.84. Sahneh ranked highest in the ‘Resources’ component, due to its abundant groundwater and surface water, while Gilangharb and Salas-e Babajani reported the lowest scores, primarily due to unauthorized well extractions. In terms of access, Qasr-e Shirin achieved 99.92% coverage in safe water supply, whereas other cities, such as Javanrud and Salas-e Babajani, fell below 50%. Environmental conditions were generally favorable across the province, with the exception of Sarpol-e Zahab, where water quality was degraded by high pesticide and fertilizer use. These findings underscore the urgent need for tailored water management interventions to address the regional disparities in water security.</jats:p>",

This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel bi-objective optimization framework. The model integrates a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach with advanced machine learning techniques to simultaneously minimize total costs and maximize patient satisfaction. A key contribution is the incorporation of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network for accurate drug demand forecasting, enabling dynamic resource allocation in crisis scenarios. The model also accounts for two distinct patient destinations—receiving hospitals and temporary care centers (TCCs)—and includes a specialized pharmaceutical supply chain to prevent medicine shortages. To enhance system robustness, probabilistic demand patterns and disruption risks are considered, ensuring supply chain reliability. The solution methodology combines the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) and the ɛ-constraint method, efficiently addressing the multi-objective nature of the problem. Results demonstrate significant improvements in cost reduction, resource allocation, and service levels, highlighting the model’s practical applicability in real-world scenarios. This research provides valuable insights for optimizing healthcare logistics during critical events, contributing to both operational efficiency and patient welfare.</jats:p>"

Survey data from a sample of supply chain managers working only on emphasising supply line performance enhancement. These findings show that a flexible supply line with a mixture of dynamic products is a mediator that draws the effects of the firm's PI and supply chain agility. Moreover, this automatically influences the firm's business performance. Moreover, the firm's overall framework is competent, yet it needs to be consistently effective regarding the complex structure of its goods for sale. This nature of a firm's framework usually impedes the effect of a flexible supply line on supply chain agility. However, on the other hand, it adds details about the impact of PI on supply chain agility. Other conditionally implemented indirect effects show that the indirect effect of PI on supply chain agility, given the flexible supply line, proves to be vigorous when a complex product mix is identified. This study will be a guide to emerging economies, leading the idea towards supply chain managers to improve their performance in the shape of their competent framework to stabilize their market worth.</jats:p>",

Increasing grain yield has become the key area of study among researchers. This study constructs a Multiple Linear Regression model based on Stepwise Regression analysis with R software and Eviews to investigate eight factors influencing grain yield in Heilongjiang province from 1992 to 2022 by utilizing methods such as White-test, Durbin-Watson Test, and Variance Inflation Factor to validate this model. According to the findings, an increase in Grain Sown Area, Effective Irrigated Area, and Value Added in Primary Industry, correlates with an increase in Grain Yield. In contrast, an increase in Disaster-Affected Areas and Employment in Primary Industry is associated with a decrease in Grain Yield. In addition, an in-depth analysis regarding the negative coefficient associated with Employment in the Primary Industry was conducted by integrating the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns. It was concluded that the incompatibility of the initial hypothesis may be attributed to the educational level of Employment in Primary Industry and the efficiency of grain production. To establish a more stable, efficient, and flexible Grain Supply Chain system, it is recommended to enhance resource utilization, strengthen disaster monitoring, control inefficient labor productivity, and promote industrial collaboration to satisfy the increasing demand for boosted Grain Yield.</jats:p>"

This research paper was conducted using a quantitative survey design, with data collected from the Jordanian Customs Department through questionnaires. The questionnaires were adopted and adapted from previous studies, and they were developed using basic random selection techniques and a five-point Likert scale. A total of 189 responses were collected, of which 181 were valid for statistical analysis; eight responses were excluded due to outliers. Consequently, 181 were analysed using Smart PLS 4.1.0.3 for hypothesis testing. The findings provide insights into the impact of customs policies on supply chain success and highlight the mediating role of sustainable practices. This research contributes to understanding supply chain management in the context of customs policies. It also underscores the importance of aligning regulatory measures with sustainability goals to drive supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

This paper utilizes a Stackelberg game model to analyze the relationship between a single export manufacturer and an import retailer. The study investigates the optimal solutions of the supply chain model—wholesale price, retail price, sales volume, and profit—across three consumer preference scenarios: no obvious preference, pure green preference, and pure new preference. Furthermore, this paper examines the impact of carbon emissions per unit of product on supply chain decision-making under two scenarios: with and without carbon trading. Carbon trading, which significantly increases unit costs, exerts a profound influence on the strategic decisions of both manufacturers and retailers. In addition, this paper incorporates carbon tariffs and taxes into its analysis, providing a theoretical foundation for governments and policymakers to promote sustainable production and consumption practices. The validity of the model is confirmed through numerical simulations, which reveal that under pure green and pure new preference scenarios, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are more inclined to invest in emissions reduction to minimize tariff costs. In contrast, under no obvious preference scenarios, OEMs are more likely to adjust product portfolios to evade carbon tariffs. This research advances the understanding of low-carbon production strategies in transnational supply chains, offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance for balancing economic and environmental objectives.</jats:p>"

However, it also poses significant environmental challenges due to large consumptions of non‐renewable materials and energy, as also extensive by‐product and waste generation. Addressing these issues is paramount, though surprisingly, research on it has largely been theoretical, fragmented and incomplete. These shortcomings are sought to be addressed in this work where a comprehensive green supply chain management (GSCM) framework for the sector is first developed through a systematic literature review. It is then empirically assessed and validated for UK's pharmaceutical sector through 47 interviews and analyses of 112 corporate environmental reports that covered all key stakeholders. Innovative and Bio‐pharma players were found to be at the forefront of the greening efforts with generic players lagging behind. High levels of solvent recycling, AI‐based drug design, and emphasis on Ecopharmacovigilance were observed for the Innovative players. The key drivers for greening were found to be regulatory pressures (e.g., f‐gas, ERA, IED) and cost saving potential, with their influence being particularly greater for the Innovative players. Similarly, complex marketing authorization process, high investment requirements, lack of green culture and time pressure were revealed as the key barriers to greening. On the downstream side, lack of environment‐related regulatory guidance on prescribing and contradictory regulatory guidance on disposing unused/expired drugs were identified as factors having a significant impact on the environmental loading of drugs. Overall, the study findings can help assess the green readiness of the sector, as also develop stakeholder‐specific policy interventions and support mechanisms to increase green adoption.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, this study proposes integrating Kolb’s experiential learning cycle with the ADDIE model into an instructional design framework for reflective and active engagement in learning activities within realistic circular supply chain scenarios. The methodology demonstrates this framework through a case study of an undergraduate module for CE problem-solving, focusing on waste reduction within small and medium enterprises in Mexico City. Based on student surveys and achievement metrics, results show positive student feedback and evaluation results, meeting module targets. This work’s main contribution offers a framework for creating novel experiential learning cases and cultivating sustainability-related and disciplinary learning outcomes. It also recognises valuable links for citizenship commitment, problem-solving, community engagement, and CE education. However, this work acknowledges limitations in complex problem-solving difficulties, a resource-demanding nature, restricted transferability, and the limited evaluation of learning effectiveness. Future research will explore this work’s relevance across Kolb’s learning styles and diverse industries, focusing on student interest and motivation, and evaluating its impact on student outcomes in various educational contexts.</jats:p>"

The reliability of the power supply system has been established for the following variants of the circuit of two-transformer 10/0.4 kV substations: without redundancy; with redundancy (when installing a sectional switch); with double redundancy (when installing a sectional switch and a backup jumper for 0.4 kV). The calculation data have shown that the reliability of the circuit without redundancy is 1.87 times lower compared to the circuit with redundancy and 3.17 times lower than with the circuit with double redundancy. Graphic dependencies of the mean time between failures of power supply circuits with two-transformer substations from different rated capacities of shop transformers have been obtained for three variants: without redundancy; with redundancy; with double redundancy. The optimal condition is to use a smaller number of transformer substations (respectively, transformers) while maintaining the load factor of 0.8. When comparing the graphs, it has been found that the longest mean time between failures is achieved with double redundancy, and the shortest – with no redundancy.

It serves as a response to the unethical and unsustainable practices of Korean tour operators by incorporating various sustainable tourism practices. Sustainable supply chain management is a vital element in the operationalization of FT, and yet, despite the increasing significance of FT, there is a dearth of research on the phenomenon. This research aims to bridge this gap by examining how practitioners define and implement FT. The current analysis is based on semi-structured interviews with 15 CEOs of FT companies. Through thematic analysis of the interviews, valuable insights into the establishment and execution of FT are uncovered. Tourism operations like FT promote positive outcomes in destination communities. The study defines FT as tourism where travelers contribute to the local economy while also promoting environmental and social sustainability. The study also examines the sustainable supply chain management operations of FT practitioners, using the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model as a framework. It is evident that FT practitioners recognize the significance of sustainable supply chain management and strive to foster a culture of mutually respectful relationships, setting them apart from traditional sustainable tourism practices. Furthermore, this article highlights how FT practitioners incorporate sustainable tourism and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in their programs. They achieve this by collaborating with local partners, utilizing local resources, and actively engaging with their partners within the destinations in which they operate.</jats:p>"

However, relying only on the data support provided by MIS is insufficient to help enterprises complete the supply chain's efficient allocation and high-frequency management. This paper aims to explore the feasibility of promoting the digital transformation of the supply chain in China's transportation industry by combining emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial intelligence (AI), and Management Information Systems (MIS). It has been found that a strong combination of AI, IoT, and MIS technologies can effectively promote the digital transformation of the supply chain. However, there are still many challenges in practical application. Therefore, this paper proposes the interaction model of these three technologies. IoT inputs the information generated in the operation and stores it in MIS, providing data support for AI's intelligent analysis. Then, the instructions issued by AI are transmitted directly to MIS. Finally, the IoT controls the physical entity that executes these decisions. In addition, this paper summarizes the problems and reasons that may exist in applying MIS, IoT, and AI technology in the transportation industry at this stage. It is found that many problems, including low utilization efficiency of MIS, low willingness of front-line operators to use it, differences in information transmission protocols, and high cost of AI training, hinder these three technologies to promote the digital transformation of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

In order to expand the application of this technology, the design of an induction coil type launcher that can launch fire extinguishing bombs, large-scale simulated bird bodies and other thrown bodies was completed, consisting of a four-stage coil capable of launching 10kg thrown body at an initial velocity of more than 100m/s. In order to meet the integration requirements of the launcher body, the design of a compacted pulsed power module matched to the launcher was carried out. According to the characteristics of multi-stage coil launching, the pulse discharge circuit is designed by adopting the continuity-front type topology to avoid the possible problem of induced voltage damage to the device; based on the technical specifications of the launcher, the types and parameters of the pulse power devices in the module are determined and the launch simulation is carried out for verification; measures such as high specific energy devices, shared electrodes structure, and built-in discharge devices are adopted to make the module meet the compactness requirements. The module has a rated energy storage capacity of 100kJ, a maximum operating voltage of 10kV, and a specific energy of 1.2MJ/m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. The short circuit discharge experiment and the coil discharge experiment shows that the module’s discharge capacity and structural strength satisfy the design requirements; and the actual launching experiment shows that four modules of the same type are used as the excitation source of the coil-type launcher, which can project a 10kg thrown body with an initial velocity of 103m/s at an operating voltage of 8kV.</jats:p>",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of chloramphenicol removal from model solutions using Lemna minor (duckweed) depending on the initial concentration of the antibiotic, time of cleaning and specific biomass of duckweed.\r\nModel solutions of chloramphenicol with concentrations of 2, 5, 10 and 20 mg/L were used in the study. The cleaning time ranged from 1 to 72 hours, and the chloramphenicol content was determined by liquid chromatography. It was established that the efficiency of cleaning depends not only on the time and initial concentration of the antibiotic, but also on the specific biomass of L. minor. In particular, the greatest efficiency was observed in the interval from 24 to 48 hours, after which the removal of the antibiotic markedly decreased, and the content remained stable until the end of the 72-hour period.\r\nAt chloramphenicol concentrations of 2 and 5 mg/L with a specific duckweed biomass of 36 g/L, the cleaning efficiency gradually increased and reached maximum values in 72 hours of 23.2% and 26.8%, respectively. For a larger biomass – 50 g/L – these indicators were 17% and 19%, which indicates the possible optimization of the cleaning process when reducing the specific biomass of duckweed.\r\nAt higher initial concentrations of chloramphenicol (10 and 20 mg/L), the use of duckweed with a specific biomass of 36 g/L provided the maximum antibiotic removal of 33.0% and 29.5%, respectively, in 72 hours of purification. As the biomass increased to 50 g/L, the efficiency decreased and amounted to 23.6% and 21% for these concentrations, which indicates the dependence of the process on the amount of L. minor.\r\nThe results confirm that the use of Lemna minor is promising for the removal of chloramphenicol from wastewater. The highest efficiency was achieved with a process time of 48 hours and a specific duckweed biomass of 36 g/L, which ensured a decrease in the concentration of chloramphenicol to 29.4% at the initial level of 10 mg/L. The use of duckweed contributes to reducing the environmental burden and reduces the risk of the spread of antibiotic resistance in natural waters.</jats:p>"

Many of these issues, especially the urban heat island effect and stormwater runoff, have a greater impact and stronger influence on post-industrial cities more emphatically influence post-industrial cities, because of their specific development patterns. Cities face many environmental challenges, including air and water quality problems, the need for adequate green space, excessive heat gain, contaminated stormwater runoff and lack of biodiversity ecosystem. Urban agriculture offers a unique opportunity to utilize vacant or idle land and rooftops throughout cities for the production of oxygen and healthy pesticide-free food. Adding residential green space to a neighborhood, including community gardens and urban farms, is known to provide a number of social, health, economic, and environmental benefits. Despite the challenging global trends, some citizens believe that Indonesia presents the resilience trend as displayed across the region, and we are ready to keep moving forward together for the years.

Educational programs gradually reduce the amount of practice classes, the use of special calculation software allows to carry out more necessary calculations in short time, illustrate the results, correct the mistakes, choose the optimal constructive solution, therefore, it contributes to the development of critical thinking and independent learning skills of the student. The practice of implementing information technologies into the education process from simple to complex software is widespread both in Ukraine and abroad. Using modern software activates practical learning, boosts professional identity, consciousness, motivation, and creation of the students. The article provides the calculation of the seepage pressure under the dam by the ordinary handmade method and by Seep/W software. The fourth-year bachelor's degree students carry out this calculation during the concrete dam design. The comparison of the calculation results by hand and by Seep/W PC was made. Modern engineering software are quite complex, require additional knowledge and practice skills, encourage students to survey additional information, which contributes to the development of the students individual trajectory. Most of the modern software are in English, which also stimulates the study of professional English vocabulary.</jats:p>"

Despite its critical importance, the relationship between coordination mechanisms and sustainability performance remains underexplored. This study examines the interrelations between transactional characteristics, relational and formal coordination, and sustainability performance in agri‐food supply chains. By surveying 204 farmers and 135 downstream players across diverse supply chain arrangements, this research employs structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis to analyze data suitability and test hypotheses. The empirical findings reveal nuanced relationships: relational governance has a significantly positive connection to economic and social sustainability within supply chains. There is also a positive, indirect relation between relational governance and ecological performance through the promotion of resource efficiency. Formal coordination practices facilitate strategic relationships and efficient resource allocation and as such connect to social and economic viability of supply chains. Transaction costs play a role as mediator between formal and relational coordination, and sustainability outcomes. Effective management of transaction costs can mitigate inefficiencies and foster collaborative efforts. By understanding these dynamics, policymakers and stakeholders can develop strategies to promote resilience and sustainability in global food systems.</jats:p>"

However, persistent challenges in agricultural supply chains, such as inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and limited traceability, contribute to high post-harvest losses, unfair pricing for farmers, and reduced consumer trust. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and transparent ledger system, offers a promising solution to these issues. This review explores blockchain’s potential to improve supply chain efficiency and transparency in SSA. By integrating blockchain with smart contracts, IoT devices, and real-time data sharing, stakeholders can enhance traceability, automate processes, and reduce transaction costs. Blockchain-based platforms provide direct market access for farmers, ensuring fair pricing and minimizing intermediary influence. Furthermore, blockchain’s immutable nature guarantees data credibility, fostering consumer trust and compliance with quality standards. Despite its potential, blockchain adoption in SSA faces challenges, including high costs, inadequate infrastructure, limited technical expertise, and low awareness of its benefits. Addressing these barriers requires affordable, scalable solutions and supportive policy frameworks. This review highlights blockchain’s transformative role in resolving inefficiencies and improving transparency in SSA’s agricultural supply chains. Collaborative efforts among governments, private stakeholders, and international organizations are crucial to fostering adoption, driving economic growth, and enhancing food security.</jats:p>"

This study examines the coordination challenges in green supply chains, accounting for risk aversion and manufacturer competition. It explores how risk-averse behavior influences operational decisions, offering strategies to enhance cooperation among supply chain members. This study develops three key models: a rational behavior model, a risk aversion model, and a cost-sharing contract model, deriving optimal equilibrium decisions for each. It analyses the impact of risk aversion on pricing, product greenness, and profitability in a competitive manufacturing environment and compares outcomes across the models. Numerical simulations validate the findings, revealing that higher levels of manufacturer risk aversion lead to reduced wholesale prices, retail prices, and product greenness, which hinder the achievement of sustainability goals. Profitability and product greenness are lower under the risk aversion model compared to the rational behavior model. Under conditions of weak market competition, cost-sharing contracts effectively enhance profitability for both manufacturers and retailers while fostering collaboration to improve sustainable green practices within the supply chain. These findings provide actionable insights for green supply chain enterprises and contribute to the theoretical foundation of green supply chain research, particularly in contexts involving manufacturer competition and risk aversion.</jats:p>"

This research proposed a new framework named Intelligent Supply Chain Cost Optimization (ISCCO). ISCCO integrates deep learning with advanced optimization algorithms. It focuses on minimizing transportation costs by accurately predicting customer behavior and dynamically allocating goods. ISCCO significantly enhanced supply chain efficiency by implementing an innovative customer segmentation system. This system combines autoencoders with random forests to categorize customers based on their sensitivity to discounts and likelihood of cancellations. Additionally, ISCCO optimized goods allocation using a genetic algorithm enhanced integer linear programming model. By integrating real-time demand data, ISCCO dynamically adjusts the allocation of resources to minimize transportation inefficiencies. Experimental results show that this framework increased the accuracy of user classification from 50% to 95.73%, and reduced the model loss value from 0.75 to 0.2. Furthermore, the framework significantly reduced order cancellation rates in practical applications by adjusting pre-shipment policies, thereby optimizing profits and customer satisfaction. Specifically, when the pre-shipment ratio was 25%, the optimized profit was approximately 7.5% higher than the actual profit, and the order cancellation rate was reduced from a baseline of 50.79% to 41.39%. These data confirm that the ISCCO framework enhances logistics distribution efficiency. It also improves transparency and responsiveness across the supply chain through precise data-driven decisions. This achieves maximum cost-effectiveness.</jats:p>"

The policy restrictions on expanding construction lands likely prompted local governments in these megacities to prioritise reallocating land to the tertiary sector, which is recognised for its higher efficiency in land use. This study employs a synthetic control method to empirically assess the policy’s effects. The findings indicate that the policy significantly fostered the transition of both land and ISs towards the tertiary sector, particularly in megacities at the early stages of structural transformation. The mechanism analysis indicates that the primary economic benefits of the policy derive from industrial structural change, rather than improvements in intra-industry land use efficiency or changes in sectoral relative prices. Additionally, this article provides supporting evidence of the policy’s positive impact on sustainable development, demonstrated by improvements in income and reductions in environmental pollution. Nevertheless, it also highlights a potential risk of increased inequalities. </jats:p>"

The admission capacity of medical schools, which has the greatest impact on the number of physicians, has been determined through discussions among the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, medical associations, medical organizations, universities, and academics, depending on the medical supply-demand status on that era. In recent years, the maldistribution of medical specialties and regions has become an issue. For the involving this issue, Japanese government takes from multiple perspectives to address this problem, including “regional quotas” in admission quotas for university medical school and, setting a ceiling on the number of residency positions available in each prefecture as well as on recruitment capacity in the specialist physician system. The implementation of “work style reform” for physicians, focuses on shortening physicians’ working hours and has raised concerns regarding a shortage and regional maldistribution of physicians. The government’s policy is based on a key concern: rising healthcare costs could seriously threaten the country’s financial health. Therefore, the government has limited the increase in the number of physicians. Conversely, this year, the government has begun to argue that a regulatory approach is necessary to address the uneven distribution of physicians. Our proposition is to achieve a number of physicians comparable to that of other OECD countries and to create an environment that enables physicians to voluntarily address their regional and departmental maldistribution.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The high demand for polymer products creates the need for constant mo­dernization of the technological aspects of their production, increasing the efficiency of which is impossible without a model description and solving problems of optimization of its main technological stages. The current needs for manufacturing the products with a specified structure and properties make the issue of creating tools for solving optimization problems very relevant. One of the tools for controlling the product molecular weight is using the fractional mode to supply a regulator, the composition and dosage of which are often selected empirically.Aim of the Study. The aim of the study is to develop methods and algorithms to determine the mode for multipoint supplying a regulator in the continuous-running manufacturing of polymer products with specified molecular characteristics.Materials and Methods. To choose the optimal regulator supply mode, there is used a heuristic method represented by a genetic optimization algorithm. This algorithm is based on the mechanism for creating a population of potential solutions that are subjected to the operations of crossing, mutation and selection imitating the processes of inheritance and evolution in nature. To assess the molecular characteristics of the copolymerization pro­duct, there is applied a kinetic modeling approach based on the use of molecular weight distribution moments. For a mathematical description of continuous-running production, there are used recurrent relations characterizing the transfer of the reaction mass between ideally mixed reactors.Results. According to the conditions for organizing continuous-running manufacturing, it is possible to add a regulator at the beginning of the process in the third and sixth poly­merizers along the battery. In order to determine the regulator supply mode, the optimization criterion was developed in the form of a functional reflecting the absolute difference between the calculated and specified values of the number-average and mass-average molecular weights. The software implementation of the developed method and optimization algorithm, and the computational tests carried out made it possible to identify a number of solutions, each of which contributes to manufacturing a product with specified molecular characteristics. Visualization of some resulting solutions demonstrates different molecular weight dynamics throughout the process.Discussion and Conclusion. Through using the developed method and algorithm, there has been solved the problem of identifying the three-point molecular weight control regime for the continuous-running process of producing styrene-butadiene copolymer. The choice of a genetic algorithm for the study and optimization of complex multifactorial physicochemical systems is justified by the fact that it allows searching for one or more system parameters in both a discrete and continuous set of variables and contributes to finding a global optimum due to the random nature in the search for solutions. The variety of solutions obtained for the problem makes it possible to control the process of polymer synthesis in the case of constant monitoring of the physicochemical characteristics of the product.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Regulation and customer awareness pressurize manufacturers to use recycled plastic (RP) in the production system to reduce the negative environmental impact of plastic waste for sustainable production. Compared to virgin materials, the RP available in the market shows high variation in quality, composition, and properties, and often experiences higher variability in lead time. This renders the supply chain of RP and the production systems more vulnerable, making it difficult for material requirement planning (MRP) to decide the optimal quantity and reorder time. This paper first examines the RP supply chain and the sources of variations therein, identifies the associated uncertainties for operations management, reviews the current MRP design elements in managing supply uncertainty, and finally aligns strategies and design elements with the dimensions of the uncertainties. A set of valuable propositions is drawn for the plastic firms to manage variation from upstream suppliers and promote a high-value chain of plastic circularity. MRP practices at the operational level including safety stock, optimization techniques, and alternative bills of material are proposed to mitigate the variations in the supply chain. The work provides a conceptual foundation for the circular economy of plastic, which opens a new paradigm of future research in managing RP in the production system for sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The accelerated development of economic globalization has given rise to the formation of supply chain networks for cross-regional agricultural products. However, the unequal rights and status of the partners and an imperfect benefit linkage mechanism have made it difficult to reasonably distribute and share benefits. Understanding how to establish a benefit-sharing mechanism among partners has been a popular topic in the industry, but thematic research and discussions are lacking in the academic community. Therefore, in this study, we utilized a grounded theory approach and selected five supply chain master enterprises with different supply chain systems as samples. We constructed a theoretical model of a benefit-sharing mechanism and systematically revealed the key elements and theoretical logic of benefit sharing. The results of this study showed that (1) the five elements of benefit creation, benefit integration, benefit distribution, benefit constraint, and benefit coordination have important impacts on benefit sharing in the supply chain; (2) the dimensions within these five elements are independent of each other, and these elements can be combined to demonstrate a common impact on benefit sharing. The dynamic interaction among the five elements constituted a self-regulating and self-optimizing cyclic system; (3) benefit integration and benefit distribution have a dynamic cyclic facilitating effect on benefit sharing. This study has refined the key elements of the benefit-sharing mechanism, and the results provide theoretical references for benefit sharing and in-depth collaboration among supply chain members.</jats:p>"

Addressing the question of how effectively money supply impacts GDP, the study is grounded in the theoretical framework that monetary policy influences economic output, a concept drawn from classical and Keynesian economic theories. The data, sourced from official economic reports, highlights significant variability in both M2 and GDP, with GDP exhibiting slightly lower volatility. The distributional characteristics of the variables show a slight positive skew and a flatter-than-normal distribution, suggesting potential deviations from typical economic trends. The state-space model captures the relationship between M2 and GDP, indicating that money supply is an important explanatory factor for GDP. While the model’s observation equation shows a low and statistically significant standard deviation of the error term—suggesting that it explains variations in GDP effectively—the state transition equation reveals a mostly deterministic evolution of unobserved state variables, though this result lacks full statistical significance and warrants cautious interpretation. The log-likelihood value supports a fair model fit, yet additional macroeconomic variables or alternate model structures may enhance the analysis. The findings affirm the critical role of money supply in economic growth, consistent with economic theory. However, future research could explore more complex dynamics, including non-linear relationships and the effects of external shocks, to refine the understanding of the M2-GDP nexus. This study contributes empirical insights using a state-space framework, offering valuable implications for monetary policy and macroeconomic forecasting.</jats:p>"

Medical  studies  indicate  the  use  of  Tacrolimus  in  cases  where  conventional  treatments  are  no  longer   effective,   especially   when   lupus   causes   kidney   impairment.   Despite   its   proven   effectiveness  and  the  drug's  registration  with  the  National  Health  Surveillance  Agency  (ANVISA),  Tacrolimus  is  not  standardized  by  the  Unified  Health  System  (SUS)  for  the  treatment  of  the  disease, posing an obstacle to access. This scenario forces patients to go to court to obtain the medication, which can delay the start of treatment, worsening the clinical condition and leading, in some cases, to the loss of kidney function. The 1988 Federal Constitution guarantees the right to life as the primary foundation for the exercise of all other rights. Therefore, it is argued that the supply  of  Tacrolimus  should  be  guaranteed  immediately  by  the  State,  eliminating  the  need  for  legal  action,  especially  for  patients  with  kidney  complications  associated  with  lupus,  thus  ensuring the right to life to its fullest.</jats:p>",

A mixed methodology was utilised in the model's development. The qualitative component entailed a Delphi research corroborated by literature to ascertain pertinent hypotheses, whereas the quantitative component validated the model through structural equation modelling (SEM) utilising SmartPLS software. The research delineated a seven-construct framework comprising cooperation, integration, communication, supply chain structure, Fourth Industrial Revolution technology, organisational culture, and trust. The amalgamation of these designs proved enough for improving the efficacy of the steel production supply chain. The research revealed that the use of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and the cultivation of a conducive organisational culture are essential for effective supply chain management in the steel manufacturing industry. The research presents a detailed model that facilitates the planning and organisation of steel industry supply networks in South Africa. This approach underscores the necessity of a cooperative organisational culture, client contentment, and the incorporation of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. Steel industry stakeholders are urged to implement adaptable supply chain frameworks (lean, agile, leagile) based on project goals. This study enhances theoretical frameworks by highlighting essential features that have not been previously incorporated into supply chain management models for the steel sector, including the integration of Fourth Industrial Revolution technology and organisational culture. It provides actionable insights for stakeholders in steel manufacture, enhancing supply chain performance via the proposed paradigm. The research methodology improves comprehension of supply chain management within the framework of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).</jats:p>"

A multidimensional assessment system covering corporate creditworthiness, supply chain capability, and risk level is established by analyzing the financial data from 2020-2023. The results show that although the LSTM model is good at dealing with long-time series data, the BP model outperforms the LSTM and better fits the actual data when the sample size is small.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Businesses need resilience in supply chain logistics to efficiently manage and minimize disruptions and maintain a smooth flow of goods and services. The present study aims to examine the elements influencing supply chain resilience to enhance overall supply chain performance. A thorough literature assessment served as the foundation for the study's methodology. Two methods were employed to examine the body of knowledge on supply chain resilience: first, databases and journals were searched using specific keywords; second, the publications' references were followed to find the literature that the databases and journals had not been able to locate. When building the sample for this analysis, only publications released after 2002 were included. This strategy provided 150 high-quality research articles that served as the basis for the literature evaluation reported in this study. The research article's conclusions state that manufacturers or businesses need to consider both internal and external factors when identifying and analyzing potential supply chain interruptions. To handle hazards that have been discovered, develop a comprehensive risk management plan and rank hazards according to likelihood and possible consequences. This information could prove vital for managers and supply chain experts in manufacturing companies with useful information that helps them improve the robustness of their supply networks. Moreover, because this study highlights the connection between supply chain resilience and an organization's overall performance, it occupies a significant position in the literature. The findings suggest that a company's reputation among supply chain partners and consumers is negatively impacted by frequent interruptions to business. This finding is consistent with the crisis literature, as stated by Coombs, which shows that a firm's reputation suffers more when it bears a larger portion of the blame for a crisis. The study emphasizes strategies for supply chain resilience, including diversifying suppliers, implementing robust risk management, enhancing transparency, investing in advanced technologies, fostering collaboration, and ensuring agility and flexibility in unforeseen disruptions.</jats:p>",

Considerable efforts have been made by the government, NGOs and researchers in generating, introducing and disseminating appropriate wheat technologies to boost the production and productivity of wheat. The objective of this study was to identify the status and performance of wheat seed supply and factors that determine wheat seed supply system in West Arsi and East Shewa zones. A multi-stage random sampling procedure was used to select 240 sample wheat producers from both zones using probability proportional to size. Secondary data were also used. Descriptive statistics and econometric model were used to analyze data. Descriptive statistics and econometric model were used to analyze data. In both zones formal, informal, and alternative wheat seed systems co-exist which accounts for 18.955, 31.791 and 49.25%, respectively. Access to market and market information and credit service plays an important role in accessing of improved wheat seed supply system by smallholders’ farmers. Therefore, any interventions that make farmers access to above mentioned service of the households have better enhances farmer’s access to wheat seed in the area. Total land cultivated and farm experiences effect farmer’s access to wheat seed supply system. Therefore, total land allocated for wheat production and farm experience have a positive effect on farmers access to wheat seed supply system. Therefore, total land cultivated should be increased by using rent-in and shared-in land to enhance access of wheat seed supply systems and farm experience have to be increased by providing different training. Based on the results obtained, the study suggests that the government and stakeholders should focus on strengthening the provision of formal and informal training, arranging experience sharing program, enhancing farmer’s resource endowment in order to increase access to wheat seed supply in the study area. It is, therefore, expected that the seed producers should be capacitated through accessing credit and logistics, farm machineries, seed processing plant, store and capability (motivated and competent human resource) of seed producers to supply quality seed that could meet the zonal seed demand. Incentive mechanisms need to be devised and implemented to increase participation of cooperative unions, primary seed producer cooperatives, agents/agro-dealers and private sectors in the seed industry. Moreover, there is a need to provide training on the part of government to seed producers and agents/agro dealers on seed marketing mix.\n</jats:p>"

With specific focus on four-star hotels in the iconic Niger Delta city of Port Harcourt, the study adopted a survey approach, using primary data obtained from staff of these hotels (being the population of the study). Four hypotheses were tested using Spearman’s Rank Correlation to evaluate the relationship between the operational dimensions of Supply Chain Integration (the dependent variable) and Organisational Agility (the independent variable). Results from these analyses reveal a strong correlation between the operational dimensions of Supply Chain Integration – Internal Integration and Supplier Integration – with those of Organisational Agility – Operational Flexibility and Adaptability. Going by these findings, the study concludes that Supply Chain Integration (as measured by Internal Integration and Supplier Integration) is a strong predictor of Organisational Agility, the criterion variable. The research has thus demonstrated the potential to enhance operational flexibility and adaptability by these firms in the industry while concurrently meeting customer service criteria. It is recommended herein that hospitality firms in the Niger Delta, especially four-star hotels, strive to enhance their organizational agility leveraging on supply chain integration as an essential strategic management tool for improving intra-firm communication and coordination across the critical functional domains. This could be mostly achieved through improved integration of data and information system exchange.</jats:p>"

In this context, samples of water were gathered from six stations for various parameters such as turbidity, pH, DO, BOD5, TDS, TSS, COD, EC, TH, TA, and chloride from 2017 to 2022. Due to contamination from urbanization, water quality assessment has become essential. To address this requirement, the water quality index (WQI) was developed which incorporates various water quality parameters and expresses total water quality into a single value. Nowadays, a new method, the FWQI has been developed. To develop FWQI, 11 inputs, single output, Mamdani method, And operators, fuzzy inference rules, and centroid methods for defuzzification have been used. The average values of FWQI at the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth stations were 61.28, 57.66, 62.18, 61.90, 50.00, and 49.96, respectively. Meanwhile, the average values of WQI for the same stations were 57.98, 57.40, 58.97, 58.85, 48.39, and 49.03. The findings from both methods revealed that water quality was poor at the first four stations and good at the last two stations. This new index could serve as an alternative approach to assessing water quality.</jats:p>",

Research conducted at the Technical University of Košice explores the potential of TTES systems for efficient and long-term energy storage. The accumulation is carried out in three existing underground tanks of different volumes. Among various outputs, we present the cooling process resulting from covering the water surface and the effect of tank size on cooling. The findings indicate that covering the water surface in the tanks can effectively double the energy retention time, thereby extending the cooling period. A tank with a larger volume cools slower and better ensures the formation of temperature layers. Temperature layering allows for better utilization of the tanks’ potential in terms of energy. The overall result is a significant reduction in heat losses and CO₂ emissions. These results demonstrate the critical role of TTES in stabilizing renewable energy sources, especially solar energy, to support sustainable energy solutions in buildings by providing reliable and long-term energy storage.</jats:p>"

Methods: A total of 600 surgical instruments in a hospital’s surgical instrument sterilization and supply management center were sampled and grouped based on the introduction of the PDCA cycle combined with instrument mapping. The control group included 300 surgical instruments subject to routine sterilization management from November 2023 to January 2024. The observation group included 300 surgical instruments managed with the PDCA cycle combined with instrument mapping from February 2024 to April 2024. The quality of surgical instrument management, incidence of adverse events, and other indicators were compared between the two groups. Results: The observation group demonstrated significantly higher scores in management quality indices compared to the control group, with scores for disassembly and assembly (93.28 ± 1.57 vs. 87.41 ± 1.48), cleaning (95.04 ± 2.08 vs. 90.23 ± 2.12), disinfection and sterilization (95.33 ± 1.27 vs. 91.95 ± 1.39), waste disposal (93.26 ± 1.24 vs. 89.65 ± 1.18), packaging and traceability (94.35 ± 1.74 vs. 92.23 ± 1.65), and issuance and recycling (95.79 ± 1.72 vs. 90.22 ± 1.81) (all P &lt; 0.05). The observation group reported two adverse events (one incomplete instrument specification and one case of instrument package overweight) with an incidence rate of 0.67%. Conversely, the control group reported six adverse events (including shortages, incomplete specifications, unqualified sterilization, defective instruments, untimely or incorrect delivery, and overweight instrument packages) with an incidence rate of 3%, demonstrating statistically significant differences between groups (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Applying the PDCA cycle combined with instrument mapping for surgical instrument management in hospital sterilization supply centers significantly improves management quality and reduces adverse events. Its application is recommended for wider adoption in hospital sterilization supply centers.</jats:p>"

Over the past decades, significant research has been carried out to better understand supply chain resilience, that is, the ability of a supply chain to mitigate disruptions. Supply chain efficiency, that is, the ability to mitigate recurrent risks in the absence of disruptions has been studied even longer. But only recently have the topics of efficiency and resilience been coupled in the supply chain literature. In this literature review, we focus on the intersection of supply chain resilience and supply chain efficiency. We provide a thematic overview of literature streams according to the structure of the underlying supply chains. We identify various gaps in the current literature including areas in multi-echelon and multi-product supply chain research. Furthermore, we consider dual-purpose and dedicated levers for building resilience. Dual-purpose levers are resources that are able to promote efficiency in a supply chain while enhancing resilience in expectation. By contrast, dedicated resilience levers are resources that are able to guarantee the resilience of a supply chain in the face of particular disruptions without benefiting the supply chain in the absence of disruptions. We call for more research to better understand the value of dual-purpose and dedicated resilience levers to overall supply chain performance. </jats:p>"

On the other hand, ordering for too little quantities sometimes lead to frequent reordering and thereby increasing charges on processing and receiving the items. In this research, we examine a new approach to inventory management by formulating a dynamic programming model in a linear programming form. Many research inventory models have dealt with either the correlation between the management of inventory and profitability or the impact of inventory management on retailers’ and producers’ profit. In this research we present a new approach which examines the initial and maximum capacities of a warehouse where inventory products are stocked before selling them to prospective customers. The proposed model is a dynamic programming model in a linear programming form which includes both the quantities supplied and demanded in its formulation. Thus, our proposed dynamic model in linear programming form is more applicable to practical situations than what can be found in other models. The incorporation of supply and demand factors distinguish the model from recent inventory models found in literature which are based only on supply factor and profitability. The proposed model has been applied to a warehouse of cement manufacturing industry in Nigeria. From the results obtained in the numerical example, it is observed that periodic supply and demand quantities to produce optimum inventory cost can be determined through the proposed model’s algorithm. We also observed that the optimum values of the dual objective function and that of the primal objective function are equal.</jats:p>"

Хронология распространения COVID-19 позволяет рассматривать I квартал 2020 г. как период, в течение которого распространение вируса напрямую влияло на экономическую активность в Китае, но не в большинстве других стран. Поэтому сокращение импорта из Китая в этот период можно рассматривать как натуральный эксперимент, дающий экзогенную вариацию предложения импорта промежуточных товаров. Подверженность отраслей российской промышленности сокращению импорта из Китая рассчитывается на основе коэффициентов прямых затрат импорта, учитывает долю Китая в поставках промежуточных товаров и глубину шока предложения импорта. Эконометрические оценки показывают, что характер связи динамики промышленного экспорта с динамикой поставок промежуточных товаров из Китая изменился в I квартале 2020 г., что согласуется с предположением о том, что значение коэффициента в периоды вне 2020 г. в общем случае не может быть использовано для оценки влияния шока предложения промежуточных товаров на отрасли. Негативное воздействие шока на валовую добавленную стоимость в обрабатывающей промышленности в I квартале 2020 г. оценивается в 1,9–3,1%, а на промышленный экспорт — в 6,5–7,0%.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The study assesses the impact of the intermediate imports supply shock on the dynamics of Russian manufacture. The chronology of COVID-19 pandemic suggests that the 1st quarter of 2020 was the period during which the spread of the virus directly affected economic activity only in China, but not in most other countries. Therefore, the decline in imports from China during this period can be seen as a natural experiment, which provides exogenous variation of intermediate imports supply. The exposure of Russian industries to Chinese intermediate import shock is calculated based on input–output coeffi cients, as well as China’s share of intermediate goods imports and the magnitude of supply shock. Econometric estimates suggest that the relationship between the dynamics of manufacture and the imports of intermediate goods from China changed signifi cantly in the 1st quarter of 2020. The result consistent with the assumption that the value of the coeffi cient for periods before 2020 may be endogenous, therefore it cannot be used to assess the consequences of the intermediate goods supply shock. Based on the estimated coeffi cients, the negative effect of supply shock on gross manufacturing value added in the 1st quarter of 2020 is estimated as 1.9–3.1% and 6.5–7.0% for manufacture exports.</jats:p>",

The supply chain system, characterized by varying degrees of trust, is modeled as multiple subsystems using the T-S fuzzy model. The challenge of mitigating the bullwhip effect, which refers to the amplification of demand variability within the supply chain, is reformulated as an H∞ consistency problem. A productivity and distributed consistency protocol switching controller based on fuzzy rules is designed, providing sufficient conditions for the entire system to achieve consistency. The proposed method effectively suppresses the bullwhip effect and allows certain nodes in the system to be temporarily in an abnormal state. Finally, the method’s effectiveness is validated through simulation examples.</jats:p>"

The question is whether entrepreneurial orientation of SMEs will make them more resilient to supply chain disruptions. With limited research on the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and SMEs’ supply chain resilience (SCR) this study seeks to extend our knowledge in that respect. Grounded on the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities theory, this study examined the influence of entrepreneurial orientation on the supply chain resilience of SMEs. Five constructs of entrepreneurial orientation were adapted from literature. A cross-sectional study was employed wherein an online questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of 173 SMEs owners/or managers. Structural equation modelling (SEM) with partial least square (PLS) technique was used to test the hypothesised model. The overall findings point towards the significant influence of EO on the SCR of SMEs as evidenced by the significant positive effect of innovativeness, risk-taking, pro-activeness and competitive aggressiveness, and autonomy dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation. These results imply that it is critical that SMEs adopt an intentional entrepreneurial oriented management philosophy which can be fostered in several ways including the promotion of a flexible organizational culture that promotes and rewards innovativeness among SME employees, and collaborative efforts between SME owners/managers and policy makers on risk management awareness and competitive aggressiveness literacy and training campaigns.\n\n\n</jats:p>"

We study how consumer reactions—paying more for certified products or boycotting in the event of responsibility violations—are effective in improving a firm’s uptake of responsibility practices in the sourcing domain. We first build a stylized model to study how consumer reaction affects a firm’s incentives toward responsible sourcing and find that only boycotting reactions by consumers reliably increases a firm’s sourcing from responsible suppliers. We then include behavioral aspects to our stylized model to derive a more nuanced understanding of how consumer reactions affect responsible sourcing. Through behavioral experiments, we first show that a supporting consumer reaction induces a dual-sourcing bias in firms’ sourcing decisions. We then develop a behavioral model of responsible sourcing, incorporating this dual-sourcing bias. Our analysis modifies the normative predictions of the stylized model by showing that a supporting reaction, irrespective of magnitude, always improves responsible sourcing if the boycotting reaction from the market is weak, and that promoting a boycotting reaction always improves responsible sourcing, irrespective of the product type. Our results lead us to a comprehensive and applicable insight for practice: in the supply chains of products with few brand substitutes, creating a supporting reaction in the market is the way to improve firms’ responsible sourcing, and in supply chains of products with many brand substitutes, promoting a boycotting reaction among consumers will lead to more responsible sourcing. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Transit facilitation and supply chain management are crucial for improving trade competitiveness, especially for landlocked countries like Nepal, which faces unique challenges due to its dependence on neighboring nations, particularly India, for access to global trade routes. This article explores global best practices in transit facilitation and supply chain management, highlighting how countries with similar geographical constraints, such as Switzerland and Austria, have effectively addressed logistical challenges through integrated infrastructure, digitalization, and regional cooperation. It examines how these strategies can be adapted to Nepal’s context to optimize its transit systems, reduce costs, and enhance its trade competitiveness. Key strategies include streamlining customs procedures, adopting digital integration like blockchain and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and investing in efficient infrastructure, such as multimodal transport systems and dry ports. The article also underscores the importance of regional cooperation, exemplified by frameworks like ASEAN, which can offer Nepal opportunities to harmonize policies and reduce trade barriers. Furthermore, Nepal’s transit challenges—ranging from its dependency on India, infrastructure gaps, bureaucratic delays, and limited digitalization—are discussed, with actionable recommendations for overcoming these obstacles. Opportunities for Nepal include leveraging the India-Nepal Transit Treaty, enhancing digital platforms for transparency, improving infrastructure, and strengthening regional cooperation. By aligning with global best practices and strategically addressing its challenges, Nepal can improve its logistics and transit systems, foster economic growth, and enhance its position in regional and global trade networks. This study provides a comprehensive roadmap for Nepal to build resilience and competitiveness in the evolving global trade landscape.</jats:p>"

In light of the accelerated globalization and regional economic integration, it is becoming increasingly evident that a single enterprise is no longer capable of maintaining a monopoly in the market. As a result, it is a dynamic reflection of the comprehensive competitiveness of the entire supply chain. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive examination of the significant impact and function of supply chain management on enterprise operations and management. To this end, it employs the case of Bosch to provide an empirical analysis of the optimization measures of enterprise operation and management under supply chain management. A combined approach of enterprise and supply chain management is adopted to unify qualitative analysis and quantitative research. In addition, a logical approach has been employed to analyse the issues and design potential solutions, as well as to examine the optimisation of enterprise operations and management within the context of supply chain management, involving a systematic process of analysis, comparison and referencing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid expansion of Hungary’s infrastructure projects, especially in railway construction, has significantly increased the demand for crushed stone. Both national and EU-funded initiatives have strained supply chains, resulting in logistical challenges and material shortages. With limited domestic production capacity, efficient resource management is crucial to keeping projects on track. This paper evaluates Hungary’s supply chain for crushed stone, identifying key weaknesses and proposing solutions to enhance sustainability.\n\n\nPurpose. This study investigates the logistical and supply chain difficulties in delivering crushed stone for Hungary’s railway infrastructure projects. It evaluates current supply limitations, proposes ways to improve domestic resource management, and offers strategies to reduce reliance on imports while emphasizing sustainability.\n\n\nMethodology. The research applies Geographic Information System (GIS) modeling to analyze transportation routes for crushed stone, suggesting ways to streamline logistics. It examines the production capacities of Hungarian quarries, some producing 15,000–25,000 tons monthly, and assesses the impact of European and Hungarian regulations on material quality and availability. The potential for integrating recycled materials into the supply chain is also explored.\n\n\nFindings. Hungary’s domestic quarries cannot meet the high demand for railway ballast, estimated at 192,000 tons annually, leading to import reliance. GIS modeling shows optimized transportation routes could cut costs and carbon emissions. Incorporating smaller stone fractions and recycled materials could mitigate shortages, with recycled materials potentially comprising 40 % of railway ballast.\n\n\nOriginality. By integrating geological, logistical, and regulatory insights, this paper provides novel approaches for addressing Hungary’s crushed stone supply chain challenges. The use of GIS modeling and recycled materials offers innovative solutions for reducing environmental impacts.\n\n\nPractical value. The findings present actionable strategies for improving Hungary’s supply chain efficiency, promoting recycling, and optimizing logistics. These solutions are applicable to Hungary and other regions facing similar infrastructure material supply challenges.</jats:p>",

Intermodalism, in its evolution, has been one of the most significant factors influencing global logistics, driving modern transportation systems that contribute to international trade and building connectivity across regions. Intermodalism is thus becoming more crucial for improving supply chain management and service delivery with the growth in demand for rapid and reliable freight movement solutions. Intermodal transportation allows companies to be more adaptable, react to market changes, and resist disruption.

The system of differential equations describing the fluid motion with variable flow rate in the drainage pipe has been analyzed, taking into account the inflow of liquid from the surrounding soil through the side walls in a filtration mode. This system of equations consists of the hydraulic equation of variable mass and a modified filtration equation. The pipeline under study is laid horizontally and operates with a groundwater level slope. A significant complication in the operation of such pipes is the presence of transit flow that enters their initial cross-section and is transported along the entire length of the drainage pipeline. By introducing new variables, the original system is transformed into a dimensionless form. The solution to this system of equations is presented. It is shown that, in this case, the solution to the original system of equations depends on the magnitude of four main factors: the resistance coefficient of the collection drainage pipeline «ζl»; the generalized parameter «A» which comprehensively considers the structural and filtration characteristics of the flow under consideration; the slope of the groundwater level «I»; and the magnitude of the transit flow «Qtr» The analysis employs the concept of an infinitely long horizontal drainage pipeline that operates with a groundwater level slope and transit flow, or, equivalently, a pipeline with infinite filtration capacity of the side wall surfaces. Based on the conducted analysis, relatively simple and convenient analytical expressions have been obtained for calculating the variation of flow rate and head loss along the length of the drainage pipeline operating with transit flow. To simplify the calculations, corresponding auxiliary graphical dependencies have been proposed.</jats:p>"

Water reuse and rainwater harvesting systems provide essential technical alternatives for water supply management. There are several alternative water sources  available for reuse after some needed treatment: rainwater, stormwater, greywater, drainage water etc. The integration of on-site non-potable water reuse enhances the environmental goals of a green building by lowering the consumption of potable water and decreasing the volume of storm-water and wastewater that must be sent to the City's Wastewater Treatment Plants for treatment. The purpose of the article is to analyze two approaches for partially replacing tap water (rainwater harvesting and treated greywater reuse), to compare the constructive characteristics of these systems and calculate annual volume the potential water savings in Ukraine's residential areas using each option. Both methods offer sustainable solutions to alleviate water scarcity but differ significantly in construction, application, and operational mechanisms. For a comparative analysis of the two indicated alternative sources, are present the constructive features of water supply in the context of rainwater collection and use, and greywater. The volume  of greywater generated in low-rise residential areas and  rainwater that can be harvested from roofs was counted using Ukranian normative documents.  The result shows at a building density of 0.4, the greywater volume is 1.45 times greater than that of rainwater; at a density of 0.54, it is 1.49 times greater under Ukraine's maximum annual precipitation of 750 mm. With comprehensive water recycling systems, it is possible to reduce freshwater demand by approximately 30% through greywater reuse and by around 10% with rainwater harvesting. These savings offer both economic and environmental benefits, making water recycling especially advantageous for water-scarce regions seeking to mitigate the impacts of climate change.</jats:p>"

According to the 2011 census. Around 52 per cent of urban households use unsafe water resources for drinking purposes in Orrisa, India. The empirical study located in Bhubaneswar city in the state of Orissa, India tries to understand the issues of water supply and related policies in the context of urban poor. It is important to understand the genesis of the water supply policies and their implementation especially in the context of urban poor. The mixed method has been used in the study. Binary logistic regression was used to understand the impact of socio-economic background on access to water supply. Major findings of the study show that urban poor receive very poor water supply services and are living in impoverished conditions. They are vulnerable to waterborne diseases and other infections.

Palm oil biomass stands out as a promising feedstock. However, its high humidity, bulkiness, low energy density, and dispersed resource locations (mills) pose challenges. A network that consisting collection facilities incorporating pretreatment operations as intermediaries between mills and biorefineries is a plausible solution. Nevertheless, the facility locations directly impact travel distance, overall expenses, and the nearby population. Moreover, vehicle routing during biomass collection influences transportation costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Consequently, this research designs a model to address the location-routing intricacies within a two-echelon biomass supply chain. The model operates as a multi-objective optimization framework, encompassing three-dimensional sustainability assessment, quantified respectively as total cost minimization, CO2 emissions reduction, and minimization of the population affected. The research initially optimizes each objective function individually and subsequently advances to multi-objective optimization employing the weighted sum approach. While single-objective optimization yields optimal outcomes for each dimension, enhancements in one aspect may hinder performance in others. Nonetheless, the multi-objective optimization provides insight into the trade-offs among the sustainability objectives. The computational findings demonstrate the model could adapt the network configuration in alignment with distinct sustainability aspirations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The research examines how the application of GSCP can support competitive advantage in the automotive industry by exposing concerns and pressures in the field and showing the necessity of improving sustainable management. Extensive Supply Chain Management, green purchasing, sustainable transport and closed-loop systems that comprise of GSCP, enhances both environmental conservation and firm operations, under emissions standards and EPR polices. The study also looks at aspects on how sustainable innovation impacts competitive capabilities, problems accruing, and how best to integrate sustainability with successful green practices with reference to Tesla, Toyota, and BMW among the leading firms. Through filling the theoretical-practical gap in sustainable supply chain management, the results can provide important knowledge for academics, practitioners, and policymakers, for proving that sustainability can as a strategic resource in the automotive industry. This paper provides guidance on how green supply chain practices contribute to the competitiveness of some of the prominent automobile companies. As the following analyses indicate, all three companies show that sustainability within supply chains creates strategic worth and enhanced performance. Implementing principles such as green purchasing, energy management and waste minimization, they cut operating costs and align to a more planet sensitive market environment. Further research should be conducted to investigate the sustainability effects of green supply chain and the effects of the regulatory norms regarding their implementation across all industries.</jats:p>"

More critically, Industry 4.0 has conferred competitive advantages on supply chains through the integration of digital technologies into manufacturing and logistics, but it also implies several challenges and opportunities regarding the management of these risks. This paper looks at some ways emerging technologies, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI), help address pressing concerns about the management of risk and sustainability in logistics and supply chains. The study, using a systemic literature review (SLR) backed by a mapping study based on the Scopus database, reveals the main themes and gaps of prior studies. The findings indicate that AI can substantially enhance resilience through early risk identification, optimizing operations, enriching decision-making, and ensuring transparency throughout the value chain. The key message from the study is to bring out what technology contributes to rendering supply chains resilient against today’s uncertainties.</jats:p>"

Как известно, периоды пикового потребления тепловой и электрической энергии преимущественно совпадают, вследствие этого, создается высокая нагрузка на электроснабжающую систему. Если электротеплоснабжение является единственным источником тепла, то даже кратковременное отключение электроэнергии приводит к прекращению теплоснабжения. Следовательно, необходим дополнительный источник тепловой энергии, который снизит нагрузку на электроснабжение и позволит получать выраженную ежегодную экономию затрат. Для этого важно проанализировать эффекты, оказываемые различными подходящими источниками, не производящими при эксплуатации выбросов загрязняющих веществ. С этой целью были рассмотрены возможные конфигурации источников, проведен анализ предложенных конфигураций источников тепла с точки зрения энергетической и экономической эффективности. В статье представлена математическая модель активного потребителя, позволяющая учитывать ограничения по выработке тепла ВИЭ, включать в схему накопитель тепловой энергии, соблюдать энергетический баланс и находить оптимальный вариант схемы теплоснабжения. Задача развития схемы теплоснабжения активного потребителя с учетом перехода к безуглеродной энергетике была сформулирована и решена с помощью смешанно-целочисленного программирования. В итоге проведенной оптимизации к основному источнику был выбран дополнительный источник, позволяющий существенно сократить затраты на теплоснабжение.</jats:p>"

Because the agriculture sector relies so heavily on its suppliers, robust supply chain management and strong supplier relationships ensure agribusiness sustainability and efficiency. Aceh's coffee supply chain is typified by low profitability and poor optimization, especially regarding Gayo Arabica coffee. The COVID-19 pandemic has elevated distribution risks at different supply chain stages, exacerbating this further. The relationship between supply chain innovation and competitive advantage in the coffee sector in Aceh Tengah District, Indonesia, is investigated in this quantitative study employing a mediation model. With 60 respondents, Central Aceh Regency was selected using a purposive sampling technique for research purposes. This study uses a Likert-scale questionnaire with structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). This research aims to assist Acehnese coffee companies in gaining a competitive edge through innovative supply chain practices, resulting in more robust and efficient risk management and sustainability strategies. The results show that supply chain innovation and resilience capability do not affect competitive advantage, where the p-value of these two variables is 0,4. In addition, resilience capability as a mediating variable does not directly affect supply chain innovation and competitive advantage.\n Keywords: agribusiness, coffee, sem pls, supply chain innovation</jats:p>"

Despite its acknowledged importance, there is a paucity of understanding regarding the precise effects of supply chain integration on procurement processes in this context. This research analyzes 45 projects overseen by prominent Chinese international contractors to bridge this gap. The research employs Pearson correlation analysis to identify robust correlations among critical components of supply chain integration, procurement management, and procurement performance. Essential elements, including operational performance, procurement contract management, and stakeholder engagement, are identified as critical determinants of project success. The study seeks to examine how international EPC contractors incorporate the complete procurement management process via supply chain integration. Contractors can improve operational efficiency and procurement management by forming partnerships with stakeholders to acquire and integrate resources, hence enhancing project outcomes. This ongoing enhancement process improves procurement efficiency and bolsters the competitiveness of Chinese contractors in the global EPC market. The study underscores the efficiency and sustainability of procurement processes, demonstrating how optimized supply chain integration advances broader sustainability objectives by minimizing waste, enhancing resource utilization, and promoting environmentally and socially responsible procurement practices in international projects.

However, challenges such as a lack of transparency, low efficiency, and risks of operational disruptions remain significant barriers in Supplier Relationship Management (SRM). This study aims to explore the role of blockchain technology in improving transparency, trust, and supply chain resilience. Using a qualitative case study approach, data were collected through in-depth interviews with supply chain managers from three companies in Indonesia and supporting document analysis. The findings reveal that blockchain implementation enhances operational efficiency by up to 35%, reducing the average process cycle time from 10 days to 6 days. Additionally, transparency levels increased by 40%, reflected in the ability of supply chain participants to monitor information flow in real time. Trust among stakeholders also improved by 25%, attributed to encrypted data security and immutable transaction records. These findings confirm that blockchain strengthens supply chain resilience through three main dimensions: response, recovery, and adaptation. The contribution of this research lies in enriching the literature on the role of blockchain in SRM, particularly in the context of supply chain resilience. Furthermore, the results provide practical guidance for companies in designing blockchain implementation strategies to mitigate operational risks and enhance stakeholder collaboration</jats:p>"

The proposed integrated intelligent machine learning-based control serves for power conversion control as well as supervisory control for hourly PV energy estimation and load demand control for optimal energy consumption. The objectives of power control are extracting maximum power from PV sources and exporting power to the grid at unity power factor. While the objectives for supervisory control are local load demand control for exporting power at higher export prices. The proposed system is implemented using MATLAB/Simulink to validate the efficiency of power conversion, effectiveness of machine learning for energy estimation, and load relay control for optimal energy pricing. The results proved efficient tracking of maximum power, unity power factor at grid terminals, and load relay control for PV energy availability and export cost function.</jats:p>"

Geologically, the basin features a succession of marls at the base, overlain by Cretaceous limestones, covered by Plio-Quaternary sediments composed of alluvium and sand. The Babar Dam is situated in this basin, draining an area of 567 km2 along the Larab wadi. It is intended for irrigation of surrounding lands and the supply of potable water to neighboring communities. The analysis of major element concentrations from various sampled water points reveals that the waters exhibit dominant facies: chloride-calcium (48.88%), sulfate-calcium (24.44%), bicarbonate-calcium (15.55%), magnesium bicarbonate (08.88%), and magnesium chloride (02.22%). These chemical facies are determined by the aridity of the climate, water-rock interaction, dissolution, and mineral precipitation, mediated by cationic exchanges throughout the water flow towards its outlet. Calculation of mineral saturation indices in the water indicates that only carbonate minerals tend to precipitate, notably as calcite and dolomite, while evaporitic minerals (gypsum and halite) tend towards dissolution. A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on a data table consisting of eight (08) variables and 50 individuals. The analysis was extended to two factors, explaining 75.38% of the variance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As a result of the inconsistent and non-systematic policy regarding the transition of the housing and communal economy of Ukraine, in particular, the field of centralized heat supply, to work in market conditions, significant difficulties have arisen in providing heat to consumers. The untimely development of the regulatory and legal framework for the settlement of these issues led to a poorly predicted policy in the field of heat supply. Excessive liberalization regarding the introduction of individual heat supply in the zone of centralized heat supply led to the \"washing out\" of the most solvent consumers, significantly complicating the financial situation of heat supply companies. The Government has approved the Concept of the program for the introduction of efficient centralized heat supply in Ukraine, which foresees a significant increase in the share of renewable energy sources, waste heat energy, and the use of cogeneration technologies. The increase in the share of RES in the production of thermal energy is mainly carried out on the basis of the use of biomass. Analysis of the structure of the current consumption of biomass/biofuels in Ukraine shows that the dominant role here belongs to woody biomass, the available potential of which is already used by 90%, and sunflower husks by 83%. Further prospects and opportunities for increasing the volume of energy production from biomass are primarily related to the use of crop production by-products (straw, corn stalks, etc.) and the cultivation of energy crops. Ways to realize this potential should arouse the greatest interest. For this purpose, it is proposed to amend the current legislation regarding the definition of the term \"energy plants\", to improve the legal basis for the development of farming for the cultivation of energy plants, the conditions for the lease of plots on unproductive and degraded lands. For the further development of market relations in the field of heat supply in Ukraine, it is expedient to develop and adopt the draft Law on the Thermal Energy Market, which should also regulate the conditions for the transition to individual heat supply in the area of centralized heat supply, based on the requirements and experience of the EU.</jats:p>"

The utilization of Artificial intelligence technique has protected agricultural productivity from various threats, such as rising populations, changing climates, employment difficulties, and problems with food safety. Architectures based on machine learning have been confirmed to be among the best regarding precision and resilience. By using systems based on AI, crop yields can be increased while using less water, fertilizer, and pesticides.

Forty-eight hens (50% Lohmann Brown Classic, 50% Lohmann LSL Classic) were housed in pairs (one hen per breed per pen) across 24 pens. The pens were randomly assigned to one of two dietary P levels (0.37% or 0.84% in DM) using a high-protein corn-soybean diet (11.4 MJ AME/kg, 21.5% CP) during a 14-day acclimatization period. Following acclimatization, pens from both P groups were further randomized into four dietary treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial design, varying in P levels (low vs. high) and Zn supplementation (28 vs. 131 mg/kg) over an 8-day experimental feeding phase. Performance metrics, egg production and quality, and tissue mineral concentrations (plasma, liver, bone, and eggs) were measured. Statistical analyses were performed using linear mixed models in SAS 9.4, incorporating random effects of pen nested within treatment group and fixed effects of dietary P, dietary Zn, breed, and their interactions. Tukey-corrected 95% confidence intervals were used to estimate effect differences, with significance set at P &lt; 0.05. Performance metrics, including egg production and body weight, were unaffected by dietary treatments (P &gt; 0.1), indicating no clinical symptoms of Zn deficiency. However, hens on low-Zn diets exhibited significant reductions in plasma Zn concentration (-0.83 mg/L; P = 0.0008) and liver Zn concentration (-6.78 mg/kg DM; P = 0.01), confirming subclinical Zn deficiency. Low-Zn diets also increased the femoral molar Ca:P ratio by 0.15 (P = 0.01), irrespective of dietary P supply. Interestingly, low-P diets led to a significant reduction in femur Zn content (-0.46 mg; P = 0.0009), regardless of Zn supplementation, following 21 days of reduced P feeding. These findings highlight the higher susceptibility of laying hens to phytate antagonism compared to broilers, as evidenced by measurable subclinical Zn deficiency under short-term Zn deprivation. Additionally, a temporary suspension of mineral P supply appeared to impair the mobilizable bone Zn pool. The underlying functional mechanisms driving these interactions remain unclear and warrant further investigation.</jats:p>"

However, despite literature on supply chain resilience is copious, tools for quantifying the resilience of a business are lacking, especially when dealing with the a priori resilience of a system, since several assessments are a posteriori carried out, after a disruption has manifested. In response, an analytic quantitative model is here proposed, whose output is a Global Resilience Index for a company. The model is divided into 3 phases: Supply (8 factors), Production (12 factors) and Distribution (5 factors); these elements were derived from literature and semi-structured interviews with practitioners. The logical functioning of the model is based on weighted averages attributed to each single factor; for defining the weights a survey was sent, in which respondents had to express their opinion with reference to the perceived impact of those factors on resilience. For validating the model, it was implemented in three companies manufacturing the following products: fresh milk, ginseng coffee and vegetable preserves. Despite none of them reached the higher resilience level, results offer interesting insights for let the users understand where the system is weaker. This model is intended to be made available to those who desire to include the resilience assessment to manage operational decisions; moreover, this value could be included in a wider sustainability assessment of a business.</jats:p>"

These challenges have not been sufficiently examined in the existing literature. An empirical study was conducted within a public utilities organization in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to address this gap. An integrated approach combining interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and fuzzy cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis was utilized to identify the critical challenges and to model and analyze the relationships among them. The ISM model provides significant advantages by enabling decision-makers to visualize complex interactions, supporting the development of an effective AI implementation strategy. The strategy should prioritize four critical challenges: the lack of technical skills and knowledge, the limited availability of ready-to-use AI solutions, inadequate water infrastructure, and concerns regarding privacy and data security. These challenges were identified based on their positioning at the lowest level of the ISM model and their classification as independent in the fuzzy MICMAC analysis. Addressing these four challenges will help to mitigate the remaining six. The study’s findings and implications are expected to offer valuable guidance for decision-makers in implementing AI technologies within water supply organizations, both in the UAE and in countries with similar environments.</jats:p>"

The FOPNL Nutri-Score has been implemented in several European countries. Changes in food compositions in relation to the Nutri-Score over time have been limitedly studied. This study evaluates food compositions in Europe over time, and if changes in compositions of the food supply could have potentially resulted in changes in Nutri-Score classifications of foods. Materials and Methods: Food composition data were available from EUREMO, from which bread products, breakfast cereals, hot sauces, and processed potato products from Austria, Belgium, Finland, Italy, and the United Kingdom from 2019 to 2021 were selected (n = 2260). Of these countries, only Belgium had implemented the Nutri-Score in 2019. Distributions of food compositions and Nutri-Score classifications were calculated and changes in median salt, sugar, and saturated fatty acids content were plotted by food group, country and year. Distribution of the final sum of Nutri-Score points was plotted by nutrient, food group, country and year. Results: Overall, more favourable Nutri-Score classifications (i.e., towards Nutri-Score classification A) were observed in most of the selected food groups and countries over the years, due to the influence of specific nutrients such as salt in breakfast cereals (lower median of 0.1–0.4 g/100 g) and processed potato products (lower median of 0.1–1.2 g/100 g); and sugar in processed potato products (lower median of 0.1–1.9 g/100 g) and bread products (lower median of 0.7–2.2 g/100 g). For nutrient contents in other food groups, no consistent changes were observed. Conclusions: Changes in the compositions of the food supply resulted in favourable changes in Nutri-Score classifications, suggesting a potential for food reformulation. Monitoring after the actual implementation of Nutri-Score is recommended.</jats:p>"

A high-quality ecological environment generates significant positive externalities, making the provision of such goods a key focus of government expenditure. The ability of local governments to adequately fund the supply of ecological public goods depends on the strength of their financial capacity. Based on the panel data of 30 provincial-level regions in China from 2007 to 2019, this paper uses the super-efficiency Slack-Based Measure (SBM) model and the dynamic Malmquist index to measure the supply efficiency of provincial-level regional ecological public goods including undesirable outputs. Furthermore, the panel Tobit model and the system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) model are used to empirically test the impact of local fiscal capacity on the supply efficiency of ecological public goods. The results show that fiscal absorption capacity can significantly improve the supply efficiency of ecological public goods, and the economic growth preference of fiscal allocation capacity can also significantly improve the supply efficiency of ecological public goods, indicating that under the influence of the current economic structure transformation and ecological civilization construction, the distortion of local governments in the supply of public goods has been improved, while the administrative consumption preference of fiscal allocation capacity hinders the improvement of the supply efficiency of ecological public goods, and the fiscal self-sufficiency has a lag in improving the supply efficiency of ecological public goods. Fiscal transfer payments have significantly improved the efficiency of the supply of ecological public goods.</jats:p>"

Uncertainties regarding the structuring of relationships with primary and secondary stakeholders for sharing intangible data and information diminishes the potential for exploitation of digital transparency. While businesses are accustomed to organizing efficient flows of tangible goods, management research integrating digital transparency considerations to investigate and conceptualize structural changes in agri-food supply chain networks (AFSCNs) is scarce. This gap motivates the following four questions of this study: (1) Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders in the AFSCNs of the digital era? (2) What are their transparency interests? (3) How do AFSCN structures change with the emergence of digital innovations that can facilitate sustainability transition through greater transparency? (4) How to conceptualize those structural changes to AFSCNs? The netchain approach and respective transparency concept are integrated with classical stakeholder theory. Data was collected via a series of 21 semi-structured pilot interviews with technology providers in the EU agri-food sector and analyzed using structured content analysis. Results paint a complex picture of contemporary primary and secondary stakeholders of AFSCNs and their interests. Primary stakeholder interests lead to coopetition in vertical and horizontal relationships of the netchain and low transparency efforts by intermediaries. Both hamper the dissemination of digital innovations and the exploitation of their potential to improve AFSCN sustainability. Among secondary stakeholders, policymakers and governments, NGOs, and technology providers excel in being drivers of digital transparency for sustainability, with social media as a strong direct communication tool to reach netchain stakeholders, consumers, and research institutes/universities as collaborators and customers. The emergence of “information AFSCN” and “digital AFSCN” increases the complexity of the whole supply chain network through intermediation, reconfiguration, and emergence modes of change to underlying structures. Agri-food business managers, scientists, and policymakers should innovate in private and public governance to facilitate collaborative advantage and sustainability in a combination aligned with innovative digital transparency solutions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Improving product quality is an effective way for a company to gain goodwill as well as to increase sales. In this paper, the focus is on a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. Considering the delayed effect of quality improvement on product quality, the differential equations on the levels of quality and goodwill as the state variables are established to explore the impact of delay time on members’ strategy inputs, supply chain profits and performance under decentralized and centralized decision models. Additionally, in this paper, how different profit maximization scenarios affect supply chain revenue under decentralized models is examined. The equilibrium solutions are obtained by numerical simulation. The results show that both quality improvement efforts and marketing efforts are decreasing functions of delay time, and the delay effect affects the motivation of supply chain members’ strategic inputs. Importantly, supply chain profit under centralized decision is not always higher than that under decentralized decision when the manufacturer’s concern degree and delay time are taken into account. The Rubinstein bargaining model is then used to optimize the profit distribution between the manufacturer and the retailer under centralized decision. In this paper, it is also identified that the longer the delay time, the lower the levels of quality and goodwill. The dual effect of delay effect and concern degree will exacerbate the negative impact on the levels of quality and goodwill.</jats:p>"

The main goal of this model is to maximize the total DCSCN profit to determine the amount of demand accurately, price in direct and indirect channels, locate distribution centers, and equip/not equip these centers with IoT devices. The results show that with the increase in the uncertainty rate, the amount of demand and corresponding transportation costs have increased. This issue has led to a decrease in the total DCSCN profit. By analyzing the mathematical model, it was also observed that deploying IoT equipment in distribution centers has increased fixed costs. Examining this issue shows that by increasing the savings factor by 0.2, the total DCSCN profit has increased by 6.5%. By ranking the algorithms with the TOPSIS method, the GA was ranked as the most efficient algorithm, followed by PSO, ICA, and GWO. This IoT-enhanced dual-channel supply chain model not only aims to optimize traditional supply chain metrics but also introduces advanced, data-driven strategies for improving demand management, pricing, and infrastructure allocation, ultimately driving profitability in uncertain environments.</jats:p>"

Absent musculocutaneous nerve with complete or partial takeover of function by median nerve is known. Such variation creates confusion in the interpretation of a clinical or electro diagnostic test for evaluation of peripheral nerve injury.Methods: Institutional guidelines for the use of human cadaver were followed. Routine dissection of the upper limbs for undergraduate medical teaching was performed in a 67-years-old male cadaver following standard methods. Relevant gross anatomical features of the variations were photographed.Results: The musculocutaneous nerve was absent on the left side. A direct small branch arising from the lateral cord supplied the coracobrachialis muscle. Median nerve supplied the biceps brachii and brachialis muscle and further continued as lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm.Conclusion: The unilateral absence of musculocutaneous nerve with taking over of its function predominantly by the median nerve observed in the present case is indeed a unique situation to be aware of. Additionally the case exhibited independent supply to the coracobrachialis muscle directly from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus. It is proposed that this variation should be placed in a new subcategory in the existing classification system of the classification for musculocutaneous nerve variations.</jats:p>"

Inadequate funding for transportation limits the number of roads that can be built to increase the capacity of the transportation network. Road traffic congestion pricing has been identified as a way of reducing congestion, as it makes the cost of travel more apparent to users, but there is concern about equity issues for those who may not be able to afford the price tag. This study used the records of vehicle miles travelled in a country to illustrate the variations in revenue that could be achieved with varied fuel efficiency of vehicles. As an illustration, a comparison of revenue that could have been generated (all other things being equal) using a vehicle-kilometre travel (VKT) pricing system as compared to fuel tax for a 5-year period was also done. This review noted that the VKT ‘road user fee’ pricing system is a viable way to make the cost of travel apparent to motorists and form a basis for equity between those who use fossil fuel vehicles and those who use alternative energy. In addition to presenting a simplified procedure for establishing a sustainable transportation finance system, this study also presented a simplified method to estimate the appropriate fuel tax, as well as VKT road user fee to achieve a self-funded transportation system.</jats:p>",

However, the uncertainty surrounding renewable energy supply, its remote distribution, and regional imbalance with demand pose significant challenges for designing and planning an integrated hydrogen supply chain. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a two-stage robust optimization model based on ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. We derive a robust approximation model and develop an algorithm using generalized Benders decomposition to solve the resulting model. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to CPLEX. Additionally, a case study utilizing real data from China is presented to showcase the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed model.

Blockchain can provide transparent, trustworthy, secure, and efficient carbon‐related transactions. Signaling and attribution theories inform the study that uses choice‐based conjoint (CBC) experimentation to evaluate offsetting and insetting carbon finance investment scenarios. Factors on project attributes—including price, the scope of carbon finance project, blockchain adoption level, and stakeholder involvement—relationships to managerial investment decisions are investigated. We also investigate an important question on whether managerial ecological value propensity affects investment decisions and blockchain adoption preferences. The findings show that contrary to original suppositions, price was not as influential as presumed. Of greater concern to managerial decisions is the nature of carbon initiatives—the decision on whether to pursue carbon offsetting and/or insetting investments. Managerial environmental values significantly influenced decisions on carbon finance investments–with a preference for carbon reduction projects within their own supply chains. There is also an inclination for greater blockchain technology usage in carbon investment projects. Managers with greater ecological values were also more open to involving external parties favoring the adoption more extensive blockchain solutions. These results highlight blockchain's importance in making carbon finance projects more credible and trustworthy. Practically, the study highlights the importance of carbon finance project scope, nature, and blockchain technology in promoting sustainability initiatives. There are insights into a nuanced approach to addressing complexities of carbon finance within organizations and their supply chains.</jats:p>",

A critical challenge for healthcare decision-makers is the efficient distribution of blood among different centers. This research proposes a new method to address this issue, simplifying future solutions to similar problems. As a result of our findings, we introduce a model that considers three tiers in healthcare blood supply: point one (blood collection centers), point two (blood hubs), and final destinations (hospitals and clinics) during disasters. For this study, we focused on six collection sites, five blood centers, and thirty-one medical facilities providing eight different blood types. Our model demonstrates that blood can be transported from collection sites to medical centers at a lower cost during crises. This approach requires considering the full three tiers of the healthcare supply chain rather than focusing solely on the supply chain level at blood hubs. Unlike previous studies, which focused only on individual levels of supply chain management, this study examined the entire value chain, from blood collection to delivery to the end recipient.</jats:p>"

Prediksi permintaan yang tidak akurat dapat menyebabkan masalah serius seperti kelebihan atau kekurangan stok, yang berujung pada inefisiensi operasional. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengoptimalkan prediksi permintaan produk UMKM dengan mengintegrasikan teknologi Big Data dan Artificial Neural Network (ANN) dalam SCM. Data penjualan historis dan perilaku konsumen selama tiga tahun terakhir digunakan sebagai dataset. Setelah dilakukan preprocessing dan normalisasi data menggunakan metode Big Data, model ANN dilatih untuk memprediksi permintaan produk. Hasil prediksi dibandingkan dengan metode konvensional seperti regresi linier dan moving average. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa model ANN memberikan tingkat akurasi prediksi yang lebih tinggi dengan Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) sebesar 3.45%, lebih rendah dibandingkan regresi linier (7.89%) dan moving average (10.56%). Ini menunjukkan bahwa ANN mampu memproses data yang kompleks dan memberikan prediksi yang lebih akurat, yang pada akhirnya dapat mengurangi risiko SCM, terutama dalam hal pengelolaan inventaris dan distribusi. Penelitian ini menyimpulkan bahwa integrasi Big Data dan ANN merupakan solusi efektif untuk meningkatkan efisiensi SCM di sektor UMKM. Meski demikian, terdapat tantangan dalam hal infrastruktur teknologi dan literasi digital yang perlu diatasi agar UMKM dapat mengadopsi teknologi ini secara lebih luas</jats:p>"

Using a descriptive analysis approach, the study focused on Sragen, a major rice production center. The samples for this investigation were selected purposively from datasets provided by eleven Community Food Business Institutions and Indonesian Farmer’s Stores that have been recorded in the Office of Agriculture and Food Security of Sragen Regency. The Food Supply Chain Networking (FSCN) model and rice price formation were analyzed qualitatively, while supply chain performance and value-added (VA) were assessed quantitatively. Results revealed a significant reduction in the rice supply chain stages from 6–7 to just 3, improving efficiency. Margins for partner farmers and TTI were calculated at IDR 1,600 per kilogram (51.13% of total margin share) and IDR 300 per kilogram, respectively. Inventory turnover was 12 times annually, with inventory days of supply for farmer groups at 30 days and a cash-to-cash cycle of 37 days. VA analysis showed farmers contributed 72% of total value (IDR 376,216,168), LUPM 26% (IDR 136,678,955), and TTI 2% (IDR 8,090,000). TTI supports farmers by purchasing grains at fair prices, ensuring effective marketing, maintaining rice availability, and stabilizing prices, thus playing a critical role in the community's food security efforts.  </jats:p>"

An alternative to existing light-absorbing coatings in solar collectors based on low-vacuum aluminum condensates is proposed. Coatings manufactured using vacuum technologies are recommended, when a combined cluster and molecular flow of matter is deposited on the substrate due to a forced increase in pressure. Choosing aluminum as a material for low-vacuum coating adds advantages to this technology, because aluminum has a fairly low melting point, and the controlled formation of oxide phases on the surface of the deposited film significantly increases the corrosion resistance of the coating. The designs of solar collectors, their principle of operation and the advantages of using selective light-absorbing coatings, which can increase the efficiency of collectors by 18–22 %. An innovative infrared heating system is proposed, which ensures increased heat transfer efficiency, reduced energy consumption, and stable operation even at a low level of insolation. the task of the proposed installation is to use energy carriers more efficiently.This becomes possible due to a more rational combination of traditional energy (supply from the network) and the use of secondary energy resources; active turbulation of the heat carrier mass supplied by the circulation pump into the internal volume of the annular chamber; regulation of the heating temperature; equalization of temperature field gradients in the inner volume of the ring chamber; possibilities of regulating the productivity of the heating installation, increasing technological reliability; unification of heating elements and modes; the possibility of power supply from the network and non-traditional sources. The use of heat accumulators and multilayer systems, which allow to increase the duration of hot water selection, have been analyzed. The possibilities of combined schemes with additional energy sources, such as electric boilers or biofuel boilers, which reduce dependence on fossil energy resources, are considered. These solutions contribute to increasing energy efficiency and sustainable development of the energy industry. The conclusions emphasize the potential of integrating such systems into modern energy networks, ensuring environmental friendliness, energy independence and reducing operating costs.</jats:p>"

An organization with a robust SCM can easily meet demands, ensuring that goods or services are readily available and delivered promptly. However, poor structuring and management of SCM can lead to significant challenges, including service delivery failures. This study aims to analyze supply chain practices in the public sector in Limpopo Province, specifically focusing on public entities. The study seeks to identify weaknesses within the supply chain practices of public entities in Limpopo, highlighting issues such as lack of strategic alignment, inadequate policy implementation, and poor enforcement of SCM rules and regulations. A qualitative research approach was employed, collecting data through interviews with various experts from different public sectors to address the identified flaws in SCM practices. The findings reveal that there is a significant misalignment between supply chain and organizational strategies, which has led to service delivery backlogs, high levels of corruption, and continuous strikes across the province for better services. The study also finds that top-level management, including provincial leaders, do not perceive SCM as vital enough to warrant their attention, resulting in limited support for SCM practitioners. The lack of strategic focus and governance failures in SCM contribute to financial inefficiencies and poor service delivery, underscoring the need for provincial leaders to adopt a more strategic approach to SCM as a tool for improving public service delivery. This study provides insights into the critical role of SCM in the public sector, highlighting the urgent need for effective strategies, policy enforcement, and managerial support to mitigate governance and compliance failures. The research underscores the necessity for public entities in Limpopo to realign SCM strategies with organizational goals to enhance service delivery and combat corruption.</jats:p>"

As industries progress, there is an increasing necessity to integrate technologies that enhance human-machine collaboration, optimise operational efficiency, and foster sustainability. This work aims to do a systematic review of the evolutionary process, emphasising the transformation of supply chain management by these technologies. A systematic review technique, adhering to the PRISMA framework, was utilised to collect and assess pertinent material published between 2010 to 2024. The review encompassed an exhaustive database search, stringent eligibility screening, and thematic analysis via Atlas-ti software to discern main themes and patterns concerning the incorporation of human-centric technology in supply chain management. The results indicate that the change to Industry 5.0 entails a substantial movement towards human-automation collaboration, with AI and machine learning as essential components. Digital transformation is redefining supply chain management by utilising big data, the Internet of Things, and blockchain technology to enhance transparency, traceability, and decision-making. Bionic supply chains, integrating human intelligence with machine efficiency, are developing as a vital foundation for operational resilience and sustainability. The study suggests that the incorporation of human-centric technology in supply chain management enhances efficiency and sustainability while fostering a more resilient supply network adept at reacting to interruptions. This paper offers essential recommendations for academics and practitioners seeking to enhance supply chain operations in the context of Industry 5.0. </jats:p>"

We used sample microdata from the local census regarding income, as well as information about price, tariff structure, water consumption, distribution of consumer units by billed volume ranges, and the average cost of WSS by the service areas (SA) in the Federal District, Brazil, in 2019 and 2020/2021, periods in which there was a transition from the tariff methodology. The results showed average water consumption of 108 L.inhabitant−1. day−1 and 399 L.inhabitant−1. day−1 in the lower and higher-income areas, respectively. Customers with a monthly consumption of less than 27 m3 were subsidized in both tariff cycles. The distribution of subsidies was regressive according to the connection and consumption index in the SA of lower income. Approximately a quarter of the families in the lowest income regions commit more than 3% of their income to consume water in the lifeline block of the WSS tariff structure. Findings also indicate that poorer households headed by women with children are more likely to have water poverty problems.</jats:p>",

No studies have yet been documented exploring the supply chain map of silage and production economics of fodder used. Also, identification and prioritization of the major problems associated with fodder maize production, silage production and marketing is necessary. Chitwan district was purposively selected for this study as there are a greater number of commercial dairy cattle farms and silage-making agro-industries. A field survey and FGD was conducted among the fodder maize gowing farmers, Key Informant Interview was taken with the owner of six different silage producing farms during the time period between September, 2023 to February, 2024. A total of 90 sample farmers were selected for the study by applying the simple random sampling technique. The average productivity of the fodder maize was 539 qt/ha. The average land holding of the farmers growing fodder maize was found to be 0.38 ha. Moreover, the average price of the fodder maize was estimated NRs.345/qt. The positive gross margin and benefit cost ratio (BCR) greater than one showed both fooder maize production and silage production profitable and financially viable enterprises. Indexing identified the inadequate availability of fertilizers in time and the low price of fodder maize in the market as the first major problems associated with fodder maize production and marketing respectively. The role of cooperatives seemed to be important in the backward and forward linkages of silage as cooperatives were found to be closely associated with the marketing of fodder maize and silage as well. Assuring the timely availability of fertilizers, quality seed of suitable varieties and irrigation facilities must be the priority areras of government intervention to enahcne the production of fodder maize and silage.  Moreover, price favour for the farmers, prioritizing the development of marketing channels, assuring the availability of market information, developing the transportation and storage facilities seemed to be primary areas of intervention to promote and strengthen the supply chain of silage.  Assessing the demand for silage and exploring the more sustainable value chain could be an important area for further research.</jats:p>"

This model is a modification of the model developed earlier and differs from it by taking into account the technology of raw material cutting. The model takes into account the consumption rates of raw materials, purchases on the commodity exchange, transportation of products and pricing policy of the enterprise taking into account the demand. The purpose of the model is to maximize the value of operating profit of the enterprise. When searching for a solution, an optimization strategy is applied which includes two stages: application of linear optimization at the first stage and genetic algorithm at the second stage. As a result of testing the model at one of the timber processing enterprises in the Primorsky Territory, data were obtained, based on which recommendations are formulated for managers of the company regarding cooperation with loggers. This work represents an important step in the development of supply chain management methodology in the timber industry, taking into account the technology of raw material cutting. Further research may include modification of the model using stochastic factors, improving decision-making methods and development of more accurate product demand functions. The work has practical significance for enterprises of the timber processing industry, since it can contribute to the improvement of their production processes and increase profits.</jats:p>",

Tailoring historical satellite data to local spatio-temporal dimensions is central to catalyzing sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study employed satellite data from 1983 to 2023 to inform sustainable and climate-smart decision-making for the Batwa communities in southwestern Uganda. Daily precipitation (DPR) and air temperature data were obtained from the Climate Hazard Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and the NASA Power website (NASAPW), respectively. ClimPACT3 model was employed to generate climate indices (CIs) while R-Instat was utilized to perform statistical analysis. Results revealed that the area experiences wetter than normal conditions, with precipitation (PR) ranges of 1,006–1,489 mm. A significant (p-value &amp;lt; 0.05) increase in the annual sum of daily precipitation (ASDPR) &amp;gt; the 95th percentile was observed. The daily minimum temperature (DTMin.) and maximum temperature (DTMax.) ranged from 13.1 to 14.5 °C and 24.0 to 26.4 °C, respectively. The current study connected the implications of the results to the broader SDGs. The synergies between SDG 13 and other SDGs were also established. Therefore, the study's outcomes are imperative in advancing climate resilience for the agricultural, health, and water resources sectors.</jats:p>",

It further elaborates on the Italian transposition of the SGD provisions regarding updates, clarifying the legal nature of the obligation to supply updates under Italian law, as well as its main characteristics. The impact of these provisions in Italy is examined both from a B2C and B2B perspective. The B2C perspective considers the potential extension of the legal relationship between the seller and the consumer to third-party update suppliers. The B2B perspective examines the possibility of extending the obligation to provide updates to non-consumer contracts involving goods with digital elements, by applying the principle of integrative good faith.</jats:p>",

This study aims to assess the efficacy of Q-learning in enhancing routing for agricultural supply chains, investigate its flexibility in dynamic environments, and compare its performance across several real-world scenarios. In this specific case of the banana chain, an agent is moving through various entities in the system - from local growers to small traders and warehouses. It models the routing problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the goal is to optimize cumulative reward. Several possible cases are simulated, e.g. the finding of an optimal route for a given visit sequence that optimizes charging time and non-drivable paths left over when unexpected blockages occur to avoid energy wear penalties as well as how to best save costs; These results demonstrate the adaptability and durability of Q-learning in dynamic environments to obtain near-optimal solutions across diverse settings. Indeed, the present study adds to a growing body of research on the application of RL in logistics and supply chain management, highlighting its potential to enhance decision-making in complex and variable environments. The findings suggest that Q-learning can effectively balance multiple objectives, such as minimizing distance, reducing costs, and avoiding high-wear areas, making it a valuable tool for optimizing routing in real-world supply chains. Future work will explore broader applications and other RL algorithms in similar contexts. </jats:p>"

However, the era of globalization and digitalization presents complex challenges in supply chain management that threaten the financial stability of MSMEs. Some of the key issues faced include dependency on single suppliers, limited access to digital technology, minimal transparency within the supply chain, and rapidly changing global market dynamics. These obstacles often lead to uncertainty in inventory management, increased operational costs, and reduced production efficiency. This article not only identifies these challenges but also provides an in-depth analysis of their impact on the sustainability of MSMEs. Using a solution-based approach, the article offers practical strategies such as supplier diversification to mitigate dependency risks, digital technology integration to enhance supply chain efficiency, and collaboration within supply chain ecosystems to create stronger synergies. Furthermore, the article discusses the role of governments and business communities in supporting digital infrastructure development and providing training for MSMEs to adapt to technological changes.To illustrate the implementation of these strategies, the article includes flowcharts, graphs, and real-world case analyses as practical guides for MSMEs. With this approach, MSMEs are expected to maintain financial stability, improve competitiveness, and achieve sustainable growth amidst the challenges of globalization and digital transformation.</jats:p>"

Additionally, it designs related cost-sharing contracts. The findings suggest that: centralized decision-making is more conducive to aligning the interests of various entities within the sports events platform supply chain. Different power structures have distinct impacts on overall supply chain profits and carbon emissions. Specifically, the supply chain achieves the highest overall profit under the domination of the integrated service platform, while the lowest level of carbon reduction occurs under the domination of the materials distributor.

The analysis focuses on understanding how remittance inflows have contributed to the availability of foreign currency in the Zimbabwean economy, considering the economic challenges the country has faced, including hyperinflation, currency devaluation, and economic instability. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression method was employed to analyse Zimbabwe’s relationship between remittances and foreign currency supply. The study uses annual data from 2009 to 2022. The OLS regression results indicate a significant positive relationship between Zimbabwe’s remittances and foreign currency supply. The analysis reveals that remittances have been a crucial foreign currency source, helping stabilise the economy during economic turmoil. Additionally, exchange rates and GDP significantly impact the foreign currency supply. The findings underscore remittances’ vital role in enhancing Zimbabwe’s foreign currency supply. Given the economic instability in the country, remittances have served as a reliable and stable source of foreign exchange, which is critical for sustaining economic activities. This study contributes to the literature on remittances and their economic impact by providing empirical evidence from Zimbabwe. It highlights the importance of fostering policies encouraging remittance inflows, which can significantly stabilise foreign currency supply in developing economies facing economic challenges.</jats:p>"

We scrutinize the financing preferences of 3PL, the manufacturer, and the capital‐constrained retailer by comparing credit guarantee financing, 3PL direct financing, and trade credit. Furthermore, we analyze conflicts and coordination regarding equilibrium financing modes. Our findings reveal that 3PL's financing provision strategy depends on the manufacturer's cost and the retailer's initial capital. Besides, the financing equilibrium may be detrimental to supply chain members due to their inconsistencies in financing strategies. We propose a coordination mechanism to improve the overall profitability of supply network stakeholders. This study offers managerial insights for 3PL to provide financing modes while considering resilience rationally.</jats:p>"

This study proposes a novel framework integrating hourly load balancing on typical days into a monthly scheduling model solved with Gurobi11.0.1 to evaluate demand-met reliability across storage and inflow states. By employing total storage as a system state to reduce dimensional complexity and simulating future runoff scenarios based on current inflows, the method performs multi-year statistical simulations to assess reliability over the following year. Applied to a system of 39 hydropower reservoirs in China, the case studies of present models and procedures suggest: (1) controlling reservoir storage levels during the dry season is crucial for ensuring the power demand-met rate in the following year, with May being the most critical month; (2) the power demand-met rate does not monotonically increase with higher storage levels—there is an optimal storage level that maximizes the demand-met rate; and (3) June and October offer the greatest flexibility in storage adjustment to achieve the highest demand-met reliability.</jats:p>"

Additionally, energy costs from the battery supply must be calculated and controlled to enable solar power plant entrepreneurs to profit practically. This project aims to develop an IoT-based monitoring and controlling system for battery conditions, especially energy consumption costs from battery supply. This system uses an ESP32 microcontroller, INA219 sensor, single channel 5 VDC optocoupler relay, and OLED display. The ESP32 processes the current and voltage from the INA219 sensor and then displays on the OLED display. The parameters displayed include consumed energy costs, current, voltage, power, consumed energy, and used battery capacity. Data is also sent to the Blynk website using  IoT, allowing these parameters to be monitored in real time. Based on test results, the average error in calculating energy costs is 0.046%, and other measured or calculated parameters are below 1%. This system can also turn the power flow to the load on and off using the Blynk platform. It can be concluded that the system works well, enabling IoT-based monitoring and control of battery parameters.  </jats:p>"

This method is compared to the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to evaluate its effectiveness in identifying periodic, daily, and weekly water usage patterns. VMD decomposes the original signal into multiple intrinsic mode functions. FFT is applied to analyze and reconstruct the different frequency components of the signal, transforming them back into the time domain. While FFT shows greater computational efficiency and higher reconstruction accuracy, VMD excels in handling nonlinear and non-stationary signals with better decomposition capabilities. However, VMD requires more computation time, and its performance is sensitive to parameter selection, indicating room for further optimization. Both methods successfully detect the main frequencies in short-term urban water usage patterns, particularly identifying cycles of 0.5 and 1 days. VMD demonstrates significant potential for capturing low-frequency fluctuations in urban water usage, making it a valuable tool for future research and prediction of water usage trends, particularly in short-term forecasts.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to enhance groundwater supply through an innovative and sustainable borehole system that improves reliability and ensures a consistent water supply. This study was motivated by the need to provide sustainable water access in rural communities by addressing critical gaps in existing groundwater supply systems, thereby enhancing community resilience. This study identified a problem of water scarcity in the Polokwane Municipality, Mankweng Cluster, where the existing borehole systems are inadequate to supply groundwater. Handpumps demand significant physical effort, grid-powered boreholes cease to operate during frequent power cuts, and the inconsistent diesel supply further limits borehole operation. The study was conducted using a qualitative approach, involving data collection through interviews that were analysed using content analysis. Findings indicate several challenges, including power cuts, diesel supply shortages, poor infrastructure maintenance, vandalism, and theft of equipment, which affect the proper operation of boreholes. The study concludes that water scarcity in the Mankweng Cluster stems from inadequate water infrastructure. The study recommends implementing a solar-powered borehole system that uses photovoltaic energy to pump water from underground aquifers.</jats:p>"

This paper focused on the supply side of the proposed framework: by interviewing farmers markets’ directors and producers, an empirical analysis has been carried out with the purpose of identifying how these actors evaluate the three facets of value (economic, social, and environmental). The results show that, while directors emphasize economic value, farmers attribute higher importance to the environmental and, especially, social facet of value. These findings, which represent a primary research step that includes the consumers' contribution to the stage setting, highlight the diverging views of the actors involved.

This growth necessitates a hybrid approach combining online and offline sales channels to maximize market coverage. However, this dual-channel strategy poses challenges in pricing, as customer preferences heavily influence purchasing decisions. This study analyzes pricing strategies within a dual-channel supply chain (DCSC). It examines two main scenarios, centralized and decentralized systems, to determine optimal pricing strategies considering in-sales service and discount. The decentralized system employs a Stackelberg game model, where the manufacturer sets prices first, followed by the retailer. A clothing company is used as a practical case study to apply these mathematical formulations. The study highlights how parameter variations such as customer preferences, service, and unit costs influence price. Notably, the decentralized system often results in higher profitability than the centralized approach under specific conditions. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that while some parameters remain stable, customer preferences significantly affect pricing decisions. A preference for online shopping tends to favor a centralized strategy, indicating that coordinated pricing can mitigate channel cannibalization risks. The study underscores the complex interplay between pricing strategies, discounts, and in-sales services in dual-channel supply chains</jats:p>"

To study the vessels that are involved in the vascularization of the ovary and oviduct, the method of conventional and thin preparation was used, pouring SKS-65 latex through the femoral artery, then fixing in a 3 % aqueous solution of formaldehyde was performed. Three types of arterial blood supply to the ovaries have been identified. In the first type, two arteries originated from the left cranial renal artery and penetrated into the ovarian stroma. In the second type, one artery branched from the descending aorta and two arteries from the left cranial renal artery. In the third type, two arteries branched from the descending aorta and one artery from the left cranial renal artery and entered the ovarian stroma. Arterial blood supply to the oviduct is carried out by the main arteries - dorsal and ventral oviduct, additional – cranial, middle and caudal protein, cranial and caudal uterine and small collateral – right and left craniolateral, caudoventral, cranioventral uterine. Vascularization of the uterus in chicken occurs due to the main (cranial and caudal uterine) and additional (craniolateral right and left, caudodorsal and cranioventral) collateral arteries. In 68.5 % of cases, it was found that the ovaries were supplied with blood by branches both from the descending aorta and from the left cranial renal artery, while in 31.5 % of cases – only from the left cranial renal artery. The presence of various connections in the form of intersystemic and intrasystemic anastomoses on the lateral surface of the oviduct, which represent a morphological path of roundabout blood circulation, was noted.</jats:p>",

Businesses, economics, and political settings are becoming more susceptible to unforeseen shocks and disruptions. Due to these uncertainties, organizations currently encounter several challenges in the supply chain. These challenges include adapting to fluctuations in demand, enhancing service quality, reducing inbound costs, improving on-time delivery, and shortening customer lead times. To ensure their survival, organisations must adapt to the escalating levels of demand unpredictability and prioritize the attainment of enhanced agility. Agility is the capacity to promptly adapt to shifts in market and consumer requirements, serving as a source of competitive advantage. Hence, it is imperative for organizations to revamp their supply chain in order to address the challenges of agility and maintain a competitive edge in the fiercely competitive global market. The review objective is to investigate several approaches to agile supply chain strategy implementation in order to enhance responsiveness to market volatility. The present study employs the systematic review methodology, adhering to the protocols and guidelines established by Kitchenham and Charters. The investigation is carried out utilizing online scholarly database systems, yielding a total of 135 initial publications, which are further narrowed down to 21 published studies spanning the period from 2013 to 2023.

In this study, 10 field surveys, including those of recently built apartments, and three high-rise water supply experiments were conducted. The study presents a strategy for using fire department connection facilities as follows. First, during the normal operation of the pressurized water supply device, the supply pressure to the fire engine vehicle is gradually increased from 0.3 MPa or higher to transmit water. This protects firefighters from high-pressure increases. Second, when the pressurized water supply device is not operated, it is transmitted at a pressure equivalent to 50 m of head (net positive suction head + fire engine vehicle supply pressure) required for the height of the fire floor. Here, the required head of 50 m can be calculated as the sum of the suction head up to the pressurized water supply device and the supply pressure of the fire engine vehicle.</jats:p>",

The study examined the theoretical application of CSP to a real‐world food supply chain case, reviewing how systems thinking can enhance resilience by addressing systemic issues. The case analysis reveals the tactical approaches taken in response to the disruptive effects caused by the pandemic. A causal analysis reveals the presence of unreconciled elements, for example, a lack of inventory transparency between firms, classified as unresolved systemic issues that negatively affect the ability of the wider supply chain to manage the discontinuity of the supply chain. A conceptual framework and retrospective theoretical application articulate CSP's utility in addressing unreconciled systemic issues. This paper is one of the first applications of CSP in a supply chain context, providing a novel lens for examining resilience. Limitations include the research approach (retrospection), with further longitudinal studies, suggested to empirically assess the conceptual framework postulated in this paper.</jats:p>",

This study undertakes a bibliometric analysis of 445 Scopus-indexed documents (2002–2024) using VOSviewer and Biblioshiny, offering a systematic exploration of critical research trends, thematic clusters, and knowledge gaps within this intersection. The analysis identifies several dominant themes, including green logistics, circular economy principles, digital transformation technologies, and adaptive risk management. Findings highlight the transformative role of digital tools—such as blockchain, IoT, and AI—in enhancing supply chain transparency, predictive analytics, and operational agility. The automotive sector emerges as a focal industry, facing unique challenges of resource dependency, regulatory compliance, and the need to align sustainability with resilience frameworks. Additionally, the study underscores the growing prominence of circular economy practices, such as reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chains, in addressing environmental goals while bolstering supply chain adaptability. However, significant gaps persist, particularly in the empirical validation of sustainable logistics practices and their measurable impact on resilience outcomes across diverse regions and sectors. The study calls for the development of integrated frameworks that align environmental sustainability with technological innovation and operational efficiency, supported by longitudinal studies and cross-industry comparisons. This research contributes to academic discourse by offering actionable insights for scholars and practitioners. It establishes a foundational roadmap for integrating sustainability and resilience, emphasizing the pivotal role of digitalization and circular economy principles in shaping robust, adaptable supply chains capable of withstanding the complexities of an increasingly volatile global environment.</jats:p>"

Therefore, we simulated the water balance model of an estuary agricultural reservoir to evaluate the impact of additional industrial water release on its performance. We considered runoff and treated water as water inflow and irrigation requirement in paddy fields and water use in the hydrogen plant as water release. Runoff and irrigation water requirements were estimated using the Tank model and the FAO modified Penman method, respectively. Industrial water demand was surveyed at 32,000 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> throughout the year. The results show that the reservoir's reliability increases as the water loss and irrigation area decrease with reusing the return flow, which is hardly affected by the industrial water supply. The trend of resiliency resembles reliability; however, the industrial release has the most significant impact when lower water loss is applied and the paddy area is decreased. Vulnerability gets worse when additional purpose water is released. In other words, the more water the reservoir releases, the more severe the drought gets. Therefore, the engineer and operator should consider the expected risks presented as reliability, resiliency and vulnerability in the design and management of the reservoir.</jats:p>"

In Ulu Belu District, coffee distribution through long channels causes high distribution costs, so supply chain management (SCM) is needed to improve efficiency. This study aims to measure the cost efficiency and effectiveness of coffee distribution using qualitative descriptive analysis method. The results showed that coffee marketing efficiency in Channel I amounted to 11.98%, and Channel II amounted to 11.92%, both classified as efficient. Delivery accuracy was also high, with Channel I reaching 98.89%, while Channel II was 85.83%. Channel II is more cost-effective despite Channel I being more effective in delivery. Cost-efficiency is important because coffee is a perishable product, and weather-related delays are rare. Channel I, which involves many members, increases distribution costs, so Channel II is recommended for optimal efficiency. It is suggested that improvements to transportation infrastructure, road access, and storage facilities at trader locations can increase distribution efficiency, maintain coffee quality, and reduce losses.</jats:p>"

As part of ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency and accuracy of data collection, to better inform regulatory decision-making, scientists at the FDA have been exploring the application of emerging imaging technologies. To this end, we tested the ability of shortwave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral image analysis to simultaneously detect and identify filth elements from a variety of chemically digested single- and multiple-ingredient food matrices. We tested five stored-product beetle species on a background of four different food matrix types. Our analyses successfully detected whole beetles and fragments as small as 0.65 mm in 95% of samples. All beetle species tested were accurately detected from the background matrices, and initial classification results show identification to genus. Our results show that SWIR spectral image analysis is a very promising technology for application in the detection and identification of filth elements in food products in a regulatory context and further development has the potential to increase analytical efficiency at FDA regulatory labs. </jats:p>"

However, traditional methods to ensure food security are often susceptible to various forms of fraud and require significant processing overhead, making them inefficient for the evolving demands of modern food supply chains. To address these shortcomings, blockchain technology has emerged as a robust and efficient solution to enhance food security. This paper presents a novel lightweight blockchain-based signature mechanism designed for the rapid detection of food fraud. It also includes a domain-specific ontology to serve as a structured knowledge model, allowing systematic analysis and detection of different types of fraud within the food supply chain. This approach uses smart contracts built on lightweight blockchain technology to initiate and manage transactions related to food fraud. Then, semantic rules are applied to detect and identify fraudulent activities. Once fraud is detected, associated transactions are encrypted and tracked, ensuring visibility and traceability among consortium members. Experimental results based on large-scale transaction data demonstrated ~7.5× speed improvement over iterative search algorithms while maintaining high transaction traceability and significantly reducing storage costs.</jats:p>"

The findings presented by this research have indicated that finished goods, fuels, and energy shortages have augmented inflation. The war affected the routes of transport which in turn impacted the goods and logistics of the commodities by Russia. Due to war, Europe has taken the step to welcome the Russians leaving their country. The sanctions imposed have adversely affected the Russian imports from Europe and exports to Europe. However, European countries such as Poland, Germany, and Finland imported natural gas from Russia and the imports of fossil fuels were increased by nations like Turkey, China, and India. In this way, Russia's earnings from its sales of fossil fuels rose. Unfortunately, everything gets costly because the cost of transport increased, and worldwide prices of energy elevated. Intense inflation was led by this war.</jats:p>"

This paper seeks to address this oversight by demonstrating what a systems (multiparadigm, multimethodological) approach involves and means for supply chain theory and practice: the adoption of a broad range of paradigmatic perspectives, the juxtaposition and interplay of different perspectives and the creation of opportunities for understanding and action that offer the potential for transformational insight and change. Such a systems approach is demonstrated through the employment of three contrasting perspectives (objective‐positivist, subjective‐interpretivist and radical‐critical) to the case study of the supply chain for personal protective equipment (PPE) in the United Kingdom during the first year of the Covid pandemic. This case study is complex and multifaceted and demonstrates well the urgent practical need for a systems approach to supply chain theory and practice as each supply chain perspective offers only partial insight and understanding.

We analyze a set of 23 companies in four food industry sectors in Italy to characterize the practices implemented to build proximity, upstream and downstream, in their supply chains. Our findings reveal a combination of different practices along the three proximity dimensions that define SFSCs. These results allow also to underline how specific practices for relational and information proximity are paramount for attaining sustainability objectives in SFSCs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Innovation is crucial in today’s business world, and one way to achieve it is by implementing a Supply Chain Management (SCM) system. Wikana Konfeksi, a clothing manufacturer based in Denpasar, still relies on manual methods for essential tasks such as tracking purchases, managing inventory, and recording sales. These manual processes often lead to errors, such as inaccurate records, misplaced documents, and delays in communication between departments. To address these challenges, Wikana Konfeksi decided to implement an SCM system using Odoo 16 ERP. This system streamlines business processes, helping the company achieve greater efficiency. The Accelerated SAP framework was used to guide the SCM implementation. The primary steps that comprise this technique are project preparation, business blueprint, realization, final preparation, and go-live support. The system was tested using the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) method, focusing on five key aspects of the Odoo 16 system design. Six staff members from Wikana Konfeksi participated in the UAT process, providing feedback on whether the system met their needs. The test results were overwhelmingly positive, with a score of 286, indicating that the system implementation was successful and more time efficient in carrying out each of its business processes.</jats:p>"

Anthropogenic and geogenic pollutants in water system are challenging to identify, transport, and properly dispose of, thus demanding frequent monitoring. Study focuses on application of statistical approach to analyse pattern and to monitor WQ parameters of region. Paper presents computation of water quality index (WQI) based on various WQ parameters of the Daman Ganga River situated in Vapi, Gujarat, India. 17 WQ parameters considered were pH, electrical conductivity, temperature (Temp), total dissolved solids, NO2 + NO3, (P-Tot), Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO4, CO3, HCO3, total hardness, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), and calcium hardness (HAR_Ca). Quartile deviation was carried out as preprocessing technique to identify fair analysis of trend followed by other parameters. Application of PCA followed by varimax rotation factor analysis was attempted to identify contribution of significant parameters. Methods developed by Council of Canadian Ministry of Environment (CCME) and British Columbia (BC) were applied to compute WQI. WQI evaluated were 42.35 and 63.29 for CCME and BC, respectively, based on five significantly influencing parameters, namely, HAR_Ca, SAR, CO3, Temp, and P-Tot. Study signifies the hardness and salinity factors impacting WQ and efficiently reduces subjectivity and bias to determine the WQI model.</jats:p>",

However, there are still problems with palm oil commodities in North Sumatra, especially Langkat Regency. In the FFB marketing aspect, obstacles are faced, such as fluctuations in FFB prices at the farmer level and the length of trading channels that farmers have to go through before they reach the factory. This research aims to analyze the smallholder oil palm supply chain in Langkat Regency. The research was carried out in May - August 2024. The research used primary and secondary data. Determining respondents used non-probability sampling, namely the purposive sampling method for farmers with a total of 73 people and snowball sampling for trading institutions. The data analysis used is the food supply chain network (FSCN) to describe research descriptively based on the results of interviews with business actors, observations and checking documentation. The research results show that supply chain management has clear chain targets and structured chain members. There are two flow patterns in the smallholder oil palm supply chain in Langkat Regency. The flow pattern of the supply chain I: farmer – middleman – ramp – palm oil mill and the flow pattern of the supply chain II: farmer – middleman – palm oil mill. Analysis of marketing margins and farmers' share, it shows that the smallholder oil palm supply chain in channel II is more efficient than channel I because it has the lowest margin and the highest farmers' share</jats:p>"

These challenges lead to inefficiencies, resulting in significant waste and reduced productivity, and place small-scale firms at a disadvantage in a competitive market. This review explores the potential for utilizing Construction 4.0 technologies to enhance productivity and streamline supply chain management in small-scale construction. Through a comprehensive literature survey, a lack of awareness and adoption of digital tools was identified, revealing a key barrier to optimizing supply chain processes and achieving cost-effectiveness for these businesses. To gain further insight into current practices, a questionnaire survey will be conducted with engineers and suppliers involved in the small-scale construction supply chain, aiming to assess their specific needs and challenges. Insights from this survey will inform the design of a web-based application tailored to act as a digital tool for supply chain management, with a focus on improving productivity by addressing key factors impacting small-scale supply chains. This proposed tool will offer a user-friendly platform for streamlining supply chain operations, ultimately supporting small-scale firms in adapting to industry demands and enhancing their competitive positioning through digital transformation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines the significant impact of COVID-19 on Pakistan's apparel industry, which has faced severe challenges due to global supply chain disruptions and the cancellation of $2.1 billion in export orders by major international buyers. As a key contributor to Pakistan's economy and a major source of employment, especially for women, the apparel sector has been severely strained, with brands like H&amp;M and Walmart reducing business. This has led to factory closures and widespread job losses. Using an explanatory research design and deductive approach, the study focuses on supply chain resilience in the garment sector during the pandemic. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire targeting HR and administrative personnel familiar with company policies and strategies. A sample of 150 respondents was surveyed to assess vulnerabilities, operational sustainability, capabilities, and supply chain resilience. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 26), supported by data from newspapers, online sources, and observations. A pilot study confirmed the reliability of the questionnaire. The study highlights the need for greater collaboration among governments, international buyers, and textile organizations to support the industry during crises. It also identifies the health risks faced by workers and emphasizes the importance of policy measures such as stronger labor protections and continued government support. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and industry leaders to enhance resilience and sustainability in the global garment industry.</jats:p>",

The peculiarities of the operation of the water supply system of a multi-story residential building under conditions of increased pressure at the entrance of the water supply system are analyzed.Mathematical and software tools have been developed for the formation of recommendations for the implementation of energy- and resource-saving approaches in the design of water supply systems of multi-story buildings. In order to develop a refined mathematical support for the development of recommendations for improving the energy efficiency of water supply systems, the water consumption calculations of a multi-story building were refined, and the expressions for the distribution of water consumption values by floor were obtained. The use of an indicator of the operating mode of the system is proposed and justified: consumer needs for water as the amount of water consumption at a minimum sufficient input pressure. According to the cyclogram of water consumption by users of the building, the need for water, which is the same for all floors, is determined. A methodology for calculating water consumption by each individual floor based on the experimental results of changes in water consumption of the building with changes in inlet pressure has been developed. The influence of the amount of excess pressure at the entrance of the house on the amount of water consumption by its residents was studied. It has been established that due to excess pressure in the system, for a seven-story building, for same resident's need for water, the difference in consumption between the first floor and the seventh floor can be 9%. The results of flow calculations for zero excess pressure at the water supply system inlet were obtained; the results of flow calculations for excess pressures corresponding to 1, 2, 3 and 4 atm were obtained. For the studied example of a seven-story building, the probable annual increase in water consumption for each of the above-mentioned excess pressures, which are 4718, 9400, 14070 and 18696 m3, respectively, was calculated.</jats:p>"

Understanding the current resilience capabilities of cross-border suppliers is a stepping-stone to implementing resilience initiatives and policies to mitigate disruptions. However, no guidelines or practical tools exist to help cross-border suppliers conduct a deep-dive analysis of their resilience. Therefore, this paper proposes an assessment tool to guide cross-border suppliers in assessing their resilience capabilities. Methods: The supplier-focused resilience assessment approach was adapted from the Logistics Performance Index concept. The questionnaire and its resilience assessment dimensions were established through a literature review with the support of experienced cross-border professionals. Case study validation was further conducted to demonstrate the tool’s applicability. Results: The assessment evaluation through the Cross-Border Resilience Performance Index facilitates detailed analysis and benchmarking, enabling recommendations for necessary resilience initiatives and policies. Conclusions: This study contributes to the supply chain literature by adding a more practical resilience assessment approach focusing on cross-border suppliers. The Cross-Border Resilience Performance Index is the study’s primary contribution and is novel to the literature. The tool’s advantages include ease of use, replication potential, and its ability to glean comprehensive insights, ultimately improving supplier resilience and supply chain robustness. By implementing more precise initiatives, the tool increases the chances of cross-border suppliers being selected and maintained by buyers, helping them sustain their businesses and better respond to changing conditions to mitigate disruptions.</jats:p>"

Although its emergence is well documented, limited empirical research examines the underlying factors driving the accounting supply chain challenge. These factors must be clearly understood before effective solutions can be developed and employed. We survey more than 1,400 business school undergraduates (both accounting and nonaccounting) using fixed-response and open-ended questions. We employ factor analysis, logistic regression, and textual analysis to better understand how their perceptions of specific elements of accounting and the profession affect their choice of pursuing an accounting education. We find three factors impacting the choice to pursue an accounting education: (1) perceptions of career opportunities, (2) familiarity with life as an accountant (including work-life balance), and (3) hurdles to the degree/career, particularly the certified public accountant exam requirements. These results have implications for effectively resolving the accounting supply chain challenge.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Availability: Data are available upon request.</jats:p>",

The most complicated case is the leakage from underground gas pipelines, as gas filtration into the ground, its spreading from the leakage place and accumulation in underground cavities are determined by many factors. Natural gas leaks, in addition to losses, may cause damage to buildings and structures, threat to human health and life due to burning or explosion of the gas-air mixture, financial and economic costs in case of gas shortages, and fines for consumers. Thus, the causes of failures are mainly corrosion wear and local defects of various origins on the walls of gas pipelines, which reduce the capacity of gas pipelines, as well as deteriorate the physical condition of the pipe metal - causing its fatigue under prolonged exposure to operational loads. The listed causes of failures, except for the last one, are well studied. The methods of local defects detection are developed, which will contribute to the improvement of the process of operation and repair and restoration technologies of gas pipelines. In contrast to the existing approaches, the approach presented in the article assumes improvement of the process of operation and repair and restoration technologies of gas distribution networks on the basis of local defects detection methods developed by the authors and improvement of their reliability taking into account the data on the actual technical condition and characteristics of each group of reliability indicators of elements of gas distribution networks.</jats:p>"

As a rotating machinery product, inherent vibration is present in its functionality. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the sources of vibration and minimize them to prevent transmission to the vehicle body. This paper discusses and presents experimental results of a design change aimed at reducing vibration transmission from the fuel supply module by modifying the rubber support within the product. Beginning with an analytical model to establish the cause-effect relationship between dynamic machinery and its support in vibration phenomena, the study implements changes to the actual product and conducts tests in fuel tank applications. The goal is to reduce vibrations transferred from the source to the target through design proposals. Following prototype tests, the paper concludes that vibration measurements of rotating machinery can be reduced by altering the design of its rubber support&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

This study explores the pro-environmental behaviours of the supply chain actors and their employees that can help minimise food waste within the agricultural supply chain. This study used a thematic literature review method to draw empirical evidence on, to explore the components, factors and impacts of pro-environmental behaviour towards reducing food waste across the agricultural supply chain. The study found that consumer education campaigns, the adoption of innovative technologies for waste management and development of food rescue organisations can help develop pro-environmental behaviours among the supply chain actors to reduce food waste. These findings are useful for policymakers, industry professionals, and researchers to develop effective strategies for minimizing food in the agricultural supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Against the backdrop of globalization, the complexity of supply chains has been increasing, making supply chain resilience a critical factor in ensuring the stable operation of enterprises, national economies, and international trade. This paper adopts a network modeling perspective to systematically review the theoretical foundations and research progress in supply chain resilience, focusing on the application of network modeling methods. First, the concept of supply chain resilience is defined, and its developmental trajectory is reviewed. Through literature visualization analysis, this study delves into the current state of research on supply chain resilience, addressing challenges and risk management, highlighting the importance of network modeling techniques in this field. Subsequently, it explores supply chain network modeling based on complex networks and agent-based modeling, analyzing their strengths and limitations in simulating the overall evolution of supply chains and the dynamic behavior of individual entities. By integrating network structural characteristics with resilience evaluation methods, this paper suggests potential directions for future research. These include enhancing the description of individual firm behavior, analyzing the dynamics of information networks, and emphasizing task-oriented model design, thereby offering new perspectives and pathways for managing supply chain resilience in a way that can generate significant positive externalities for global economies. This research also indicates that the enhanced resilience of supply chains can produce a multiplier effect, benefiting not only individual firms but also promoting economic stability and growth across multiple countries.</jats:p>"

Very little effort has been made towards its domestication and the development of techniques for its production. An experiment was conducted in Benin, to evaluate the effect of substrate and water supply on B. mannii’s survival and growth. A factorial design with two factors was set up in a randomized complete block with three replications. Three substrate types under five watering levels were tested. Data on collar diameter, and total height were collected over 4 months and used to calculate the current growth rates, which were analyzed using two-way ANOVA. The findings indicated that the species exhibited a generally sluggish rate of growth, with height increasing by less than 1 cm per month and collar diameter expanding by under 0.4 mm each month. This trend was consistent, irrespective of the type of substrate or the frequency of watering. Although no statistically significant effect was found between the modalities of the factors in isolation and their interaction on current height growth, the combinations of a watering every two days with sandy-loamy substrate mixed with cow dung and a watering every five days with bokashi substrate exhibited the best height growth performances, with increases of 0.22 cm and 0.24 cm per week, respectively. The availability of water has proven to be crucial for both survival rates and the growth of collar diameter, highlighting how essential water is for B. mannii.</jats:p>"

The results showed that the tank temperature increased as the flow inlet rate decreased. At 4 L/m, the temperature in storage rose to 42 °C at 12 Am, while at 6 L/m, the temperature rose to below 39 °C. Introducing water pipes inside the storge tank enhances heat accumulation and heat dissipation ability. Temperature peaks were recorded at 45°C using 8 water tubes and a flow rate of 4 L/m.</jats:p>"

The conventional sources are meant to serve as a backup for renewables to meet the demand during power shortages in the system. This research focuses on integrating an optimal structure of an off-grid system consisting of PV and WT generators with a battery energy storage system (BESS) and a diesel generator set (DGS) to ensure high reliability of power supply to a remote area. We contribute a machine learning algorithm (TLBO) for optimal sizing of the installed capacity of the PV-WT-BESS-DGS hybrid system components. The algorithm relies on the original multi-objective function to determine the most advantageous values of unit capacities for PV and WT plants, as well as the number of batteries and diesel generators, to meet the demand in the hybrid system under different scenarios of PV and WT power shortage. The optimization problem is solved considering the variability of meteorological conditions as manifested in the random and uncertain intermittency of PV and WT generation as well as in the stochastic nature of the electricity consumption process. To enhance the efficiency of its solution, this study seeks to cluster these processes and identify common scenarios for the data set of hourly measurements of PV and WT generation and loads during the year. We use k-means clustering to determine the number of clusters for PV, WT, and loads for representative geographical areas. The study reports the results of the analysis of optimal configurations for a hybrid AC/DC system made up of PV, WT, BESS, and DPS in these areas.</jats:p>"

Drawing on 14 key informant interviews as well as a novel Twitter dataset, I hypothesize that digital activism can elicit a response from industry when it originates with a small number of activists, provided that it also spreads to traditional media. I further hypothesize that industry’s response will be superficial and result in only token changes to sustainable supply chain practices due to the ephemerality and lack of cohesion inherent in some forms of digital activism. These hypotheses lay a foundation for broader cross-sectoral research on how industries respond to digital activism directed at their supply chains and add nuance to ongoing debates about the efficacy of digital activism as a means of changing industry practices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Preterm infants are susceptible to neonatal sepsis, a syndrome of pro-inflammatory activity, organ damage and altered metabolism following infection. Given the unique metabolic challenges and poor glucose regulatory capacity of preterm infants, their glucose intake during infection may have a high impact on the degree metabolism dysregulation and organ damage. Using a preterm pig model of neonatal sepsis, we previously showed that a drastic restriction in glucose supply during infection protects against sepsis via suppression of glycolysis-induced inflammation, but results in severe hypoglycemia. Now we explored clinically relevant options of reducing glucose intake to decrease sepsis risk, without causing hypoglycemia and further explore the involvement of the liver in these protective effects. We found that a reduced glucose regime during infection increased survival via reduced pro-inflammatory response, while maintaining normoglycemia. Mechanistically, this intervention enhanced hepatic oxidative phosphorylation and possibly gluconeogenesis, and dampened both circulating and hepatic inflammation. However, switching from a high to a reduced glucose supply after debut of clinical symptoms did not prevent sepsis, suggesting metabolic conditions at the start of infection are key in driving the outcome. Finally, an early therapy with purified human inter-alpha inhibitor protein, a liver derived anti-inflammatory protein, partially reversed the effects of low parenteral glucose provision, likely by inhibiting neutrophil functions that mediate pathogen clearance.Our findings suggest a clinically relevant regime of reduced glucose supply for infected preterm infants could prevent or delay the development of sepsis in vulnerable neonates.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, new technologies strongly rely on precious raw materials and might suffer from supply chain risks. The European Union has identified a set of raw materials deemed to be critical or strategic because they appear essential for energy transition technologies. Consequently, long-term energy system planning must factor in the availability of these critical raw materials when selecting specific technologies, as their supply could be affected by global policies or conflicts. This paper provides a literature review on the assessment of critical raw materials in energy technologies comparing the main approaches on critical raw materials content assessment in technologies, long-term planning studies considering critical raw materials, and the development of indicators for critical raw materials content in energy technologies. The main findings of this review suggest that existing reliable databases with the bill of materials, such as life cycle inventories, should be exploited and that proper indicators to rank the criticality of materials and the importance of a specific technology should be developed. These findings are discussed and organized proposing a method for the optimal planning of an energy technologies mix in regional or national energy systems considering the availability and future supply of critical raw materials.</jats:p>"

This process stands as a pivotal component of supply chain management (SCM), making supplier selection a critical concern for establishing an effective supply chain system. In this instance, a case study has been presented for supplier selection employing Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in conjunction with the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique. We have explained it using fuzzy data. It not only contributed on utility of fuzzy AHP methodology, but also provided comprehensive literature review of MCDM problems. Furthermore, by outlining the steps of fuzzy AHP in a straightforward numerical manner, this study can serve as a guide for implementing the methodology in other (MCDM) problems. In this study, we evaluate four suppliers using fuzzy AHP. This method can be used when one has to select one particular supplier from a number of suppliers in a short time span. It will be also helpful to the Pharmacists to select the best supplier who can fulfil all their needs. Despite the abundance of studies on supplier selection, there has been relatively less investigation into the evaluation and selection of suppliers using specific measures tailored to the healthcare sector. To bridge this gap, this research puts forth a guideline for selecting suppliers of baby hygiene products.. KEYWORDS :Supplier, AHP, Fuzzy, Evaluation, Supply chain management (SCM).</jats:p>",

As a consequence, tipping elements are mostly absent from climate projections that are commonly used by the drinking water industry to test the resilience of their systems. There is, however, mounting evidence for the existence and potential (possibly even imminent) activation of some of these tipping elements. The drinking water sector is, by necessity, slow-moving as its infrastructure is meant to operate for many decades and in practice often does so even longer. The time scales of possible changes associated with tipping element activations may, however, be much shorter. We provide a review of the current understanding of climate tipping elements and present a simple model that investigates potential magnitudes and time scales of rapid climate change associated with tipping element activations. We study the potential consequences for drinking water supply systems, focusing on Europe, and argue that given the associated deep uncertainty and far-reaching consequences, it is essential to include tipping scenarios in the decision-making processes in the drinking water sector.</jats:p>"

I used the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) to model the impact of events occurring in the global supply chain, and the export and import container traffic at Turkish ports. Instead of examining the relationship between the variables over the whole sample, I used the time-varying causality analysis, which makes it possible to detect the relationship at different periods in time by analyzing it with the rolling window approach. The dataset includes 230 monthly observations and covers the period between January 2004 and February 2023. The pressure in the supply chain differs according to export and import container loads. The Russia–Ukraine war, the Suez Canal closure, economic sanctions between the U.S. and China, economic crisis, geopolitical conflicts, hurricanes, and port congestion in the U.S. all affected the traffic in Turkish ports. Since this research was conducted with a time-varying approach and the GSCPI variable successfully represented many global supply chain events, it was possible to examine which events affected international trade through a single variable. Thus, event-based assessments become possible instead of just saying that supply chain pressure affects international trade. </jats:p>"

The management of raw water supply in Bayongbong District for the community still relies on springs with a gravity system, deep well pumps and rivers. The flow of the Cimanuk River in Bayongbong District can be used to provide raw water. Four rainfall stations are used. Average rainfall is calculated using the Thiessen method. The raw water collection point does not have a automatic water level recorder (AWLR), so it is necessary to create a model to obtain the discharge at the collection point. The model used is the water balance model from F.J. Mock. Calibration of model parameters was carried out on observed discharge at Cimanuk-Bayongbong AWLR and Cimanuk-Bojongloa AWLR. To test the reliability of the model, NSE and RMSE values ​​were used. The NSE and RMSE values ​​in the Cimanuk-Bayongbong catchment area are 0.515 and 3.615 and Cimanuk-Bojongloa are 0.593 and 4.813. The results of the model parameter calibration are used to calculate the discharge at the collection point. The calibration result ​​at the collection site are exposed surface 50%, infiltration coefficient 0.5: recession coefficient 0.35: catchment area characteristic factor 10%; and soil moisture capacity 200 mm. The dependable flow is calculated based on Q90% probability, water availability in July, August, September and October is 0.078 m3/s; 0.025 m3/s; 0.035 m3/s; and 0.025 m3/s. Water availability in that month is smaller than the discharge requirement for the next five and ten years, namely ranging from 0.134 m3/s to 0.168 m3/s and 0.145 m3/s to 0,182 m3/s.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a novel mathematical model for the last‐mile logistics of the pharmaceutical supply chain and optimizes a pharmacy's logistical financial outcome while considering medication synchronization, different delivery modes, and temperature requirements of medicines. We propose a mathematical formulation of the problem using mixed‐integer linear programming evolved from the actual problem of an outpatient pharmacy of a Dutch hospital. We create a case study by gathering, preparing, processing, and analyzing the associated data. We find the optimal solution, using Python MIP package and the Gurobi solver, which indicates the number of order batches, the composition of these batches, and the number of staff related to the preparation of the order batches. Our results show that our optimal solution increases the pharmacy's logistical financial outcome by 34%. Moreover, we propose other model variations and perform extensive scenario analysis to provide managerial insights applicable to other pharmacies and distributors in the last step of cold supply chains. Based on our scenario analysis, we conclude that improving medication synchronization can significantly enhance the pharmacy's logistical financial outcome.</jats:p>"

In light of this, this paper uses A-share listed companies in China from 2012 to 2022 as the sample and empirically examines the impact of the asset-light operational model on corporate performance, while identifying the transmission mechanism through the lens of supply chain resilience. The study finds a significant positive correlation between the asset-light model and corporate performance. The mechanism test shows that the asset-light model promotes corporate performance growth by enhancing supply chain resilience, establishing a deduction pathway where the asset-light model drives corporate performance improvement.

Live-streaming channel selection strategies and behavioral decisions are critical considerations for retailers to enhance business performance by increasing engagement and profitability. This study introduces the spillover effect between influencer and self-live-streaming channels, offering new theoretical insights into sustainable supply chain management from multichannel retailing, game theory, and spillover effects for channel selection and pricing, optimizing dual-channel tactics for inclusive marketing, and challenging pricing and channel effectiveness beliefs. Hence, inclusive and sustainable business practices in live e-commerce have been examined, focusing on dual-digital-channel strategies involving influencer marketing and self-live-streaming. This paper investigates three digital supply chain structures for sustainability, which are based on influencer characteristics: the single digital channel (S), the dual-digital-channel structure without spillover effect (DN), and the dual-digital-channel structure with spillover effect (DS). This study employs Stackelberg game models to analyze behavioral, pricing, and channel preferences, and it also extends the model to offline channels. This study finds that (a) influencer effort affects influencer live-streaming pricing, which may not always be cheaper than self-streaming digital channels; (b) commission rates significantly impact influencer pricing strategies, leading retailers to use skimming and penetration pricing strategies when commission rates are low and high; and (c) retailers may develop influencer live-streaming channels if the cross-price coefficient is medium and low but prefer it when the coefficient and spillover impact are large. By analyzing how these digital channels contribute to societal sustainability through reduced environmental impact and enhanced social inclusion, this research highlights key marketing decisions that optimize business performance and social responsibility in the digital economy. It offers live e-commerce managers strategic channel selection, pricing, and sustainability advice and recommendations for future empirical validation to enhance practical applicability.</jats:p>"

Carbon tax has been introduced in many countries to reduce GHG emissions. As recycling can prevent additional GHG emissions, the carbon tax should be refunded based on the GHG volume saved by recycling. The incentive of carbon tax refund can help promote recycling as an environment-friendly and economical activity. To retrieve material values from end-of-life (EOL) products, a reverse supply chain network should be designed based on the status and value of EOL products. This study introduces carbon tax refund into the reverse supply chain network for maximizing saved GHG emissions and minimizing cost. The bi-objective model is formulated using ϵ constraint method and integer programming. Numerical experiments were conducted based on the recycling of a vacuum cleaner and a laptop. The monetary rate at which the carbon tax refund became economically attractive differed according to product type. Thus, variable carbon tax refund rates would be needed, based on product type, to incentivize recycling.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The transition to sustainable energy systems has placed increasing importance on the adoption of circular economy (CE) models, particularly within energy supply chains. Circular economy practices emphasize the efficient use of resources, waste minimization, and the reuse, recycling, or repurposing of materials, promoting long-term sustainability. In energy supply chains, this model aims to reduce environmental impact, enhance resource efficiency, and improve overall economic performance. Recent advancements in circular economy models have facilitated the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower into energy supply chains, significantly lowering carbon emissions. Energy producers are now focusing on maximizing the lifecycle of resources and optimizing energy generation and distribution processes. One of the core components of CE in energy is the shift toward closed-loop systems, where waste from one process becomes the input for another, minimizing environmental degradation and resource depletion. Furthermore, waste-to-energy technologies and energy storage systems are becoming crucial in reducing energy wastage and improving grid reliability. Key innovations include the development of energy-efficient technologies, such as smart grids, and advances in digital tools that enable real-time monitoring of energy consumption and emissions. These technologies allow energy companies to optimize their operations, reduce inefficiencies, and enhance supply chain resilience. Additionally, digitalization and data analytics are supporting the tracking of resource flows, carbon footprints, and waste streams, driving transparency and accountability across the supply chain. However, the widespread implementation of circular economy models in energy supply chains still faces significant challenges, including technological limitations, financial constraints, and regulatory barriers. Governments and industries must collaborate to create frameworks that support circular practices and incentivize investment in sustainable solutions. Despite these challenges, the potential of CE models to drive the transformation toward low-carbon, resource-efficient energy systems is undeniable. By advancing these models, energy supply chains can contribute significantly to global sustainability goals, reducing the carbon footprint and fostering long-term resilience in the energy sector.\r\nKeywords: Circular Economy, Sustainable Energy, Energy Supply Chains, Renewable Energy, Resource Efficiency, Carbon Emissions, Waste-To-Energy, Smart Grids, Digitalization.</jats:p>"

The study presents White Supply Chain Management (WSCM), which incorporates ethical, social, and environmental practices into supply chains to enhance competitiveness. WSCM expands on Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) by integrating principles of ethics and social responsibility towards achieving the SDGs. The variables include social pressure, ethical management and corporate social responsibility, promoting holistic sustainability across all supply chains.\nPurpose of the article: The study's objectives were to examine the validity components of WSCM in the food sector, analyze the influence of WSCM on the long-term effectiveness of the Food Industry, and examine the WSCM model to see how it promotes long-term effectiveness in the food business.\nMethod: The research used a quantitative survey design to elicit responses from a sample group of 664 respondents, selected using a lottery-based random sampling method with 2–3 key informants per factory, typically occupying middle to high-level executive positions. The test tool was a structural equation model.\nFindings &amp; value added: The results show that WSCM and sustainable performance (SUS) are much improved by social pressure. WSCM further improves SUS. The findings emphasize the need for food sector stakeholders to interact with their publics (both internal and external), maintain ethical standards, and leverage supply chain analytics for transparency. Theoretically, the findings show how societal pressure drives sustainability through WSCM, therefore addressing issues outside of conventional Green Supply Chain Management. The study focuses on the necessity of implementing an integrated framework for managing the supply chain, comprising ethical, social, and environmental factors, and advises future research to test the WSCM framework in additional sectors and investigate its long-term effects on sustainability.</jats:p>"

However, the global warming potential of green hydrogen worsens if grid electricity is used to back up renewable sources. Green hydrogen is also responsible for water consumption and for land use, while offshore platforms may be responsible for the loss of marine biodiversity. Another potential environmental hotspot is the depletion of rare metals and critical materials employed in the electrolyzer and in the power generation plants. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of information about the management of the end‐of‐life stage of this equipment. Notably, the delivery along the supply chain is responsible for hydrogen leaks, whose environmental consequences are still uncertain.</jats:p>",

Accurately forecasting energy supply and electricity demand is crucial for the efficient operation of DES. This paper focuses on accurate short-term energy supply and demand forecasting using machine learning (ML) algorithms across different seasons within small-scale DES, including photovoltaic (PV) generation, wind generation, and load demand. Initially, we develop multiple base model ML algorithms including long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and recurrent neural networks (RNN) with feature selection approaches to improve forecasting accuracy and reduce model complexity. These base models leverage key temporal and spatial features and seasonal variations process to improve the model forecasting accuracy and reduce overfitting across different seasons. To further reduce forecast errors, we propose robust ensemble forecasting techniques including simple averaging (SA), weighted averaging (WA), and Stacking. In ML algorithms, the ensemble forecasting technique combines the multiple base models’ forecasts to produce a more accurate and robust final forecast by leveraging the strengths and compensating for the weaknesses of individual base models. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow libraries to develop, train, evaluate, and validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the developed forecasting models and the proposed ensemble forecasting techniques. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach offers a robust solution for short-term supply and demand forecasting problems in DES. The work is both novel and effective from the perspectives of application, ML algorithms combination, and performance improvement.</jats:p>"

Can these avenues be put together, or are they parallel and, hence, not compatible? The answer to that question largely depends on the potential effects of digitalization on SFSCs. Going digital is a transformative process, accompanied by desirable and undesirable economic, social, environmental, and cultural impacts on short supply schemes. In this cross-sectional quantitative study, based on data from 211 individuals who frequently buy from SFSCs, we examined how consumers evaluate these impacts. We also investigated how participants’ perceptions of these impacts influence their acceptance of agricultural digitalization and their willingness to buy food products from digitalized SFSCs. Our results revealed that consumers view digitalization as a source of positive environmental but adverse social, cultural, and economic impacts on short supply schemes. In addition, we found that acceptance of digitalization and willingness to buy from digitalized SFSCs received moderate-to-low scores. Two regressions showed that buyers’ perceptions of the social impacts that follow digitalization shape both acceptance and willingness. These findings uncovered consumers’ skepticism toward digitalization, suggesting that their commitment to short supply chains and the values that these schemes represent cultivate the belief that digitalization can negatively transform SFSCs, leading to an unwelcome industrialization.</jats:p>"

With the improvement of global environmental protection awareness, the construction of platform supply chain of forest products has become the core driving force to promote sustainable development of forestry. Studying the resilience of supply chain of platform of forest products is of great importance to solve the contradiction between economic development and natural ecosystem protection. However, the existing resilience evaluation methods are not suitable for the dynamic and complex performance evaluation of the current forest products platform supply chain. Therefore, in order to make up for this shortcoming, this paper evaluates and analyzes the supply chain resilience of the forest products platform based on AI recommendation and extension theory. Firstly, this paper combined the characteristics of forest products and used AI recommendation technology to build a forest products platform supply chain resilience performance evaluation index system. Secondly, the AHP method was used to calculate the index weight, and the resilience evaluation model of the platform supply chain of forest products was constructed. Finally, in order to ensure the authenticity and credibility of the evaluation results, three practical cases were analyzed to illustrate the resilience level of the platform supply chain of forest products, and the effectiveness of the application of AI recommendation and extension theory in the resilience performance evaluation of forest products platform supply chains was verified. The scientific value of this paper is that it provides a new idea and a new method for the resilience performance evaluation of the forest products platform supply chain and makes theoretical and practical contributions to the fruitful application of AI recommendation in the supply chain field. In addition, this study also provides a new practical guideline for protecting the natural environment and realizing the sustainable development of forestry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>In the supply chain, retailers usually have inherent advantages over manufacturers in obtaining demand information because they are closer to the final market and can directly interact with consumers. However, manufacturers cannot make sure whether their retailers have obtained extra demand information. The retailer's information acquisition state is also an important aspect of information asymmetry among supply chain participants, besides the demand information itself. We examine two modes observed in practice regarding the transparency of the retailer's information acquisition state: non‐transparency and full transparency. By incorporating a manufacturer's information belief adjustment strategy, our study thus addresses a retailer's acquisition and ex‐post sharing of information (i.e., the decision on how to share acquired information) under the two transparency modes. The main findings show that under the non‐transparency mode, the retailer shares low‐demand information but hides high‐demand information. With respect to the interim profit (i.e., after the acquisition cost is realized), the preferences of the manufacturer, retailer, and supply chain on the two modes depend on the information acquisition cost. With respect to the ex‐ante profit (i.e., before acquisition cost is realized), surprisingly, the manufacturer and supply chain always prefer the non‐transparency mode, whereas the retailer's preference for the two modes still depends on the acquisition cost. In addition, our equilibrium outcome reveals that the retailer and the manufacturer will never sign an internal information sharing agreement (i.e., never achieve the full transparency mode), whether before or after the realization of information acquisition cost. We also find that the expected consumer surplus under the non‐transparency mode is always higher than that under the full transparency mode, which is also a counterintuitive outcome. Finally, our main findings in the core model are relatively robust when considering acquisition cost sharing, general demand distribution, general acquisition cost distribution, ex‐ante informed retailer, and imperfect information acquisition.</jats:p>"

Prior research on supplier‐enabled innovation has identified various capabilities that buyers need in order to collaborate with innovative suppliers. It recognizes that suppliers also require capabilities to access buyer knowledge. However, we still know little about the role of innovation intermediaries—actors who are neither buyers nor suppliers, but still influence innovation processes and outcomes in supply networks. Our case‐based research shows that intermediaries create workspaces for R&amp;D and experimentation, help to refine definitions of requirements and de‐risk novel solutions, support contracting, and facilitate solution implementation. We contribute to research on supplier innovation by developing a model of intermediaries' activities and underlying capabilities, and their impact on innovation sourcing outcomes. We elaborate the indirect capabilities theoretical perspective by introducing additional types of indirect capabilities for collaborative innovation in supply chains, and showing how these capabilities interrelate. We furthermore extend the literature on innovation intermediaries by elucidating hitherto unexplored capabilities for intermediation and adding insights regarding the contribution of intermediaries to open innovation processes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The E‐commerce platform supply chain (EPSC) is maturing as a result of the platform economy's growth, and an increasing number of eco‐friendly producers are joining E‐commerce platforms to increase the sales of their eco‐friendly goods. However, without an information disclosure mechanism, customers find it challenging to completely comprehend or grasp the green information on items. Eco‐labels, as a green declaration symbol, can effectively reduce the information asymmetry between consumers and manufacturers. This paper establishes four game models for the EPSC under industry and government labels, considering the reselling and agency selling modes. The effects of consumers' green perceptions, eco‐label credibility, and R&amp;D cost coefficient on the operation of EPSC, consumer surplus, environmental quality improvement, and social welfare were analyzed. We find that the enhancement of consumers' green perceptions and eco‐label credibility are beneficial for improving the product's greenness, increasing the profit of the E‐commerce platform, consumer surplus, environmental quality improvement, and social welfare, but it may not necessarily be beneficial for the manufacturer and the overall profitability of EPSC. Additionally, the profitability of the E‐commerce platform, consumer surplus, environmental quality improvement, and social welfare are more susceptible to shifts in consumers' green perceptions, whereas increasing the eco‐label credibility is more beneficial to the revenues of the manufacturer and EPSC. From the perspective of pursuing profits, the industry label is often chosen by the manufacturer, whereas the E‐commerce platform tends to choose the government label. Whether the optimal sales mode selection strategy of the manufacturer under the eco‐label is beneficial to the E‐commerce platform also depends on the size of unit production cost, commission rate, and consumers' green perceptions (eco‐label credibility). Moreover, EPSC benefits most from the reselling mode under the industry label, whereas consumer surplus, environmental quality, and social welfare are better served by the reselling mode under the government label. Conversely, the manufacturer is more likely to decide to resell the product under the government label when the R&amp;D for green products is highly challenging.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a multi-stage simulation, testing, and verification method is designed for a multi-team, multi-location, and multi-stage integrated gas system. This method is designed to solve the problem of missing input parameters between the gas supply system and the exhaust system. Preliminary tests and strategy verifications were carried out through theoretical simulation and semi-physical simulation, and good calculation results were obtained for the single-rack product. The external systems were tested using a simulation system, and a calculation method was designed to obtain relatively accurate parameters. In the early stage, the performance of the product was predicted using the parameter library of Flomaster and semi-physical simulation methods, but the error was large. In the middle and late stages of development, as some products became realistic, multi-stage testing was carried out using a vacuum simulator, simulated flow resistance, and other methods, achieving a performance prediction with an error of 12% before ground testing. The final ground test and on-orbit test showed that the design and calculation method of this paper is effective. The multi-stage design method proposed in this paper was successfully applied to the integrated gas system of the Chinese space station, which can provide a reference for the design of fluid components in long-term system engineering.</jats:p>"

Using systems thinking, real-world system behaviour is converted into a conceptual model, facilitating decision-making through customer, actor, transformation, worldview, owner, and environment components. The findings include a conceptual model translated into a causal loop diagram, part of a dynamic systems approach, which shows the interconnections and feedbacks among variables in the supply chain, such as raw material supply, logistics costs, production volume, and distribution costs. This stage identifies stakeholders and systematically illustrates the relationships in managing the flow of goods. It provides a basis for designing a supply chain network aligned with local government policies for developing the coconut milk agro-industry. It aims to optimize the local food industry, particularly rendang, in West Sumatra province. After creating the conceptual model, gap analysis and validation were conducted, comparing the model with real-world insights from stakeholders, including coconut farmers, producers, rendang manufacturers, academic institutions, and local governments. Validation focused on efficiency, efficacy, and effectiveness.

Providing the population with a sufficient amount of good quality drinking water is a strategic task for the national government.Drinking water used for centralised water supply to the population is drawn from surface water sources and groundwater aquifers. Historically, surface water has been preferred as the main source of water supply.The Dnipro River and its numerous tributaries are the main source of water supply for 75% of the Ukrainian population. However, due to significant technogenic pressures on the water quality in the Dnipro River and its catchment area the surface water is characterised as polluted and highly polluted in terms of chemical and bacterial contamination.In order to improve the quality component of the domestic drinking water supply to the population and industrial enterprises (mainly food production), particular attention should be paid to the increased use of groundwater. The experience gained during the war suggests the need to establish a local water supply system based on pumping stations (i.e., buvettes) with reserve water sources and means of delivering water to the consumption network.The article analyses the existing shortcomings and problems in the organisation of domestic drinking water supply in Ukraine and outlines some steps to improve the situation.</jats:p>"

These mangoes are primarily exported to countries in the Middle East, Europe, and Southeast Asia, where demand for exotic fruits like mangoes continues to rise. The increasing global demand for Indian mangoes presents a unique opportunity for Tamil Nadu to expand its market presence through improved supply chain practices. However, challenges such as inadequate cold storage facilities, poor transportation infrastructure, and the perishable nature of mangoes make it difficult for the industry to meet international standards. Agile Supply Chain Management (SCM) principles can play a transformative role in the mango export supply chain, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. This manuscript aims to explore how Agile SCM can be effectively applied to the export of mangoes from Tamil Nadu, addressing both opportunities and challenges in implementing Agile practices in the mango export sector.</jats:p>",

Extant literature has documented various predictors of vibrant supplier relationships. However, missing in the extant literature is the potential of negotiation approaches to cultivation of healthy supplier relationships. This study therefore sought to determine the influence of negotiation approaches on SRM. A sample of 150 dyadic transactions in the fast-food restaurant industry was surveyed. The broad dichotomous categorisation of negotiation methods into distributive and integrative approaches was used. SRM was operationalised using dimensions such as commitment, trust, communication, adaptation, and satisfaction. After conducting a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) the results revealed that the distributive strategy was weakly linked to supplier relationship, while a strong supplier relationship was observed in the use of integrative negotiation strategy. It was therefore recommended that procurement practitioners must employ integrative negotiation strategies and tactics in order to create sustainable supplier relationship management.</jats:p>",

The optimization mechanism is implemented by coding the novel self-adaptive F-NSGA-III algorithm with a fuzzy structure in the MATLAB environment and integrating it with the EPANET framework. Initial definition of the cost function is based on the correlation between the cost, diameter, and length of the pipes. Subsequently, the program is ran through 10,000 and 20,000 iterations. In order to enhance the rate of convergence, the cost resulting from the breach of the permissible pressure range (minimum: 30 m and maximum: 60 m) is included into this function. Subsequently, the program is executed once more to get the optimal solution. The results indicate that the F-NSGA-III algorithm, has superior speed in identifying optimal solutions as compared to NSGA-II. In this method, the utilization of fuzzy structure and the consideration of the cost of violating the permissible pressure in each iteration result in the fastest attainment of the optimal response, as previously achieved by other researchers, for sample networks. Therefore, this structure yields more optimal solutions with fewer iterations and substantially reduces the time required to achieve convergence.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article provides an in-depth analysis of airline ticket pricing, tracing its historical evolution and exploring current trends. The article provides a detailed description of the structure and components of airline ticket pricing, as well as the impact of factors on this process.  The research examines the development of airline pricing from the early 20th century, when aviation was a luxury reserved for the wealthy, to its current state as a competitive and affordable industry. Key historical milestones are discussed, including the introduction of computerised reservation systems in the 1960s, the US Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, and the emergence of low-cost airlines in the 1980s and 1990s. These developments have led to fundamental shifts in the pricing of airline tickets, which made it possible to transform the aviation landscape by reducing fares and expanding access to air travel. At the same time, the article discusses economic and technological factors that influence airfare changes, such as deregulation, fuel costs, global crises and consumer demand. The article analyses dynamic pricing strategies supported by sophisticated modern airline pricing algorithms, which allow carriers to adjust fares in real time in line with market conditions. The study also highlights important events that have influenced pricing trends, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, showing how airlines have quickly adapted to economic shocks by adjusting their pricing structures. In addition, the study delves into the speed and frequency of price fluctuations, highlighting airlines' responses to real-time data and global changes. The implications of these price dynamics are assessed, identifying their impact on industry profitability, passenger accessibility and other economic consequences. Airlines benefit from revenue optimisation through dynamic pricing, while passengers face challenges in navigating variable fares. Thus, the results of the study, namely the economic analysis of airline pricing, provide an opportunity to identify the complex interaction of factors that shape airline prices. The results highlight how technological advances, competitive pressures and changes in consumer behaviour continue to redefine the airline market, offering valuable insights into the factors driving the evolution of airline affordability.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to analyze the effect of supply chain practices, including milking, inventory, transportation, and communication, on food loss in the dairy supply chain in Banyumas Regency, Indonesia. This study used a quantitative approach with multiple linear regression analysis based on data from 46 dairy farmers. The results showed that only transportation significantly affected food loss with a regression coefficient of -0.450 and a p value of 0.004. Poor road infrastructure, inefficient transportation, and inadequate delivery support equipment contributed to milk loss during distribution. Although milking, inventory, and communication did not show significant effects, these practices are still important in maintaining milk quality. Farmers are advised to improve milking hygiene, improve storage systems, and strengthen stakeholder coordination. The implications of this study indicate that reducing food loss can improve milk production efficiency, maintain supply stability, and support farmer welfare. Further studies are recommended to expand the research scope to cooperatives and processing industries to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the dairy supply chain.\n\nKeywords: Banyumas Regency, distribution efficiency, food loss, milk supply chain, transportation\n\n \n\nAbstrak\n\nFood loss dalam rantai pasok susu merupakan tantangan yang berdampak pada efisiensi produksi dan keberlanjutan industri peternakan. Penelitian ini bertujuan menganalisis pengaruh praktik rantai pasok, yang mencakup pemerahan, persediaan, transportasi, dan komunikasi, terhadap food loss dalam rantai pasok susu di Kabupaten Banyumas, Indonesia. Studi ini menggunakan pendekatan kuantitatif dengan analisis regresi linier berganda berdasarkan data dari 46 peternak sapi perah. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa hanya transportasi yang berpengaruh signifikan terhadap food loss dengan koefisien regresi -0,450 dan p value 0,004. Infrastruktur jalan yang buruk, ketidakefisienan alat transportasi, dan alat pendukung pengiriman yang kurang berkontribusi terhadap kehilangan susu selama distribusi. Meskipun pemerahan, persediaan, dan komunikasi tidak menunjukkan pengaruh signifikan, praktik-praktik ini tetap penting dalam menjaga kualitas susu. Peternak disarankan meningkatkan kebersihan pemerahan, memperbaiki sistem penyimpanan, dan memperkuat koordinasi antar pemangku kepentingan. Implikasi penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa pengurangan food loss dapat meningkatkan efisiensi produksi susu, menjaga stabilitas pasokan, dan mendukung kesejahteraan peternak. Studi lanjutan disarankan untuk memperluas cakupan penelitian hingga ke koperasi dan industri pengolahan guna mendapatkan gambaran lebih menyeluruh tentang rantai pasok susu.\n\nKata kunci: efisiensi distribusi, food loss, Kabupaten Banyumas, rantai pasok susu, transportasi</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Climate change has an impact on the scarcity of sustainable water sources for plant water supply in a greenhouse. In the dry season, the availability of groundwater and surface water sources is insufficient to supply the crop water requirements. Adequate and consistent water supply is crucial to support the optimal growth and production of plants in a greenhouse. Rainwater harvesting can be an important alternative to mitigate water scarcity, reduce groundwater exploitation, and preserve environmental sustainability. This study investigates the reliability of rainwater harvesting from greenhouse roofs to supply the water demands of vegetable crops cultivated in the greenhouse surface area. The analysis was conducted based on rainfall depth values of a 20-year time series (2004-2023) from a representative rainfall station of the study area. The rainwater harvesting in the greenhouse can produce a capture volume of 25.43 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> (227.02 L/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) with a cumulative capture volume of 2116.72 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> and 20.07 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> (179.19 L/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) with a cumulative capture volume of 1643.82 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, represents a mean monthly rainfall of 283.78 mm and a dependable rainfall with an 80% probability of 223.98 mm, respectively. The reliability of the rainwater harvesting system can fully supply the water needs of the vegetables-cucumber family, small vegetables, roots and tubers, and vegetables-solanum family, reaching 2.81 L/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>.day, 2.95 L/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>.day, 3.09 L/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>.day, and 3.23 L/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>.day, respectively. The average surplus of 18.91 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> was produced in the design based on the mean monthly rainfall depth and 13.55 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> in the dependable rainfall depth of 80% probability.</jats:p>",

We find that when the production cost of a product is high under no trade‐in program, old consumers do not purchase the product. When the retailer provides the trade‐in program, there are “lose–win” situation for the manufacturer and retailer.

The present study explores the logistics of vegetable enterprises, primarily focusing on the spatial spread of market centers, their functioning, role, and efficiency of supply chains, postharvest losses, and constraints. The study used Nearest Neighbor Analysis, Location Quotient, and Rao's Sphere of Influence method to demarcate the Trade Area. It was found that there is a random distribution of vegetable markets with the Rn value of 1.12 across the region, with the largest trade area (27 sq km) in the second‐order market center at Srinagar. From the Boxall postharvest loss method, it was found that between 20% and 25% of the vegetables are lost along the entire supply chain on account of inadequate infrastructure and a lack of technology and awareness. The efficiency analysis reveals that shorter supply chains exhibit higher efficiency as compared to extended supply chains. However, despite lesser efficiency, these extended supply chains comprised of producers, preharvest contractors, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers are more prevalent (51%) on account of small farm size, low income, and quantity of produce, which is validated from the results of Chi‐square and Analysis of Variance tests at the (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) level of significance. From the constraint analysis, it was revealed that numerous intermediaries, small farm sizes, inadequate counseling and training, an improper support system, and a lack of market information are the main obstacles in this enterprise. Policy interventions for the upgradation of infrastructure, strengthening farmer's cooperative societies, easy access to finance, training, and awareness are needed for streamlining operations, reducing wastage, and improving efficiency and productivity to ensure the long‐term sustainability of this enterprise.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Life expectancy is a key indicator of public health, reflecting the overall socio-economic development and environmental conditions of a country. In rural areas, where centralized water supply systems are often unavailable, the quality of drinking water becomes a critical factor influencing residents' health. Non-centralized water sources, such as wells, boreholes, or open reservoirs, are often characterized by elevated levels of harmful substances or bacterial contamination, which may lead to chronic diseases and increased risks of premature mortality. The study was conducted in rural settlements of 12 territorial communities in the Zhytomyr district during 2020–2023. Water samples were collected from non-centralized sources and analyzed for nitrate and total iron content. The study utilized the Loss of Life Expectancy (LLE) metric to evaluate the effects of drinking water consumption. LLE was calculated as the product of the probability of a hazardous event or exposure (Risk) and the average remaining life expectancy (L). Official data from the Zhytomyr Regional Statistics Office were used to determine average life expectancy and the mean age of the adult population. The study found that the average nitrate concentration in drinking water from non-centralized sources exceeded established standards in all examined communities, ranging from 1.4 times higher in Novohuivynska to 3.5 times higher in Volytska. Total iron concentrations exceeded national standards only in Lyubarska, but relative to European standards (0.2 mg/dm3), most communities showed exceedances between 1.15 and 2.7 times. Life expectancy reduction due to nitrate-contaminated water was estimated to range from 0.85 years in Novohuivynska to 2.13 years in Volytska for adults, with even greater impacts on children, ranging from 1.67 to 4.22 years. Similar calculations for iron contamination showed reductions ranging from 0.11 to 1.17 years for adults and 0.21 to 2.31 years for children. These findings underscore the significant health risks associated with consuming water with elevated levels of nitrates and iron.</jats:p>",

Based on extensive discussions with supply chain SMEs (subject matter experts) and federal government security officials, this framework unfolds in two steps: (1) a mapping process constructs a supply chain map from a focal firm’s perspective, and (2) the supply chain map is overlaid with various types of disruptions that can occur at supply chain locations. To this end, the paper systematically classifies PSC disruptions based on historical data and expert opinion. The paper discusses various pre-disruption and post-disruption mitigations and reports gleaned insights into their efficacy. Finally, the paper discusses the generalizability of this integrated framework to other supply chains, such as medical devices and satellite solar panels.</jats:p>"

The source of drinking water supply for the city of Chelyabinsk with a population of more than 1 million people is the Miass River, the flow of which is regulated by the Shershnevskoye and Argazinskoye reservoirs. The waters of these reservoirs are periodically subjected to increased blooming, including cyanobacterial blooming, which makes the water hazardous to human health, requiring special monitoring.\r\nMaterials and methods. The objects of research were natural water of the river. The objects of the research were natural water of the Miass River at the Shershnevskoye water reservoir in the water treatment station of the municipal unitary enterprise for water supply and sanitation industrial association “Sosnovskiye water treatment facilities” in Chelyabinsk and treated drinking water before supplying to the distribution network. The results of laboratory-instrumental studies of phytoplankton biomass, quantitative, and qualitative (species composition) of cyanobacteria for 2010–2022 were used. Determination of cyanotoxins microcystin-LR, cylindrospermopsin, anatoxin-a, saxitoxin, and beta-N-methylamine-L-alanine (BMAA) in reservoir water and drinking water supplied to the population was carried out using ready-made immunoenzyme test systems, manufactured by Eurofins Abraxis (USA) by enzyme immunoassay method.\r\nResults. The dominant genera of cyanobacteria identified in the water of the Shershnev Reservoir were: Planktothrix, Aphanizomenon, Microcystis, and Anabaena. As a result of monitoring the water of the Shershnev Reservoir and drinking water there were detected following toxins produced by cyanobacteria: microcystin-LR, anatoxin-a, saxitoxin, cylindrospermopsin, microcystin, and β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA). The analysis of qualitative and quantitative composition of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins allowed revealing the tendencies of “blooming” processes characteristic for this region, insufficient efficiency to the two-stage purification scheme in relation to: anatoxin-a, cylindrospermopsin, saxitoxin, and microcystin-LR. \r\nLimitation. Lack of domestic standards and test systems with the necessary sensitivity and representativeness to expand the range of determined priority cyanotoxins in water.\r\nConclusion. Regional peculiarities and seasonal patterns of distribution of the consequences of cyanobacterial “blooms” have been revealed. The direction \r\nof further research may be the improvement of wastewater treatment systems and drinking water treatment systems. The obtained results can be used as a basis for development of monitoring system, including identification of priority cyanotoxins and assessment of public health risk.</jats:p>",

This study examines water access and supply-related challenges in selected villages in the Greater Giyani Municipality (GGM), which suffers from severe water shortages due to persistent drought. In 2008, water levels in the Nsami and Middle Letaba Dams dropped below 5% and 6%, respectively. An open-ended questionnaire survey of 638 households was conducted in 2021, and hydroclimatic data were used to achieve the aim of the study. The analysis revealed that the main water supply sources in GGM are boreholes, communal taps, bulk water through in-house connections, and water vendors. The estimated water demand for the selected villages is 3,230,600 L per day, while the total water supply is only 1,796,676 L per day, resulting in a 44.38% deficit. The questionnaire survey identified two key challenges: unreliable municipal water supply and a lack of access to water within 200 m of households. The study recommends prioritizing water management strategies, such as demand management, groundwater development, and supply innovations, to meet domestic water needs. </jats:p>"

The focus of this article is the role of logistics in the structure of exports and imports. The study examines the organisation and management of export and import operations that contribute to economic growth. This is achieved by optimising the allocation of resources and increasing trade efficiency, with an important role in promoting international competitiveness.  \nThe object of study is logistics systems that facilitate international trade. Logistics operations include transport, warehousing, customs procedures and supply chain management. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between logistics infrastructure and the strategic goals of national export and import activities, which emphasises their interdependence in trade. \nA systematic approach to assessing cooperation between logistics elements and their role in the export-import system has made it possible to determine the efficiency of foreign economic activity in the country's economy.\nThe survey results demonstrate the level of development and strategically managed logistics systems that significantly increase the efficiency of export and import activities. They reduce transaction costs and minimise delays in the supply chain. The study identifies risks and threats in the implementation of foreign economic activity. It also examined critical logistics factors, such as the expansion of the range of transport, digitalisation and the use of modern technologies, which enhance the benefits of export and import operations for the national economy.  \nThe study found that the logistics sector is not just a service component of trade, but a strategic driver and engine of economic development. The integration of innovative technologies and infrastructure modernisation are proposed as necessary measures to maintain competitive advantages in global markets. In addition, the study emphasises the importance of political support and international cooperation in harmonising logistics standards and practices to unlock the full potential of export and import activities.\nThe article reveals logistics as a segment of economic growth, emphasising its key role in transforming export and import activities into a powerful factor of national development.\n</jats:p>"

The characteristics of key technologies in the implementation of blockchain in the system of grain supply chains have been defined, such as smart contracts, the Internet of Things (IoT), interplanetary file system (IPFS), contactless tags (RFID), Ethereum platform (identified as the best for supply chain tracking). The influence of factors on the introduction of blockchain technologies into the grain supply chain tracking system was determined using a SWOT analysis. Strengths include transparency, increased trust, automation of processes and protection against falsification. Weaknesses include high implementation costs, difficulty scaling, and the need for staff training. Opportunities that open up through the use of blockchain include attracting new partners, increasing competitiveness, and developing new markets. Threats include legal difficulties, technical failures, high energy costs, and resistance from market participants. An assessment of the investment attractiveness of introducing blockchain technology into the grain supply chain tracking system was carried out by calculating such indicators as economic effect; net present value (NPV) of implementing blockchain technologies; payback period of investments. According to the results of analysis, the following data were obtained: NPV (150439 a.u.)&gt;0, the payback period of investments is 2.8 years, which is acceptable for large agricultural holdings. Prospects for development have been determined, in particular, the unification of agricultural holdings for the joint implementation of blockchain technologies in the tracking system of grain supply chains, which would be a strategically beneficial solution for all participants in the supply chain</jats:p>"

In order to reap the rewards of ethanol, an Ethanol Blending Programme has been initiated. Currently, India intends to begin using gasoline with 20% ethanol by 2025 and to complete the switch by 2030. India has, however, continually fallen short of the blending goal. Moreover, this goal is still unattainable due to a lack of ethanol supply. Therefore, improvement of this scenario requires a precise ethanol demand projection for appropriate policy formulation. Besides, identifying an accurate forecasting model is also necessary to produce accurate demand projection consistently. This study attempts to identify the most suitable model among autoregressive integrated moving average, grey model and long short-term memory (LSTM) and reveals that LSTM model produces forecast more accurately with more consistency. Thus, this model is used for projecting the ethanol demand till 2030. The forecasted demand for ethanol to achieve a 20% mix will be 10 474.81 million litres through 2030. Therefore, India is likely to face continuous ethanol shortages in order to fulfil future blending requirements if the demand–supply imbalance is not mitigated. </jats:p>"

PT XYZ is an export-scale sweet potato-based food processing company. The obstacle the company often faces is the mismatch in the quantity of raw material delivered from suppliers, resulting in delays in production and fulfillment of demand to consumers. For this reason, it is important to measure the performance of the supply chain, so that the company knows the parts of the supply chain that must be improved. Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) is a method for measuring supply chain performance. Before applying the SCOR method, the first step that needs to be done is determining the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) and its weight. This research aims to determine KPI weights using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, at PT XYZ. The AHP method was chosen because of its ability to provide objective weights based on priorities determined by experts. The results showed that there were 6 KPIs at level 1, 19 KPIs at level 2 which were grouped in 6 dimensions, and 50 KPIs at level 3 which were grouped in 19 dimensions. The KPI determination is adjusted to the SCOR dimensions and the real conditions of the company. Furthermore, based on the AHP method analysis, the weight of each KPI is obtained, and the weight comparison between KPIs is known. The implementation of strategies that focus on the KPIs with the highest weights is expected to improve the overall supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

The article presents a mathematical formulation of the problem of finding a compromise solution, which includes an PR model, a CHS model and a generalized desirability criterion. A methodology for selecting energy source equipment for PR in the CHS has been developed, taking into account the interests of the CHS and PR and their ability to produce heat energy. A structure of a multi-agent system is proposed and agent behavior algorithms are developed that take into account the complex behavior of the PR and CHS objects.

The IMs are exposed to different internal and external faults; one of the most popular external faults is unbalanced supply voltages. Unbalanced supply voltage is a popular and worldwide phenomenon that effectively decreases the characteristics of IMs. The present work shows the adverse effect of unbalanced supply voltages on the steady-state characteristics of all NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) designs of 20hp squirrel cage IMs (SCIMs). A symmetrical component is used to determine the performance of each NEMA design operating in different unbalanced supply voltage situations. The importance of this paper is that it likens different NEMA designs regarding torque-speed characteristics, efficiency, power factor, stator currents, rotor currents, torque pulsation, a ripple in rotor speed, and starting-up performances when subjected to over and under-unbalanced supply voltage conditions.

To begin with, it is necessary to know more about the nature of this market since it plays an essential role in the country's economic development and in improving the standard of living of its population. The importance of the real estate industry cannot be overemphasized in the context of China, specifically in terms of the financial structure, urbanization, and social welfare. Hence, evaluating government policies in this regard is crucial to understand further, how and why they work or fail, along with the impact on the growth of cities. Thus, this paper aims to provide an overview and qualitative analysis of the Chinese real estate market's government policies between first- and second-tier cities, focusing on supply and demand. The actual policies include purchase restrictions, availability of land, and monetary policies, and the effects of actual policies are discussed for various tiers of cities. The study establishes that first-tier cities are highly priced and competitive due to high supply and demand, while second-tier cities are variably priced and could be oversupplied. These issues need more profound and local policy suggestions to understand specific heterogeneities of various Chinese urban property markets and strive for the mutual and relatively balanced growth of different city clusters.</jats:p>"

In response, we propose a hybrid method named GDK of global structure model (GSM) with degree centrality (DC) and K-shell decomposition (KS). Our objective is to leverage the proposed method to pinpoint pivotal nodes in supply chain networks, with the aim of enhancing network efficiency and resilience. This research showcases the practical applicability of GDK in solving real-world supply chain challenges. By identifying these key nodes, organizations can proactively allocate resources and manage disruptions more effectively, ultimately improving supply chain performance. In conclusion, this study introduces GDK as a valuable tool for addressing the problem of critical node identification in supply chain data networks.

The overall internal supply chain operation structure of the power company is analyzed. The speed histogram is used to divide the speed field corresponding to the index algorithm in order to measure the node speed domain accurately. The rectangular bounding box of the root node is calculated. The internal health data of the power supply chain is identified. The fuzzy clustering operation is used. The original sample size is obtained. The algorithm data is clustered under the action of the index matrix. Bad data is identified in the supply chain. The overlap threshold and the intra-class compact threshold are initialized. The R-tree dynamic index of the optimal clustering is obtained. Quantity output results are generated, and unhealthy data in the material supply chain is classified. The identification and monitoring of unhealthy data in the supply chain are realized. Experiments show that the proposed method can efficiently monitor the risk factors existing in the material supply chain, and the monitoring of supply chain health risks is consistent with the actual occurrence value, the error is small, the method is feasible and effective, and the robustness is good.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of dual-carbon goals, it is essential to coordinate low-carbon policies and technologies. As a promising approach for clean energy integration, the combined heat–power–hydrogen virtual power plant (CHP-H VPP) effectively consolidates electricity, heat, and hydrogen to meet increasing energy demands and reduce carbon emissions. To this end, this paper proposes an optimal scheduling method for CHP-H VPPs based on a stepped carbon trading mechanism. First, at the low-carbon technology level, a CHP-H VPP architecture is constructed, incorporating thermal power units, hydrogen-doped gas turbines, hydrogen-doped gas boilers, and two-stage power-to-gas (P2G) systems. Second, at the policy level, a stepped carbon trading model is established to constrain system carbon emissions and an optimization model is formulated to minimize operating costs and emissions. Finally, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with linearly decreasing constraints is employed to refine solution accuracy and accelerate convergence by progressively narrowing the search space and guiding the algorithm toward optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model enhances both the economic performance and carbon-reduction capabilities of the system; the simulation results also show that the proposed model effectively improves economic returns by reducing operating costs and enhancing carbon-reduction capacity, with a 7% reduction in run time.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article discusses the main geological structures of the territory of Kharkiv, in particular the northern side of the Dnipro-Donetsk Depression (DDD) and the central graben. It is determined that these elements have different depths of the Precambrian basement: from 1 to 5 km on the side of the depression and from 8 to 16 km in the graben. The northern side of the DDD is composed of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, while the graben contains sedimentary formations of the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic.\nThe peculiarities of the geological and geomorphological structure of the territory of Kharkiv influence the formation of natural groundwater resources. In particular, the interlayering of rocks of different permeability contributes to the formation of interlayer aquifers. The city has a mineral water source “Kharkivska-1” with reserves of 2471 m³/day. The waters of the horizon have a sulfate-hydrocarbonate and hydrocarbonate composition with mineralization from 0.4 to 1.6 g/dm³.\nA promising horizon for artesian water supply is the aquifer in the deposits of the Alb-Cenomanian complex (K1-K2s), which is regionally distributed within the Dnipro-Donetsk artesian basin. The waters of this complex are warm, with a temperature of 20-24°C, and have a sulfate-hydrocarbonate sodium-calcium composition in the central part of Kharkiv and a sodium hydrocarbonate composition on the periphery. Water salinity varies from 0.5 to 0.9 g/dm³.\nThe maximum water withdrawal from the K-K2s complex in Kharkiv was achieved in the early 80s of the last century, which led to the formation of a depression sinkhole about 100 meters deep. Since 1983, due to a decrease in groundwater extraction, the piezometric level has been recovering. Currently, water withdrawal from the K-K2s complex is about 4.2% of the approved reserves.\nBased on the analysis of geological and hydrogeological surveys, it is recommended to use the aquifer in the deposits of the Alb-Cenomanian complex (K-K2s) to organize a reserve water supply for Kharkiv. The locations of the wells are proposed taking into account the conditions of groundwater formation and recharge.</jats:p>",

Typically, SHAPF is controlled by a control method based either on the harmonic voltage of the load or on the supply harmonic current. However, the above two methods have the disadvantage of requiring the control coefficient much be large enough, which easily causes system instability. Therefore, this paper presents a new control method for SHAPF. It is a combined control method of the supply harmonic current and the source harmonic voltage. The advantage of the proposed method is the ability to reduce the total harmonic distortion of the supply current and voltage applied to the load with a control coefficient that is not too large. A fuzzy-proportional integral controller is designed for the proposed control method to reduce the compensation error in steady state under variable load conditions. Mathematical models and simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the total harmonic distortion of the supply current, voltage applied to the load and minimize the compensation error at steady state.</jats:p>"

By constructing a manufacturer-led differential game model, we analyzed the carbon emission transfer strategy of a supply chain under the influence of the reference low-carbon level effect and reciprocal altruistic preferences in scenarios with and without such preferences. The results showed that the reference low-carbon-level effect had a positive influence on the manufacturer’s transfers but not on the supplier’s acceptance of them. Moreover, reciprocal altruistic preferences increased both the transfer and acceptance of emissions while improving the low-carbon level of products. Under the influence of reciprocal preferences, the difference in the degree of altruism will also affect the carbon emission transfer and acceptance behavior of the manufacturer and supplier. When the supplier’s reciprocal altruism coefficient and the consumer’s memory parameter remain within a certain range, the transfers positively affect cooperation in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The peculiarities of functioning of centralized heat supply systems of residential microdistricts at carrying out works on ‘insulation’ of buildings in operation, namely, parameters of operation of hot water supply heating units are considered. The influence of the heating load reduction due to the works on increasing the heat transfer resistance of the building structures on the flow rate of network water and heat exchange area of hot water supply heaters has been analyzed. Estimates are made for conditions of use of one-stage parallel scheme connection for heat exchangers to heat distribution networks. The known relations for such most widespread in heat supply systems heat exchangers as plate apparatuses are used at calculations of a heat transfer surface. The range of change of the heat transfer surface of hot water heaters and the flow rate of network water depending on the ratio of the maximum heat loads of hot water supply and heating and the degree of insulation efficiency of the building is determined.\r\nFormulas for determining the parameters of hot water supply heat exchangers are proposed. The formulas are valid in the range of reduction of heat consumption for heating of the building from 0 to 35 %. Assessment of the heating load reduction is performed on condition that the thermal modernization of a building constructed in accordance with the building requirements in force several decades ago provides modern requirements for the thermal resistance of building structures. The temperature of water in the heating system of the insulated building is determined depending on the building insulation efficiency, provided that the water flow rate through the heating system of the building before and after its insulation is unchanged. The range of variation of the ratio of hot water supply and heating heat loads accepted for consideration is 0,6–1,2.\r\nThe obtained results can be used at comparison of connection schemes of heat exchangers for hot water heating for installation on individual heat points of insulated buildings.\r\n</jats:p>"

It examined how both companies have responded to highly publicized disruptions in their supply chains, compromising customer satisfaction. Complaints against Walmart were classified as: 1) Profiling (allegations of theft, race-based refusal of services, locking up items); 2) Damaged goods; 3) Billing issues; 4) Delivery problems / Missing goods; 5) Communication barriers due to delayed, inconsistent, or incoherent messages; and 6) Employee complaints. Walmart's typical response was an apology, a courtesy gift card, or a settlement. In the case of Boeing, investigations unveiled deception in business practices which resulted in inaccurate information being shared with regulating agencies as well as poor coordination of repair efforts, lack of documentation, ineffective communication, and neglect. Boeing's problems led to catastrophic failures for which Boeing has paid billions of dollars in damages. Strict monitoring will help ensure compliance with safety standards.</jats:p>",

Integrating sustainability into market strategies allows businesses to attract environmentally conscious consumers, differentiate in a competitive market, and contribute to a sustainable future. This paper examines the Thai rice supply chain using Fairtrade as a voluntary sustainability standard, exploring consumer awareness, factors influencing sustainable market practices, and market readiness for sustainable products in the Global South. Based on the research project conducted in Thailand by engaging university students by Fairtrade International, it uses desk and field methods to assess the Thai rice supply chain, Thai rice market, and Thai customers. The study is indicative of the market readiness for sustainable products and recommends that state policies are synonymous with established private sustainable standards to strengthen domestic sustainable market ecosystem.</jats:p>"

The model incorporates dynamic market dynamics, mass balance, and endogenous dynamic market prices based on supply and demand dynamics. The results suggest that there will be germanium scarcity in the near future, and a price increase is predicted. Future demand for germanium for the photovoltaic technologies can only partially be met. The total global extractable potential for germanium was estimated to be about 342,000 tons in 2022 from a geological presence of about 5.5 million tons. The major obstacle for germanium supply is the opportunity for extraction from mother metals, the availability of the required infrastructure, and low extraction yields. Germanium is extracted as a secondary metal from zinc and fly-ash today, but potential new sources are lead, copper, nickel refining residuals, and Bayer liquid from bauxite processing. The maximum germanium production rate was estimated to be about 1250 ton/year. The actual 2023 global extraction rate is about 210 ton/year. With respect to supply sustainability, germanium may suffer from a scarcity of supply and limit the application of key technologies in the future. The supply per person peaks in 2053 and declines to 2020 level by 2200. A doubling of demand above business-as-usual would imply germanium shortages in the market. The recycling rate for germanium is far too low for a circular society, and the supply situation may be significantly improved if the recycling rate can be increased substantially. The implications for the EU imaginaries indicate that four policy pathway approaches would be necessary to address the scarcity of germanium: regulation and innovation, investment in local solutions, market-driven adaptations, and community engagement/conservation.</jats:p>",

However, SM and VPD are strongly coupled through multiple physical processes, confounding their effects on ET. Here, we decouple the interaction between SM and VPD and then analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of their individual effects on ET based on multiple observation‐based data sets. The results show that ET is limited by SM rather than VPD in approximately 63% of global land areas (60°S–60°N), defined as water supply‐limited regions. From 1982 to 2014, the effect of SM on ET enhances significantly in 43% of the water supply‐limited regions. The trends can be attributed to changes in SM and VPD themselves as well as to changes in vegetation conditions. Using the findings from the observation‐based data sets as the benchmark, we show that Earth System Models (ESMs) can overall reproduce the spatial pattern of SM and VPD effects on ET but fail to capture their temporal trends. Our results highlight that the water supply and demand control on ET varies with changing environments, which should be explicitly considered when analyzing the terrestrial water cycle and land‐atmosphere interaction.</jats:p>",

However, challenges such as declining crude oil storage capacity due to tank damage and limited space threaten the continuity of refinery operations and the stability of national energy supply. This study aims to address this issue by implementing the compact solution method to enhance crude oil stock availability and secure the national fuel supply. Using a quantitative approach with descriptive methods, the research collected data through observation, document review, and literature study. The data were analyzed qualitatively to assess the impact of the compact solution method. The results indicate a significant improvement in crude oil stock availability, which increased from 60.14% (using the off-stream repair method) to 72.9%. Additionally, the tank level was successfully increased to a maximum of 13,990 mm, adhering to API 650 or API 579 FFS Level 3 standards. This improvement extends the operational lifespan of the tank to 62 years, reducing maintenance costs and ensuring uninterrupted refinery operations. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the compact solution method in addressing crude oil tank capacity issues and securing national energy resilience. These results provide valuable insights for energy sector stakeholders in optimizing crude oil storage and refinery operations while minimizing repair costs and downtime.</jats:p>"

Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from seven countries, the authors conclude that most unmet need can be attributed to demand‐side reasons for non‐use. I replicate the analysis and find errors in the authors’ calculations. When corrected, the relative differences between demand‐side and supply‐side reasons are smaller, and the proportion of women reporting supply‐side reasons is larger than demand‐side reasons in two countries. In addition, the approach does not account for endogeneity between supply and demand, which cannot be disentangled using cross‐sectional data like the DHS. Using longitudinal data, I find that more than four out of five women with “demand‐side unmet need” use contraception after receiving an intervention that reduced supply‐side barriers. I discuss the extent of inference gained by these indicators for informing programs, noting that women's true reasons for non‐use may be poorly proxied with cross‐sectional data, and prioritizing resources based on these reasons would fail to reach a nontrivial proportion of non‐users who would have preferred to contracept if access were improved.</jats:p>",

It is inevitable to consider random uncertainty based on fuzzy scenarios and cognitive uncertainty to model a Sustainable Closed-Loop SC (SCLSC) problem. Using Pentagonal Fuzzy Numbers (PFNs) has higher comprehensiveness and accuracy than triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers due to taking into account higher uncertainty, less lack of information, and taking into account maximum subjectivity Decision-Makers (DMs). There is a gap in the literature regarding the use of PFNs in SCLSC problems. This research presents a new model using PFNs to solve deficiencies in stochastic-possibilistic programming. Developing a Robust Stochastic-Possibilistic (RSP) based on PFNs under fuzzy scenarios, presenting measures of necessity, possibility, and credibility for making decisions founded on different levels of DMs’ risk, and proposing global solutions through providing linear programming models are the main innovations and contributions of the present research. An actual case study evaluates the presented approach to reduce the cost and carbon pollution in the stone paper SC. In the suggested method, trade-offs could be formed between the mean of objective functions and risk by modifying the robustness coefficients. According to the proposed approach, an optimal value of confidence is specified. Additionally, robustness deviations are controlled in the model, which results in more accurate and reliable results.

We focus on heterogeneity in the industries that create demand for trucking services: state‐level natural resource extraction, warehousing, and container port activity. We create a state‐level archival data set of truck transportation establishment payrolls from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which we combine with other archival sources. We test our hypotheses via discontinuous growth curve models estimated using the mixed effects modeling framework. We find states that saw greater declines in natural resource extraction activity had much slower growth in trucking payrolls for May 2020–December 2021, whereas states that saw more warehousing activity growth or were home to large container ports saw faster growth in trucking payrolls.

These technologies, already transforming broader industries, offer promising opportunities for optimizing operations in critical humanitarian and healthcare settings. Objective: This article explores the key levers that influence the adoption of emerging technologies within the HHSC and examines the broader implications for stakeholders. It aims to provide an understanding of how these technologies can be integrated to enhance supply chain performance and operations. Approach: A narrative review of the literature was conducted, drawing on a range of studies published between 2010 and 2020. The analysis employed a thematic approach, focusing on identifying key patterns and trends in the adoption of emerging technologies. Key themes related to technology adoption drivers, operational impacts, and stakeholder implications were synthesized and discussed in relation to the broader HHSC context. Key Findings: The thematic analysis revealed several important levers influencing the adoption of emerging technologies, including factors such as technological readiness, organizational capacity, and stakeholder collaboration. The findings highlight the importance of understanding these levers in combination, rather than in isolation, to effectively leverage technological innovations in HHSC. Conclusions: This article provides valuable insights for both practitioners and researchers. For organizations, it emphasizes the importance of focusing on integrated lever combinations to maximize the benefits of emerging technologies. For scholars, it offers a foundation for further research into the complex relationships between these factors and their implications for supply chain optimization. The findings contribute to a better understanding of how these technologies can be successfully adopted within the HHSC and lay the groundwork for future exploration in this area.\n\nKeywords: Supply chain digital tools, Health, Humanitarian, Supply chains, Supply chain automation, Systematic review, Blockchain, Big data, Artificial intelligence, Digital health, Drones, Robotics</jats:p>",

The actual milk demand data came from the company and two forecasting models, ARIMA and RNN-LSTM, have been deployed using Python Jupyter notebook and compared them in terms of various precision measures. VRPTW established not only the optimal routes for a fleet of six vehicles but also tactical scheduling which contributes to a streamlined and agile raw milk collection process, ensuring a harmonious and resource-efficient operation. The proposed approach succeeded on dropping about 16% of total travel time and capable of making predictions with approximately 2% increased accuracy than before.</jats:p>"

However, significant fluctuations in the output voltage of power batteries and abrupt changes in the input voltage of DC–DC converters pose major challenges to their safety and reliability, thereby impeding sustainable development. This paper proposes a frequency‐prediction‐based topology morphing control strategy (FPTMC) for a dual resonant cavity LLC (DR‐LLC) converter. The strategy aims to accommodate a wide range of input voltages while enhancing the reliability of the vehicle's power supply. Firstly, the topology of the DR‐LLC converter is introduced, utilizing a fundamental wave analysis method for modelling purposes. This analysis results in three distinct voltage gain models corresponding to various topology modes, thereby enabling the converter to manage a wide spectrum of input voltages. Then, a geometrically simplified state plane analysis is employed to derive switching frequency models for the three topology modes, facilitating real‐time prediction of the necessary switching frequency during topology transitions. The proposed control strategy, which relies on frequency prediction, effectively mitigates the problem of voltage spikes during these transitions. Finally, both simulation and experimental results validate the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed wide input voltage control strategy for DR‐LLC converters in vehicle power supply systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the increasing concerns regarding meeting the world’s future food demand, there is still a substantial quantity of food loss and waste (FLW), particularly concerning fruits and vegetables. In the case of Kermanshah province, inefficiencies within the leafy vegetable supply chpain (LVSC) contribute to an alarming annual waste of 39% of leafy vegetables. Although several studies have proposed strategies and recommendations for mitigating this waste, the actual impact of these interventions on reducing FLW has not been thoroughly examined or quantified. Using System Dynamic Modeling, this study offers a novel approach to quantify the impact of interventions on waste reduction. The quantification results reveal four key interventions reducing vegetable waste at the production stage: biotic (31.2%) and abiotic stress control (14.4%), improved educational services (23.2%), and access to quality inputs (15.2%). Furthermore, the results suggest that early-stage factors in the LVSC play a crucial role in determining waste accumulation in later stages. Improvements in packaging facilities and cold supply chain infrastructure, along with better coordination and information sharing among stakeholders at the market stage, significantly help reduce waste. Additionally, effective planning for household food shopping is emphasized as a crucial strategy for minimizing waste at the consumption stage. This holistic approach focuses on the interconnectedness of actions across various stages of the supply chain and their combined effect on decreasing the overall waste of leafy vegetables.</jats:p>"

Based on major e-commerce platforms in China, combined with an extended technology acceptance model, this study examines the factors affecting low-carbon supply chain adoption by agricultural product consumers on e-commerce platforms. The results showed that consumers’ perceived risk, perceived usefulness, and adoption attitude all influence their adoption behavior, with the effect of adoption attitude being the greatest. Furthermore, the effect of perceived usefulness on adoption attitude is stronger than that of perceived risk. Moreover, perceived usefulness is affected mainly by the perceived price, technical utility, green behavior tendency, and subjective norms, whereas the perceived risk is affected mainly by technical utility, information display and dissemination, and green behavior tendency. This study provides valuable insights for e-commerce platforms to better understand the needs of agricultural product consumers, improve market competitiveness, and enhance consumers’ awareness and willingness of adopting low-carbon approaches, which can promote the low-carbon sustainable development of agricultural product supply chains.</jats:p>"

Further, the agriculture sector contributes to greenhouse gas emissions that lead to climate change. The sector requires substantial investments in climate-smart practices and technologies to address these challenges. However, it has traditionally been underserved by the financial system, so farmers and other stakeholders don't have access to the financing to follow climate-smart agriculture practices. This chapter identifies financing challenges in following CSA practices and explores critical role innovative financial mechanisms can play in alleviating these challenges. This includes development of tailored financial products, use of risk-sharing instruments, and promotion of public-private partnerships. It highlights importance of capacity building of FIs and farmers to design and implement climate-smart interventions and develop robust metrics to measure impacts of these investments.</jats:p>",

To mitigate <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> risks on‐farm and along the supply chain, egg producers have adopted various quality assurance, animal husbandry, and biosecurity practices recommended by organizations such as Australian eggs, the European Commission, and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). However, egg storage requirements vary significantly worldwide. In Australia, most states follow the Food Standards Australia New Zealand, but discrepancies exist. In the United States, the USDA mandates refrigeration of eggs below 7.2°C to prevent <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> growth, whereas the European Union requires that eggs must not be refrigerated to avoid condensation, which may promote bacterial growth. Refrigeration of eggs is associated with reduced <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> growth and decreased infection risk. Yet, conflicting data regarding the impact of storage temperatures on <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> survival may contribute to the disparity between international recommendations for egg storage. Studies indicated better <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> survival in egg contents at 5°C due to higher expression levels of survival and stress response‐related genes compared to 25°C, yet this may not lead to an increased risk or higher severity of <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> infection. Evidence suggests that storing eggs at less than 7°C will influence the virulence of bacteria. Warmer storage temperatures may lead to increased potential of <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> multiplication in the nutrient‐rich yolk and may cause the expression of certain virulence genes.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper provides a systematic literature review of hospital supply chain management (SCM), emphasizing variations across hospital types, methodological frameworks, the SCOR model, and technological advancements. Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology, the study systematically identifies, screens, and synthesizes relevant research to ensure comprehensive and high-quality data. The article selection process was done through a multiple screening procedure by four researchers, who collaboratively assessed data quality and relevance to the research topic. Individual researchers then further evaluated each identified article to avoid bias and ensure objectivity in the selection process. It highlights unique SCM challenges public and private hospitals face, particularly in resource allocation and technology adoption. Constrained by budget limitations, public hospitals often depend on collaborations and streamlined processes to ensure essential supplies. In contrast, private hospitals leverage technological tools such as AI, IoT, and blockchain for real-time data analysis and efficiency gains. Key SCM methodologies reviewed include Deep Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making frameworks, and simulation modeling, each offering diverse benefits in cost management, inventory control, and decision support. The SCOR framework’s applicability to hospitals is also discussed, emphasizing areas for process optimization and patient care improvements. The study concludes with insights into strategic SCM practices that support operational resilience, efficiency, and patient outcomes across hospital types, urging future research on scalable, technology-driven SCM solutions for healthcare institutions.</jats:p>"

This community service program is designed with a participatory approach, education, and application of appropriate technology. The methods used include surveys, farmer training, implementation of technology to increase livestock productivity, use of biodigesters, and strengthening farmer institutions. The evaluation results showed a significant increase in farmer knowledge and skills, with an average post-test score increasing by 40% compared to the pre-test. The adoption of appropriate technology, such as feed biofermentation, and biodigesters, has succeeded in reducing production costs by 30%. Livestock productivity increased with production, while duck mortality rates decreased from 15% to 5%. Strengthening farmer institutions through the formation of farmer groups also increases the organizational capacity and bargaining power of farmers, including in accessing government financing and support. This program not only has a positive impact on farmer welfare but also contributes to meeting the community's animal protein needs and better environmental management. The sustainability of this program is expected to be achieved through supervision and synergy between the government, academics, and the private sector. This holistic approach shows great potential for replication in other areas with similar conditions.</jats:p>"

APL analysis is a pivotal method in Industrial Engineering, offering quantitative insights into the strength, complexity, and extent of cross-industry interconnections. This approach provides a robust framework for understanding manufacturing systems and the intricate relationships that drive sectoral interactions in production chains. Findings reveal that in the UK, the construction industry maintains significant connections with electricity transmission and distribution, gas distribution, and steam and air conditioning distribution. These connections highlight the construction sector’s role as a critical node in the broader industrial network. Geographical distinctions in supply chain dynamics were observed: while inter-industry linkages span two steps in the UK overall, they reduce to a single step in Northern Ireland and Scotland due to their simpler economic structures. The complexity of the UK’s economy facilitates diverse pathways between sectors, resulting in the emergence of intermediate steps during inter-industry transitions. The study emphasizes that industrial linkages across the UK are robust and interconnected, with the service sector forming the core of the industrial supply chain. By driving outward expansion and providing key inputs to industries such as construction and utilities, the service sector underscores the critical role of cross-sectoral integration in enhancing supply chain efficiency and resilience. These findings contribute to the field of Industrial Engineering by providing a comprehensive understanding of regional supply chain dynamics, offering insights into optimizing industrial frameworks and fostering sustainable economic development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the growing season, cultivated plants are subject to bifurcation effects such as drought, frost, ice, hail, heavy rains, etc. The dependence of mankind on the weather is quite large. The purpose of this work is to study artificial bifurcation by heat supply of plants in laboratory conditions. The thermophysical characteristics of the interaction of the plant-soil-air system are due to radiation heat exchange, which includes the arrival of long-wave radiation from the atmosphere - plants and reflected radiation from plants into the atmosphere; the arrival of short-wave radiation from solar radiation used by plant leaves for photosynthesis and reflection of part of this photoactive radiation; turbulent heat exchange of the soil surface with the surrounding surface air; transpiration heat exchange of the soil surface with the surrounding surface air; heat exchange in the soil. In addition, solar radiation reaching the slope surface has a different scattering effect on the functioning of the plant-soil-air system. Note that the vegetation cover performs the function of thermal insulation between the atmosphere and the soil. The analytical determination of the heat supply of plants is quite difficult, especially on slopes of different steepness and exposure, due to both the insufficiency of the data included in these analytical expressions, as well as the uncertainty (impossibility) of determining experimentally appropriate coefficients. Therefore, the technique of the bifurcation approach allows, as a first approximation, to design certain technologies for cultivating crops for a specific catchment area, both in terms of frost resistance, and to apply measures to protect against frost. The stability of plant seedlings to frost was checked in laboratory conditions: sowing and germination of barley seeds under the same conditions (according to ambient temperature and soil moisture) for seven days; placing in a refrigerator at -18°C; extraction from the refrigerator at intervals of 5 minutes, maximum duration of 50 minutes; visual monitoring of the condition of plants. Experimental studies have shown that the death of a plant from frost is described by the regression equation y = 0,0268x2 – 0,3701x + 17,232. As a result of the research, a bifurcation function has been proposed, confirmed by laboratory experiments.</jats:p>",

This paper conducts the supply chain using a landing craft tank (LCT) ship as the LNG carrier, equipped with a specific principal dimension, and an ISO tank as the LNG storage facility. The use of LCT has the advantage of being able to sail in coastal areas and can be converted using existing ships. This comprehensive techno-economic assessment consists of calculating the LNG demands for the BMPP, the arrangement of ISO containerized tank stacking in the LCT, and identifying the LNG terminal facilities. Moreover, the research points for a future LNG economy are highlighted; cost-effective production and utilization solutions for enhancing the feasibility of LNG. The Landing Craft Tank (LCT), a vessel with a load capacity of 32 container tanks (20 ft) and a volume of 20.38 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, distributes LNG to BMPP Sambelia. The economic analysis of LNG distribution patterns from Benoa LNG Terminal to BMPP 30 MW Sambelia, using LCT ships with FSRU (Floating Storage and Regasification Unit) receiver terminals, reveals that at a margin of $2.2, the most optimal option has an IRR of 11.6%, a payback period of 5.7, and an ROI of 17.41%.</jats:p>",

Based on the challenges of data integrity, fraud prevention, and reduction of intermediaries, the study assesses the transformational role of blockchain in financial institutions.\nResearch Methodology: A mixed-methods approach was taken, where quantitative data from the surveys of 150 financial executives across different types of organizations were combined with qualitative insights from expert interviews. Such statistical analysis, complemented by thematic interpretation, could enable an integrated assessment of blockchain applications and related challenges in the financial sector.\nResults: The results reveal that blockchain significantly enhances the transparency and security of transactions, hence reducing fraud and manipulation of data. The respondents were very optimistic about the cost reductions due to the elimination of intermediaries. Yet, these are counterbalanced by barriers to wide diffusion, such as scalability issues, regulatory uncertainties, and technical integration complexities that reduce the full potential of blockchain.\nLimitations: The limitations of the study are the small sample size, which limits the generalization of findings. Further research with larger and more diverse samples is needed to investigate more comprehensively the impact of blockchain on the financial sectors.\nContributions: The research, therefore, contributes to discourses on blockchain as a transformative finance technology, giving insights into useful strategic, policy, and technology issues.\nNovelty: It also presented both opportunities and challenges in view of realizing blockchain's role in digitizing financial ecosystems.</jats:p>"

(2) After the HSR opened, real earnings management (REM) significantly reduced, especially overproduction and abnormal cash flow manipulation. (3) HSR reduced REM by promoting supply chain performance. (4) With a reduction in REM, HSR improved stock pricing efficiency, which is reflected in the reduction of stock price synchronisation and crash risk.

This phenomenon is particularly accentuated by a high demographic growth rate, which increases the pressure on infrastructure and basic services, especially drinking water supply, due to the increasing needs of households. The main objective of this study is to analyse the contribution of the WEAP model to the management of drinking water supply in the different sectors of the city of Guelma. This approach aims to ensure effective and sustainable planning of water resources to meet the growing needs of the population in each sector, while preserving this essential resource. The results show that water resources are limited, with projected consumption increasing from 6 million m³ in 2008 to around 47 million m³ in 2050, while the population is expected to reach almost 800,000 inhabitants. All scenarios show a water deficit, where demand exceeds supply. The study therefore emphasises the need for integrated water resource management to ensure sustainability. It uses hydrological and demographic data to guide supply decisions and aims to develop effective strategies to address the growing water challenges in the city of Guelma.</jats:p>"

It is used in several by-products such as citrus pudding, citrus fritters, and citrus bread. With more and more people paying attention to food safety issues, attention to the safe and stable source of citrus is becoming more important. Problems in this supply chain including those that result in reduced revenue for the farmers and the government, and major losses during off-season arise primarily from lack of trust, dependability, openness, accountability, origin, and safety. To address these difficulties, we present a secure and transparent framework using Blockchain technology to monitor citrus crops from the farm to the consumer’s table. We propose a new cryptocurrency token named citrus coin (CC) which will be used in the process of purchasing investors in the citrus n value chain. This system includes an elaborate demonstration, a CC cryptocurrency wallet, and an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The functioning of the framework is based on smart contracts to manage the transactions which are traceable and transparent through the entire citrus crop supply chain while the CC can be converted into traditional fiat money. Also, we use the decentralized storage system (InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)) to store information about corporations and sellers to improve security, transparency, and access to data. Furthermore, our experimentation and analysis, demonstrate that the proposed framework provides better results compared to the existing solutions for the supply chain in terms of contract verification time, regular gas transaction efficiency, and block generation latency.</jats:p>"

Conventional cleaning techniques, such as backwashing and chemical cleaning, are frequently inadequate in effectively dealing with various types of fouling and can result in the gradual deterioration of the membrane. Advanced technologies such as ozone treatment and advanced oxidation processes present interesting answers, but they necessitate meticulous optimisation and can incur significant costs. It is crucial to develop membrane materials that are resistant to fouling and to create monitoring and control systems that operate in real-time in order to enhance fouling management. It is essential to overcome these problems in order to improve the performance, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of membrane-based water treatment systems used in the production of drinking water. This paper overviews the role of ozonation when it is coupled with membrane process. In general, ozonation as pretreatment and/or post treatment and its mechanism in fouling mitigation, investigation of elimination mechanism of natural organic matter (NOM) and bio-toxicity in the ozonation process, and the prospect of ozonation to be used in fouling mitigation of membrane process for potable water reuse.</jats:p>",

Organizations are compelled to integrate sustainable practices into their supply chains to navigate the complexities of the post-COVID-19 era and mitigate the far-reaching consequences of such disruptions. However, exploring supply chain imperatives from sustainability dimensions still remains underexplored, presenting a significant research gap, particularly in the fashion retail sector. In response, this study aims to pioneer an innovative approach by amalgamating Pareto analysis, Bayes theorem, and the Best-Worst Method to evaluate sustainability imperatives comprehensively. Focusing on emerging economies like Bangladesh and its fashion retail industry, this methodology synthesizes insights from literature reviews, expert feedback, and Pareto analysis to curate a definitive set of influential imperatives. Finally, the Bayesian Best-Worst Method is applied to examine them. The results reveal the availability of government support schemes to promote sustainability, developing strategic supply chain interventions to ameliorate the impact of disruptive events, and digitalizing the supply chain as the most monumental imperatives under economic, social, and environmental perspectives, respectively. The study’s innovative methodology and its implications for sustainable supply chain management offer valuable insights for both academic research and practical application, presenting a strategic blueprint for the fashion retail industry to navigate and thrive in the post-COVID-19 era. This work can not only advance the theoretical understanding of supply chain sustainability but also provide actionable guidance for industry leaders in developing robust, resilient, and sustainable supply chain strategies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nickel is an important key resource and plays an increasingly important role in new energy technologies. The stability of its worldwide supply chain is crucial for addressing country risks and unforeseen events. To explore the impact of country risks on the stability of the global nickel supply chain, this study conducts a complex network analysis and panel regression analysis on nickel ore, ferro-nickel, and the stainless-steel trade data from 2000 to 2022. The study reveals the mechanisms by which economic and political risks affect the trade structure of nickel commodities and identifies the drivers of global nickel supply chain patterns. The study finds that an increase in economic risk promotes diversification of supply sources, while political risk hurts export scale and resource control ability. Industrial structure adjustments and R&amp;amp;D investments have a significant impact on trade structure, especially on the stainless-steel trade. China is a major consumer and importer, and occupies a central position in the global nickel trade network, while Indonesia and the Philippines’ policy changes have a significant impact on the market. This study provides an empirical basis for the risk management of the global nickel supply chain and a scientific basis for policy formulation and strategic planning.</jats:p>"

The results indicate that supply chain digitalization significantly enhances corporate ESG performance, this conclusion remains valid after various robustness tests. Mechanism analysis shows that supply chain digitalization improves corporate ESG performance by enhancing internal operational efficiency, increasing interfirm trade credit, and enhancing external supervision. Finally, the promotion effect of supply chain digitalization on ESG performance is mainly present in corporates with stronger cooperative culture, stronger innovation capabilities, party organization, and those operating in heavily polluting industries.</jats:p>",

Artificial intelligence (AI) has proven to be a transformative force in addressing the challenges of logistics and supply chain management, offering innovative solutions for forecasting, decision-making, and operational efficiency. This research explores how AI-driven approaches can solve specific supply chain challenges, including demand variability, disruption management, inventory optimization, transportation inefficiencies, and supplier relationship management. The review proposes a comprehensive analysis of AI technologies such as predictive analytics, real-time monitoring systems, optimization algorithms, and autonomous systems, highlighting their contributions to enhancing supply chain resilience. By leveraging AI, organizations can improve their ability to predict disruptions, optimize resource allocation, and respond dynamically to real-time challenges. The research incorporates case studies and real-world applications to illustrate successful implementations of AI in logistics, as well as lessons learned from failed attempts. Additionally, the review examines the benefits of integrating AI into supply chain operations, such as improved risk management, enhanced decision-making, and increased adaptability to uncertainties. However, it also addresses the challenges of AI adoption, including high implementation costs, data privacy concerns, and organizational resistance to change. By presenting actionable insights and recommendations, this research aims to provide a roadmap for organizations seeking to harness AI to strengthen their supply chain resilience. The findings underscore the transformative potential of AI technologies in fostering robust, adaptive, and efficient supply chain systems capable of withstanding future uncertainties and disruptions.\r\nKeywords:  Supply Chain, Artificial Intelligence, Logistics Management, Review.</jats:p>"

The study model was validated using primary data from the field survey of 261 metropolitan, municipal, and district assemblies (MMDAs) through questionnaires. The informants included executive management members of MMDAs and citizen representatives who are assembly members.\r\nResults: Using the Smart PLS-SEM analytical tool, a significant finding was that perceived value positively and significantly moderates and mediates the relationship between citizen participation (CP) and value for money (VfM). The study provides theoretical contributions to the theory of citizen participation (TCP) literature and managerial contributions to direct public officials and local community development partners to understand the roles of citizens who perceive value to achieve value for money in project procurement.\r\nConclusion: Empirical evidence demonstrates that perceived value has a moderate positive and significant influence on the relationship between citizen participation and value for money.\r\nRecommendation: Citizens should be involved in local government decisions regarding project procurement if value for money is to be achieved.</jats:p>"

Despite this growth, the last stage of delivery, known as the last mile, continues to pose challenges in terms of cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency. In this manuscript, the potential of autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) as a viable solution to these challenges is deeply explored. ADVs have the capability to significantly reduce labor costs, improve overall delivery efficiency, and play a role in decreasing carbon emissions. However, it is crucial to recognize the potential risks that ADVs may encounter, including concerns related to technological reliability, security, and regulatory obstacles. Successfully implementing ADVs will necessitate effective risk management and mitigation strategies. The objective of this research is to investigate the potential for ADV last-mile delivery while minimizing associated risks. In addition to discussing the current state of ADVs, this study underscores the necessity for innovative risk mitigation solutions to optimize last-mile delivery and particularly emphasizes the crucial role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the realm of route optimization and operational efficiency enhancement.\n \nReceived: 14 August 2024 | Revised: 24 September 2024 | Accepted: 10 November 2024\n \nConflicts of Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.\n \nData Availability Statement\nData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.\n \nAuthor Contribution Statement\nJames E.

Food Loss and Waste of potatoes tends to be high, while food loss and waste mapping along the potato supply chain in Indonesia are not yet available. This study aims to identify the research gap of food loss and waste in potato supply chain, to determine the future research position, and to develop the future research framework. Systematic literature review was conducted to identify the research gap. At first, bibliometric analysis was conducted using Harzing’s Publish or Perish and VOSviewer software to produce the network visualization of research keywords to identify the gaps. Secondly, the most frequent keywords were used as the basis to review the relevant previous studies to determine the future research position. “Sustainability” is the main keyword that appears which has a close relationship with “food supply chain”, “supply chain management”, and “food industry”, while “potato” is not the most frequent keyword. The gap identified is the absence of keywords related to “soft system dynamics”, “food loss”, “food waste”, “food loss and waste”, and “life cycle assessment” which could be a potential novelty. To connect the dots of previous studies and produce a novelty, the future research will be positioned around the topic of sustainable potato supply chain modelling to reduce food loss and waste.</jats:p>",

The present study attempted to determine the microbiological quality and detection of pathogenic bacteria in different municipal water supplied in the different places of Dhaka city. This study involved the microbiological analysis of sixteen drinking water samples collected from diverse sources, including four from supply points, six from consumer points, and six treated water samples, obtained from Siddeswari, Sonargaon, Mirpur, and Badda. All the samples were contaminated with different microorganisms, and the total viable bacterial count ranged from 103 to 10⁷ CFU/mL. Pathogenic microbes like Pseudomonas spp. was present in all the samples, while Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus spp. were predominantly present in seven, six, and eleven samples, respectively. We also aimed to determine whether Shigella spp. was present in all the samples, but it was completely absent. Escherichia coli was detected in samples from both supply and consumer points within the range of 102 to 103 cfu/mL. The results indicate that the treatment procedure is not sufficiently effective in eliminating all pathogenic bacteria, and unhygienic environments contribute to post-treatment contamination. The study revealed that government should take necessary action to ensure public health safety, particularly with regard to access to safe drinking water.\r\nStam. J.

To address the issue of PSC quantification, this paper presents a PSC evaluation method of active distribution networks while considering demand response (DR). Firstly, an incentive-based DR model is introduced, followed by the development of a PSC evaluation model that incorporates DR. This model completely describes the PSC of active distribution networks while considering N-1 security constraints. Secondly, a PSC evaluation algorithm based on uniform state-space sampling is presented, enabling the quantification of the complete PSC of active distribution networks with DR. Then, the influence of the load reduction coefficient in DR on the PSC is studied. It is found that the maximum PSC increases with the load reduction coefficient initially and then stabilizes. Furthermore, measures such as appropriately increasing the load reduction coefficient and expanding the bottleneck component capacity are proposed to enhance the PSC. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed PSC evaluation method is verified by two active distribution networks, CASE1 and CASE2. The proposed method visualizes the complete PSC of active distribution networks considering DR as a curve and quantifies it as an interval value. For CASE1, the complete PSC is quantified within the range of [4.0, 8.4] MVA, and for CASE2, it is quantified within the range of [17.0, 33.0] MVA. The proposed measures effectively enhance the PSC, facilitating the efficient, safe, and low-carbon operation of smart distribution networks.</jats:p>"

The t-statistics of the GSCPI on air cargo, integrated logistics, and pipeline companies were below the threshold of 1.291, corresponding to a 90% confidence level, which indicates that these results were not statistically significant. Therefore, logistics companies should prioritize the development of resilient and sustainable supply chain strategies incorporating alternative energy sources, such as liquefied hydrogen, ammonia, green methanol, and liquefied natural gas, to enhance their ability to respond to unexpected situations. Second, contrary to other logistics sectors, shipping enterprises have been positively impacted by the GSCPI, suggesting that they may find new opportunities during periods of global instability. By adopting eco-friendly fuel alternatives and green technologies, shipping companies can capitalize on these opportunities and contribute to the global transition toward sustainable logistics practices. These findings suggest that global logistics companies, including pipeline, air cargo, and integrated logistics companies, should develop resilient global supply chain management strategies that incorporate supply chain platforms, nearshoring, and import diversification. This study offers important implications for entrepreneurs and policymakers, emphasizing the role of sustainable energy solutions in stabilizing global supply chains.</jats:p>"

However, the impact of digitalisation on the SDGs is complex and multifaceted, and the role of SSCs in mediating this relationship is not fully understood. While extant research has delved into the influence of digitalisation on SSCs, predominantly within specific industries or geographic regions, a research gap persists concerning large-N samples and the generalisability of results.\nPurpose of the article: This study evaluates the role of digitalisation in achieving SDGs along with the mediation of SSCs based on the resource-based view, the triple-bottom-line, and dynamic capabilities theories.\nMethods: The study has extracted panel data from Eurostat from 2013 to 2022 and evaluated these data through partial least squares structural equation modelling to estimate the association among constructs. The sample covers the EU–27 countries and consists of 270 observations. Digitalisation is operationalised as the use of digital technologies to, for instance, innovate business models, provide new revenue streams and value-producing opportunities, and enhance, streamline, and make supply chain processes more efficient and environmentally sustainable. SSC practices encompass the design, planning, execution, and monitoring of supply chain activities to create value, optimise resources, and minimise environmental impact.\nFindings &amp; value-added: The findings indicate that digitalisation has a positive association with SDGs and SSC practices. The study also noted that SSC initiatives play a mediating role between digitalisation and SDGs among the EU economies. These interesting insights could direct policymakers to enforce the initiative of digitalisation in SSCs to boost SDGs in EU economies. Although the literature on digitalisation and SSCs has gained significant attention, this is the first study in these domains.</jats:p>"

To cover the seller's ordering and logistics costs, two distinct mixed financing schemes are considered to address the funding needs: (i) equity financing and bank credit financing (EBF) and (ii) equity financing and 3PL firm financing (ELF). We examine how the equity financing ratio influences equilibrium outcomes and derive the financing preference for each member. The results reveal that a large equity financing ratio prompts the seller to buy more. Interestingly, the seller's profit under EBF either monotonically decreases or exhibits a concave relationship with respect to the equity financing ratio. By contrast, the seller's profit under ELF is consistently concave with respect to the equity financing ratio. Additionally, a Pareto zone of the 3PL firm's interest rate exists in which a win–win situation can be achieved. The seller tends to opt for ELF when the sum of the unit transportation fee and ordering cost is high but the equity financing ratio is moderate. Comparatively, the 3PL firm is reluctant to offer financing when both the sum of the unit transportation fee and ordering cost, and the sum of the unit transportation cost and ordering cost are high, while the equity financing ratio is low. Finally, we investigate an endogenous equity financing ratio and further discuss the effect of the seller's initial working capital.</jats:p>"

The study employed structural equation modeling (SEM) for data analysis. The findings highlighted that trust played a significant mediating role between perceived usefulness, security, and intention to use blockchain technology. Perceived usefulness and security were found to significantly enhance trust, which in turn positively influenced the intention to adopt blockchain. Regulatory support also had a strong positive impact on adoption intentions, underscoring the importance of clear and supportive regulatory frameworks. Cost was identified as a barrier to adoption, reflecting the need for organizations to address financial concerns associated with blockchain implementation. The results contributed to the theoretical understanding of blockchain adoption by integrating trust as a key mediator in the Technology Acceptance Model and offered practical implications for supply chain management professionals and policymakers.</jats:p>"

The HOR method is employed to identify and analyze risks as well as the agents present within the supply chain of the tobacco processing facility. The company also needs strategies to manage the identified risks. The HOR method comprises two stages: the initial phase entails identifying risks and risk agents emerging within the factory's supply chain utilizing the Supply Chain Reference Operation (SCOR) approach. Phase two is the stage of determining the priority order of mitigation strategies that can be implemented at the factory. In the initial phase of HOR, 46 instances of risk events were identified within the supply chain, while the second phase involved selecting 27 risk agents for mitigation strategies. The results of phase two of HOR yielded 12 mitigation strategies that were implemented in the factory. These mitigation strategies were then ranked based on their ability to handle the existing risk agents.</jats:p>"

However, simultaneous optimization of water transfer direction in a cost‐effective and reliable ISSG to balance thermal localization, salt accumulation, and resistance to oilfouling represents a rare feat. Herein, inspired by seabird beaks for unidirectional water transfer, eco‐friendly and cost‐effective plant extracts, sodium alginate, and tannic acid, are selected for crafting an innovative Sodium Alginate‐Tannic Acid Hemispheric Evaporator (STHE). The STHE aligned with centripetally tapered channels ensures one‐directional water flow and effectively inhibits downward heat transfer, thereby boosting energy efficiency. Additionally, the integration of one‐way water supply in tapered channels with interfacial evaporation of STHE, mimicking plant transpiration, collaboratively facilitates upward water transfer for a reliable solar‐driven water evaporation rate of ≈2.26 kg m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> under one sun irradiation. Even in a brine of 15.0 wt % solution, no salt crystals are observed on the surface of STHE. Hemispheric structure and superhydrophilicity are conducive to oil repellence. This work provides pivotal inspiration for constructing next‐generation solar generators of high‐efficiency, salt‐tolerance, and anti‐oil‐fouling.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>3D-bioprinting is a promising technique to mimic the complex anatomy of natural tissues, as it comprises a precise and gentle way of placing bioinks containing cells and hydrogel. Although hydrogels expose an ideal growth environment due to their extracellular matrix (ECM)-like properties, high water amount and tissue like microstructure, they lack mechanical strength and possess a diffusion limit of a couple of hundred micrometers. Integration of electrospun fibers could hereby benefit in multiple ways, for instance by controlling mechanical characteristics, cell orientation, direction of diffusion and anisotropic swelling behavior. The aim of this study was to create an advanced ECM-biomimicking scaffold material for tissue engineering, which offers enhanced diffusion properties. PCL bulk membranes were successfully electrospun and fragmented using a cryo cutting technique. Subsequently, these short single fibers (&lt;400 <jats:italic>µ</jats:italic>m in length and ∼5–10 <jats:italic>µ</jats:italic>m in diameter) were embedded in an agarose-based hydrogel after hydrophilization of the short single fibers by O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> plasma treatment. Fiber-filled bioinks exhibit significantly improved biomolecule diffusion (&gt;500 <jats:italic>µ</jats:italic>m), swelling properties (20%–60% of control), and higher mechanical strength, while its viscosity (5–30 mPas*s) and gelation kinetics (28 °C) remained almost unaffected. The diffusion tests indicate a high level of size selectivity, which can be utilized for targeted biomolecule transport in the future. Finally, applying 3D-bioprinting technology (drop-on-demand vs. microextrusion) a print setting dependent post-dispensing orientation of the fibers could be induced, which ultimately paves way for the fabrication of metamaterials with anisotropic material properties. As expected, the fiber-filled bioink was found to be non-cytotoxic in cell culture trials using HUVECs and HepG2 (&gt;80% viability). In summary, microfiber integration holds great promise for 3D-bioprinting of tissue percursors with advanced metamaterial properties and thus offers high applicability in various fields of research, such as <jats:italic>in-vitro</jats:italic> tissue models, tissue engineered implants or cultivated meat.</jats:p>",

However, this method often proves inadequate in delivering satisfactory thermal comfort due to elevated temperature and poor air distribution. This research explores the potential of zonal air supply strategies to enhance thermal comfort in a classroom situated in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. During July 2024, field data—including measurements of airflow velocity, air temperature, relative humidity, and globe temperature—were collected to find key thermal comfort indices: Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD). In addition, a survey was administered to assess students’ thermal perceptions. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were utilized to predict air temperature, velocity, and humidity distribution, evaluating the impact of zonal air supply designs on thermal comfort within the classroom. Parametric analysis was used to identify the most effective zonal air supply configuration for reducing PMV and PPD values. The findings show that, under existing ventilation conditions, PMV and PPD indices at different heights exceed the recommended limits established by ASHRAE Standard-55, indicating thermal discomfort during peak temperature periods. Further investigation demonstrated that introducing a 4-zonal air supply system could reduce PMV by 16–32% and PPD by 32–36%, thereby significantly improving thermal comfort in the classroom.</jats:p>"

Where money serves as the counter-performance, the Directive’s restitution rules are relatively clear and align closely with established EU private law.

These ideas place an emphasis on reducing, reusing, and recycling resources.

In the present study, kinetic experiments with UV alone (254 or 254+185 nm) and the combination of UV and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an AOP were conducted in WWTP effluent (with and without ultrafiltration) to assess the degradation of 24 OMPs, 13 of which were examined for the first time, in a flow-through batch reactor setup. Four parameters were systematically varied to quantify their impacts on OMP degradation: H2O2 concentrations, UV source, water matrix, and flow rate. Most of the studied OMPs (e.g., trimethylammonium, 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine, carbamazepine) were only significantly degraded in the presence of UV radiation and H2O2. The highest pseudo-first-order rate constants were found for diclofenac, acesulfame, diatrizoate, and sulfamethoxazole. The experiment with the highest degradation also showed the strongest abatement of UV absorbance at 254 nm. Only three of the 24 substances (cyanoguanidine, melamine, and oxipurinol) were not degraded; UV alone even increased their concentrations. Overall, upgrading a UV disinfection to an AOP using H2O2 allows the degradation of a wide range of OMPs, making it an interesting process for water reuse.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Prefabricated building (PB) involves many participating enterprises. Its implementation faces many challenges, mainly in the areas of technology, cost, construction management, management of supply chain (SC), and sustainability. The purpose of synergy management of a prefabricated building project supply chain (PBPSC) is to help the whole SC obtain better benefits. This study establishes a measurement index system from the perspective of green sustainability in terms of cost control, technology, information, reliability of SC, and environmental protection. The COWA-CRITIC ideal point method is used to calculate the subjective and objective combination weights, and a cloud model based on this combination weight is constructed for measurement, which is validated by taking the project of a residential building as an example. The results are compared with those of other measurement models to verify the applicability of the measurement model of this study in the synergy management performance of the PBPSC. The sensitivity of the indexes within the five subsystems is analyzed using the one-way rotation OAT method to allow decision makers to identify the most sensitive indexes. This study shows that the synergy management performance of SC in this project is better. The measurement model used in this study is consistent with the results obtained from other measurement models and is in line with the actual situation. Sensitivity analysis using the one-factor rotation OAT method shows that among the secondary indexes, specialized technical staff is the most sensitive to changes in weights; among the primary indexes, cost control is the most sensitive to changes in weights. This provides a new method for measuring the synergy management performance of the PBPSC. Based on the results of this study, corresponding countermeasures are proposed for the synergy management of the PBPSC, which will provide a reference for the synergy management of SCs with similar projects in the future.</jats:p>"

Supplying electricity is also one such service; however, the standards defining its assessment are not always consistent with the expectations of its consumers. This stems from the fact that the standards, which describe the quality of services associated with power supply, are based on a rather modest range of such parameters such as power supply continuity (interruption time), frequency, value, asymmetries, and time waveform shape (cf. EN 50160:2023). This article discusses the continuity quality of power supply (CQoPS), which takes into account numerous quality-related aspects, more than just the ones described in the standard. The method for determining CQoPS coefficients has been based on estimating uncertainty; therefore, it is devoid of such statistical evaluation disadvantages as the requirement for full knowledge of the system that is assessed. This paper also discusses an example calculation of one of the observations based on actual measurements of a renewable energy source (RES) power supply fed to metering systems and a result simulation depending on various observations.</jats:p>"

Predictive analytics offers transformative potential in optimizing supply chain operations by leveraging data-driven insights for proactive decision-making. This explores the advancements in predictive analytics models tailored for global trade systems, emphasizing their role in enhancing supply chain efficiency, resilience, and agility. By integrating machine learning algorithms, big data analytics, and real-time data feeds, these models enable accurate forecasting of demand, inventory levels, and transportation routes. Key innovations include the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) for pattern recognition, predictive maintenance of assets, and dynamic route optimization. The use of ensemble modeling and deep learning enhances the predictive accuracy, while adaptive algorithms accommodate evolving market trends and disruptions. The review also highlights the challenges of data silos, scalability, and model interpretability, which hinder the full potential of predictive analytics in global supply chains. Ethical considerations such as data privacy and fairness in AI-driven decision-making are addressed to ensure responsible model implementation. Case studies from various industries demonstrate how advanced predictive models mitigate risks, reduce costs, and improve sustainability by optimizing resource utilization and reducing carbon footprints. Emerging trends, such as the integration of blockchain for transparent data sharing and IoT for real-time monitoring, further enrich the predictive capabilities. This underscores the critical need for collaborative frameworks between stakeholders, continuous innovation, and investment in analytical capabilities to future-proof supply chains.

This model allows the reduction of the reaction time of enterprise management to negative external factors and to predict the need for management decisions on resource allocation and innovation to minimize the time to restore the stability of machine-building enterprise functioning in new production realities under changes in the market. Based on the analysis of the model, its decomposition has been carried out, and four main factors related directly to the production process that affect the optimization of the proposed function have been identified. Special attention was paid to the detailed analysis of each factor: productivity, product quality, efficient inventory and resource management, and a new important factor in modern conditions, such as responsibility to standards and regulatory documents. This analysis allowed us to propose mathematical models of the influence of each of the factors on the overall flexibility functionality. The proposed mathematical models were analyzed using the benefits-based planning method. This made it possible to analyze how a small and medium-sized engineering enterprise would react to a stress situation associated with changes in market demand, to optimize the overall integral function of small and medium-sized machine-building enterprises flexibility over time, and to propose variants of anti-stress solutions to offset the impact of stress factors on the sustainability of the enterprise over time.</jats:p>"

From an efficiency perspective, do these complex supply chain disruptions call for more complex risk management strategies? To answer this, we built an empirically grounded discrete event simulation model, the results of which were analyzed using data envelopment analysis. Results show that with unprecedented complex disruption patterns, a multi‐strategy portfolio approach is usually less efficient than a single‐strategy or a do‐nothing approach unless the strategy portfolio has certain characteristics. The most efficient strategy portfolios typically consist of a moderate number of diverse strategies. Too many strategies in a portfolio can be problematic, leading to increased costs that outpace improvement in revenue and service level. Results illustrate that even a strategy that generally performs poorly can be part of a very good strategy portfolio and vice versa. This study provides nuanced and novel findings that contribute to the resolution of the literature debate about the value of multi‐strategy portfolios in addressing complex disruption patterns. Highlighting the value of a strategy portfolio view, these insights help firms better prepare for the next complex and sustained global supply chain disruptions.</jats:p>",

The study question examined the implementation of a risk management system by Thulamela to guarantee service delivery. Utilising risk management and institutional theory, the study adopted a mixed-methods approach, applying deductive thematic analysis and SPSS software to examine data regarding the municipality's risk management procedures, team expertise, and framework suitability. The findings reveal that although Thulamela possesses a supply chain risk management framework, enhancements are necessary, specifically in (i) empowering the risk management team, (ii) incorporating technology and maintaining a record of suppliers with a history of non-compliance, and (iii) augmenting staff's risk management expertise. A favourable correlation was observed among effective risk management, institutional theory, supply chain procedures, and service delivery.

These distributors source a single product from a farmer through an agricultural cooperative, operating in a single period. The agents have the ability to coordinate their actions to maximize their profits, and we use cooperative game theory to analyze cooperation among them. The distributors can engage in joint ordering, increasing their order size, which leads to a decrease in the price per kilogram. Additionally, distributors have the opportunity to cooperate with the farmer, securing a reduced price per kilogram at the cost price, while compensating the farmer for any kilograms not acquired in the cooperation agreement. We introduce multidistributor-farmer games and we prove that all the agents have incentives to cooperate. We demonstrate the existence of stable allocations, where no subgroup of agents can be better off by separating. Moreover, we propose and characterize a distribution of the total profit that justly compensates the contribution of the farmer in any group of distributors. We also explore the conditions under which the farmer can be compensated to maximize their revenues when cooperating with all players.

Specifically, it aims to assess consumer awareness of the environmental and social implications of palm oil production, examine the impact of price sensitivity on purchasing decisions, and explore the influence of eco-friendly certifications like the RSPO on consumer preferences. The research employs a structured survey distributed both online and inperson to a diverse sample of Malaysian consumers. With a sample size of 200 respondents, the survey evaluates variables such as customer awareness, price sensitivity, and the influence of product labeling and certification on the demand for sustainable palm oil. The study finds that consumer awareness significantly impacts the demand for sustainable palm oil, with higher awareness correlating with a greater preference for sustainably sourced products. Price sensitivity remains a barrier, as many consumers are reluctant to pay premiums for eco-friendly options. Furthermore, clear and credible product labeling and certifications like RSPO positively influence consumer trust and demand for sustainable palm oil. Policymakers and industry stakeholders can leverage these insights to develop targeted strategies that promote sustainable palm oil practices. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing consumer demand for sustainable palm oil in Malaysia, a major global producer. It integrates theories such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, PriceQuality Inference Theory, and Signaling Theory to explain consumer behavior dynamics.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The utilization of blockchain in supply chain management is very effective in recent years. By using blockchain in SCM transactions has efficiently traceable and auditable. This survey aims at providing an overview of various existing research papers that discuss the role, applications, and probable of blockchain in revolutionizing the medical supply chain. The studies surveyed collectively underscore the dire need for enhanced transparency within the ecosystem of healthcare. Blockchain provides real time tracking of medicine goods in secure manner in SCM. One of the themes that keeps cropping up in the research is how blockchain will be able to help block counterfeit drugs and improve traceability of pharmaceuticals from production to delivery to the very end-user. Some studies also look more closely at smart contracts in automatic processes like the making of a payment, procurement, and even compliance management. Thus, with blockchain, business operations are also being improved. Also, blockchain studies have looked more intently at data integrity and safe ways in which information among stakeholders-manufacturers, distributors, healthcare workers, and even regulators-can share or be shared to them. However, this surveyed research also recognizes the scalability issues, regulatory hurdles, and high cost of initial investment in implementing blockchain. This body of work has thus demonstrated that though blockchain holds great potential for transforming the medical supply chain, more research and stakeholder collaboration is required to achieve broad-based adoption and realization of benefits</jats:p>"

Obtaining the appropriate thermophysical characteristics of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells can be confirmed by experimental studies and mathematical calculations. Obtaining relevant results in the future makes it possible to carry out a professional assessment of the heating temperature of such LIB, the conditions of their combustion, and the spread of fire in general. According to the results of experimental studies, namely, under the condition of the action of an external source of high temperature (flame) and uniform heating of the outer walls of the LIB, its inner part is heated to an average temperature of 168 °C for 70 seconds. For comparison, the corresponding temperature in the middle of the LIB without internal filling (cathode and anode) is reached within 45 seconds. The developed mathematical model based on the differential equation of thermal conductivity in the cylindrical coordinate system and the use of the Newton-Richmann`s Law of Heat Exchange made it possible to carry out mathematical modelling of the heating process of a LIB. Further comparison of the experimental values with the mathematical model confirmed the correctness of the experiment. The obtained mathematical model based on the experimental values made it possible to obtain the corresponding numerical values of the specific heat capacity, material density, thermal conductivity coefficient and heat exchange between the surface and the near-surface layer of the Panasonic NCR18650B.</jats:p>",

Information asymmetry and low collaboration efficiency remain key challenges across the timber supply chain. This study develops a three-party evolutionary game model examining digital collaboration between timber production and processing enterprises, finished product distribution and retail enterprises, and third-party service providers, introducing third-party service providers alongside traditional production and distribution enterprises. The model incorporates novel parameters including information sharing degree, value-added reliability gains, and free-riding coefficients to reflect real-world circumstances. Through equilibrium simulation and analysis, we identify four possible evolutionary states. The results demonstrate that successful digital collaboration in timber supply chains relies on three conditions: a high level of initial stakeholder involvement accelerates the formation of supply chain digital intelligent collaborative mechanisms, equitable benefit distribution maintains long-term cooperation, and integrated third-party services reduce implementation costs while improving information reliability. These findings provide a new perspective and reference for timber enterprises to implement digital transformation strategies.</jats:p>"

Through an in-depth analysis of 14 initiatives across Europe, it explores the multi-faceted nature of SFSCs collaboration, revealing a complex interplay between collaborative relationships, interaction mechanisms, and relational benefits. By identifying seven key interaction mechanisms—information sharing, decision synchronisation, goal congruence, incentive alignment, resource sharing, joint knowledge creation, and collaborative communication—the article shows how these mechanisms generate both tangible and intangible relational benefits, including fair pricing, reduced transaction costs, enhanced market knowledge, technological skills, and stronger community engagement. The findings demonstrate that SFSCs collaborations operate as dynamic ecosystems characterised by complex interdependencies among diverse actors. This diversity extends beyond traditional business-to-business (B2B) models to include business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-to-business (C2B), and hybrid business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) relationships. These varied collaborative structures facilitate mutual learning, innovation, and value co-creation, crucial for the resilience and adaptability of local food systems. The presence of robust interaction mechanisms is essential for fostering effective partnerships and generating relational benefits, even if not all mechanisms are consistently present in every type of collaborative relationships.</jats:p>"

It signifies that maximizing irrigation profits has become the primary consideration of current agricultural irrigation systems. By discussing the change in irrigation profits with irrigation fraction f, which represents the proportion of irrigated farmland per unit area of cultivated land, a new method of qualitative diagnosis of irrigation supply and demand balance was proposed by means of the optimal irrigation fraction f0 corresponding to the objective function yf and the correlation coefficient ρ between irrigation water demand anomalies D^ and irrigation water withdrawal anomalies I^ (ρD^,I^=0). It will serve as a new attempt to optimize irrigation profits. We argue that the optimal objective function yf0 represents the state of equilibrium of irrigation supply and demand. This study proposes a reverse optimization idea, which includes two comparison methods, to estimate the comprehensively optimal irrigation fraction f0 that maximizes irrigation profits and irrigation profit per unit area while minimizing risks associated with climatic anomalies. By demonstrating that f0 performs exceptionally well in meeting the objectives of maximizing irrigation profits and minimizing risks across various climatic scenarios, we suggest a robust method for optimizing irrigation profits, which simply calculates ρD^,I^f=0 because ρD^,I^ is the function of f. Since f0 could capture the optimal solution to the greatest extent. It can serve as a simple and effective solution to determine the optimal objective function yf0 and diagnose the state of balance between irrigation water demand and supply.

The paper investigates key challenges in workforce development, infrastructure modernization, and cost competitiveness, while highlighting successful strategies employed by industry leaders. Findings indicate that while domestic production costs remain 15-25% higher than offshore alternatives, benefits in supply chain resilience, market responsiveness, and environmental impact create compelling arguments for reshoring. The research concludes that successful reshoring requires coordinated efforts across stakeholders, sustained investment in technology and workforce development, and strategic policy support to create a competitive and sustainable domestic manufacturing base</jats:p>"

Due to the structural characteristics of the supply chain, keeping the freshness of agricultural products involves different entities and multiple links, which is a long‐term strategic issue requiring significant investment. Given the perishability of agricultural products, the aging of preservation facilities, or the decline of technology, it is critical to consider the multitier freshness‐keeping strategy from a dynamic perspective. Therefore, this paper studies dynamic freshness‐keeping and coordination of a multitier agricultural product supply chain. We first construct a differential equation considering the three‐tier freshness‐keeping efforts. Then, we compare the optimal freshness‐keeping efforts, retail price, and system profit between the decentralized and centralized decision‐making models. Finally, two contracts based on cost‐sharing and secondary transfer payment are designed to coordinate the decentralized decision‐making model. Results show that (i) as the decision sequence moves backward, freshness‐keeping effort decreases at each tier for the same freshness‐keeping efficiency; (ii) adopting the centralized decision‐making model offers several advantages, including well‐balanced freshness‐keeping efforts across multiple tiers, a lower retail price, and higher system profit; and (iii) under a specified payment range, the “freshness‐keeping cost‐sharing‐two‐part fee” contract motivates entities to increase freshness‐keeping efforts and realizes individual and system‐wide profit improvements.</jats:p>"

From the extensive case study of ChemScene, a biopharma company, we used advanced AI models that integrate LSTM neural networks, Q-learning, and genetic algorithms. Analysis of 18 months of data revealed remarkable improvements across key performance metrics. The sales volume increased by 38.1%, while the sales volume decreased by 77.1%. Customer loyalty was significantly boosted, increasing retention from 82% to 91%. These improvements translated into profitable results, including a 20% increase in revenue and a 31.3% jump in operating profit. Our findings not only validate the effectiveness of machine learning in inventory management but also provide new insights into AI's broader impact on customer relationships. And the market as a whole. This research provides a useful model for retailers considering AI adoption, paving the way for future research in this rapidly changing industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article analyses the existing developments in the logistics of grain and similar cargoes in international systems. Due to the increase in logistics costs, Ukrainian agricultural companies receive a lower price compared to world market prices - they have to bear the costs caused by an inefficient logistics system. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a simulation model of the logistics system for the supply of grain cargo from the producer to the seaport of departure, as the main hub of communication with ports around the world. And the modelling will allow us to determine the level of influence of the obtained data on the transport material flow on the efficiency of decision-making. It is proposed to build models based on Petri nets, which allow to study the behaviour of an object in real time by assessing the performance of the system without forecast data. Today, the logistics system of grain cargo delivery in Ukraine has a structure based on the interaction of participants: agricultural companies as producers and organisers of grain exports, farmers, transport and logistics companies, as well as the existing infrastructure of Ukrainian and foreign ports, railways, and roads. This principle of interaction allowed us to build a structural model of functional interaction in the grain supply system. Based on this interaction and the principles of organising the supply of grain cargoes from production (harvesting) to the port of departure, a two-tier model of the functioning of this logistics system was developed. At the top are models of data collection and processing by an agricultural company, and at the bottom is a simulation model of the logistics system. A simulation model of grain cargo movement from the sender to the seaport of departure based on Petri nets has been built, which reflects the structure of relationships between the elements of the system and the dynamics of changes in its states in a compact form. On the basis of the built model, a simulation was carried out for three variants of distribution of cargo flow by two modes of transport. It has been determined that the option of uniform distribution of grain cargo between road and rail transport allows to save time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>In a low‐carbon service supply chain, consisting of a carbon‐dependent manufacturer and a low‐carbon service company, a dual contract for revenue sharing and guaranteed carbon reduction promotes sustainable collaboration and emission reduction. However, adjusting contract terms and collaborative relationships when negative cooperative behavior occurs or a collaboration impasse arises remains underexplored. Thus, we constructed an evolutionary game model to analyze cooperative behaviors between carbon‐dependent manufacturers and low‐carbon service companies. Through stability analysis, we identify conditions for active commitment. Importantly, potential negative strategies may hinder optimal cooperative emission reduction, leading to a cooperative deadlock. Numerical simulations reveal the following: (1) Higher guaranteed carbon reduction targets or moderate liquidated deposit can prevent negative behaviors. (2) Changing the allocation ratio of carbon trading revenue or government subsidies helps the chain move towards cooperation. (3) Service innovation facilitates positive cooperation; however, low‐carbon service companies must possess the capability to translate their level of service innovation into carbon reduction performance. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which utilitarian and exploratory service innovations influence cooperative decision‐making differ. (4) When supply chain members find themselves in a decision‐making impasse, in addition to moderately increasing the carbon reduction guarantee amount or the penalties for failing to meet carbon reduction targets, enhancing the distribution ratio of carbon trading revenues for carbon‐dependent manufacturers, increasing the allocation of government subsidies, and implementing service innovations can also help break the deadlock. (5) Combined carbon trading policies and government subsidies effectively promote sustainability compared to singular adoption. These findings impact cooperative emission reduction in low‐carbon service supply chains and policy formulation. The conclusions of this paper have implications for the maintenance of cooperative emission reduction relationships among members in the operation of low‐carbon service supply chains and the formulation of policies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nHydrostatic bearings are commonly used in high‐precision applications due to their excellent performance across a wide range of sizes, from millimeters to tens of meters. However, their operation is dependent on a continuous external supply. If this supply fails or the pad alignment is improper, collisions or damage to sliding surfaces can occur, compromising machine precision or even causing malfunction. This study presents an experimental assessment of selected material combinations for sliding surfaces to minimize damage in large‐scale hydrostatic bearings under critical conditions. The research aims to identify the most suitable material combinations that ensure a reliable and efficient operation of hydrostatic bearings, even in the case of oil supply failure or pad misalignment. The experimental methodology focuses on the influence of material properties on friction and wear. According to the results, the most suitable materials to combine with structural steel are tin, polytetrafluoroethylene, and leaded compositions. On the other hand, aluminum bronze, structural steel, and galvanized steel are the least suitable combinations. These findings offer valuable insights into selecting the most appropriate conformal sliding surface material combination for large‐scale hydrostatic bearings based on multiple criteria, which can contribute to improved safety and durability.</jats:p>"

Due to a reduction in plant nutrition with sulphur, this has also led to a drop in the S concentrations in certain plant species over time. As a result, a lot of experimental work was carried out to remedy the emerging yield and quality deficiencies on the farms. In this summarised study, data from 98 sites in Germany and other European countries were recorded from 1998 to 2023, received from sulphur fertiliser trials carried out on farms and experimental stations under organic farming conditions. This second part of meta-analysis focuses on establishing relationships between the status of plant nutrient supply with sulphur and biomass yield responses, the nitrogen uptake of crop species and the extent of N2 fixation in legumes. The results of regression analyses based on the effect of the S concentrations and the N:S ratios of the crop species on the relative yield differences between 851 standard variants (=100%) and 1177 sulphur treatment variants. In principle, declining yield increases were determined as a result of increasing S concentrations and decreasing N:S ratios. Except in the case of grain legume young plants, both characteristics were suitable for determining corresponding limit values for yield formation. Different values were determined depending on the plant species and harvest material. In extensive comparative analyses and discussion with literature data, minimum sulphur concentrations and maximum values for N:S ratios for young plants, vegetative harvest material (straw) and grain materials are proposed to ensure optimum biomass yields of permanent grassland, lucerne–clover–grass, grain legumes and cereals for use in practice of agricultural systems of different intensities.</jats:p>"

To motivate logistics service providers to invest in logistics capacity, thereby maintaining supply chain resilience and achieving coordination, a joint contract incorporating cost and benefit sharing is proposed in a novel Stackelberg game model. By analyzing the behavior of various decision-making models—centralized, coordinated, and decentralized—in supply chains, we find that the proposed Stackelberg game model effectively correlates higher investment levels with increased supply chain resilience. The coordination mechanism significantly improves both the level of resilience and the investment amount, leading to enhanced overall profitability.

The research further examines the moderating role of disruptive events in the relationship between risk resilience and organizational sustainability. A quantitative research design was employed, utilizing data collected from 156 employees through a structured questionnaire. The findings demonstrate that the proposed framework has significant predictive capability, with Q² values of 36.6% for risk resilience and 41% for organizational sustainability. The analysis highlights that HR practices, employee development, big data analytics talent and management capabilities, and innovation collectively explain 52.3% of the variance in supply chain risk resilience. Moreover, the combined effect of risk resilience and responses to disruptive events accounts for 55% of the variance in organizational sustainability. These findings emphasize the importance of prioritizing data analytics talent development, effective HR practices, and proactive response strategies to enhance the risk resilience and sustainability of logistics firms. Practical implications suggest that policymakers and industry leaders should focus on improving these critical factors to better navigate challenges posed by crises and disruptive events. This research contributes novel insights into the determinants of supply chain risk resilience and organizational sustainability, offering a valuable framework for strengthening the logistics sector's adaptability and long-term viability in a dynamic and uncertain business environment.</jats:p>"

The fishery system can be regarded as a slow–fast system under some suitable assumptions. Through variable aggregation methods, we derive a simplified four-dimensional model governing the density of prey fish, the juvenile and adult predator densities, and fishing effort in the fishery. We perform a stability analysis of the simplified system and give the optimal harvesting policy by using Pontryagin’s maximum principle. In our analysis, we find that the catastrophe equilibrium point corresponding to overfishing leading to fish extinction is unstable, which indicates that the predator stage structure has an impact on the stability of the system. Moreover, we find that due to the additional food item the system appears to have prey-free equilibrium points, which indicates that the system does not collapse due to the extinction of one prey item. We also give thresholds for the amount of additional food needed to maintain the balance of the system under different circumstances. </jats:p>",

ESSs operate in diverse environmental conditions and are responsible for the safety of lives, property and the natural environment of SB users. The operational tasks of ESSs in SBs require a continuous power supply from various sources, including renewable energy sources. The authors conducted an analysis of the power supply for selected ESSs used in SBs, which enabled the development of a power supply model. For the proposed model, the authors designed a proprietary graph of the ESS operational process, taking into account power supply implementation. Considering the operational indicators for the analysed ESSs, such as repair and failure rates, a computer simulation was performed. The simulation allowed the determination of the reliability of the ESS power supply within the considered redundancy configuration of additional energy sources, which can be utilised during the design phase. The reliability analysis of the power supply and the determination of rational parameters conducted in the article are crucial for achieving all the functionalities of ESSs in SBs, as envisioned during the design process. The article is divided into six chapters, structured to address the topics sequentially: an introduction to the state of the issue, a critical literature review, an analysis of the power supply for selected ESSs, implementation of renewable energy sources, the development of a proprietary model and operational graph, a computer simulation and conclusions.</jats:p>"

The study is primarily focused on designing an optimized electrical power source for Magnetically Impelled Arc Butt (MIAB) welding, which is a solid-state welding process characterized by specific current requirements. MIAB welding involves variation of current in two stages of the welding sequence. The objective of this study is to propose an appropriate power supply configuration that meets the precise amperage control and also ensures machine compactness and automation of the process. Utilizing state-of-the-art simulation tools, the research explores various design parameters and configurations to achieve the desired current modulation efficiently. The inverter-based welding power source is tested for the welding of tubes of MS1018 material by implementing parametric variations to validate its workability and performance. The findings indicate that the proposed power supply configuration can enable the required control and also provide a compact power supply unit for MIAB welding, paving the way for its broader industrial adoption and implementation. This research contributes to the advancement of welding technology by providing a robust solution to the challenges associated with arc dynamics and amperage modulation in MIAB welding, ultimately leading to improved weld quality and process efficiency. The proposed power supply design demonstrates potential applications well beyond MIAB welding, offering versatility for any process requiring controlled amperage variation during its operation cycle.</jats:p>"

A standardized supply system using time-series forecasting was implemented to provide wards with timely supplies based on actual needs. This approach helped reduce storage issues and minimized related nursing tasks.Methods: The project was conducted in two stages to address different supply cycles and the challenge of forecasting the quantity required for the ward’s needs. In the first stage, supply cycles were standardized to five times per week, and the location and size of the storage cabinets were standardized across all wards. In the second stage, ward storage cabinets were automatically replenished with new cabinets stocked with standardized items based on past usage.Results: The mean weekly transported supply quantity decreased from 6,278 to 5,481 (12.7%). The mean inventory across all wards reduced from 3,471 ± 1609 to 1,741 ± 354 (p&lt;.001), resulting in a 30% reduction in storage space. A retrospective analysis revealed minimal emergency requests (0.1% of total supply) despite not keeping any items in stock.Conclusion: We confirmed the timely supply of the quantity required for ward needs through a ward logistics standardization project. Storage-related issues and inventory management tasks are reduced by the daily exchange of supply or storage cabinets and the accurate estimation of future demand based on past usage.</jats:p>",

Based on the results of the analysis of known developments of heat and cooling supply systems and methods of their calculation, the authors justified an improved version of the system in which the low-temperature source is source water, removed and supply ventilation air. The subsystem of two-level hot water supply with air cooling of premises in the warm period of the year of civil buildings located in the Southern regions of Ukraine was considered. On the basis of analytical study of heat and energy efficiency of the improved heat pump system of hot water supply and air cooling, the dependence of the actual conversion factor has been established, which represents a multifactor interrelation of initial and mode parameters, as well as modes of operation of structural subsystems of selection, conversion and subscriber heat consumption. Mode conditions are determined that ensure highly efficient heat recovery from cold water and ventilation air for hot water supply in the building and its cooling in the warm period of the year. The results of the analytical study have established the feasibility of using cold water and ventilation air as an integrated low-temperature source in the proposed system of heat and cold supply.

Their impact on the economic growth of the countries adjacent to the routes, on the efficiency of cargo owners, transport operators, carriers, and infrastructure owners has no clear theoretical or empirical estimates. The purpose of this study is to substantiate and calculate the synergy effect indicator of transport connectivity of the North – South ITC, namely, to assess the maximum volumes of cargo transported along all ITC routes, taking into account the factors limiting its throughput and carrying capacity. Research methods: the scenario forecast for the development of the ITC was obtained by sampling — scenario distribution. In calculating the indicators for assessing the economic effects of the ITC routes, the method of comparing digital data with risk factors limiting rail freight flows was used. The analysis of the distance matrix for three ITC routes was used. The forecast of the estimated indicators is made by the method of dynamic analysis of successive series of indicators of rail freight transportation, characterizing each route, their changes over time. Results: based on the following indicators: throughput and carrying capacity of the ITC railway infrastructure; sustainable development index of the countries of the region; logistics index (customs and border clearance; quality of trade and transport infrastructure); “transportation costs” — the contingency effects were calculated, reflecting the maximum volumes of transported goods, taking into account the connectivity of infrastructure and modes of transport along all routes of the North – South ITC. Practical significance: scenario calculation of contingency effects along the ITC routes can be used in projects for he development of the transport and logistics infrastructure of the ITC, since it allows assessing the effects of growth in freight throughput.</jats:p>",

It has been shown that I5.0 can enhance sustainability within supply chains (SCs). However, companies in emerging economies, especially small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs), which are crucial to developing economies, face challenges in implementing these concepts. These SMEs are in the early stages of adopting I5.0 to foster sustainability in their SCs and require urgent identification of key I5.0 enablers. Unfortunately, the current literature lacks research on this topic specifically within the context of SMEs in emerging economies. To bridge this gap, this study identifies the enablers of I5.0 that promote sustainability diffusion in SCs, using China’s SME manufacturing sector as a case study. The integrated framework for applying multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques in this study aims to assist decision-makers in evaluating different options and making optimal choices in a systematic and structured manner when faced with complex situations. The study employs the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) to identify 15 key I5.0 enablers and categorize them into three clusters. Grey-DEMATEL is subsequently utilized to determine the causal relationships, rank the importance of the enablers, and construct an interrelationship diagram. This study found that ‘availability and functionality of resources’; ‘top management support, active participation, and effective governance’; ‘support from government, regulators, and financial resources’; and ‘introduction of safer and more efficient robotic systems for human–robot interaction and collaboration’ serve as the primary means of resolving issues. Overall, this study helps managers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in I5.0 applications to promote sustainability in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The question of optimal monetary policy is one of the most controversial among economists in different countries of the world. The answer to this is largely determined by the way money is formed in the economy. According to modern macroeconomic concepts, money supply can be influenced by factors other than monetary policy. This article discusses the main theoretical approaches to determining the mechanisms of formation of the money supply. The main attention is paid to the post-Keynesian theory of endogenous money supply, within which the accommodation and structuralist approaches dominate. Both approaches are based on the premise that the money supply in the country is affected by changes in bank loans. However, they differ in the degree to which the monetary regulator satisfies the banks’ need for loans: full (accommodation) and partial (structuralism).\nThe main source of money supply growth in the modern world is the credit channel, which is considered key from the standpoint of post-Keynesianism, but considering the Russian economy in retrospect, one cannot help but note two more important sources, such as the currency channel, which was of great importance in the 2000s, and the fiscal channel, which currently also plays an important role in changes in the money supply. Since 2013, the Central Bank has been actively using such a regulatory instrument as the key interest rate in its monetary policy, which is consistent with the position of post-Keynesianism. Using the conducted theoretical review, as well as an analysis of the current state of the Russian money market and monetary policy, it is concluded that there are prerequisites for the endogeneity of the Russian money supply, which provides grounds for further analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships of key macroeconomic indicators using econometric models.</jats:p>",

The objective of this research article is to understand the experience of managers on the supply chain for medication and other pharmaceutical products in all structures of the Wangata Health Zone. The inductive approach with the phenomenological method was used to analyze the stockout phenomenon in the empirical field, which is the Wangata health zone. Interviews were carried out over a period of one month from 16 August 2024 to 16 September 2024 in the Wangata General Referral Hospital as well as 7 health centers in the Wangata Health Zone. The interviewed people were managers responsible for supplies, purchasing managers, custodians, pharmacy assistants, and all administrators in charge of various structures in this zone. 19 semi-directed interviews were conducted after noting the saturation of information among respondents. The obtained results show in a practical way the dependence on partners (donors) for the supply of medical products, late deliveries, and drugs that are close to expiry. Drugs provided by partners do not meet the real needs of users. Stock shortages, price increases in pharmaceutical depots, insufficient funding, a permanent lack of partners, a total absence of organization of continuing training sessions, and premises, where pharmacies are installed in the majority of cases, are inappropriate and do not meet the standards of a hospital pharmacy. The conclusion drawn from this research emphasizes that regulation of the pharmaceutical supply chain, a good logistics management information system (LMIS), availability of funding, and distributed leadership skills in the pharmaceutical supply chain will allow health structures to take care of users appropriately. These strategies will also enable health structures, through their stock managers, to ensure the availability of medicines and other medicinal inputs and to guarantee a financial balance, allowing them to self-generate medical supplies in order to be partially or totally independent in terms of acquiring medicines.</jats:p>",

The research investigates four key dimensions of SCM: supplier relationships, intermediaries and distributors, customer relationships, and operations. This study relied on the descriptive analytical approach, where the study population consisted of all the Jordanian pharmaceutical industrial companies listed on the Amman Chamber of Industry, which are (72) companies, including (32) For human pharmaceutical industry companies only. Amman Stock Exchange, and the study tool was sent electronically and (176) responses were retrieved, (11) invalid questionnaires were excluded for the purposes of bioanalysis so that we have (165) questionnaires available. To achieve the objectives of the study, arithmetic averages and standard deviations were used in addition to multiple regression analysis and simple regression analysis. Findings reveal that SCM significantly enhances competitive advantage, accounting for 69.6% of its variation, with operations and intermediaries-distributor relationships exerting the strongest influence. Furthermore, the moderating role of TM is confirmed, increasing the explanatory power of SCM from 43.7% to 49.2%. These results underscore the importance of integrating TM practices into SCM strategies to sustain competitive advantage in a dynamic and highly regulated industry. The study provides theoretical contributions to the resource-based view by incorporating TM as a strategic enabler and offers practical insights for optimizing SCM and TM practices. Based on the results of the study, the study recommended several recommendations, the most important of which is the need for a specialized information network to exchange information between the company and suppliers, interest in involving suppliers in organizing And the development of the services provided, because of their experience and knowledge of the necessary materials and the expected costs.</jats:p>",

The Mihogang River is directly influenced by the Daecheong Dam, which is situated in the middle section of the Geumgang River. A reservoir simulation was conducted over approximately 40 years (from 1983 to 2023) using the storage equation. The results of an analysis demonstrated that an additional supply of up to 0.11 m3/s could be provided while maintaining the planned supply amount over a five-day period, thus ensuring a water utilization reliability of 96.3%. In addition, an additional supply of up to 0.23 m3/s was found to be feasible within the supply range stipulated in the 2023 contract for a five-day period, thus ensuring a reliability of 98.7%. However, because the reliability of water utilization is typically evaluated based on the lowest water level, our study recalculated and reassessed the potential for additional supply to ensure that the water level complied with water supply adjustment standards. The evaluation results showed that although the water utilization reliability was met, the supply availability rate generally decreased and fell below the level of concern specified in the water supply adjustment standards.</jats:p>",

However, the lifetime of FESS is limited because of significant frictional losses in mechanical bearings and challenges associated with passing the critical speed. To suppress the unbalanced response of FESS at critical speed, a damping ring (DR) device is designed for a hybrid supported FESS with mechanical bearing and axial active magnetic bearing (AMB). Initially, the dynamic model of the FESS with DR is established using Lagrange’s equation. Moreover, the dynamic parameters of the DR are obtained by experimental measurements using the method of free vibration attenuation. Finally, the influence of the DR device on the critical speed and unbalanced response of FESS is analyzed. The results show that the designed DR device can effectively reduce the critical speed of FESS, and increase the first and second mode damping ratio. The critical speed is reduced from 13,860 rpm to 5280 rpm. Compared with FESS of the mechanical bearing, the unbalanced response amplitude of the FESS with DR is reduced by more than 87.8%, offering promising technical support for the design of active and passive control systems in FESS.</jats:p>"

This research examined the relationship between big data analytics capabilities and organizational performance in the context of supply chain visibility based on sample data collected from 400 manufacturing firms operating in Pakistan. The data were gathered from experienced supply chain professionals with the help of a structured questionnaire while Smart PLS 4.0 was employed to evaluate the research model. The research findings indicate that big data analytics capabilities positively affect supply chain visibility and result in improved organizational performance. The study supports the research hypothesis that though big data analytics capabilities may not have a direct impact on organizational performance however, they can both indirectly and positively impact organizational performance when mediated by supply chain visibility. The findings recommend that manufacturing sector organisations should focus on improving supply chain visibility to optimise the benefits of big data analytics capabilities. This research extends the existing literature on big data analytics capabilities from a supply chain perspective, showing how they improve the performance of organisations and hence offer valuable insights to researchers and practitioners.</jats:p>",

Supervised by Dr. Alberto Garre and Prof. Pablo S. Fernandez and coordinated by Dr. Virginia Filipello of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Italy, the fellowship aimed to provide hands‐on training in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). The fellow benefited from UPCT's expertise in microbiological risk assessment, gaining knowledge of methodologies, terminologies and software tools essential for QMRA. The focus of the fellowship was on the risks associated with plant‐based milk products, which are increasingly popular as sustainable alternatives to dairy milk. Despite the heat treatments these beverages undergo to ensure safety, risks persist, such as cross‐contamination during post‐processing or the survival of heat‐resistant spores like Bacillus cereus. A recent European outbreak linked to contaminated oat milk underscored the importance of assessing these risks. The project was conducted in two phases: first, at UPCT's Food Microbiology Laboratory, where the fellow handled and characterised the thermal resistance of various B. cereus strains using a thermoresistometer; and second, through remote analysis of experimental data using risk analysis software tools. The fellow developed skills in microbiological techniques, such as spore preparation and thermal resistance evaluation, and became proficient in data analysis using the R programming language and the biorisk package. The fellowship culminated in the development of a QMRA model to estimate the likelihood of B. cereus‐related foodborne illness from plant‐based milks, considering different heat treatments and bacterial strains. The fellow's training covered all stages of risk assessment, including hazard identification, exposure assessment, hazard characterisation and risk characterisation, providing a comprehensive foundation for a career in food safety and microbial risk assessment. \r\n</jats:p>",

Basing the framework on a systematic literature review, we further confirmed our findings through interviews with informants from various stakeholders in the mining industry (n=10). The results showed that by integrating blockchain technology into the evaluation of carbon emissions in supply chains, sustainability would greatly improve. The framework outlined in this article delineates the procedures and advantages of employing blockchain technology to expand transparency, mitigate emissions, and bolster overall sustainability. Potential future research areas may probe deeper into investigating the economic consequences and regulatory factors, and enduring viability of carbon emissions management frameworks that utilize blockchain technology.</jats:p>",

Temperature plays a crucial role in regulating geosmin dynamics in temperate and subtropical lakes, while its influence may be lower in tropical waters. To better understand the factors affecting geosmin occurrence in tropical waters, a dataset from a field investigation conducted in a large tropical reservoir was analyzed. The water temperature varied between 16 °C and 32 °C, with geosmin concentration ranging from below the detection limit (3 ng/L) to as high as 856 ng/L. Elevated geosmin levels exceeding &gt; 10 ng/L were observed over the whole year except for in September, suggesting that the annual temperature was suitable for geosmin production. Among the diverse cyanobacteria, Dolichospermum circinale was identified as the main producer of geosmin in the reservoir, both by correlation analysis and cells’ geosmin measurements. Geosmin concentration was also significantly related to the abundance of D. circinale. None of the environmental variables (temperature, pH, transparency and nutrients) were significantly directly correlated with geosmin concentration. But the high total nitrogen significantly explained the increase in D. circinale abundance associated with geosmin elevation. Our results suggest that nutrients, particularly nitrogen, directly affected the competitive advantage and abundance of key geosmin producers and thus modified geosmin levels in this tropical reservoir. Our study thus hints at the possible management of the geosmin problem through nutrient reduction in tropical reservoirs.</jats:p>"

Objetiva-se compreender a influência da tecnologia da informação e da confiança interorganizacional na governança relacional e a influência da governança nos resultados dos membros da díade cliente-fornecedor. Realizou-se uma pesquisa survey aplicada a empresas de máquinas e implementos agrícolas associadas ao Sindicato das Indústrias de Máquinas e Implementos Agrícolas do Rio Grande do Sul (SIMERS). Analisaram-se respostas de 47 casos, utilizando-se técnicas estatísticas de análise fatorial e de modelagem de equações estruturais. Os resultados das análises fatoriais sugeriram examinar as variáveis flexibilidade e mecanismos informais de cooperação para medir governança relacional; e as variáveis performance relacional, custo do conflito e esforço de parceria para examinar as consequências da governança relacional. Complementarmente, a análise estrutural indica que apenas a confiança interorganizacional causa efeito positivo na cooperação, enquanto a flexibilidade também recebe efeito positivo e significante da integração da tecnologia da informação. Apresentam-se, ainda, como significantes, as seguintes consequências da governança relacional: da flexibilidade, positivamente na performance; da flexibilidade, negativamente no esforço de parceria; da cooperação, negativamente no esforço de parceria; da cooperação, positivamente na performance e no custo do conflito. Esse resultado aponta que uma estrutura de relacionamento com forte cooperação demanda um esforço maior à organização do trabalho e à solução de problemas personalizados, contestando a hipótese de que a influência da cooperação no custo de transação seja sempre negativa. Assim, por meio da governança relacional e dos custos de transação, demonstram-se potenciais caminhos para a redução de custos e superior performance relacional da díade cliente-fornecedor. O modelo teórico desenvolvido pode contribuir na investigação científica de outras cadeias de suprimentos.</jats:p>"

However, rapid urban expansion and increased density threaten these forests, creating significant imbalances between the supply and demand for these services. Understanding the characteristics of ecosystem services and reasonably dividing ecological management zones are crucial for promoting sustainable urban development. This study introduces an innovative ecological management zoning framework based on the matching degree and synergies relationships of ESs. Focusing on Fuzhou’s fourth ring road area in China, data from 1038 urban forest sample plots were collected using mobile LIDAR. By integrating the i-Tree Eco model and Kriging interpolation, we assessed the spatial distribution of four key ESs—carbon sequestration, avoided runoff, air purification, and heat mitigation—and analyzed their supply–demand relationships and synergies. Based on these ecological characteristics, we employed unsupervised machine learning classification to identify eight distinct ecological management zones, each accompanied by targeted recommendations. Key findings include the following: (1) ecosystem services of urban forests in Fuzhou exhibit pronounced spatial heterogeneity, with clearly identifiable high-value and low-value areas of significant statistical relevance; (2) heat mitigation, avoided runoff, and air purification services all exhibit synergistic effects, while carbon sequestration shows trade-offs with the other three services in high-value areas, necessitating targeted optimization; (3) eight ecological management zones were identified, each with unique ecological characteristics. This study offers precise spatial insights into Fuzhou’s urban forests, providing a foundation for sustainable ecological management strategies.</jats:p>"

ERPS can quickly provide power support for the rapid restoration of the grid, and quick respond to repair tasks, thus ensuring public safety and other aspects of security. However, traditional diesel gensets and gas gensets as emergency power sources have problems such as environmental pollution, high fuel reserve costs, and inconvenient operation. To overcome these shortcomings, a multi-mode replenishment method for outdoor emergency repair power vehicles, is proposed in this paper. A hybrid gravitational search leader particle swarm algorithm (GSLPSO) with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is proposed for photovoltaic charging under sufficient light. And when there is insufficient light or at night, an iterative learning-based charging mode switching method is designed to automatically switch to electric vehicles for charging. If conditions permitted, the system will prioritize the support of AC outlets for replenishment. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, a multi-mode power replenishment system model is established in MATLAB/Simulink, and the simulation results show that the system can effectively improve the efficiency of replenishment of emergency repair power supply, and significantly reduce the pollution and cost.</jats:p>",

The envisioned system includes an Air Handling Unit (AHU), Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV), daily Thermal Energy Storage (TES), and daily Domestic Hot Water (DHW). The main objective is to satisfy the greenhouse heating, cooling, and dehumidification loads, for the considered application, while minimizing energy consumption. This analysis is conducted using data extracted from a case study of a commercial, multi-zone greenhouse, considering different daily weather conditions throughout a year. To reduce the computation time, a clustering approach based on the K-Means method is applied to obtain a small number of typical weather days. Elbow, Dendrogram, and Silhouette approaches confirmed that it is possible to represent a year as six different Typical Days (TD), which can be further categorized as Heating only (TD1 and TD2), Heating/Cooling (TD3 and TD4), and Cooling only (TD5 and TD6). Dynamic Pinch Approach (DPA) showed a great ability to target the minimum energy consumption and maximize the potential heat recovery for each typical day. The study focuses on energy targeting, with discussion of preliminary design considerations, such as the solar hot water (SHW) system, Thermal Energy Storage (TES), and heat pumping. Results revealed that mine water can significantly improve the energy system efficiency, specifically where heating/cooling or only cooling is dominant (TD3, TD4, TD5, and TD6). For instance, by integrating an AHU with the greenhouse for the TDs where heating/cooling is dominant, 22.5% energy saving is achievable. The incorporation of heat pumping, waste heat recovery, and solar thermal collectors through mixed direct/indirect heat recovery (i.e. via TES) can reduce hot utility usage in the considered application by as much as 40%. </jats:p>",

And, in the model that does not employ blockchain technology, mechanisms are used to make the benefits of centralized and decentralized decision-making symmetrical. Consumers often have varied psychological expectations when choosing products. This paper considers the reference quality effect, where consumers establish a reference quality before making a purchase decision. However, the lack of transparency in product sales across supply chain channels can lead to a disparity between actual and expected product quality, impacting market demand and brand reputation. Therefore, manufacturers must balance increasing profits with meeting consumer demand for product traceability. This paper focuses on a dual-channel supply chain model involving manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. Firstly, the pricing issues and channel selections under centralized decision-making and a Stackelberg game with decentralized decision-making are comparatively analyzed in the mode of without adopting blockchain technology and adopt two-part pricing contract to coordinate. Secondly, the impact of blockchain technology on pricing is examined when it is adopted. Thirdly, pricing issues and channel selection strategies based on actual product quality in the dual-channel supply chain are compared under both models. Finally, numerical simulations validate the findings. The study found that: (1) the reference quality effect has a cross-positive influence on the equilibrium price and profit of a dual-channel supply chain; (2) the two-part pricing contract can mitigate the double-marginal effect and enhance profits; and (3) the adoption of the blockchain technology leads to increased equilibrium prices and total profits in the dual-channel supply chain compared to not using it. This paper offers a theoretical foundation for manufacturers and retailers to develop effective pricing and channel selection strategies in dual-channel operations to achieve higher returns.</jats:p>"

Байкал в пределах Кабанского, Прибайкальского,   Баргузинского и Северо-Байкальского районов Республики Бурятия. Выявлено, что   численность населения, проживающего в центральной экологической зоне   Байкальской природной территории (в пределах Республики Бурятия), составляет   6,9 % от всего населения Республики. По данным государственной статистической   отчетности, наибольший объем воды потребляют Кабанский и Северо-Байкальский   районы, в основном из подземных источников, в Баргузинском и Прибайкальском   преобладает использование поверхностных вод. На рассматриваемой территории   централизованное водоснабжение присутствует только в крупных населенных   пунктах, таких как города Северобайкальск, Бабушкин, пгт Усть-Баргузин, с.   Выдрино, пос. Нижнеангарск, в остальных преобладают источники   децентрализованного водоснабжения. По данным государственного мониторинга   состояния недр, обеспеченность прогнозно-эксплуатационными ресурсами   подземных вод питьевого качества является очень высокой. Проведено   ранжирование населенных пунктов прибрежной зоны оз. Байкал по удельному весу   населения, обеспеченного питьевой водой, отвечающей требованиям санитарного   законодательства, в результате которого выявлено, что 99 % населения   Северо-Байкальского района потребляют доброкачественную воду, а в остальных   районах в сельских поселениях ситуация складывается не лучшим образом. В   последние годы благодаря федеральной программе «Чистая вода» многие населенные   пункты были обустроены водопроводными сетями, также планируется строительство   и реконструкция водозаборных сооружений, что позволит снизить риск   потребления недоброкачественной питьевой воды.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The issues of high-quality drinking water supply in   the settlements of the coastal zone of Lake Baikal within the Kabanskii,   Pribaikalskii, Barguzinskii and Severo-Baikalskii districts of the Republic   of Buryatia are discussed in this article. The number of people living in the   Central Ecological Zone (within the Republic of Buryatia) makes up 6,9 % of   the total population of the republic. According to the state statistical   reporting, the Kabanskii and Severo-Baikalskii districts consume the largest   volume of water, mainly from underground sources, in the Barguzinskii and   Pribaikalskii districts, and the use of surface water prevails. In the   territory under consideration, centralized water supply is provided only in large   settlements, such as the cities of Severobaikalsk and Babushkin, the village   of Vydrino, and the Ust-Barguzin and Nizhneangarsk urban settlements, and the   others are dominated by sources of decentralized water supply. An analysis of   the water supply of the population showed that fluctuations in the Lake   Baikal level affect both the quality and quantity of water used for domestic   and drinking needs; in addition, as a result of an increase in the water   level, water intakes may be subject to flooding, which may lead to a   deterioration in sanitary and hygienic indicators. According to the state   monitoring of the conditions of subsurface resources, the availability of   predictive and operational resources of groundwater of drinking quality is   very high. The ranking of the settlements of the Lake Baikal coastal zone in   terms of the population proportion provided with drinking water that meets   the requirements of sanitary legislation, as a result of which it was   revealed that 99 % of the Severo-Baikalskii district population consume   good-quality water, and in the other areas in rural settlements the situation   is not the best way. In recent years, thanks to the “Clean Water” federal   program, many settlements have been equipped with water supply networks, and   it is also planned to build and reconstruct water intake facilities, which   will reduce the risk of poor-quality drinking water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hydrogen as a renewable energy source is increasingly important in efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition to clean energy. Many power plants are equipped with hydrogen plants that produce hydrogen gas continuously, but excess hydrogen is often disposed of when storage reaches maximum capacity. This study proposes the use of excess hydrogen to power fuel cells as a backup energy source in various important facilities, such as commercial centres, fitness, and health services. Hydrogen fuel cells offer the main advantage of zero-emission operation, making them an ideal solution for improving energy sustainability. By using previously discarded hydrogen, not only energy waste can be minimized, but it also opens new business opportunities in the sale and rental of fuel cell systems to consumers who care about their carbon footprint and clean energy. The hydrogen gas productivity at a power plant reaches 88.8 kg/day, and the potential excess hydrogen gas at a power plant reaches 48.84 kg/day. One kilogram of hydrogen gas can generate 15 to 20 kWh of electrical energy. The study also examines potential business models that focus on the utilization of hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as solar, hydro, and geothermal. In addition, the analysis shows that the application of fuel cells for backup energy systems in strategic locations can reduce dependence on conventional energy that generates emissions. The use of this technology has great potential to support green energy infrastructure in Indonesia and is in line with global initiatives towards reducing carbon emissions. With the cost of hydrogen production getting lower and the growing awareness of the importance of clean energy, this approach is expected to play a significant role in achieving sustainable energy targets.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) as the research area, quantifies the tourism supply index (TSI) and tourism demand index (TDI) from 2011 to 2020 using the tourism development index model, calculates the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of TSI and TDI based on the coupling coordination model, and explores the factors influencing the CCD using the geographic detector. The findings indicate that: (1) The TSI and TDI in various provinces show fluctuation but exhibit an overall upward trend. (2) There were apparent spatial disparities of the CCD, with a distribution characteristic of high in the east and low in other regions. The CCD gradually improved, with its gravity center slowly shifting toward the southwest. All provinces entered the intermediate stage of tourism development since 2014. (3) Basic service guarantee, consumption drive, and innovation drive are identified as the dominant factors influencing the CCD. The study can provide valuable insights for tourism coordination and sustainable development.</jats:p>"

At the stage of selecting the location of energy storage, a comprehensive power flow sensitivity variance (CPFSV) is defined to determine the location of the energy storage. At the energy storage capacity configuration stage, the energy storage capacity is optimized by considering the benefits of peak shaving and valley filling, energy storage costs, and distribution network voltage deviations. Finally, simulations are conducted using a modified IEEE-33-node system, and the results obtained using the improved beluga whale optimization algorithm show that the peak-to-valley difference of the system after the addition of energy storage decreased by 43.7% and 51.1% compared to the original system and the system with EV and PV resources added, respectively. The maximum CPFSV of the system decreased by 52% and 75.1%, respectively. In addition, the engineering value of this method is verified through a real-machine system with 199 nodes in a district of Kunming. Therefore, the energy storage configuration method proposed in this article can provide a reference for solving the outstanding problems caused by the large-scale access of EVs and PVs to the distribution network.</jats:p>"

The hydraulic support faced complex loads while operating on the fully mechanized mining face. To meet the requirement of rapidly following the coal mining machine’s movement, numerous actuators of the hydraulic support frequently performed sequential actions, and the liquid demand of the hydraulic support varied strongly over time, causing the hydraulic system to endure constant pressure and flow shocks, making it difficult to ensure the production efficiency and equipment reliability of comprehensive working face. This study analyzed the pressure and flow characteristics of the liquid supply system during the periodic actions of the hydraulic support. To address the strong time-varying load and liquid demand during the simultaneous actions of the hydraulic support, an Extended State Observer (ESO) was designed for observation and compensation. An Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) method suitable for the configuration of a rapid pump-controlled liquid replenishment and pressure stabilization system was proposed, and a co-simulation model of the mechanical and control systems was developed by comparing indicators such as the pressure fluctuation amplitude and the execution time of the hydraulic support actions. The pressure stabilization control effects of the ADRC method, the PID control method, and the traditional multi-pump coordinated liquid supply mode under typical time-varying conditions were analyzed and compared. A simulation test system was constructed to validate the results, demonstrating that the ADRC rapid fluid replenishment and pressure stabilization control method can suppress load disturbances, reduce the system pressure fluctuation amplitude by 20.8%, and shorten the hydraulic support operation time by 2.6%.</jats:p>"

By combining game theory with complex systems theory, discrete dynamic models for output competition among PM chains under four scenarios are constructed. The Nash equilibrium solution and stability conditions of the models are derived according to the principles of nonlinear dynamics. The stability of the model under the four scenarios, as well as the impacts of the initial output level and comprehensive tax rates on the stability and stability control of the system, are analyzed using numerical simulation methods. Our findings suggest that maintaining system stability requires controlling the initial output levels, the output adjustment speeds, and tariff rates to remain within specific thresholds. When these thresholds are exceeded, the entropy value of the model increases, and the system outputs decisions to enter a chaotic or uncontrollable state via period-doubling bifurcations. When the output adjustment speed of the four PM chains is high, the direct-mail logistics mode exhibits greater stability. Furthermore, under increased tariff rates for CBEC, the bonded warehouse mode has a stronger ability to maintain stability in system output decisions. Conversely, when the general import tax rate increases, the direct-mail mode demonstrates better stability. Regardless of the logistics mode, the information-sharing strategy can enhance the stability of system output decisions, while increased e-commerce platform commission rates tend to reduce stability. Interestingly, the use of a non-information-sharing strategy and the direct-mail logistics mode may be more conducive to increasing the profit levels of overseas manufacturers. Finally, the delayed feedback control method can effectively reduce the entropy value, suppress chaotic phenomena in the system, and restore stability to output decisions from a fluctuating state.</jats:p>"

The problem of the study is to identify the impact of environmental accounting disclosure challenges on supply chains and sustainable development in companies. By taking the experiments of 20 companies and representatives of the study community interested in the topic and using the heuristic study approach through the questionnaire tool and a set of key variables, including the adoption of disclosure on environmental accounting performance (DEAP), supply chain sustainability performance (SCP), Sustainable Development Index (SD), and the (PLS) program, through statistical analysis, the study reached the most important results. The study revealed a positive relationship between the disclosure of environmental accounting performance, improved supply chains, and sustainable development in the companies represented by the study sample in the GCC, where both financial performance and environmental performance contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and supply chains. Accordingly, the study recommends many recommendations, the most important of which are: the need for companies to be encouraged to disclose the performance of environmental accounting as a strategic necessity, promote more sustainable supply chain management, improve financial performance, and effectively contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, thereby enhancing sustainability within companies and across supply chains. The study also recommends the need to continue studies in this aspect, especially in the GCC and East Asian countries, to urge companies to disclose the performance of environmental accounting in their financial statements.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Применение установок рекуперации паров (УРП) является основным способом сокращения выбросов углеводородов из транспортных средств. Однако для их успешной работы газовоздушная смесь (ГВС) должна преодолеть расстояние от заполняемых танкеров или железнодорожных цистерн до аппаратов, в которых собственно и производится сначала отделение углеводородов от воздуха и иных газов, а затем их возврат в жидкую фазу. При эксплуатации установок рекуперации паров нефти и нефтепродуктов нередко приходится сталкиваться с тем, что пропускная способность подводящего газопровода УРП становится недостаточной при наращивании объемов перевалки. Это приводит к тому, что на танкерах частично открывают мастрайзеры, и часть газовоздушной смеси напрямую сбрасывается в атмосферу. В результате проектная величина степени улавливания паров нефти/нефтепродуктов не обеспечивается. Увеличение пропускной способности подводящего газопровода УРП достигается сочетанием снижения гидравлического сопротивления отдельных его элементов и изменением напорно-расходной характеристики нагнетателей ГВС. В статье на примере одного из российских морских терминалов рассматриваются мероприятия по увеличению пропускной способности подводящего газопровода установки рекуперации паров нефти за счет оптимизации межочистного периода детонационных преградителей, изменения количества и схемы включения воздуходувок, а также реконструкции линейной части подводящего газопровода. Установлен численный критерий необходимости очистки детонационных преградителей. На основании сравнительного гидравлического расчета 7 альтернативных вариантов выбрана схема реконструкции подводящего газопровода и блока нагнетателей, обеспечивающая увеличение пропускной способности подводящего газопровода УРП.

However, for their successful operation, the gas-air mixture (GAM) must overcome the distance from the tankers or railway tanks being filled to the apparatuses, in which hydrocarbons are first separated from air and other gases, and then returned to the liquid phase. When operating oil and petroleum product vapor recovery plants, it is often necessary to face the fact that the capacity of the VRU supply gas pipeline becomes insufficient with increasing transshipment volumes. This leads to the fact that the mastrisers are partially opened on tankers, and part of the gas-air mixture is directly discharged into the atmosphere. As a result, the design value of the degree of vapor capture of oil/petroleum products is not provided. An increase in the throughput of the VRU supply gas pipeline is achieved by a combination of reducing the hydraulic resistance of its individual elements and changing the pressure and flow characteristics of GAM superchargers. Using the example of one of the Russian marine terminals, the article discusses measures to increase the capacity of the oil vapor recovery unit’s supply gas pipeline by optimizing the intertreatment period of detonation barriers, changing the number and switching scheme of blowers, as well as reconstructing the linear part of the supply gas pipeline. A numerical criterion for the need to clean detonation barriers has been established. Based on a comparative hydraulic calculation of 7 alternative options, a scheme for the reconstruction of the supply gas pipeline and the supercharger block was selected, which provides an increase in the capacity of the supply gas pipeline of the VRU. The results obtained can be used to substantiate technical solutions to increase the capacity of the supply gas pipeline of steam recovery plants at other terminals for loading oil and petroleum products into vehicles.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>AC/DC hybrid distribution networks with power electronic transformers (PETs) as distribution hubs are in line with the future development direction of the AC/DC hybrid distribution network. Unlike traditional transformers, power electronic transformers introduce new node types and may transform the network topology from radial to ring structures. These changes render traditional power flow calculation methods inadequate for achieving satisfactory results in AC/DC hybrid networks. In addition, existing commercial power flow calculation software packages are mainly based on the traditional AC power flow calculation method, which have limited support for the DC network. Especially when the DC network is coupled with the AC network, it is difficult to achieve a unified calculation of its power flow. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel power flow calculation method for ring AC/DC hybrid distribution networks with power electronic transformers. The proposed method is based on the alternating iterative method to ensure compatibility with mature AC power flow calculation programs in commercial software, thereby improving the feasibility of engineering applications. Firstly, the steady-state power flow calculation model of PET is constructed by analyzing that the working principle and control modes of power electronic transformer are proposed based on the source-load attributes of its connected subnetworks. According to the characteristics of the power electronic transformer, AC distribution network, and DC distribution network, a hybrid alternating iteration method combining the high computational accuracy of the Newton–Raphson (NR) method with the high efficiency of the Zbus Gaussian method in dealing with ring networks is proposed. On this basis, the power flow calculation model of the AC/DC hybrid distribution network with power electronic transformers is established. Finally, the simulation of the constructed 44-node ring AC/DC hybrid distribution network example is carried out. The simulation results show that the proposed method can not only converge reliably when the convergence accuracy is 1 × 10−6 p.u., but also ensure that the voltage magnitudes of all nodes are above 0.96 p.u. whose maximum offset value is 0.789% when the outputs of the connected distributed generations fluctuate, which verifies the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

This is especially important given the complexity of aircraft manufacturing, the globalization of supply chains, and the requirement to meet stringent regulatory standards. While outsourcing is widely adopted to improve cost competitiveness, it also introduces risks, such as compromised product quality, inefficiency, and delays. Methods: This study explores how aerospace firms manage outsourcing relationships using control mechanisms. Data were gathered through seven semi-structured interviews with supply chain managers from contracting and supplier firms focusing on both formal and informal controls in supplier selection and relationship management. Results: Supplier selection is primarily guided by trust, past performance, and delivery reliability. Firms employ formal controls, such as KPIs and certifications, alongside informal practices, including embedding internal staff within supplier operations. This dual approach ensures quality, mitigates risks, and maintains compliance with regulatory standards. Conclusions: This study concludes that combining formal and informal controls is vital for balancing outsourcing efficiency with risk mitigation, offering valuable insights into supply chain management practices in regulated industries like aerospace.</jats:p>"

The general analysis model of the proposed transmitter and the numerical calculation method for mutual inductance between energy transceivers are established.

We consider the evidence of rice and cotton cultivation to be important. Almost all authors attest to the river flowing near the walls of the city of Dvin and the water sources of the city. In some parts of the city walls and the citadel of Dvin, traces of the surrounding water ditch, which was once filled with the waters of the Azat River, are clearly visible. Parts of that system continue to be used for different purposes and to various degrees.\n\nAs a result of the excavations carried out in Dvin in 2022–2023, the sediment of the water supply ditch, which is 12 m wide and up to 60 cm thick, was also excavated and examined. According to stratigraphy, the archaeological layer can be dated to the 9th century.\n\nThe network of water pipes of the city is distributed in the area of about 120 hectares. Many distributors, filters, elbows and other structures and artifacts related to water supply systems were also found during the archaeological excavations.</jats:p>",

Moreover, significant drought seasons may create prominent challenges for the communities. The objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to assess household water insecurity experiences and (2) to explore willingness to pay and ability to pay for better water supply for the Lok Dangkaan Village, Pitas district, a remote area with frequent drought climate in Sabah. A structured questionnaire was utilised in a cross-sectional survey of 45 households to gather information on demographics, socioeconomic status, and water-related concerns. The water insecurity was measured using the Household Water Insecurity Experiences Scale (HWISE). While the water consumption and affordability were measured by the ability to pay (ATP) and willingness to pay (WTP), with monthly water bills and water fee indicators respectively. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to analyze the data. The study found that most households engaged in fishing, have low incomes and limited access to basic amenities. Water quality is poor, though waterborne diseases are rare. Eighty-two percent of the households do not have access to clean water. The average estimated daily water consumption is 183.56 litres, with substantial variability. 75.6 percent of the households said they could afford to pay RM0.10 for every 1000 litres. On the other hand, their average monthly water bill during the dry season was RM121.67. The high level of water insecurity in Lok Dangkaan Village underscores the urgent need for improved water access and quality. While the forthcoming mini water treatment plant may address some issues, continued support and targeted interventions are necessary to enhance water security in the community.</jats:p>"

This study, leveraging 2022 trade data and inter-linkage dependencies within the niobium industry, constructs a multi-layer network model and simulates the impact and propagation of supply disruptions under two realistic scenarios: Restrictions on primary product exports and total export bans. Our findings reveal that: (1) Supply constraints on primary products cascade through the middle and downstream trade networks, impacting the final product layer more severely, especially for countries with limited ability to cope with disruptions. (2) China, Malaysia, Brazil, and the United States emerge as crucial risk sources, with their export restrictions potentially triggering a complete collapse of trade networks across all layers. (3) Hidden risk sources include Asian countries like Japan and Korea in the primary product layer, while European nations like the United Kingdom and Germany, despite playing a limited role in upstream disruptions, significantly influence the intermediate and final product layers. These findings underscore the importance of developing feasible systemic risk mitigation strategies, optimizing industrial structures, fostering global cooperation, and ultimately bolstering the robustness and resilience of the global niobium industry chain.</jats:p>"

The analysis confirmed that the damage to hydraulic availability increased rapidly as the earthquake magnitude increased, but the water quality did not deteriorate compared to hydraulic availability. This suggests that the water quality supply risk is low except for extreme interruption in the water supply route. However, if an earthquake of a certain magnitude or greater occurs, the building risk, evacuation risk, fire risk, and water outage risk are at a certain level or higher. When considering the water quality supply risk, the overall comprehensive earthquake risk in urban areas increased. Thus, uniformly applying the weights of all factors in the earthquake risk assessment does not correctly reflect the characteristics and environment of the region, and a process of realistically calculating the weights of each factor through various methods is necessary.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It has become a critical element of modern business due to the increase in environmental issues and\nconsumers' demands for ethical products. This paper observes the nexus between sustainable supply chain strategies\nwith consumer perceptions: how businesses can implement environmentally and socially responsible practices with its\nsupply chain processes to influence consumer behavior. The study outlines the concept of sustainability in supply\nchains, ranging from environmental mitigation, social responsibility, and economic viability. It covers major\nsustainable practices in supply chains, including resource optimization, waste reduction, carbon footprint management,\nethical sourcing, and embracing circular economy principles.\nThe paper then discusses how these practices influence consumer perception. Consumers are increasingly playing a\ndecisive role in the development of a firm's corporate sustainability approach. Thanks to the development of ethical\nconsumption, more and more people now pay attention to the environmental and social consequences of their\npurchasing decisions. Companies are being scrutinized for aspects such as supply chain labor practices, environmental\ndestruction, and traceability of materials by consumers. Consequently, companies have had the ability to become\ndifferentiated competitors, improve brand equity, and tap into a widening market of environmentally and socially\nconscious customers by adopting sustainable practices in their supply chains.The paper uses a review of recent case\nstudies and market research as a means of showing how transparent communication of sustainable supply chain\npractices can help form positive consumer perceptions. For example, it is seen that those businesses that offer specific\nand transparent information regarding product origin and the sustainability of their sourcing are getting higher customer\nsatisfaction ratings along with better brand reputation. Second, using certifications and third-party validations, such as\nFair Trade or LEED, can further increase consumer confidence in the legitimacy of a brand's sustainability claims. On\nthe other hand, the paper also emphasizes the challenges that businesses face in implementing sustainability practices\nthroughout their supply chain. Higher implementation costs, restricted access to sustainable resources, and the intricacy\nof managing sustainability across diverse geographies and industries are some of the challenges. Consumer perceptions\nof sustainability are not always uniform and vary with differing level of understanding, interest, and willingness to pay\na premium for sustainable products across different demographic groups. In summary, while green supply chain\nmanagement has associated ecological and social benefits, it also offers great tools for business communication with\ncustomers, gaining them a grip on the markets with such appealing practices. As consumers gain awareness of social\nand environmental issues, the demand for responsible supply chains is likely to grow, forcing companies to adapt and\ninnovate in their approaches to sustainability. Ultimately, businesses that successfully align their supply chain strategies\nwith consumer expectations can achieve long-term profitability while contributing to global sustainability goal</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The classified water pricing system is an effective measure for promoting the rational utilization of water resources under market mechanisms. Studying the water prices of three different types of water sources, including reservoir water, river water, and wastewater treatment plant effluent, is the basis for promoting the use of reclaimed water. However, there remains a spectrum of viewpoints on how to establish a pricing mechanism for reclaimed water at present. This study primarily focuses on the multi-level quality-separated water supply system in Yiwu City, China. It analyzes the limitations of the current water pricing formation mechanism and the externality of integrating reclaimed water into the unified allocation of multiple water sources. Based on the principles of full-cost water pricing and externality theory, a supply-side classified water pricing permit cost and pricing calculation model, covering the entire process of the social water cycle, is proposed. It focuses on the analysis of the impact of equity costs and environmental costs on supply-side classified water pricing. The Shapley value method is used for the technology of cost allocation among stakeholders to reasonably distribute the calculated water pricing of reclaimed water. The price of reclaimed water varies depending on the user type, with residential users paying 2.93 CNY/t, industrial users 4.00 CNY/t, and government allocations at 8.52 CNY/t. Compared with the classified water prices of various stakeholders on the user side of reservoir water, reclaimed water has a significant price advantage. This research demonstrates that the supply-side classified water pricing model, which includes a permit cost and pricing calculation framework, can encourage the supply of higher-quality water at corresponding higher prices, while also providing the internalization of external costs. Furthermore, the Shapley value method of cost allocation can realize the fair burden of stakeholders on the calculated water price and maintain the competitive advantage of reclaimed water prices.</jats:p>"

This study introduces a graph-theory-based optimization model to analyze the structural and operational dynamics of urban water supply systems, incorporating constraints such as water quality, pressure, and system connectivity. Using Lishui City as a case study, the model evaluates three water allocation plans to meet the projected 2030 water demand. Advanced algorithms, including Floyd’s shortest path algorithm and the GA-COA-SA hybrid optimization algorithm, were employed to address constraints such as pipeline pressure, water quality attenuation, and nonlinear flow dynamics. Results indicate a 1.4% improvement in cost-effectiveness compared to the current allocation strategy, highlighting the model’s capability to enhance efficiency. Among the evaluated options, Plan 2 emerges as the most cost-effective solution, achieving a supply capacity of 4.5920 × 105 m3/d with the lowest annual cost of 5.7015 × 107 yuan, highlighting the model’s capability to improve both efficiency and resilience. This study prioritizes cost-efficiency tailored to regional challenges, distinguishing itself from prior research that emphasized redundancy and water quality analysis. The findings demonstrate the potential of graph-theoretic approaches combined with advanced optimization techniques to enhance decision-making for sustainable urban water management.</jats:p>"

Potassium is vital for sweetpotato growth, boosting tuber size, sweetness, disease resistance, and yield quality, with deficiencies leading to poor tuber formation and increased stress susceptibility. The present study evaluated the effect of varying dosages of potassium fertilizer (Muriate of Potash, MoP) on the growth, yield, and biochemical qualities of sweetpotato. As a genetic material, BAU sweetpotato-5 was chosen as it is recognized for its high yield, short duration, and nutritional advantages. There were three treatments—full dosage of MoP (321.6 kg ha−1, T0), half dosage of MoP (160.8 kg ha−1, T1) and no MoP (T2). Four replications of a randomized complete block design (RCBD) were used in the experiment. According to analysis of variance, the morphological and biochemical parameters, such as the fresh weight plant−1, number of tuber plant−1, chlorophyll content, total phenolic content, vitamin C, carotenoid, anthocyanin, Zn, and Fe content varied significantly among treatments. The application of the full recommended dosage of MoP resulted in the highest values for several traits, including the fresh weight plant−1, number of tuber plant−1, chlorophyll content, carotenoid, anthocyanin, and Fe content. Conversely, total phenolic content and vitamin C were highest without MoP application. Principal component analysis (PCA) differentiated treatment T0 from T1 and T2 due to higher positive coefficients of the number of leaves at 115 days after transplantation, vine length at 115 days after transplantation, number of branches, stem diameter, fresh weight plant−1, tuber length, tuber diameter, tuber weight, number of tuber plant−1, SPAD, carotenoid, anthocyanin, Fe, and negative coefficients of total phenolic content, vitamin C, and Zn. The findings suggest that potassium is integral to maximizing both yield and key nutritional components in sweetpotato cultivation.</jats:p>"

This study employs response surface analysis and cluster analysis to examine the data of Chinese listed firms and their supply chains from 2009 to 2022. From the dyadic perspective of customer–supplier, the results suggest that the congruence of customer and supplier ESG performance reduces customers' financial constraints while increasing suppliers' financial constraints. The reduction in customers' financial constraints enhances customers' firm value. This study further reveals different configuration patterns of ESG performance within the supply chain from the triadic perspective of customer–focal firm–supplier. Our findings enrich the empirical research on ESG performance within supply chains, offering significant insights for managers and investors in allocating supply chain resources and formulating ESG investment strategies.</jats:p>",

However, these by-products, such as pomace, wastewater, and biomass, also offer valuable opportunities for implementing a circular economy (CE) model that enhances sustainability. Despite increasing attention to the valorization of these by-products, understanding of the indicators used to measure circularity in this context remains limited. This systematic review examined the existing literature on circular economy indicators employed to assess the use of by-products in the olive oil supply chain. The aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of the most suitable indicators in this sector, while identifying best practices for quantifying and monitoring progress towards a more circular system. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and bibliometric analysis was conducted using CiteSpace 6.4 R1 software. The results highlighted a key indicator, the Material Circularity Indicator (MCI). Additionally, methodologies such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and water footprint (WF) were evaluated, while challenges were identified, including the need for standardized metrics and improved data collection across the supply chain.

The relevance of this methodology is underscored by the need for organizations to enhance the effectiveness of management decisions through such analytical frameworks. The novelty of this work lies in the adaptation of classical deterministic analysis models to the specific context of power supply companies, taking into account the peculiarities of their financial and economic activities. A plan-fact analysis of the budget execution of the power supply company was conducted using the chain substitution method, which was implemented across all types of deterministic factor models: additive, multiplicative, multiple, and mixed (combined). This analytical approach enabled the determination of the impact of individual factors on the variation of the performance indicator by gradually substituting the baseline value of each factor indicator within the performance measure with the actual value for the reporting period. The authors conclude that the proposed methodology facilitates the analysis of changes in the performance indicator (marginal profit) attributable to factors of the I, II, III levels. It is applied in practice for the formulation of managerial reporting and the adjustment of the marketing policy of the power supply company operating at the territory of Saint Petersburg.</jats:p>",

The studies used a method of modeling the consumption of unevenly mixed rations by animals, where 25 % of the ration consisted of high-energy components of the mixture in the second experiment, and feeds with a low energy concentration in the third. It was found that when consuming a low-concentrate feed mixture with an energy concentration in the diet of 8.9 MJ/kg dry matter and a crude protein concentration of 9.7 % with a mixing uniformity of 75 % compared to the control diet (100 % mixing uniformity), there were implausible changes in the consumption of nutrients by individual animals. Fluctuations in the apparent digestibility of nutrients throughout the gastrointestinal tract of young cattle ranged from 2 % to 6 % when consuming a feed mixture with a mixing uniformity of 75 %. On the high-nutrient diet, the digestibility of crude protein and crude fiber increased by 14% and 9 %, respectively. On the low-nutrient diet, there was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in digestibility by 5 % for dry matter and organic matter and nitrogen-free extractives, and for crude protein (by 12 %), compared to the high-nutrient diet. The provision of animals with energy and protein significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01) on the high-nutrient diet by 34.7 % and 11.5 %, respectively. Consumption of the low-nutrient diet had practically no effect on energy content. When feeding a feed mixture with a 75 % mixing uniformity on a low-nutrient diet, a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity was observed by 42 %, a high-nutrient diet significantly affected the increase in erythrocyte content by 7.9 %, while most hematological and biochemical blood parameters of heifers fluctuated within the physiological norm for animals of this age.</jats:p>",

The Water Evaluation and Planning Tool (WEAP) model was utilized to analyze both current and projected domestic water distribution in the region through 2030. Initially, an assessment of current water demand and supply for household use was conducted. Relevant data were collected from a local branch of the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture (MEWA) in Baljurashi Governorate. This data was input into the WEAP model, which then produced projections for water demand, supplied resources, and unmet needs based on the reference scenario pertaining to the current accounting year. The findings revealed no unmet water demand, according to the model results. To enhance future water availability, the expansion of the Um-ghaith reservoir as a new water source is to be taken into consideration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article discusses the possibilities of using foresight analysis methods in relation to the issue of food supply. Taking into account the fact that food markets are a rather complex object of study, and food supply depends not only on quantitative (volume of consumption, total calorie intake), but also qualitative parameters (quality of nutrition, structure and macronutrient composition of the food basket, provision of micronutrients, etc.), using only quantitative, economic and statistical methods for analysis is inappropriate. The best effect can be achieved by foresight techniques that take into account non-trivial, deep connections and allow a more comprehensive look at the phenomenon under consideration.\nTaking into account the above, the authors systematized modern approaches to foresight analysis, considered the most effective methods, such as identifying weak signals and wild card events, and also identified the features of using these methodological approaches for analyzing food markets, which are subject to a wide range of difficult to predict climatic and technogenic factors, as well as factors of geopolitical and macroeconomic nature. An emphasis on identifying implicit connections, and also predicting key reference points that can have a decisive impact on the development of food markets, can help improve economic resilience in the face of emerging global food crises.\nThus, the study allows us to conclude that the use of modern foresight analysis methods for studying food supply issues is highly relevant. Identification of weak signals and wild card events can allow a more rational and realistic approach to constructing scenarios for the development of food industry sectors, as well as early identification of potential threats that could destabilize the situation and have a significant negative impact on the level of food supply, both at the level of individual countries and in the world at large.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the power sources for wearable electronic devices most often work with electrical energy obtained from the environment without using standard batteries. This paper presents the structure and electrical parameters of a circuit configuration realized as a prototype of a low-power AC-DC conversion circuit intended for use as a power supply device for signal processing systems that test various biomedical parameters of the human body. The proposed prototype has to work as a wearable self-powered system that transfers electrical energy obtained through mechanical vibrations in the piezoelectric generator. The obtained electrical energy is used to charge a single low-voltage supercapacitor, which is used as an energy storage element. The proposed circuit configuration is realized with discrete components consisting of a low-voltage bridge rectifier, a low-pass filter, a DC-DC step-down (buck) synchronous converter, a power-controlling system with an error amplifier, and a window detector that produces a “power-good” signal. The power-controlling system allows tuning the output voltage level to around 1.8 V, and the power dissipation for it is less than 0.03 mW. The coefficient of energy efficiency achieved up to 78% for output power levels up to 3.6 mW. Experimental testing was conducted to verify the proposed AC-DC conversion circuit’s effectiveness, as the results confirmed the preliminary theoretical analyses and the derived analytical expressions for the primary electrical parameters.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Driven by the servicing and digital transformation of manufacturing enterprises, product and service innovation for manufacturers and service providers to promote integrated solutions collaboratively has become an important way for enterprises to maintain market competitiveness. Building on this foundation, this paper develops an innovation priority decision model for the product–service supply chain, which comprises manufacturers and service providers, considering the data mining and information sharing strategies of service providers. It analyzes the optimal decisions and profits of the members when product innovation is prioritized as well as when service innovation is prioritized, and subsequently explores the selection of innovation strategies for the product–service supply chain under varying conditions. The results of the study show that, firstly, service providers’ data mining and information sharing strategies are not always favorable to the innovation decisions of both parties. Only when data resources can be transformed into real innovation value at a reasonable cost can data mining and information sharing play the role of ‘external incentives’ to promote collaborative innovation between the two parties. Secondly, when service providers do not adopt data mining and information sharing strategies, the efficiency of product and service innovation plays a decisive role in innovation prioritization. The party with high innovation efficiency adopts the sub-priority innovation strategy, which can lead to a larger market share for the innovation results. Finally, under the service provider’s data mining and information sharing strategy, the innovation priority selection of the product–service supply chain depends on the information value transformation ability of the manufacturer and the service provider. Moreover, the profits of manufacturers and service providers under the same innovation priority do not always ‘advance or retreat together’, and there may be cases where one of them suffers a loss of profits. This study provides a theoretical basis for the choice of innovation strategies given to manufacturers and service providers, and promotes the development of collaborative innovation between them.</jats:p>"

The nonnodulated lateral roots were treated with excessive nitrate (200 mg·L−1 nitrogen) for three days, followed by a three-day nitrate withdrawal, and then subjected to excessive nitrate again for another three days. Meanwhile, the nodulated side was continuously supplied with nitrogen-free nutrient solution. We measured the nitrogenase activity, nodule quantity, and concentrations of sucrose, starch, and soluble sugars, along with the microstructure of the nodules. By analyzing these data, we aim to provide theoretical insights into how indirect nitrate supply affects the nitrogen fixation capacity of nodules. The results demonstrated that indirect supply of nitrate to the soybean nodules reduced the nodule nitrogen fixation ability, which was manifested in the decrease in nodule dry weight, nodule number, and nitrogenase activity. The reason was found to be related to the decrease in carbon sources (sucrose, starch, and soluble sugar) allocated to the nodules. Further observation of the internal structure of the nodules found that the number of infected cells in the nodules decreased with the addition of nitrate, and increased with its withdrawal. However, the addition and withdrawal of nitrate did not change the effect of nitrate on the structure of infected cells around the nodules after the first addition of nitrate. These may be one of the important reasons why nitrate indirectly affects the activity of nitrogenase in nodules.</jats:p>"

The analysis begins by exploring the impacts of each party’s respective biases. The results indicate that while seller optimism generally leads to self-detrimental outcomes, it can also benefit both the platform and the overall system. Conversely, platform optimism does not permanently harm the platform itself but consistently disadvantages the seller and negatively impacts the supply chain. This work then investigates the combined effects of seller and platform optimism on overall system performance, revealing that the entire channel can, in fact, gain from optimism bias. This research offers insights into strategic approaches that may enhance the efficiency of online retail supply chains.</jats:p>"

This algorithm effectively separates mixed leak sources and accurately estimates the delays of source propagation. Signal simulations confirm the algorithm's effectiveness, revealing that the distribution of leak positions, signal‐to‐noise ratio, and frequency characteristics of the leakage source all influence the algorithm's performance. Comparative analysis demonstrates the algorithm's capability to eliminate signal interactions, facilitating the localization of multiple leaks.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid development of the modern automotive industry and increasing requirements for environmental friendliness, energy efficiency, and economy necessitate the development of new control systems for internal combustion engines (ICEs). A topical issue for the strategic development of road transport is the design of new technologies: a combination of different fuel types and neural control of ICE power supply. The paper analyzes the combination of types of ICE power, namely motor gasoline, diesel, and gaseous fuels, and a neural method of controlling engine power based on operating conditions. A neural approach to optimizing fuel choice by operating conditions is presented. The neural system allows you to automatically adjust the fuel supply parameters using an adaptive PID controller (proportional-integral-differential controller), which adjusts the fuel supply in real time based on external conditions. The neural network can use temperature, load, and engine speed as input parameters. To consider more complex conditions of internal combustion engine operation, the model can be supplemented with vehicle speed, atmospheric pressure, wear of engine parts, and driver reaction. Using multi-layer neural networks allows you to adapt the fuel supply in real-time. The architecture of a neural network for this task may include several layers: an input layer that receives ambient temperature, engine load, engine speed, fuel type, atmospheric pressure, and wear level of parts; a hidden layer that performs nonlinear transformations and makes decisions based on the interaction of parameters; and an output layer that generates a fuel supply control signal. The neural network can be trained based on data from real or simulated conditions, which allows it to predict the most economical mode of operation of the internal combustion engine. Adaptive neural networks can be used to optimize the ratio of fuels. A graphical visualization is performed to help understand that fuel consumption depends on temperature and load for each fuel type.

It draws attention to the growing significance of technical advancements like\nartificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data analytics. These advancements allow for improved\ndecision-making, real-time tracking, and increased supply chain visibility.

The results imply that improving transportation logistics not only\nresults in significant cost savings but also strengthens the sustainability and resilience of international supply chains.\nMultimodal transportation—a combination of land, sea, and air transportation—is emphasized as a successful strategy\nfor cost optimization because it chooses the most cost-effective routes and modes according to the particular\nrequirements of the shipment. For large-volume shipments, air freight delivers goods more quickly but at a greater cost,\nwhereas sea freight is more economical but requires longer transit durations.

This study is focused on developing an optimised structure in order to maximise the potential of the device and provide a lightweight and robust novel design. For this purpose, initial studies on the system involved 2D CFD simulations combined with parametric optimisation, which validated the use of the turbine system with water as the working fluid. The obtained component geometries were then used for the creation of a 3D CFD model, which was tested in a set-up dynamic simulation environment. Subsequently, the performance of the system was evaluated through the use of referenced experimental analyses. By taking into account the loading conditions present at the blades, as well as the inherent typical loads caused by the rotational speed of the turbine, the system was then optimised using generative design processes. Through the applied methodology, the performance of the turbine was predicted to be 61.79%. Moreover, the generative design optimisation showed a reduction in mass of 60.226% for the blade structure and 69.523% for the rotor structure.</jats:p>"

In high-voltage power supply operation, the firing discharge phenomenon occurs. Current transformers fire signal into a current signal through the firing voltage value and Zener diode voltage comparison to set the safety threshold; when the threshold is exceeded, the fire protection mechanism is activated, reducing the power supply voltage output to protect the high-voltage power supply system. When the ignition signal disappears, based on the IGWO-PID control of the ignition self-recovery circuit according to the feedback voltage, the DC supply voltage of the high-voltage power supply is adjusted, inhibiting the ignition discharge and, according to the ignition signal, “segmented” to restore the output of the initial voltage. MATLAB/Simulink was used to establish a system simulation model and physical platform test. The results show that the protection effect of the designed scheme is an improvement, in line with the needs of practical work.</jats:p>"

Recently, it has been suggested that climate warming causes rifts between flower and pollinator phenology. To what extent the progression of pollinators matches the availability of flowers in the Arctic season is poorly known. In this study, we aimed to characterize the community phenology of flowers and insects in a rapidly changing Arctic environment from a descriptive and functional perspective. To this end, we inferred changes in resource availability from both a plant and an insect point of view, by connecting resource and consumer species through a metaweb of all the plant–insect interactions ever observed at a site. Specifically, we: (1) characterized species‐specific phenology among plants and insects at two High‐Arctic sites—Cambridge Bay in Nunavut, Canada, and Zackenberg in Northeast Greenland; (2) quantified competition for flowers using sticky flower mimics; (3) used information on plant–pollinator interactions to quantify supply and demand for pollinator services versus flower resources during the summer; and (4) compared patterns observed within a focal summer at each site to patterns of long‐term change at Zackenberg, using a 25‐year time series of plant flowering and insect phenology. Within summers, we found evidence of a general mismatch between supply and demand. Over the 25‐year time series, the number of weeks per summer when resource supply fell below a standardized threshold increased significantly over time. In addition, variation in resource availability increased significantly over years. We suggest that the number of resource‐poor weeks per year is increasing and becoming less predictable in the High Arctic. This will have important implications for plant pollination, pollinator fitness, and the future of the Arctic ecosystem, as both plants and their pollinators are faced with widening resource gaps.</jats:p>",

(2) Mechanism analysis reveals that supplier transaction volatility raises the level of corporate tax burden by increasing operational risk and relationship maintenance costs. (3) Further analysis indicates that the volatility of major supplier transactions exacerbates corporate income tax burdens, while the impact of customer transaction fluctuations on the tax burden is more pronounced for non-state-owned enterprises, and state-owned enterprises experience a suppressive effect on value-added tax from customer transaction volatility.

Attempts at weeding off TBAs have been firmly resisted by their clients who have developed confidence and trust in their services and herald them as first and trusted responders to child delivery cases. Unfortunately, recent evidence has shown that TBAs in servicing public trust and for other reasons, often do not timely refer their clients to the closest source of formal healthcare–primary healthcare centres (PHCs). Looking into the motivations for these reasons is the crux of the current study. Data were collected through qualitative interviews with 85 respondents across three states in Nigeria. The qualitative data comprised of 73 in-depth interviews and 12 focus group discussions<jats:bold>.</jats:bold> Respondents were TBAs and other informal health providers, formal health workers, policymakers, community leaders and service users. Data were analysed thematically to explore the demand and supply determinants of referrals from TBAs to the formal healthcare providers. Demand side factors that constrain referrals from TBAs to PHCs were community preference for TBAs, and cultural and religious inclinations of the consumers to TBAs’ practices of infusing religious teachings and rules into the process of child delivery. Supply-side factors were infrastructural deficits, staff shortages and lack of sanctions for poor practices in PHCs. Demand and supply-side factors constrain the referral of pregnant women from TBAs to the PHC facility for child delivery. These factors should be addressed, and innovative interventions used to link the TBAs to the formal health system for increased institutional deliveries with skilled birth attendants.

Additionally, the CA–Markov model and the gray prediction model were deployed to forecast Lanzhou's future water and soil resource capacity. The evaluation from 2010 to 2022 indicates consistent classification at overloaded or severely overloaded levels, highlighting systemic inefficiency in water and soil resource utilization, which poses a significant obstacle to sustainability. Notably, urbanization rate, water productivity coefficient, and per capita water resources were identified as key factors influencing these results. Based on the forecast for the next 5 years (2023–2027), the water and soil resource capacity of Lanzhou is expected to further decline, posing challenges to sustainable development. This study provides technical support and decision-making guidance for the formulation of Lanzhou's water and soil resource management strategies and sustainable development planning, playing a key role in promoting efficient resource utilization and protecting regional water and soil resources.</jats:p>",

Examining the ecosystem windbreak and sand fixation service (WSFS) from the perspectives of supply and demand plays a crucial role in the continuous regulation of regional wind erosion. Through the enhancement of the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) model, integrated with uncertainty analysis, scenario simulation, and environmental factors calculation, the dynamic simulation of the supply of ecosystem windbreak and sand fixation service (WSFSS) and the demand of ecosystem windbreak and sand fixation service (WSFSD) in the Wuding River Basin in China was achieved, and specifically, a simulation framework for WSFSD and WSFSS was constructed. The results show that: (1) the uncertainty analysis can calculate the upper and lower limits of the range of parameter x (downwind distance) in the RWEQ model, and changes in the parameter x can make the simulation results of WSFSS and WSFSD more reasonable; (2) In the past 20 years, the WSFSS has shown a spatial distribution pattern of high in the northwest and low in the southeast. In terms of time, the annual WSFSS has shown a fluctuating growth trend with a growth rate of 8.06 t/a. The monthly WSFSS has shown a rising-fluctuating-declining trend; (3) The rationality of WSFSD was indirectly verified through the setting of scenario simulation. In terms of time, across the 252 months under study (January 2000–December 2020), 85% of the months witnessed WSFSD within the range of 1.0–1.4 kg/m2 in the Wuding River Basin.

First, we propose that Bertola’s and Teunissen’s concept of Fashion 4.0 offers a powerful framework for understanding the organization of global fashion today. This model emphasizes the dynamic, decentralized and technology-driven character of the ‘smart factories’, ‘smart networks’ and ‘smart products’ that dominate the global fashion industry. The value of this framework is illustrated with contemporary examples from the UK. Second, we argue that increasing regulatory demands impose uncertain and costly compliance obligations on firms across multiple aspects of their operations and supply chain. Our discussion highlights the confluence of challenges related to intellectual property, value chain monitoring and AI regulation. We contend that smaller and medium-sized enterprises, particularly emerging designers, are disproportionately affected by this regulatory burden—a phenomenon we term the ‘tragic character’ of contemporary compliance. Finally, we explore how the challenge of navigating an increasingly complex business and regulatory landscape necessitates the deployment of ever-more sophisticated digital technologies, especially AI. We outline several potential applications of such technologies across the fashion industry. In conclusion, we suggest that in the context of Fashion 4.0, understanding the interaction between different regulatory schemes, as well as their effects on industry stakeholders, is becoming critical yet increasingly complex and opaque. This raises difficult questions about the limits of law and other regulatory schemes in fostering innovative, sustainable, and socially responsible business practices in the fashion sector.</jats:p>",

However, live streamers’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been overlooked in existing studies. This paper examines the CSR investment strategy for the brand owner and live streamer considering the effect of consumer preference and power structure within live-streaming supply chains (LSSCs). To achieve this objective, we develop different Stackelberg game models to examine CSR investment strategy in an LSSC by focusing on whether either firm can be the LSSC leader or invest in CSR. Additionally, the impact of CSR investment strategy on consumers and both firms of LSSC investing in CSR are analyzed. Our findings reveal that regardless of who the LSSC leader or CSR investor is, CSR investment benefits both LSSC firms, and the LSSC leader (brand owner or live streamer) always benefits more from investing in CSR. However, the LSSC follower investing in CSR benefits consumers. Moreover, either one of the LSSC firms prefers the other firm to invest in CSR when consumer sensitivity is low; otherwise, it prefers investing in CSR by itself. Finally, our research highlights that both firms investing in CSR can achieve win-win outcomes for LSSC members and consumers. These findings provide implications for LSSC firms in CSR investment strategies considering different consumer preferences.</jats:p>"

In this study, oxygen supply prediction models based on the K-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm were developed and compared using actual production data from the BOF. To further improve the accuracy of oxygen supply predictions for the BOF, this study optimises the algorithm using two methods: distance weighting and feature vector weighting based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. Experimental results indicate that the feature vector weighting method based on the Pearson correlation coefficient achieves better optimisation results compared to the distance weighting KNN algorithm. The prediction accuracy for oxygen supply reached 77.6% for an oxygen consumption error within ±200 Nm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, 89.8% for ±300 Nm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, and 95.7% for ±400 Nm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>; additionally, this optimisation improved the endpoint hit rate for oxygen supply by 10.3% compared to the original algorithm. This model provides an effective reference for actual production and offers reliable insights for optimising other algorithms. Future research could further explore the application of other machine learning algorithms in oxygen supply prediction to achieve higher accuracy and broader applicability, thereby advancing the intelligent development of the BOF steelmaking process. </jats:p>"

However, it has been observed that the DC output voltage decreases with an increasing air gap between the rotor magnet and HTS stator. To increase the output of the HTS dynamo at a fixed gap, this study employs an efficient numerical model based on the equivalent current method to investigate the magnetic field distribution of the magnets with different structural parameters. The relationship between the magnetic field distribution of the rotor magnet and the open-circuit voltage of the stator is established and extensively validated against simulation modeling and experimental data. Experimental results indicate that the rotor’s magnetic field distribution and the stator’s magnetic field penetration influence the open-circuit voltage of the HTS dynamo. Specifically, when the distance between adjacent magnets is large, the magnetic field penetration occurs only on both sides of the stator, causing circuit voltage to increase initially and then decrease with the magnet distance decreases. A reverse point opposite to the magnetic field direction on both sides is generated at the center of the stator when the distance decreases further, which increases the average induced current density, and suppresses the downward trend. By optimizing the magnetic field distribution of the rotor magnets on the stator, the DC output power of the dynamo can be effectively improved. This model and the results contained in this article provide a comprehensive theoretical basis for researchers to compare and optimize their own modeling and experiment of the HTS dynamo.</jats:p>",

In this research, a sand column model was designed to investigate the SS-algae combined clogging mechanism in the porous medium during the Yellow River water recharge in the Yufuhe River channel of NCP. The SS-algae combined plugging of the medium appeared earlier and the plugging degree was more serious compared with the SS-only clogging and the algae-only clogging during the infiltration. Meanwhile, the surface clogging degree of the medium is more serious, and the interior is smaller in comparison to the SS-only group and the algae-only group. The filter cake and algae mat are the signs of SS clogging and algae clogging, and the algae mat structure in the SS-algae group is more dense compared to the algae-only group. In the combined clogging experiment, the outflow concentration of SS and algae in the medium is less than the SS-only group and the algae-only group. In addition, algae and SS can limit each other's migration in the medium.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to explore anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of cassava (EUM) and poultry (FP) effluents using one inoculum/substrate ratio (30%) and three EUM vs. FP substrate composition ratios (25:75, 50:50, and 75:25). The AcoD process was therefore designed for 20 L batch digesters, under mesophilic conditions, with less than 5% total solids for 66 days. The results showed that EUMs were highly resistant to degradation, while FPs were the most easily degradable. Kinetic analysis indicated specific organic matter (MO) reduction rates of 0.28% per day for EUM and 0.76% per day for FP. EUM alone produced 45.47 mL/g MO, while the 50:50 substrate produced 1184.60 mL/g MOV. The main factors contributing to EUM inefficiency were the inability to tame acidic conditions and the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. AcoD produced 23 to 50 times more methane than EUM alone, 2 to 5 times more than FP alone, and 2 to 4 times more than inoculum. As a result, the AcoD of both types of waste had a qualitative and quantitative effect on biogas production. CH4 content increased from around 2 to 75%, depending on the amount of organic nitrogen added. The addition of nitrogen by AcoD, even under mesophilic conditions, improves the kinetics and quality of anaerobic digestion of low-nitrogen substrates. Its impact on thermophilic and psychrophilic conditions needs to be verified.</jats:p>"

In the experiment, participants estimated jail times for 20 criminal law cases, first without and then with AI advice. Our results show that trust and reliance are significantly higher for high model accuracy. In addition, reliance does not decline over the trial sequence, and trust increases significantly with high accuracy. Human-like (vs. abstract) explanations only increased reliance on the high-accuracy condition. We furthermore tested the extent to which trust and reliance in a trial round can be explained by trust and reliance experiences from prior rounds. We find that trust assessments in prior trials correlate with trust in subsequent ones. We also find that the cumulative trust experience of a person in all earlier trial rounds correlates with trust in subsequent ones. Furthermore, we find that the two trust measures, trust and reliance, impact each other: prior trust beliefs not only influence subsequent trust beliefs but likewise influence subsequent reliance behavior, and vice versa. Executing a replication study yielded comparable results to our original study, thereby enhancing the validity of our findings.\n          </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As a critical financing method, supply chain finance (SCF) plays a vital role in addressing the financing challenges faced by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and in promoting collaborative development within supply chains. However, SCF systems inevitably encounter complex risks of default contagion. Effectively detecting and assessing these risks, along with formulating reasonable financing strategies, are issues of common concern to both the academic and business communities. This study utilizes complex network theory to investigate the guaranteed warehouse financing model in supply chain finance. First, a complex network model of supply chain finance is constructed to analyze the transmission mechanisms of default contagion risk. This model effectively measures the ways and mechanisms of risk propagation. Second, a default probability model is developed to assess the risk magnitude for enterprises following default contagion. This model facilitates risk assessment and control, providing a scientific basis for financing decisions. Third, by constructing an SCF financing model, this study examines the financing decision-making behaviors of banks, manufacturers and retailers under various conditions. It reveals the interactions and interest trade-offs among participants in the guaranteed warehouse financing model. Finally, through simulation analysis, the study investigates the impact of different parameters on supply chain finance strategies. The results offer quantitative guidance for banks in setting loan quotas and provide a theoretical foundation for enterprises to formulate reasonable financing strategies in the guaranteed warehouse financing model. </jats:p>",

This study examined how parental supply is associated with attitudes toward adolescent alcohol use, perceived norms of parental supply, perceived behavioural control and perceived acceptable age to drink alcohol. A total of 1197 Australian parents with children aged 12–17 years completed an online cross-sectional survey assessing their parental supply behaviours, attitudes and perceptions in April 2022. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between attitudes, perceptions and parental supply of alcohol to their child. Forty-three percent of respondents nominated an acceptable age to drink a full drink of alcohol below 18 years, and 23% reported supplying a full drink of alcohol to their adolescent. Parents were more likely to report supplying a full drink of alcohol if they nominated an acceptable drinking age below 18 years (&amp;lt;16: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 14.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.23–26.42; 16–17: AOR = 5.68, 95% CI = 3.69–8.73), appraised alcohol as more beneficial (AOR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.02–1.69) and less harmful (AOR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.36–0.68) for adolescents, and perceived that parent friends (AOR = 2.91, 95% CI = 1.80–4.70) and other parents (AOR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.37–3.62) supplied alcohol in unsupervised contexts. Perceived behavioural control was not associated with parental supply. These findings suggest there may be value in trialling interventions that target parents’ perceptions about the acceptable age to drink a full drink of alcohol, attitudes toward adolescent alcohol consumption, and perceived norms of parental supply to influence parents’ supply intentions.</jats:p>",

With the advancement of circular economy practices and increased environmental regulations, reverse logistics is taking on a critical role in waste reduction and resource efficiency. The research analyzes product reintegration models and discusses their implications for companies seeking to align their operations with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through a systematic literature review, the article identifies theoretical gaps, highlighting the need for more robust performance metrics and integrated approaches across sectors and regions for reverse logistics policies. Contributions include a framework for assessing the impact of reverse logistics practices and strategic recommendations for more coherent global policies. These perspectives aim to provide robustness for future research and for the implementation of more sustainable supply chains. This theoretical analysis not only sheds light on current practices but also addresses the transformative potential of reverse logistics in building resilient, resource-efficient supply chains. Ultimately, the study advocates for collaborative efforts among stakeholders to bridge existing theoretical and practical divides in sustainable logistics.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to determine the optimal NaCl concentration for promoting plant growth, D-pinitol, and other phytochemicals in M. crystallinum cultivated in a hydroponics system. Seedlings of M. crystallinum were transplanted into a hydroponic system and subjected to different NaCl concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mM) in the nutrient solution. To evaluate the plant’s response to salinity stress, measurements were conducted on growth parameters, chlorophyll and carotenoid levels, total flavonoid and polyphenol contents, and DPPH scavenging activity. The optimal NaCl concentration for growth was found to be 200 mM, at which the shoot fresh and dry weights were highest. Additionally, total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were maximized at 200 mM NaCl, with a subsequent decrease at higher concentrations. The highest DPPH scavenging activity was observed in the 200 mM NaCl treatment, which correlated with increased levels of total flavonoids and polyphenols. These results indicated that optimizing NaCl concentration can enhance the antioxidant activity of Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L. The D-pinitol content also peaked at 200 mM NaCl treatment, further supporting its role osmotic adjustment under salinity stress. M. crystallinum exhibited enhanced antioxidant production and cellular protective functions at 200 mM NaCl, which optimized its biochemical defense mechanisms and helped maintain physiological functions under salinity stress. These findings provide valuable insights for agricultural and biological applications, particularly in cultivating M. crystallinum for its bioactive compounds.</jats:p>"

The analysis examines the transient responses for varying valve closure times (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic>) and the effect of installing surge tanks. Results show that increasing valve closure time and installing surge tanks both mitigate water hammer impacts. Specifically, when valve closure time exceeds 300 seconds, surge tanks reduce maximum pressure below the pipeline’s tolerance (<jats:italic>Pmax</jats:italic>) and decrease the number of nodes experiencing damaging negative pressures.

This review identifies synthesized findings from various studies that the adoption of GSCM\nhas led to a significant improvement in economic sustainability through a reduction in operational\ncosts of up to 20%-and enhancing the ability of market competitiveness. In this regard,\nenvironmental concerns contribute by reducing resource consumption by up to 30% as waste is\ngenerated, promoting sustainable production processes. Socially, GSCM advances good labor\npractices and strengthens community involvement in the pursuit of better working conditions,\nimproving relationships between the producers and local communities. With all these advantages,\nhowever, GSCM in the Sri Lankan tea export sector faces fluctuating global market prices, effects\nof climate change, and persistent labor shortages. These challenges are indicative that strategic\ninterventions of the government to support and collaborate in the industry do become urgent to\nenhance sustainability. This review also points out one important limitation in relying on\nsecondary sources of data and emphasizes that there is a dire need for empirical research to\nenhance the evidence base to provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders.

Motivated by the issues with the hydraulic distribution network in the city of Tecate, Baja California, Mexico, a prototype was built in order to emulate its operation and validate proposed control schemes as an alternative to the current manual management. The prototype has been built integrating a series of industrial sensors and actuators to truly provide the features of a real application to ease the implementation in a real scenario, using the IoT platform Node-RED. This paper describes a PI-IoT proposed control system for regulating the level of a tank by means of an analog valve. In the real system, these elements are indeed separated by a distance of 4.5 km, which implies the use of a real time communication channel to effectively regulate the level.

Thus, the (1,1) case gives the coventional honeycomb model that describes the two low-energy bands in graphene. Generalizations, such as (2,1), (2,2), and (3,3) display several nontrivial features, such as coexisting graphenelike Dirac cones with flat bands, both at zero and finite energy, as well as robust degeneracy points where a flat band and a parabolic band meet at the <h:math xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><h:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Γ</h:mi></h:math> point. Here we explore the edge states of this class of crystals, using as reference triangulene crystals, and we find several types of edge states absent in the conventional (1,1) honeycomb case, associated to the nontrivial features of the two-dimensional bands of the high-fold case. First, we find dispersive edge states associated to the finite-energy flat bands, that occur both at the armchair and zigzag termination. Second, in the case of noncentrosymmetric triangulene crystals that lead to a <j:math xmlns:j=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><j:mrow><j:mi>S</j:mi><j:mo>=</j:mo><j:mn>1</j:mn></j:mrow></j:math> Dirac band, we have a bonding-antibonding pair of dispersive edge states, localized in the same edge so that their energy splitting is reduced as their localization increases, opposite to the conventional behavior of pairs of states localized in opposite edges.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To improve supply chain efficiency in global corporate operations, this study investigates the function of cost accounting. The growing interconnectedness of global marketplaces has made efficient cost management a crucial component for businesses looking to stay ahead of the competition. The main goal of this study is to investigate how supply chain performance can be maximized through the use of cost accounting techniques to pinpoint major cost drivers and enhance decision-making. A thorough analysis of different cost accounting approaches and how they are used in supply chains, with an emphasis on Activity-Based Costing and technological integration, is part of the objective of the study. The primary issue discussed is the dearth of empirical knowledge about how cost accounting is implemented in various business contexts, especially in multinational settings and service-oriented industries. A qualitative research methodology is used, and the analysis is supported by secondary data from company reports, academic publications, and related literature. Supply chain efficiency is greatly increased by precise cost identification, strong cost management systems, and cooperative supplier relationships, according to key results. Limitations, however, include issues with cultural and legal disparities in global settings as well as a dearth of empirical data in some businesses. The consequences of the study are both theoretical and practical, providing firms looking to enhance their cost management plans and operational effectiveness with insightful information. By filling in current research gaps, this study advances our knowledge of the relationships between supply chain performance and cost accounting.</jats:p>"

Currently, most studies in this field do not consider the problems brought about by the time scale when selecting the input feature set. Therefore, this study explores how to select the relevant input feature set and model for the ultra-short-term water demand forecasting (UWDF) of water treatment plants from the perspective of time multi-scale features, in order to provide more accurate and effective water supply planning for water treatment plants. This study uses feature engineering to analyze the importance of relevant features affecting water supply, and compares and analyzes the predictive capabilities of seven deep learning models. The experimental results show that the time multi-scale features (TMFs) extracted from the historical water supply data play an important role in the prediction of ultra-short-term water supply, and the LSTM model performs better in the prediction task, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 5.3530% and a goodness-of-fit (R2) of 0.9981. This study provides an effective method for intelligent operation and maintenance in the field of water treatment, and has broad application prospects.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development and implementation of regional protection plans for ecosystem carbon storage services have been recognized as crucial actions for mitigating global climate change. However, the supply areas of carbon sequestration in terms of ecosystem service flows in inland regions are still less evaluated. The goal of this study is to identify the priority-ranked supply areas for carbon sinks. Here, we conducted a case study in the Hexi Region of northwestern China and proposed a framework to quantify the priority supply areas for carbon sinks from the perspective of ecosystem service flows. Firstly, we quantified the carbon service supply and demand areas by combining carbon models (i.e., the Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach model and soil respiration models) with socioeconomic and natural factors. Then, we introduced a breaking point formula to estimate ecosystem service flow, specifically focusing on distance or range. Finally, we determined priority supply areas for carbon sinks based on the Zonation model. The results showed that significantly higher carbon sequestration values were detected in the Qilian Mountains, ranging from 2.0 to 3.0 t hm−2, in comparison with desert oasis areas, where the supply values ranged from 0 to 0.01 t hm−2. The urban areas and rural settlements within the study area are characterized by higher values of carbon emissions compared to those in the Qilian Mountains and deserts. The carbon flow analysis demonstrated that the middle and northern parts of the study area, being characterized by lower precipitation and sandy landscapes, were identified as locations with low carbon sequestration fluxes (&lt;1.0 t hm−2). In addition, the mountainous regions were identified as the main highest priority area for ecosystem carbon sequestration, covering 8.33% of total area of the Hexi Region. Our findings highlighted the importance of the Qilian Mountains in terms of sustaining carbon sequestration service supply in the Hexi Region and targeted ecological protection practices to be implemented going forward.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Timely and accurate land use information in open-pit mines is essential for environmental monitoring, ecological restoration planning, and promoting sustainable progress in mining regions. This study used high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, combined with object-oriented methods, optimal segmentation algorithms, and machine learning algorithms, to develop an efficient and practical method for classifying land use in open-pit mines. First, six land use categories were identified: stope, restoration area, building, vegetation area, arterial road, and waters. To achieve optimal scale segmentation, an image segmentation quality evaluation index is developed, emphasizing both high intra-object homogeneity and high inter-object heterogeneity. Second, spectral, index, texture, and spatial features are identified through out-of-bag (OOB) error of random forest and recursive feature elimination (RFE) to create an optimal multi-feature fusion combination. Finally, the classification of open-pit mines was executed by leveraging the optimal feature combination, employing the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers in a comparative analysis. The experimental results indicated that classification of appropriate scale image segmentation can extract more accurate land use information. Feature selection effectively reduces model redundancy and improves classification accuracy, with spectral features having the most significant effect. The RF algorithm outperformed SVM and KNN, demonstrating superior handling of high-dimensional feature combinations. It achieves the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 90.77%, with the lowest misclassification and omission errors and the highest classification accuracy. The disaggregated data facilitate effective monitoring of ecological changes in open-pit mining areas, support the development of mining plans, and help predict the quality and heterogeneity of raw clay in some areas.</jats:p>"
