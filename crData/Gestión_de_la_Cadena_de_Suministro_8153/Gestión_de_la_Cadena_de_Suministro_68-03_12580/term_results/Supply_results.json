      "abstract": "<jats:p>Everyone who has heard of Harrod-Domar realises that growth\n      targets imply something about savings rates. But growth targets also\n      imply something about the availability of capital goods. The business of\n      economic planning, as Winston points out [1], is to ensure compatibility\n      between the Harrod-Domar and the Mahalanobis constraints. If domestic\n      savings exceed the availability of domestic plus foreign capital goods,\n      two \"despised alternatives\" confront the economy: inventory accumulation\n      or slower growth. To avoid this unhappy predicament, Winston outlines\n      three remedial policies. Our purpose is to suggest that the Harrod-Domar\n      and Mahalanobis constraints may not be independent. Remedial policies\n      aimed at that larger capital goods supply may affect the private and\n      public savings rates and the growth of income. These suggestions are\n      hardly novel [2]. They turn on re¬placing the proportional savings\n      function with a classical savings function (i.e., one which specifies\n      private savings rates by economic sector), on distinguishing tax rates\n      by type of domestic production and imports, and on stipulating a\n      connection between consumer-goods production and import of raw materials\n      for the consumer industries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The history of Western industrialisation and the recent experience of developing countries both indicate that rapid industrial growth is usually accompanied by serious urban housing problems. The pressure to minimise infra-structure investment, which is expensive and only indirectly productive, is very great. The existence of this problem in China has long been recognised in general terms, but its exact dimensions have only recently been brought into question in articles by Kang Chao and William Hollister. Kang Chao has produced estimates for all urban areas which show that per capita living area approximately halved between 1949 and 1960. Hollister, in his work on capital formation, argues that a decline of this magnitude has not taken place. The difference between these two views arises first from Hollister's addition of 70 per cent, to the official housing construction figures for socialist enterprises for the years 1950 to 1955. This addition is the estimated extent of housing construction in the private sector. The second difference between the two estimates arises from the treatment of depreciation and repair work. Kang Chao makes no allowance for repair work and estimates depreciation to be 2 per cent, annually. Hollister on the other hand considers that 1 per cent depreciation is sufficient and estimates that repair work to this value has been done. Neither writer offers any systematic statistical evidence for his estimate of depreciation and repair. This is unfortunate, since these differences, over periods of ten years or more, lead to radically opposed appraisals of the housing situation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Angiotensin-induced contraction of the isolated guinea pig and rabbit intestines is mediated through activation both of the intrinsic nerves and on the smooth muscle. An extension of such studies was carried out to include the effects of angiotensin on the isolated ilea of the Mongolian gerbil, the mouse, and the rat. These studies indicate further the diversity in the intrinsic motor nerves of intestine of the three species, as has been suggested in previous studies. Angiotensin (1 μg/ml) produced a biphasic effect on the ileum of the gerbil, mouse, or rat, i.e. an initial fast spike-like contraction followed by a slow, progressive contraction. The spike-like contraction was abolished by procaine, cocaine, and mecamylamine, but not by hexamethonium or pentolinium. In the mouse and gerbil, this initial response was blockaded by atropine, morphine, and epinephrine; and in the rat it was resistant to atropine and morphine but inhibited by epinephrine. The slow progressive contraction of the three ilea was inhibited by only papaverine and epinephrine. Motor nerve stimulation (cholinergic pathway in mouse and gerbil, non-cholinergic in rat) was responsible for the initial angiotensin effect and direct musculotropic stimulation for the secondary effect. </jats:p>",
