      "abstract": "<jats:p>Adaptive and highly synchronized supply chains can avoid a cascading rise-and-fall inventory dynamic and mitigate ripple effects caused by operational failures. This paper aims to demonstrate how a deep reinforcement learning agent based on the proximal policy optimization algorithm can synchronize inbound and outbound flows and support business continuity operating in the stochastic and nonstationary environment if end-to-end visibility is provided. The deep reinforcement learning agent is built upon the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, which does not require hardcoded action space and exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. These features, complimented with a straightforward supply chain environment, give rise to a general and task unspecific approach to adaptive control in multi-echelon supply chains. The proposed approach is compared with the base-stock policy, a well-known method in classic operations research and inventory control theory. The base-stock policy is prevalent in continuous-review inventory systems. The paper concludes with the statement that the proposed solution can perform adaptive control in complex supply chains. The paper also postulates fully fledged supply chain digital twins as a necessary infrastructural condition for scalable real-world applications.</jats:p>"

The advance of digitalization and technologization enables new business models, increased process efficiencies, novel planning approaches, and much more but, on the downside, there is also the risk of being lost in the maelstrom of developments. Within these developments, the automation of logistics processes and ultimately the design of autonomous logistics systems is one of the most defining trends that has far-reaching consequences for the planning and execution of future logistics processes. This Special Issue aims to contribute to the discussion and to get to the bottom of the question of how the path towards automated and autonomous logistics systems should be designed. This editorial lays a foundation by presenting application areas of automation and discussing the theoretical path towards autonomous logistics systems. The articles that follow provide highly practical insights into current research results on the automation and autonomization of informational and physical logistics processes.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate and examine the role of supply chain agility on supply chain resilience and supply chain performance sustainability. This study uses a quantitative method with the Smart PLS version 3.3.3 analysis tool and also involves 54 furniture SMEs in the Special Region of Yogyakarta as respondents. The results of this study find and prove that supply chain agility has a positive and significant effect on supply chain resilience and supply chain performance sustainability. The more agile furniture SMEs in managing the supply chain, the stronger the sustainability of future performance in the midst of a business environment full of uncertainty. This shows that supply chain agility owned by furniture SMEs has an important role in supply chain resilience and supply chain performance sustainability.</jats:p>"

This study uses the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and theory of training motivation as theoretical background for the exploration. In addition to that, this paper provides meaningful information for executives aspiring to contribute to the development of supply chain management (SCM) talent including the primary drivers, benefits, barriers and bridges (Fawcett et al., 2008). Using this framework will lead to the development of a conceptual model to facilitate future research efforts.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper studies three case companies where there was an active executive engagement in the recruiting, on-boarding and ongoing development of SC talent.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>In all three case companies’ executive engagement was high and the executives acted as champions of the SC talent development program including designing and stewardship of the program. They also got personally involved in recruiting, training and mentoring. In alignment with the RBV of the firm, all three case companies were strongly driven by a need to improve the competitive advantage of their firm through the SC competencies and capabilities. This strategic directive is driven by the executive suite and typically involved a combination of goals including improving functional capability development, internal stakeholder relationships and growth in business value contributions. This leads to the need for attracting new talent, due to talent shortages and developing more future-proof capabilities of the SC talent. Talent that is future-proof can effectively handle the current scope of work and successfully implement changes that the SCM strategy aspires to. Hence, the executive ownership is very much driven by a strategic imperative to improve the knowledge, skills and abilities and critical realization of the importance of talent recruitment and development. This study also finds that there are very specific SCM drivers, benefits, barriers and bridges in play making it important for SCM executives and teams to engage and not rely on generic human resource (HR) processes and frameworks only.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>We found that in the three case companies’ executive engagement in talent development had a positive impact. We also identified specific roles of the executives such as, the benefit of engagement across multiple hierarchical layers of the organization and, the risk of programs being shorter lived when focused on a narrower talent issue. Our research focus contributes to the existing supply chain literature involving talent management. It also suggests actions for supply chain executives, for the educational provision of universities and multiple research opportunities.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>There is no evidence of prior research in fields of HR management, talent development or SCM related to the impact of executive engagement in this process.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The impact of modern conditions of functioning of the world economic system on the processes of its globalization and global supply chains was examined in article. One of the main factors in intensifying the deepening of production and technological ties is recognized as logistics integration. It creates a new scheme for global supply chain management. It is based on the unity of the principles of hierarchy and heterarchy in the choice of forms and scope of integration. Logistics integration is seen as a process of organizing the interaction of cooperating entities in the chain, aimed at achieving the ultimate system goal. In-depth and situational adjustment of production and technological relations and joint use of resources and capital of enterprises in the logistics chain is realized either through their mergers and acquisitions or in other forms of virtual integration. The consequence of such integration is the formation of comprehensive logistics services with high added value. The author 's vision of building a heterarchical system of global supply chain management using the institutions of focus centers is presented. Basic recommendations for strategic and tactical planning of the chain's activities as a single integrated entity have been developed. Such a system provides self-organization of management and flexible dispersion of centers of general system management decisions according to the functions and competencies of specialized supply chain centers. Heterarchical self-organization of management operates on the terms of relations' equality, full openness and transparency between interacting entities, a single information environment and communication channels.</jats:p>"

Recently, this problem has become particularly acute due to growing economic losses and social, economic and security threats, a sharp increase in the return of unused, substandard, end-of-life products, hazardous and hazardous waste, materials for recycling and regeneration. This link of business processes was not even distinguished in the structure of the supply chain before. Based on the analysis of the theory and practice of recycling, resource conservation, recycling and disposal, the authors concluded that it is necessary to form a closed supply chain with the participation of reversible flows and based on the concept of product life cycle. The example of Ukraine illustrates the current situation with the formation and accumulation and processing of waste production and life due to the actual lack of reverse logistics services. The paper develops a comprehensive scheme-structure of existing problems of reverse logistics and offers specific recommendations for solving problems of reverse logistics management in Ukraine. Each aspect of improving the management system considered from the standpoint of economic, social, environmental, technical and technological efficiency. Particular attention paid to the relevant educational work with the population on ways to implement the principles of reversible logistics, improving the culture of consumption together with the introduction of legal and social responsibility.</jats:p>"

The paper aims to study how the endogenously generated excess money supply can contribute to global financial crises. The creation of money supply is examined from the perspective of the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) and endogenous money, namely Horizontalism, Structuralism, and Modern Money Theory. Given that prices are not flexible in the short term, increased volatility in the money market prevents a short-term ready balance between money supply and output. The overall result of money supply accommodation can be unpredictable if monetary authorities and commercial banks do not pool their interests, and the money demand volatility becomes extremely high. The study of the correlation between money supply and output allowed distinguishing between neutral countries in the creation of extra liquid assets and countries that can be a potential trigger for excessive money supply volatility. Monitoring the dynamics of M3 and GDP showed that before the significant crisis periods of 1997–1998, 2007–2008, and 2019–2020, the growth of money supply was more than 8%. The established critical level confirms the potential contribution of endogenously created excess money supply to global financial crises.</jats:p>",

Drawing on organizational justice theory, our research develops and tests a model of relationship restoration. We examine how the supplier's restoration tactics—acknowledgment, compensation, and operational transparency, influence the interactional, distributive, and procedural fairness perception, respectively, of the buyer, resulting in relationship restoration. The results are based on a 2 (Acknowledgment – Yes/No) × 2 (Compensation – Yes/No) × 2 (Operational Transparency – Yes/No) vignette‐based study with 390 experienced practitioners. The analysis shows that compensating the buyer and providing transparent procedures for dealing with similar situations in the future, lead to higher distributive fairness and procedural fairness, respectively, resulting in restored relationships. Compensation makes up for past supplier malperformance, whereas operational transparency mitigates future concerns. We also find that restoration tactics based on interactional justice are less effective than those based on procedural and distributive justice. There is only marginal support for the indirect positive effect of acknowledgment on restoration intentions (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.10). These results point to the importance of knowing how to approach a buyer to initiate relationship restoration. Managers must understand and evaluate the specific needs of each buyer when proposing a compensatory design that appeals to the buyer. Additionally, establishing procedures that are appealing to all buyers can be a challenge for a supplier, due to the differing benefits to the supplier provided by each buyer.</jats:p>",

Failure in either one of these leads to the whole system failure. Once the system is technically feasible, we can manage its social aspects. In this paper, we deal with technical sustainability of corrosive water, its impacts and the remedial measures. Corrosive water can severely damage intakes, metal pipes, cemented chambers, concrete reservoir and household plumbing systems. Hence, it is necessary to identify the corrosiveness of the water and should be neutralized. There are several solutions to this problem, however, they are not sustainable and economical for semi urban and rural communities. In this paper, we propose a sustainable, natural and economical solution to determine the corrosiveness of water and to effective technology to neutralize it. The proposed solution uses naturally available resources, hence makes it sustainable and affordable. Once the proposed method is deployed, it doesn’t require additional resources such as continuous monitoring, skilled manpower and electrical power cost etc. In this method, initially, the corrosiveness of the water is identified using parameters such as: total dissolved solid (TDS), pH, temperature, calcium and alkalinity. The corrosive water is then analyzed in laboratory. With carbon dioxide kinetic study, we verify the design of stabilization tank volume calculation. The research outcome is applied in the field to upgrade intake, pipe and fitting designs. The experiment in this research is conducted with the data obtained from several water supply schemes including Padampokhari water supply scheme in Nepal and tested in the same water supply scheme.</jats:p>"

A model using various microbial growth parameters was developed in order to standardise the experimental interpretation for BRP measurement. This study used 82 experimental BRP data sets of water samples collected from the water treatment plant to locations (customer taps) in the distribution system. The data were used to model the BRP process (growth curve) by a data fitting procedure and to obtain a best-fitted equation. Statistical assessment and validation of the model obtained equation by fitting these 82 sets of data were conducted, and the results show average R2 values were 0.987 for treated water samples (collected at the plant prior to chlorination) and 0.983 for tap water (collected at the customer taps). The F values obtained from the F-test are all exceeded their corresponding F critical values, and the results from the t-test also showed a good outcome. These results indicate this model would be successfully applied in modelling BRP in drinking water supply systems.</jats:p>",

This paper aims to reveal the surge wave characteristics and provide design guidelines for air vessels in long-distance water supply systems. First, the analytical formulas of water-level oscillations in the air vessel are derived based on the Krylov–Bogoliubov–Mitropolsky method. Then, an optimization model is constructed for selecting the optimal volume of the air vessels. Finally, the validation of the analytical formulas and the optimization of the model are conducted through two actual projects. The results show that the calculation error of the analytical formulas can be controlled within a very small range, and the process of selecting air vessel volume can be simplified with the provided model. In addition, increasing the air chamber height within its range can reduce the volume of air vessels with the same protection requirements. The optimization analysis results of the air vessel can provide guidance and reference for the design of actual projects.</jats:p>",

In this study, a multi-objective robust fuzzy stochastic programming (MORFSP) model is proposed for designing biodiesel supply chain network (BSCN) under different and hybrid uncertainties. This model simultaneously minimizes total cost of the BSCN and total environmental impacts of activities of the network. Fixed costs and environmental impact of opening facilities are described as fuzzy variables. Demands, supplies, other costs and environmental impacts are considered as fuzzy scenario based variables. The proposed MORFSP model considers different risks, including possibilistic variability and scenario variability related to economic and environmental objective functions, and unsatisfied demand costs. This model is applied in a real case study to design a BSCN in Iran. Waste cooking oil (WCO), and some non-edible plants like Salvia lerifolia (SL) and Jatropha Curcas L. (JCL) are considered as sources of producing biodiesel. The proposed approach used for designing a four-echelon, multi-period, and multi-product, of BSCN. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed model for designing the BSCN under hybrid uncertainties.</jats:p>"

While global supply chains cause or contribute to interconnected environmental and human rights impacts, I show that supply chain regulations often exclusively target one policy domain. Furthermore, an analysis of the first experiences with the implementation of the French Duty of Vigilance law, which covers and gives equal weight to environmental and human rights risks, reveals that the inclusion of environmental and human rights standards in legal norms is not sufficient to ensure policy integration. The empirical focus here is on the soy and beef supply chains from Brazil to the European Union (EU), and the findings rely on an analysis of legal norms and company reports, field research at producing sites in Brazil and semi-structured interviews with civil society, business and state actors. For analyzing the data, I draw on the literature on environmental policy integration (EPI) and apply a framework that distinguishes between institutional, political and cognitive factors to discuss advances and challenges for integrating human rights and the environment in sustainability governance. The study concludes that more integrated approaches for regulating global supply chains would be needed to enable ‘just sustainability’.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a method that takes into consideration the post-earthquake medical supply–demand relationship in order to quantify the initial functionality and instantaneous functionality loss of a hospital system under the conditions of an earthquake, which is different from the current quantitative method that takes into consideration only the internal factors of the hospital system. In this method, a geographic information system and an earthquake damage prediction model are first used to obtain the medical supply capacity before and after the earthquake and the medical demand after the earthquake. Based on the results of the post-earthquake medical demand and the distribution of the medical supply capacity, the substitution capacity of medical resources is then calculated. Finally, the substitution capacity of medical resources is used to evaluate the functionality of the hospital system before and after the earthquake. A hospital system of a city in eastern China is considered as an illustrative example, and the impact of changes in the medical supply and demand at different times of the day on the hospital system functionality are analyzed. The results obtained show that the changes in medical supply and demand not only affect the hospital system functionality, but also cause changes in the instantaneous functionality loss of the hospital system after the earthquake. The proposed method can be used to quantify the hospital system functionality and reflect the balance of the medical supply–demand relationship before and after the earthquake, and it can help decision makers in developing a disaster reduction strategy to improve the disaster resilience of the hospital system.</jats:p>"

So far, however, the potential of textual data science has not been fully exploited to automatically analyze large chunks of textual data and to extract relevant insights. Methods: In this paper, we use data from 19 qualitative interviews with supply chain experts and illustrate how the following methods can be applied: (1) word clouds, (2) sentiment analysis, (3) topic models, (4) correspondence analysis, and (5) multidimensional scaling. Results: Word clouds show the most frequent words in a body of text. Sentiment analysis can be used to calculate polarity scores based on the sentiments that the respondents had in their interviews. Topic models cluster the texts based on dominating topics. Correspondence analysis shows the associations between the words being used and the respective managers. Multidimensional scaling allows researchers to visualize the similarities between the interviews and yields clusters of managers, which can also be used to highlight differences between companies. Conclusions: Textual data science can be applied to mine qualitative data and to extract novel knowledge. This can yield interesting insights that can supplement existing research approaches in logistics and supply chain research.</jats:p>"

There are 25 companies in Bangladesh that are trying to meet this rising demand. Since toxic materials such as lead (Pb) and sulphuric acid (H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>SO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>) are used in electric batteries, the supply chain of the industry needs to be more circular. The aim of this study is to explore the barriers of implementing Circular Supply Chain (CSC) in Electric Battery Industries (EBIs) of Bangladesh. Related barriers were defined using the PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal) framework, and the contextual relationship among the identified barriers was developed using Interpretive Structural Modelling (MICMAC i.e., Cross Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification technique), followed by a cause-effect analysis of the driving barriers to determine the root causes. Lack of sustainable development planning, lack of knowledge about the environment, health, and future generations, lack of coordination among industries and supply chain partners, increased competition, lack of investment in technological innovation, and low quality of circulated products are the root causes of the driving barriers to implementing CSC in Bangladesh's EBIs. The government and the supply chain partners of EBIs should take holistic approach on sustainable development. The results would help in the implementation of CSC, making it easier to achieve sustainable development by introducing economic growth, improving the environment, and creating more job opportunities.</jats:p>"

In this paper, I define the functional boundaries The functional boundaries of the competencies’ implementation regarding the field of companies’ logistics management, I paid special attention to the framework for the implementation of production logistics competencies. I also disclosed the principle of interaction between the logistics system and the production system at an enterprise. This principle is meant to be implemented in the field of production planning and the gradual movement of resources, accompanied by the value creation. As a result of the abovementioned interaction, the essence of the mechanisms and tools of process management in the field of procurement logistics is revealed to achieve a synergistic effect from the continuity of management activities. This explains the reasons why the implementation of lean manufacturing tools indirectly leads to the optimization of logistics processes. Next, the essence of the lean production concept is revealed and arguments are given for the complementarity of the concept with the tools of logistics management, but taking into account the differences in their functional contents. The subject of this study is the Kanban lean production method, so the next stage of the discussion is devoted to the analysis of the theoretical provisions of this management concept. The principle of implementation of the discussed concept in the production practice is also schematically presented. Based on review studies results about the Kanban system practical application success, conclusions were drawn about the possible positive effects of this system’ application. Further, as a result of the analysis of a food supply chain participating company’s financial statements, I determined the daily residual inventory for one of the finished products items, and it was compared with the daily order sizes. Subsequently, with the use of the Kanban system, logistics processes were optimized by eliminating excess production. Finally, I summarized the results with a list of the potential benefits brought by the use of lean manufacturing tools.</jats:p>",

In fact, it would be the key to guaranteeing development for the poorest areas of the planet from which most of the raw material for the food market derives. The paradigm of centralized production is not applicable in these territories, because the distribution network would involve unjustifiable costs. For this reason, many studies have been carried out to ensure that the energy supply (specifically electricity) for off-grid utilities is maintained, in order to guarantee energy autonomy while reducing dependence on specialist assistance for the management of the system. In this work, a hybrid system (HRES) is proposed that combines the exploitation of solar radiation, wind power, and biomass using static devices, in order to improve the system’s availability and limit the cost of operation and maintenance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigated the relationship between risk management and financial intermediation of quoted commercial banks in Nigeria. Panel data were sourced from the Nigeria Stock Exchange for a period that spans 2009 to 2018. Financial intermediation was measured domestic credit of the commercial banks. Domestic credit was modelled as the function of Risk diversification, Basel compliance, risk transfer, credit securitization and risk retention and risk evaluation. Multiple regressions were formulated to ascertain the relationship between risk management and capital investment decision of commercial banks. Panel Unit root test was utilised to establish the stationarity of the data. Panel cointegration, and granger causality test analyse the data. The panel unit root test proved presence of unit root at first difference and concluded that the variables were integrated in the order of 1(I). The study found that, there is a significant relationship between risk management and domestic credit decision, of the quoted commercial banks. The panel cointegrations show the presence of long run relationship between the endogenous variables and the exogenous variables while the granger causality test found uni-directional causality among the variables. From the findings, the study concludes that risk management have significant relationship with domestic credit decisions of the commercial banks. The study recommends that to mitigate the riskiness of banking operations, more avenues for risk diversification should be explored. Although Basel compliance enhances domestic credit decision, its implementation should be done cautiously and in consideration of the intricacies and peculiarities of the Nigerian banking space, as it impinges on most domestic credit decisions.</jats:p>"

There are many articles on this area and several different viewpoints. This work focuses on assessing the sustainability of supply chain management based on two main measurements. Firstly, the value of ecological, environmental, and social measurement indicators and the extent of the challenge in collecting information. The objective of this article is to improve the precision of the assessment. A Sustainable Policies for Supply Chain Management (SP-SCM)is proposed in this article. The suggested framework is a synthesis of quality function deployment (QFD) with plithogenic set grouping processes.A summation function is applied: the perception of the decision-maker of criteria required to assess the viability of the supply chain, the measurement criteria dependent on the specifications, and the difficulties in collecting details. This research submitted a real-world test case on the sugar industry to test the proposed framework. In evaluating the sustainability of the supply chain policy, the findings revealed the performance efficiency of the proposed system.</jats:p>"

Hydrogen is typically employed as mid- to long-term energy storage, whereas batteries cover short-term energy storage. Green hydrogen can be produced by any available electrolyser technology [alkaline electrolysis cell (AEC), polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM), anion exchange membrane (AEM), solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC)] if the electrolysis is fed by renewable electricity. If the electrolysis operates under elevated pressure, the simplest way to store the gaseous hydrogen is to feed it directly into an ordinary pressure vessel without any external compression. The most efficient way to generate electricity from hydrogen is by utilizing a fuel cell. PEM fuel cells seem to be the most favourable way to do so. To increase the capacity factor of fuel cells and electrolysers, both functionalities can be integrated into one device by using the same stack. Within this article, different reversible technologies as well as their advantages and readiness levels are presented, and their potential limitations are also discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Stuttering is a disorder characterized by intermittent loss of volitional control of speech movements. This hypothesis and theory article focuses on the proposal that stuttering may be related to an impairment of the energy supply to neurons. Findings from electroencephalography (EEG), brain imaging, genetics, and biochemistry are reviewed: (1) Analyses of the EEG spectra at rest have repeatedly reported reduced power in the beta band, which is compatible with indications of reduced metabolism. (2) Studies of the absolute level of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) show conflicting findings, with two studies reporting reduced rCBF in the frontal lobe, and two studies, based on a different method, reporting no group differences. This contradiction has not yet been resolved. (3) The pattern of reduction in the studies reporting reduced rCBF corresponds to the regional pattern of the glycolytic index (GI; Vaishnavi et al., <jats:xref>2010</jats:xref>). High regional GI indicates high reliance on non-oxidative metabolism, i.e., glycolysis. (4) Variants of the gene ARNT2 have been associated with stuttering. This gene is primarily expressed in the brain, with a pattern roughly corresponding to the pattern of regional GI. A central function of the ARNT2 protein is to act as one part of a sensor system indicating low levels of oxygen in brain tissue and to activate appropriate responses, including activation of glycolysis. (5) It has been established that genes related to the functions of the lysosomes are implicated in some cases of stuttering. It is possible that these gene variants result in a reduced peak rate of energy supply to neurons. (6) Lastly, there are indications of interactions between the metabolic system and the dopamine system: for example, it is known that acute hypoxia results in an elevated tonic level of dopamine in the synapses. Will mild chronic limitations of energy supply also result in elevated levels of dopamine? The indications of such interaction effects suggest that the metabolic theory of stuttering should be explored in parallel with the exploration of the dopaminergic theory.</jats:p>"

In the literature, there are a myriad of formulations, empirical expressions, algorithms and software for model efficiency assessment. In general, model predictions are curve fitting procedures with a set of assumptions that are not cared for sensitively in many studies, but only a single value comparison between the measurements and predictions is taken into consideration, and then the researcher makes the decision as for the model efficiency. Among the classical statistical efficiency formulations, the most widely used ones are bias (BI), mean square error (MSE), correlation coefficient (CC) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) procedures, all of which are embedded within the visual inspection and numerical analysis (VINAM) square graph as measurements versus predictions scatter diagram. The VINAM provides a set of verbal interpretations and then numerical improvements embracing all the previous statistical efficiency formulations. The fundamental criterion in the VINAM is 1:1 (45°) main diagonal along which all visual, science philosophical, logical, rational and mathematical procedures boil down for model validation. The application of the VINAM approach is presented for artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model predictions.</jats:p>",

This project, which represents an example of harmonization at the regional level and whose presentation is expected in 2021, places the issue of enterprises’ private procurement process at the heart of the debate. Supply chain strategies are an essential element of any business ecosystem. Therefore, in order for firms to effectively address social and environmental concerns along with the economic dimension, it is necessary to adopt and spread the use of sustainable business practices across the entire supply chain. Currently, due to (i) the diffusion of the ‘triple bottom line’ approach; (ii) the reputational and economic damages arising from numerous scandals concerning the supply chain; and (iii) the growing market value of sustainability, an increasing number of firms have included sustainability requirements in their entire supply chain. This has led to the enhancement of ‘preferred procurement’ policies, such as the green, social, and sustainable procurements. After a brief analysis of the current legal framework and the best practices applied in the field of sustainable private procurement, this study offers some conclusions on (i) the impact of sustainability on the definition of the boundaries of the firm and (ii) the policy shift from self-regulation to statute law in private procurement governance and the benefit of a model statute designed to be adopted by different jurisdictions.</jats:p>",

This study explores the possibilities of transforming the governance in Brazil’s soybean supply chain based on stakeholders’ accountability. Methods: We used secondary data from companies’ reports and statistical yearbooks to identify key stakeholders in the soybean supply chain as well as to explore trade-offs between reducing farming expansion into new agricultural frontiers and increasing investments in agro-industrial sectors. Results: The results reveal that at the global level, multinational corporations along with domestic groups should be held accountable for improving the governance of the soybean supply chain in Brazil since foreign multinationals control 65.4% of it. At the domestic level, losses in Brazil’s farming sector can either be offset by an 11% or 5.2% market share increase in the trading segment or in the whole supply chain, respectively, since Brazilian groups control 93.4% of the farming sector but only 7.1% of the agro-industrial sectors. Conclusions: Global accountability and domestic trade-offs are fundamental for transforming governance in global agri-food supply chains. They serve as a means for overcoming the current strategy of expansion into new farming frontiers.</jats:p>"

This study estimates the supply adequacy of nutrients in China’s food system from 1965 to 2018 at the national level, aiming to reveal whether the supply of nutrients meets the demand. The results show that the nutrient supply in China’s food system has experienced a sharp increase in the past five decades, and the deficiency in nutrient supply has been greatly mitigated. Although most nutrients such as potassium are already sufficiently supplied in China’s current food system, some nutrients, especially calcium and zinc, still need a further enlarged supply to improve the nutrition condition of the Chinese population. Besides encouraging a healthy diet, supply-side regulation, e.g., fortification and enrichment, is also needed to improve nutrient availability. This study helps people better understand the development and current situation of nutrient adequacy in China’s food supply, thereby providing information and implications for policymakers.</jats:p>"

The offshore assets seem insulated from these incessant thefts due to difficulty accessing the facility and the compactness of the operations resulting in efficient security surveillance.

Thus, contaminants of groundwater permeate through pores in the ground, and adsorption attenuates the pollution concentration as the pollutants adhere to the solid surface. Mathematical models based on certain simplifying assumptions have been used to predict solute transport. The transport of solutes in porous media is governed by a partial differential equation known as the advection-dispersion equation. In this study, a two-dimensional numerical model has been developed for solute transport through porous media. Results of spatial moments have been predicted and analysed in the presence of both constant and time-dependent dispersion coefficients. Afterward, a numerical model is used to simulate experimentally observed breakthrough curves for both conservative and non-conservative solutes. Thus, transport parameters are estimated through numerical simulation of observed breakthrough curves. Finally, this model gives the best simulation of observed breakthrough curves, and it can also be used in the field scale.</jats:p>",

Timely and complete supplies of fuels in war conditions determine the achievement of the assumed goals of a military operation. They often determine the health and life of soldiers. For this reason, the role of building the resilience of supply chains to disruptions, the type and frequency of which is entirely different from the undesirable events occurring in civil goods flows, is increasing. Therefore, the critical concept supporting building the resilience of fuel supply chains is risk management in these chains. The authors have developed a risk analysis method that integrates the Kaplan and Garrick approach and the fuzzy theory. The analysis identifies the existing disturbances and assigns them to the individual phases of the supply process. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, the authors analyse nine scenarios for the three most important stages of the procurement process in terms of building the resilience of the entire chain: Planning, delivery and storage. The fuzzy theory estimates the risk level for the analysed scenarios of adverse events. The proposed method is universal. It can be implemented to analyse the resistance of supply chains of other materials. It can also support the decision-making process for those responsible for planning, organisation and proper functioning of supply systems in all high-risk conditions, not only in the zone of war and stabilisation operations.</jats:p>"

Optimization models have been used extensively in providing insights to decision-makers on issues related to harvest and production planning in agri-food supply chains. First, we conduct an extensive literature review on previous survey articles to distinguish our research from others. Based on the previous reviews, a new classification scheme is developed to classify articles systematically. Harvest and production planning problems in agri-food supply chains are analyzed through three sections: problem scope, model characteristics, and modeling approach. Neglected problem topics and several promising research directions are presented to stimulate research interest on agri-food supply chains specifically planning of harvest and production.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Public authorities in developing economies typically have to deal with fiscal stress, lack of resources and an underdeveloped real estate industry. This poses a severe challenge at times of rapid urbanisation. Governments typically react to housing demand shocks by introducing policies that support the real estate market’s capacity to supply housing. One prominent policy in this respect is land readjustment. It has been promoted as a best practice and has been extensively discussed from an efficiency perspective; however, little is known about the ecological performance of the urban landscapes that typically emerge with this tool. Therefore, this study developed an assessment framework that allows discussion of the ecological performance of these neighbourhoods as an outcome of the reciprocal interaction between public sector initiatives and real estate market responses. Based on a LEED ND assessment of the cases of Taipei and Seoul, the research identifies four institutional drivers of ecological costs. First, public agencies tend to neglect the ecological costs of greenfield site developments. Second, public agencies to not employ policies that promoe brownfield developments. Third, a weak public sectors’ negotiating position can result in an ecologically inefficient urban pattern. And finally, the public sector’s construction standardisation policies can impose real estate market limitations and wasteful use of resources in the long run.</jats:p>"

The proposed model simulates a case study of Iranian medical ventilator production. The proposed model includes environmental sustainability to limit the carbon emissions as a constraint. A novel stochastic optimization model with strategic and tactical decision making is presented for this closed-loop supply chain network design problem. To make the proposed ventilator logistics network design more realistic, most of the parameters are considered to be uncertain, along with the normal probability distribution. Finally, to show the managerial dimensions under the COVID-19 pandemic for our proposed model, some sensitivity analyses are performed.

Preventing mould and mycotoxin contamination is almost impossible; it is necessary for producers to implement a comprehensive mycotoxin management program to moderate these risks along the animal feed supply chain in an HACCP perspective. The objective of this paper is to suggest an innovative integrated system for handling mycotoxins in the feed chain, with an emphasis on novel strategies for mycotoxin control. Specific and selected technologies, such as nanotechnologies, and management protocols are reported as promising and sustainable options for implementing mycotoxins control, prevention, and management.

Drivers work less in response to higher accumulated income, with a strong effect for recent earnings that gradually diminishes for earlier earnings. We estimate a structural model in which drivers work toward a reference point that adjusts to deviations from expected earnings with a lag. This dynamic view of reference dependence reconciles conflicting “neoclassical” and “behavioral” interpretations of evidence on daily labor-supply decisions. (JEL J22, J31, L94) </jats:p>",

For this purpose, twenty-year observed streamflow and SSL data of three gauging stations, located in the Missouri and Upper Mississippi regions were utilized at both daily and monthly scales. The obtained results of both scenarios indicated the supremacy of ensemble techniques to single AI models. The neural ensemble demonstrated more reliable performance compared to other ensemble techniques. For instance, in the first scenario, the ensemble technique increased the predicted results up to 20% in the verification phase of the daily and monthly modeling and up to 5 and 8%, respectively, in the verification step of the second scenario.</jats:p>",

There have been a few chemical modifications of the CTA membrane surface. This has improved membrane hydrophilicity, water flux, and salt rejection compared with unmodified CTA membranes. Chitosan-containing porous materials as composites have resulted in increased pore characteristics. It has motivated the modification of the surface of the commercial CTA forward osmosis (FO) membrane by surface coating with chitosan (CS)–powdered activated carbon (AC) mix. The membrane morphology was characterized by SEM, FTIR-ATR, contact angle measurement and AFM. Operational conditions for FO such as the orientation of the membrane active layer, feed and draw solution flow rates, and type and concentration of draw salt were optimized with the original CTA membrane. The modified membrane exhibited around a two-fold increase in the water flux and reduced reverse salt flux compared with the original CTA membrane. The improved water flux was attributed to the CS-AC coating enhancing water wettability of the membrane surface and the porous AC generating additional water flow channels. Overall, the water flux of the CTA-CS-AC membrane developed in this work was superior to that of CTA and cellulose acetate (CA) membranes reported in the literature.</jats:p>",

The cationic polyelectrolyte/GO composite membranes are prepared by the layer-by-layer self-assembly method via electrostatic attraction. The introduction of polycations between nanochannels in the GO membranes effectively suppresses the swelling and improves the stability of the membranes. It is found that the polyelectrolytes' charge density and the surface potential of the composite membranes jointly determine the membranes' properties. The experimental results show that the novel GO membranes can obtain high flux and considerable desalination performance under low operating pressure. Typically, the salt rejection rate reaches 66.8% for 1.0 g/L MgSO4, and the flux is 39.8 L·m−2·h−1·bar−1. Benefitting from the GO composite membranes keeping similar retention for both high and low concentration salt solutions, the ideal desalination performance could be obtained through multi-stage processes on the premise of ensuring high flux, which is more suitable for industry.</jats:p>",

The research design employed in this study was descriptive research design. The target population for this study was 44 management employees of Delmonte. These comprised of top managers, line managers and supervisors who are directly involved in the supply chain process. The study adopted census approach since the population of the study was small. The results revealed that marketing diversification and supply chain performance were positively and significantly related. The study also concluded that the company carries out extensive market diversification and also values partnerships and joint ventures which enhances the competitiveness of the firm. This has been done on regular basis considering extensive marketing research that gives the internal operational departments the necessary knowledge/information on the products needed in the right segments of the market. The study recommends that the management should also consider training and induction of the present and newly recruited staff in order to ensure high quality operations in the company.

In order to observe the effects of individual and coordinated decision making, mixed-integer programming models for forestry, round-wood transport, and the wood-based industry were developed and integrated. The models deal with operational planning issues regarding production, harvest, and transport and are solved sequentially for individual cost optimization of each wood supply chain actor as well as simultaneously by a combined model representing joint cost optimization in an integrated wood supply chain. This allows for the first time, benchmarking relative cost-saving potential of the wood procurement strategies coordinated transports, integrated supply chains, satellite stockyards, and higher truck payloads within a single case study setting. Based on case study data from southern Austria, results show the advantages of an integrated supply chain with a cost-saving potential of up to 24%. Higher truck payloads reinforce this potential and enable up to 40% savings compared to the predominant wood procurement situation in Central Europe. Wood supply chain integration for Central European circumstances seems to be feasible only for a limited consortium of a few companies, for example when restricted to a wood-buying syndicate supplying several industry plants or a few large forest enterprises, especially as both groups are commonly steering wood transport on their own. Consequently, further research on the challenging task of implementing integrated supply chains using the opportunities of digitalization to realize existing cost savings potential by deepening cooperation and intensifying information exchange is needed.</jats:p>"

We present and characterise the power supply system in use, pointing out its weaknesses. We consider a case study. The load of the power supply network generated by the rolling stock used in Poland was examined using a microsimulation. A real train timetable was taken into account on a fragment of one of the most important railway line sections in one of the urban agglomerations. Then the results were compared with the results of a microsimulation in which old units were replaced by new trains. These tests were carried out in several variants. We found critical points in the scheduling of railway system use. Our results indicate that it is becoming increasingly necessary to take into account the permissible load capacity of the supply network in certain traffic situations in the process of timetable construction.</jats:p>"

The most frequently used criteria are the country concentration of production, depletion time of reserves, and geopolitical risk. Indicator measurements and normalizations vary substantially between different methods for the same criterion. Our results can be used for future raw material criticality assessments to screen for suitable supply risk indicators and generally accepted indicator normalizations.

We predict that the electron flow is realized through the electron flow device (EFD). We suppose that there are several versions of the SET. Two of them are described below [Structure of Aerobic Glycolysis (SET-AG) and Structure of Oxidative Phosphorylation (SET-OP). The hypothesis is based on the atom properties of the protonated adenine molecule and the docking computations of molecular mechanics involved, suggesting that two ascorbate molecules may occupy the empty NADPH pocket, preferably binding to the adenine binding site. We hypothesize that the adenine originates from uric acid (UA), resulting in an ATP-UA-ADP-ATP-UA cycle. It would also mean that UA is one of the oxygen sources in aerobic glycolysis.&#x0D;\nWe also suppose that the EFD contains the well-known molecules of the Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) and Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) supplemented with two additional UA-originated adenine molecules, two L-ascorbic acids, and two D-glucose molecules. Based on all this, we surmise that a tetra adenine octo phosphate ring (TAR) exists, in which the UA originated adenine molecules form a ring. The molecules are linked to each other through the N7-C2 and C8-N1 atoms of the adenine molecules by H2PO4e- molecules. The four N10 atoms of the adenine molecules bind one flavin, one nicotinamide, and two L-ascorbic acid molecules. Six D-glucose molecules complete one Unit of the structure. Both Fe-S and cytochrome clusters, as well as dehydrogenases, ensure the continuous operation of the Unit. The synchronized function of the three-stoke, three twin-cylinder engine results in continuous energy, ATP, and H+ production. Eukaryotic cells are equipped with the SET-AG and the SET-OP; thus, they can live in an anoxic and oxygenized environment.&#x0D;\nIt is hoped that the SET concept developed here will help the better understanding the way of cancer treatment’s action regarding glucose deprivation or Vitamin C.</jats:p>"

In this study, a new approach was developed based on the GWF to determine the nitrate and arsenic pollution of groundwater. GWF of coagulation-flocculation and biochar adsorption processes were calculated and benchmarked with each other. In the second stage of the study, the effect of groundwater recharge using reclaimed municipal wastewater on GWF was investigated applying Monte Carlo simulation. The results revealed that nitrate led to higher GWF. According to the results, biochar application could reduce the GWF. Total reduction of GWF would be approximately 64.3% if groundwater recharge using reclaimed wastewater is applied.</jats:p>",

The current trend of globalisation has affected every business, and supply chain risks have become a concern in logistics and other business processes. Current risk management strategies must address a variety of global and local challenges. To tackle this issue, existing research has analysed risks in agrifood supply chains, ASC risk management, disruption in ASCs, risk assessments of agriculture supply chains and sources of risk facing an agricultural supply chain. However, the existing research has not defined and categorised risks as a basis for managing risks in ASCs. Therefore, the definition and categorisation of risks in the ASC has been overlooked. To address this gap, this paper undertakes a systematic literature review, offering constructs to define and categorise risks in ASCs, and develops a novel taxonomy in ASC risks to enrich future research on ASC risk management. Sixty-one articles from six databases published between 2000 and 2020 underwent descriptive and thematic analysis.</jats:p>"

The presented method uses hierarchical timed Colored Petri Nets to model inventory management in a multi-stage serial supply chain, under normal operating conditions, and under the presence of disruptions, for both traditional and information sharing configurations. Disruptions are introduced as canceled orders and canceled deliveries, in a time period. Supply chain performance has been evaluated, in the context of order variance amplification and stockout amplification.

Despite a precipitous decline in the costs of RE technologies, the external costs of renewable intermittency and the massive investments in new RE capacities needed to achieve carbon neutrality would drive electricity costs up. Here, we develop a power system expansion model to comprehensively evaluate changes in the costs of electricity supply over a 30-year transition to carbon neutrality, including the effects on the costs of various factors. RE supply curves across China, operating security constraints, and characteristics of various generation units are modelled in detail to assess the cost variations as accurately as possible. According to our results, approximately 5.5 TW of wind and solar photovoltaic capacities would be required to achieve carbon neutrality in the power system by 2050. The electricity supply costs would increase 21.5%, or 10.4 CNY¢/kWh (1.51 USD¢/kWh), which equates to a rise in the effective marginal price of carbon to 1082.6 CNY/t (157.0 USD/t) in 2050. The major cost increments would result from substantial investments in the new RE capacities, flexible generation resources, and network expansion that would be required to achieve carbon neutrality.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is necessary to study the automatic calculation method of load resonance frequency of photovoltaic power supply, so as to detect the load resonance frequency of photovoltaic power supply in real time, thereby ensuring the normal operation of photovoltaic power supply system. The load resonance frequency of photovoltaic power supply is divided into steady-state load resonance frequency and dynamic load resonance frequency. The mathematical model of load resonant circuit of photovoltaic power supply is established by calculating algorithm of load resonant frequency of photovoltaic power supply in steady state, and load resonant frequency of photovoltaic power supply in steady state is calculated. The resonance detection algorithm based on wavelet transform and Hilbert-Huang transform is used to analyze and calculate the load resonance frequency after detecting the resonance signal of photovoltaic power system. The experimental results show that the resonant frequency of photovoltaic power supply load calculated by this method is not much different from the actual resonant frequency of photovoltaic power supply load, and the error range is between-0.30% and 0.49%. Therefore, this method can keep the load resonance frequency of the photovoltaic power supply the same as the RF transmission resonance frequency, and can ensure the normal operation of the photovoltaic power supply.</jats:p>",

This paper employs fuzzy goal programming with triangular fuzzy numbers, membership functions, constraints, assumptions as well as the variables and parameters for optimizing the solution of the model problem. The proposed model presents the mathematical algorithm, and reveals the optimal solution according to satisfaction rank from 0 to 1. Providing a theoretical background, this study offers novel ideas to researchers, decision makers and authorities.</jats:p>"

Understanding the impact of climate change on drought-prone forests is a key objective in assessing forest responses to climate change.<jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>In this study, we assessed tree growth trends and changes in physiological activity under climate change based on patterns in tree rings and stable isotopes. Additionally, structural equation models were used to analyze the climate drivers influencing tree growth, with several key results. (1) The climate in the study area showed a trend of warming and drying, with the growth of tree section areas decreasing first and then increasing, while the water use efficiency showed a steady increase. (2) The effects of climate warming on tree growth in the study area have transitioned from negative to positive. The gradual advance of the growing season and the supply of snowmelt water in the early critical period of the growing season are the key factors underlying the reversal of the sensitivity of trees to climate. (3) Variation in water supply has led to different responses of tree growth to warming, and the growth response of <jats:italic>Pinus tabuliformis</jats:italic> to temperature rise was closely related to increased water availability.<jats:bold>Conclusions: </jats:bold>Our study indicates that warming is not the cause of forest decline, and instead, drought caused by warming is the main factor causing this change. If adequate water is available during critical periods of the growing season, boreal forests may be better able to withstand rising temperatures and even exhibit increased growth during periods of rising temperatures, forming stronger carbon sinks. However, in semi-arid regions, where water supply is limited, continued warming could lead to reduced forest growth and even death, which would dramatically reduce carbon sinks in arid ecosystems.</jats:p>"

CDI has been studied for the removal of various ionic species from water including fluoride ion (F−) with promising results. However, there is no comprehensive literature that summarizes the use of CDI for water defluoridation applications. Therefore, this review paper critically analyzes different electrode materials that have been studied for water defluoridation, their electrosorption capacities and F− removal efficiencies. It further discussed the parameters that influence CDI efficiency during defluoridation and point out the issues of F− selectivity when co-existing with other ions in the solution. We can conclude that different electrode materials have shown different abilities in electrosorption of F−. The carbon-based materials possess high surface area and good electrical conductivity which is paramount for ion adsorption but gives lack selectivity for F− removal. Metal oxides and hydroxides have been reported with improved electrosorption capacity and high selectivity to F− due to the ion exchange between the F− and the hydroxyls surface of the metal oxides/hydroxides. Apart from the good performance of these materials for defluoridation, the discovery of actual practical use of the electrode materials for defluoridation for commercial scale is still a need.</jats:p>",

This step towards more prosumer-based and decentralized energy systems comes at a time when energy planning at a neighborhood scale is on the rise in many countries. It is widely assumed that—from a prosumer’s cost-perspective—shared conversion and storage technologies supplying more than a single building can be advantageous. However, it is not clear whether this is the case generally or only under certain conditions. By analyzing idealized building clusters at different degrees of urbanization (DOU), a linear-optimization approach is used to study the cost difference between shared energy infrastructure (smart energy neighborhoods, SENs) and individually planned buildings. This procedure is carried out for various emission reduction targets. The results show, that with higher emission reduction targets the advantage of SENs increases within rural environments and can reach up to 16%. Nevertheless, there are constellations in which the share of energetic infrastructure among buildings does not lead to any economic advantages. For example, in the case of building clusters with less than four buildings, almost no cost advantage is found. The result of this study underlines the importance of energy system planning within the process of urban planning.</jats:p>"

Although detailed information regarding arterial supply is important to establish accurate and reproducible experimental procedures, this has not been studied in the rat colon. Therefore, we analysed the detailed arterial distribution pattern and its individual variations in the colon of 34 rats. The rat colon received colic branches of the ileocolic artery, and the right, middle and left colic arteries. The single left colic artery constantly arose from the caudal mesenteric artery and was distributed to the descending colon, whereas the others showed variations in number and distribution. The ileocolic artery gave rise to one (12%) or two (88%) colic branches supplying the proximal ascending colon, and these branches formed rich, mesh‐like anastomoses along the initial portion of the ascending colon. One (74%) or two (26%) right colic arteries originated from the cranial mesenteric artery and supplied the ascending colon and right colic flexure. Moreover, one (38%), two (56%) or three (6%) middle colic arteries emerged from the cranial mesenteric artery and were distributed to the transverse colon, left colic flexure and proximal descending colon. In total, we categorized the individual variations in arterial branching and anastomosis into 11 patterns. Arterial supply to the rat colon showed a specific pattern and frequent individual variations. These findings thus provide essential information for establishing reproducible models of rat colic surgery.</jats:p>",

One of the threats to this is the failure of the water supply network, influenced by many factors, among which we can distinguish internal factors related to the process of designing, construction and system operation, and external factors related to the impact of the environment. The paper presents the influence of negative daily temperature on the failure rate of the water supply network, taking into account the material of the pipes, their diameters, and the cause of failure. The research was carried out on operational data from the period 2004–2018 from the water supply network in a city located in south-eastern Poland. The relationship between the daily temperature and the failure rate of the water supply system has been shown. As the temperature values drop, the failure rate values increase. The biggest influence of the negative daily temperature on the water supply network failure rate is observed for cast iron pipes. PE and PVC pipes are more resistant to the influence of negative temperatures. The most common cause of failure is corrosion and unsealing of the pipes. Pipes with the diameters of 100, 150, 300, 350, and 400 mm in distribution and main networks turned out to fail most often. These results can be used by water supply companies to limit the influence of factors related to negative daily temperatures on the failure rate of the water supply network.</jats:p>"

The tracer experiments were first carried out in a circular flume with a diameter of 1.6 m over both smooth and rough beds (coarse sand) with four sizes (ks = d65) of 1.04, 2.09, 3.01, and 4.24 mm. In addition, the one-dimensional advection–dispersion equation was numerically solved. The longitudinal dispersion coefficient was calculated by comparing the numerical and experimental breakthrough curves. The results showed that by increasing the bed roughness height (from zero to 4.24 mm), the longitudinal dispersion coefficient increased by 34%. In addition, the longitudinal dispersivity (λ = DL/V) increased with increasing relative roughness (ks/h), so that the range of longitudinal dispersivities in smooth bed experiments were 0.037–0.049 m and for rough bed (ks = 4.24 mm) were 0.07–0.084 m. In other words, with increasing the bed roughness height from zero (smooth bed) to 4.24 mm, the longitudinal dispersivities increased from 0.037 to 0.077 m, indicating an increase of about 108%. Furthermore, a relationship was developed using non-dimensional longitudinal dispersion (DL/(Vh)) as a function of relative roughness (ks/h). It can be concluded that taking into consideration bed roughness as the driving force of shear dispersion would improve predictive equations of the longitudinal dispersion in the rivers. As the bottom of all natural rivers has roughness elements with different sizes, the results of this study will definitely be useful in estimating the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in natural rivers and quantifying the effect of roughness in the longitudinal dispersion coefficient equations.</jats:p>",

The Egyptian government has recently turned to riverbank filtration to conserve drinking and industrial water at a lower cost and higher efficiency. The study aims to assess the hydraulic performance of the riverbank filtration system in west Sohag, Egypt. MODFLOW and MODPATH 10.2.3 were used under the platform of Groundwater Modeling System (GMS) to construct a hydraulic groundwater flow model to simulate the flow of the riverbank filtration system. Six pumping rates with two scenarios were conducted to investigate the system's hydraulic performance. Water samples were collected from the Nile River, abstraction wells, and groundwater to characterize the water quality. The results indicated that the application of riverbank filtration is promising due to the significant hydraulic connection between the Nile and the aquifer. However, the system hydraulic aspects should be taken into consideration during the design phase as they may affect the RBF hydraulic performance and its efficiency. It became apparent how effective RBF is at eliminating pathogens and suspended solids. Infiltrated water, on the other hand, has higher iron and manganese amounts than the Nile water.</jats:p>",

Salah satu daerah yang mengalami permasalahan akan kebutuhan air bersih adalah masyarakat Desa Saliki, Kecamatan Muara Badak, Kabupaten Kutai Kartanegara Provinsi Kalimantan Timur. Penyebab utama terjadinya permasalahan akan kebutuhan air bersih di Desa Saliki adalah faktor geografis dan juga industri pertambangan. Pengupasan tanah penutup (overburden), penggalian batubaranya sendiri, serta waste material menyebabkan tersingkapnya tanah/batuan yang mengandung mineral sulfida, antara lain berupa Pirit (Pyrite) dan Markasit (Marcasite). Air asam tambang juga akan mengandung logam-logam dengan konsentrasi tinggi, sehingga dapat berakibat buruk pada kesehatan lingkungan maupun manusia. Permasalahan lain juga disebabkan karena distribusi air belum merata, tidak tersedianya PDAM di lingkungan setempat menyebabkan masyarakat sulit mengakses air bersih. Paparan permasalahan di atas mendorong munculnya program Water Supply System (WSS) yang diinisiasi oleh masyarakat setempat khususnya anggota BUMDES Mekar Sejati bersama dengan tim CSR PT. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode kualitatif deskriptif melalui pendekatan action research. Objek dalam penelitian ini adalah Program WSS (Water Supply System) yang dilaksanakan oleh kelompok BUMDES Mekar Sejati, informan ditentukan melalui purposive sampling.Program Water Supply System (WSS) berhasil membantu memberikan solusi bagi permasalahan kekurangan akan kebutuhan air bersih bagi masyarakat di Desa Saliki. Selain itu, program WSS ini juga menjadi solusi dalam meningkatkan pola perilaku hidup sehat di masyarakat yang dibuktikan dengan menurunnya penyakit kulit yang dialami oleh masyarakat setempat.

The current algorithms and recognition models are easily affected by multicollinearity between features. Moreover, these algorithms include only a single learning machine, which exposes large limitations in the process of sensitive feature recognition. In this study, an ensemble learning random forest (ELRF) algorithm, including multiple learning machines, was proposed to recognize sensitive features. A self-adaptive regression coupling model was developed to predict water supply and demand in Shenzhen in the next ten years. Results validate that the ELRF algorithm can effectively recognize sensitive features compared with decision tree and regular random forest algorithms. The model used in this study shows a strong self-adaptive ability in the modeling process of multiple regression. The water demand in Shenzhen will reach 2.2 billion m3 in 2025 and 2.35 billion m3 in 2030, which will exceeded the water supply ability of Shenzhen. Furthermore, three scenarios are designed in terms of water supply security and economic operation, and a comparative analysis is performed to obtain an optimal scenario.</jats:p>",

For that reason, governments, bilateral and multilateral development agencies, including civil society organisations have adopted M&amp;E systems to better their performance through accountability, feedback loops and continuous learning mechanisms. This study investigated the functional status of Zambia’s public sector M&amp;E system. Using a designated diagnostic checklist and analytical framework, the country’s whole-of-government M&amp;E system was found to be weak in several aspects. Specifically, the study argues that for any M&amp;E system to function satisfactorily, it is required that both its ‘supply-side’ and ‘demand-side’ are well developed and sustained. The diagnostic findings have revealed that Zambia’s whole-of-government M&amp;E system had both its supply-side and demand-side weak. However, the study has not focused on both sides, instead, the supply-side has been fully explored and clear suggestions for improvement are made herein. Consequently, the study has proposed a new model which when implemented would holistically strengthen the Government –wide system for M&amp;E. It remains to the powers that be to adopt and implement the recommended model. Government will need to strengthen and sustain its M&amp;E political championship, restructure all government functions towards a results-based management approach—statistics, information technology, skills, policies, laws, etc to support an M&amp;E regime. Likewise, the issues covered in the proposed model could also be of use to other organisations seeking to strengthen their M&amp;E systems. Particularly, the methodology used to undertake the needs analysis could be of utmost applicability by others before embarking on a fuller process of building and strengthening their systems for M&amp;E. Another study was underway to support the demand-side of Zambia’s M&amp;E system.    </jats:p>"

The supply chain’s network refers to the interdependencies of the processes and activities. Taking this into account, stakeholders deal with an environment of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA). The dynamic nature of the supply chain’s environment implies uncertainty in the upstream and downstream sides. Drawing from the literature, manufacturers need to mitigate any uncertainty in their supply chains, which can consist of supply, demand, and technology uncertainties. However, the previous literature neglected any discussion of supply chain uncertainty in the context of the agro-industry. Hence, to answer this gap, this study aimed to investigate the supply chain’s environmental uncertainty factors in the agro-industry’s sectors. Accordingly, this study obtained 30 respondents from the agro-industry in Indonesia. This study reported that the agro-industry in Indonesia has uncertainties about supply, demand and technology. It is faced with the inability of suppliers to consistently deliver raw materials, in terms of their quantity and quality. Meanwhile, demand uncertainty is caused by the fluctuations in customers’ demands and the industry’s low forecasting accuracy. Moreover, the rapidly changing technology has implications for uncertainty in services and product standards; making it difficult for manufacturers to anticipate the changes. This uncertainty in the supply chain’s environment needs to be controlled by the agro-industry through supply chain integration</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Small Aegean islands are facing complicated pressures of different natures. Their physically limited water resources are invoked to cover the increasing needs of the local population, combined with the seasonal water demand peaks due to tourists. This often leads to aquifers’ overexploitation and seawater intrusion, deteriorating the water quality. Water scarcity may also occur due to inadequate infrastructure, limited investments and human resources for proper management. This study uses the example of Skiathos island, which faces all the above challenges. The water supply network and the city's demand are simulated through WEAP software, in an attempt to address the major drivers for future water management. A long-term water demand forecast is performed under scenarios of climate change (based on ensemble means of RCP simulations), and water pricing (based on the recommendations of European legislation). Other pressures (i.e., operation of new hotels) and measures (i.e., desalinization unit, network and reservoir works) that were already considered by the local authorities are discussed. Overall, the findings aim to sensitize and motivate local policymakers to construct databases, start monitoring, include more factors in the decision-making process, and avoid overexploitation for the sake of non-sustainable development norms.</jats:p>",

The issue is complex – including numerous factors that adversely affect the recruitment of future educators as well as their retention once in the classroom. Almost all states report a dearth of WL and/or ESL teachers, and WL is the discipline with the highest predictive teacher turnover rate – whether by leaving the profession entirely ( leavers) or opting to move to a different school ( movers). In spring 2020, the global health pandemic placed additional demands on all educators, and consequently some reports predict an exodus of teachers from K-12 schools. This article presents the results of a study exploring language teachers’ intention to leave the profession as a consequence of school-related responsibilities and experiences during spring 2020. Data revealed three profiles of K-12 language teachers: stayers, leavers, and conditional stayers. Implications related to influential factors in teachers’ potential decisions to remain in or exit the profession are provided. </jats:p>",

Companies often use the model of supply chain cooperation to carry out green innovation. The standard reward and punishment contract model is constructed based on the green degree of the product provided by the supplier when the manufacturer has a fair preference. The impact of the manufacturer’s fairness preference on the green degree of the product, price, manufacturer’s profit, supplier’s profit, and overall profit when the product green degree standard provided by the supplier is greater or smaller than the manufacturer’s demand standard is analyzed. The impact of the difference in channel power between manufacturers and suppliers is also analyzed on the overall profit of the green supply chain. The research results showed that when the manufacturer’s attention to fairness is equal to the attention to self-interest, the overall profit of the green supply chain is the largest, the coordination of the supply chain can be achieved, and the difference in the channel power of the participants in the green supply chain has a significant impact on the overall profit, which is verified by numerical analysis.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study was to explore the application of Q-technique to the detection of supply chain crises in the imported food industry under the influence of COVID-19. Literature analysis, expert consultation, and Q-technique methods were adopted. We used an expert consultation and questionnaire survey combined with Q-technique using the imported food industry in Taiwan as an example. Fifteen business owners were interviewed to identify priorities for supply chain crises, and 137 questionnaires were collected to determine the strength of each item. By investigating suppliers, distributors, wholesalers, platform operators, online sellers, and logistics operators, this study obtained the priority of supply chain crisis items and the strength of factors for each item. The results show that Q-technique can effectively detect the crisis of cross-border supply chain management, clarifying import food industry e-commerce supply chain crisis items and determining their priority and strength, to help enterprises make emergency decisions regarding supply chain operation, and they can also be used as a reference for enterprises to respond to the crisis.</jats:p>"

Oil price trends over the last 3 decades shows cyclical and relatively high volatility. This is due to geopolitical and economic factors including dollar value, governments and organizations (like OPEC's actions), that influence global supply and demand.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In 2020, due to the COVID-19 crises, public health became a key factor influencing oil price (due to its severe adverse impact on demand). Studies have shown that even an increase in production volumes will not be able to bring about profitability in the industry.

This paper discusses the effect of LEAN supply chain management on the profitability of oil &amp; gas firms in Nigeria. It also appraises the relationship between lean processes and operational efficiency of oil and gas producing companies. Using quantitative and descriptive research design methods, an online survey has been used to gather information from respondents from different oil and gas companies.

Companies need to link upstream and downstream flows of products, services and information to help reduce costs, wastages and ensure profitability. In, line with this, steps have been proferred to establish lean processes for organization. The researcher concludes that established industry-wide lean supply chain management processes and practices and collaboration e critical to competiveness and sustainable profitability in the oil and gas industry.</jats:p>",

The sequent depth ratio and hydraulic jump length critically contribute to designing hydraulic structures. In this research, the capability of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) as kernel-based approaches was evaluated to estimate the features of submerged and free hydraulic jumps in channels with rough elements and various shapes, followed by comparing the findings of the GPR and SVM models and the semi-empirical equations. The results represented the effect of the geometry (i.e., steps and roughness elements) of the applied appurtenances on hydraulic jump features in channels with appurtenances. Moreover, the findings confirmed the significance of the upstream Froude number in the estimating of sequent depth ratio in submerged and free hydraulic jumps. In addition, the immersion was the highest contributing variable regarding the submerged jump length on sloped smooth bed and horizontal channels. Based on the comparisons among kernel-based approaches and the semi-empirical equations, kernel-based models showed better performance than these equations. Finally, an uncertainty analysis was conducted to assess the dependability of the best applied model. The results revealed that the GRP model possesses an acceptable level of uncertainty in the modeling process.</jats:p>",

The method is capable of providing economic incentives to the actors along the supply chain. A proof-of-concept using a modified Ethereum IGR token set of smart contracts using the ERC-1155 standard NFTs was deployed on the Rinkeby test net and evaluated. The main findings include (a) allowing immediate access to TPC by the public for any desired authority by using token smart contracts. (b) Food safety can be enhanced through TPC visible to consumers through mobile application and blockchain technology, thus reducing counterfeiting and green washing. (c) The framework is structured and maintained because participants obtain economic incentives thus leveraging it´s practical usage. In summary, this implementation of TPC broadcasting through tokens can improve transparency and sustainable conscientious consumer behaviour, thus enabling a more trustworthy supply chain transparency.</jats:p>"

Such measures are, however, inadequate in mitigating the comprehensive effects of crisis such as the COVID-19, which affects both the demand and supply sides of the economy. Moreover, monetary policies are presently close to a liquidity trap combined with weakened transmission links to the real economy. Fiscal policies have been reactivated, albeit in an ad hoc and experimental manner. Based on a literature review and the policy responses following the COVID-19 crisis, the objective is to present a modified and extended framework for stabilization policies. In particular, the importance of microeconomic supply-side measures that promote entrepreneurial processes and knowledge-upgrading efforts are emphasized. Furthermore, a coherent realigning of policies at the micro- and macro-levels is argued to enhance the potential for long-term growth and to facilitate the restructuring of an economy that normally follows a crisis.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

Although there is research within this area, the impact on the interactions of responsible consumption and production for supply chains is either fragmented or inconclusive. Implementing supply chain solutions to achieve one goal could potentially support or inhibit progress in other goals; thus, before implementing such solutions, a better understanding of the interrelationships between SDGs is required. A systematic review is conducted to evidence the current nature of the understanding of these interrelationships within the food supply chain context by focusing on Responsible Consumption and Production, which refers to SDG number 12. This review is conducted through a filtering process, where 171 peer-reviewed articles addressing different SDGs were analysed and synthesized. In addition to a detailed summary of the recent literature on the SDGs and their interrelationships, as addressed in the literature, this paper establishes the limitations in the existing literature and research challenges surrounding the SDGs. This article contributes a conceptual framework that identifies stakeholder and consumer pressures as enablers of synergistic interactions between SDGs, thus directing managerial and regulatory interventions through a holistic perspective of SDGs. Finally, the review discusses contradictory findings on SDGs and provides future research avenues.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern IT technologies shaped the shift in economic models with many advantages on cost, optimization, and time to market. This economic shift has increased the need for transparency and traceability in supply chain platforms to achieve trust among partners. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is proposed to enable supply chains systems with trust requirements. In this paper, we investigate the existing DLT-based supply chain projects to show their technical part and limitations and extract the tools and techniques used to avoid the DLT scalability issue. We then set the requirements for a typical DLT-based supply chain in this context. The analyses are based on the scalability metrics such as computing, data storage, and transaction fees that fit the typical supply chain system. This paper highlights the effects of Blockchain techniques on scalability and their incorporation in supply chains systems. It also presents other existing solutions that can be applied to the supply chain. The investigation shows the necessity of having such tools in supply chains and developing them to achieve an efficient and scalable system. The paper calls for further scalability enhancements throughout introducing new tools and/or reutilize the current ones. Doi: 10.28991/esj-2021-SP1-04 Full Text: PDF</jats:p>"

Salah satu daerah yang mengalami permasalahan akan kebutuhan air bersih adalah masyarakat Desa Saliki, Kecamatan Muara Badak, Kabupaten Kutai Kartanegara Provinsi Kalimantan Timur. Penyebab utama terjadinya permasalahan akan kebutuhan air bersih di Desa Saliki adalah faktor geografis dan juga industri pertambangan. Pengupasan tanah penutup (overburden), penggalian batubaranya sendiri, serta waste material menyebabkan tersingkapnya tanah/batuan yang mengandung mineral sulfida, antara lain berupa Pirit (Pyrite) dan Markasit (Marcasite). Air asam tambang juga akan mengandung logam-logam dengan konsentrasi tinggi, sehingga dapat berakibat buruk pada kesehatan lingkungan maupun manusia. Permasalahan lain juga disebabkan karena distribusi air belum merata, tidak tersedianya PDAM di lingkungan setempat menyebabkan masyarakat sulit mengakses air bersih. Paparan permasalahan di atas mendorong munculnya program Water Supply System (WSS) yang diinisiasi oleh masyarakat setempat khususnya anggota BUMDES Mekar Sejati bersama dengan tim CSR PT. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode kualitatif deskriptif melalui pendekatan action research. Objek dalam penelitian ini adalah Program WSS (Water Supply System) yang dilaksanakan oleh kelompok BUMDES Mekar Sejati, informan ditentukan melalui purposive sampling.Program Water Supply System (WSS) berhasil membantu memberikan solusi bagi permasalahan kekurangan akan kebutuhan air bersih bagi masyarakat di Desa Saliki. Selain itu, program WSS ini juga menjadi solusi dalam meningkatkan pola perilaku hidup sehat di masyarakat yang dibuktikan dengan menurunnya penyakit kulit yang dialami oleh masyarakat setempat.

The uses of AM in rapid tooling, prototyping, and manufacturing have been innovating the current manufacturing industry from the process level to the entire supply chain. Most existing research on AM is focused on process improvement and new materials, largely neglecting the potential economic and environmental benefits enabled by AM supply chains. This research investigates an innovative supply chain structure, i.e., the integrated production-inventory-transportation (PIT) structure that is uniquely enabled by AM because of its capability of fabricating the entire product with less or even no need for assembly and labor involvement. This paper quantifies and compares the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of TM and AM-enabled PIT supply chains. Since the manufacturing industry is a major source of GHG emissions in the U.S., it needs to be thoroughly studied to explore opportunities for reducing GHG emissions for environmental protection. Case study results suggest that a potential reduction of 26.43% of GHG emissions can be achieved by adopting the AM-enabled PIT supply chain structure. Sensitivity analysis results show that a 20% variation in GHG emission intensity (the amount of CO2eq emissions caused by generating a unit of electricity) can lead to a 6.26% change in the total GHG emissions from the AM-enabled PIT supply chain.</jats:p>",

In this study, four bankruptcy solution rules including proportional (PRO), constrained equal awards (CEA), constrained equal losses (CEL), and Talmud (TAL) rules were used to develop four models to allocate the allowable pollution loads to pollution sources. One of the novel aspects of the current study is to consider the amount of each flow discharge in addition to the pollution concentration of each pollution source. Evaluation of performances of the selected bankruptcy solution rules in a reach of Karun River in Iran showed that the CEA-based model can be considered as the most desirable option for small pollution sources whereas the CEL-based model seems to be the most appropriate option for large pollution sources. The models based on PRO and TAL rules provide results between those of CEA and CEL rules which can be considered as more probable options to reach agreement on between small and large pollution sources.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, there is the unruly practice that complicates living up to those ambitions. These contradictions are, without being exhaustive, caused by a focus on economic performance, organizational behavior, adherence to leading supply chain paradigms, and reputation management. In general, corporate communication about social responsibility is perceived as hypocritical. This research looks at how these communications initiate sustainability measures in the distribution and supply chain functions of a large multinational company. In a single embedded case study, data collection took place using semi-structured interviews complemented with document research. The empirical results show that the supply chain managers were positively critical of the communication about implemented sustainability measures and considered them as an invitation to act. However, they assessed the organization that surrounded them to be less lenient due to the different objectives of the various functions. The respondents diverged about which sustainability measures to apply and embed in the supply chain organization. It became clear that the knowledge base of the respondents was fragmented and incoherent. Reflecting on the research results, the role of top management seems crucial when it comes to coherent policy, knowledge development, and the prioritization of sustainability measures.</jats:p>"

The latter takes into account the different energy losses present in the turbine. Experimental measurements achieved in IMFT laboratory allowed to calibrate the coefficients of head losses relevant for a large range of operating conditions. Once the model had been validated, an extrapolation to a real case showed the possibility of maintaining upstream water level but also of being able to produce sufficient energy for supplying in energy isolated sites.

In this work, an optimization method based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to optimize the design parameters of an ICT with dummy primary windings. It achieved an optimal uniformity of disk output voltage and load regulation. The design parameters, including the number of secondary winding turns and the compensation capacitance, were optimized based on the finite-element method (FEM) and Simulink circuit simulation. The results show that the maximum non-uniformity of the disk output voltage is reduced from 11.1% to 4.4% from no-load to a full load for a 200 kV/20 mA HUST-ICT prototype. Moreover, the load regulation is greatly reduced from 14.3% to 9.6%.

This involves choosing and landing at a landing site that is closest to or most accessible from the desired goal location. The problem is complicated by the fact that the status of candidate landing sites is unknown before the mission begins, and instead the aircraft needs to compute a sequence according to which it flies and senses the candidate landing sites in order to land as quickly as possible. The problem of computing this sequence corresponds to planning under uncertainty about environment. In this paper, we show how it can be solved efficiently via a recently developed probabilistic planning framework, called Probabilistic Planning with Clear Preferences (PPCP). We show that the problem satisfies the Clear Preferences assumption required by PPCP,and therefore all the theoretical guarantees continue to hold. The experimental results in simulation show that our approachcan solve large-scale problems in real-time while experiments on a physical quad-rotor provide proof of concept.\n      \n    </jats:p>"

Energy consumption in water supply systems (WSS) is closely connected with water demand. Especially in the case of oversized water supply systems for which consumers’ water demand is at least 50% less than previously planned and flow velocity in some parts of the system is below 0.01 m·s−1, this problem of excessive energy consumption can be observed. In the literature, it is difficult to find descriptions and methods of energy management for such a case. The purpose of this study was both an evaluation of the current demand of an oversized WSS and a preliminary technical analysis of the possibility for energy saving. Solutions are presented that resulted in improvements in energy management, thus increasing energy efficiency. The conducted analyses indicate the wide use of numerical, hydraulic models, among others, for the needs of the sustainable oversize water supply systems management in order to improve energy efficiency. Those simulations only give energy consumption results as a first step in the process of decision-making for the modernization process, in which investment costs should be taken into account as a second step. Thus, this paper emphasizes the crucial role of hydraulic models as a good analytical tool used in decision support systems (DSS), especially for large, oversized water supply systems.</jats:p>"

In the same way, the variety branches of the corporate were viewed as sub-agents. The agent-based model of supply chain was set up in this thesis. At the same time, supply chain dynamic evolution was simulated through swarm. The effective solution to coordinate the supply chain main body behaviour was explored too. Within this thesis, the evolutionary trait of supply chain is explored, and a reference for supply chain governance is provided.</jats:p>",

With the use of manufacturing firms in 19 EU countries over the period 2000–2014, we find that domestic access to intermediate inputs that are also exported leads to higher levels of revenue productivity. The effect appears as more prominent for firms with nonforeign ownership and in relatively downstream, low‐tech or labour‐intensive industries. Subsequent exploration of mechanisms uncovers patterns consistent with learning by exporting on the part of upstream supplying industries that generates positive productivity spillovers to downstream firms.</jats:p>",

Specifically, when given the option to increase profits by increasing the number of markets served, we ask whether managers can increase profits by exercising this option or does increased complexity become a burden? We conduct a human‐subjects experiment in which subjects manage a simulated supply chain across different levels of complexity, either as individuals or as part of a team. Subjects receive initial training in supply chain management and participate twice in the simulation—once as an individual and once as a team, while also varying complexity across trials. We show that as complexity increases, revenues also increase. However, average performance often deteriorates and many subjects destroy value, despite the increased opportunities for profit. We argue that managers are tempted to chase new revenue sources without understanding the costs or risks to future profits. In a follow‐up experiment, we show that when subjects are reminded about the importance of opportunity costs, revenue declines but earnings are the same or higher. Lastly, our experiments show that both teamwork and experience increase performance and reduce the variance of earnings. Experienced teams make better investment decisions. Less experienced individuals focus on revenue rather than earnings.</jats:p>",

Very few International Oil and Gas Companies own and operate trunk lines in Nigeria. As a result, marginal field owners, independent producers, and some JV partners share the trunk line for the sale of their crude. But because of the use of wide range of non-compliant meters by the injectors into the trunk lines a lot of line losses due to measurement errors are introduced. Another major feature is that trunk lines are exposed to leakages due to sabotage, aged pipeline and valve failures. The issue here is how does the owner of the trunk line back allocate these losses to their respective injectors. The Reverse Mass Balanced Methodology (RMBM) is currently in use having replaced Interim Methodology (IM) in 2017. In RMBM, the crude trunk line losses have been found to be unaccountable and it's proportionate rule for distribution of the losses to the producers are inequitable as the field owners expressed dissatisfaction with unfair deduction from trunk line operators. This study developed a procedure and an algorithm for estimation of crude contributions from each producer at the Terminal and equitable distribution of crude trunk line losses to the producers irrespective of the type of meters, meter factor and leakages and sporadic theft on the trunk lines. This study also identified two alternatives to the RMBM, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Flow based models. The results showed that flow-based model accounts for both individual and group losses, not accounted for in the RMBM, and allocates and corrects for leak volumes at the point of leak instead of at the terminal. This is a significant improvement from the RMBM.</jats:p>",

To perform such an overview, the authors investigated the link between the main stakeholders of the chain (farmers, food processors, food traders and consumers) with UN SDGs. In parallel, the authors explored the roles of policymakers, inspection services, certification bodies and academia in supporting these SDGs. In spite of numerous papers, calculations and estimations, discussion and media coverage, the authors believe that only the tip of the iceberg has been revealed. Based on this overview, the authors emphasize SDG 2—Zero Hunger and SDG 12—Responsible Consumption and Production as the most dominant for the food supply chain. In parallel, the achievement of SDG 17—Partnerships for the Goals will enable deeper intertwining of the goals and all stakeholders in the food supply chain continuum.

With the occurrence of the most devastating pandemic in decades and the continually increasing prevalence of natural disasters, this focus has been challenged, and the need to focus on supply chain resilience has become apparent. Achieving long-lasting sustainable development in supply chains requires a balance of efficiency-focused measures that enhance economic and environmental sustainability and resiliency measures. Ecological Network Analysis has revealed a unique balance between pathway efficiency and redundancy in ecosystems’ network architecture. This enables both efficient operations under normal circumstances and resilience to perturbations. This same analysis can be used to evaluate the balance of sustainability and resilience in supply chain networks, providing insights into what kind of supply chain design and policy decisions lead to more ecosystem-like architectures. This study lays the groundwork for such efforts by studying four supply chain topologies (formed by prevalent supply chain strategies) using ENA. Inventory (storage) is not well understood in the typical flow analysis used in ENA but is an essential facet of supply chain design and must be included in a supply chain analysis. This study overcomes this limitation by proposing a method to include inventory in the ENA framework. The analysis conducted revealed two significant insights: (a) the agile supply chain strategy is the most ecologically similar and (b) it is possible that there are optimal inventory levels (given partnership strategies) to utilize bio-inspiration in supply chain design.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Price postponement is an effective mechanism to hedge against the adverse effect of supply random yield. However, its effectiveness and the resulting production decisions have not been studied for risk-averse firms. In this paper, we investigate the impact of price postponement and risk aversion under supply yield risk. Specifically, we study a risk-averse monopoly firm’s production and pricing decisions under supply random yield with two distinct pricing schemes: (1) ex ante pricing in which the firm simultaneously makes the sales price and sourcing decisions before production takes place and (2) responsive pricing in which the pricing decision is postponed until after the production yield realization. We adopt conditional value at risk (CVaR) as the risk-aversion measurement and investigate the impact of the firm’s risk-aversion level on its optimal decisions and the corresponding profit. Among other results, we show that, for each pricing scheme, there exists a unique risk-aversion threshold under which the firm chooses not to produce. Interestingly, price postponement has no impact on the risk-aversion threshold as the cutoff values under both pricing schemes are the same. We further show that the value of CVaR improvement from responsive pricing may not be monotonic in the firm’s risk-aversion level. Consequently, our results indicate that, although price postponement induces operational flexibility by better matching demand with available supply, whether the firm should adopt responsive pricing needs to be carefully evaluated as the benefit may not justify the potential fixed cost associated with price postponement, especially for a highly risk-averse firm. In addition, we show that responsive pricing, even with its ex post revenue-maximization behavior, benefits the end-market consumers in equilibrium. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical studies to check and confirm the robustness of our results. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management. </jats:p>",

The Ca2+ removal found to be pH and temperature independent, with high removal rates at room temperature and common pH values of water samples (pH 4–12), rendering these circumstances ideal for the low-cost maintenance of the procedure that took place within the first 5 min. The linear form of the Langmuir isotherm model expressed better (R2 = 1) the Ca2+ sorption, which means that takes place at specific homogeneous sites of Na-Pal. Thermodynamic analysis proved the non-spontaneous (positive ΔG0), physical, and exothermic nature (ΔH0 = −10.8197 kJ/mol) of the reaction, while the kinetic models proved the chemisorption of Ca2+ by Na-Pal.</jats:p>",

Simulation was used to check the effect of a new and a special time-based temporal consolidation on the response time in outbound logistics. A soft delivery deadline that is less than the average lead time was used because of the long lead time. Arena Software was used to model the supply chain in order to find the best circumstances to use consolidation. Results showed that temporal consolidation could be more effective when order preparation time is with larger variability. The useful waiting is more when there is at least one order every four days. A formula that approximates the percent of reduced shipments was found. Furthermore, many shipments can be reduced without severely affecting the average response time.

Due to the declining amount of gas available, high carbon footprint, increasing cost of fuel and inefficient operating, alternative energy options are necessary and imminent. Most offshore oil and gas platforms locate in deep water surrounded by huge amount of energetic wave resources, hence, the feasibility of supplying offshore oil facilities electricity by hybrid wave and wind energy farms based on daily energy power production instead of annual average was conducted in this project. The hybrid energy farm was modeled and validated by applying meteorological data in Gulf of Mexico area from WaveWatch III system. With the hindcast wave and wind condition data from 1979 to 2019, daily energy generation of the hybrid energy farm was estimated. Meantime, the feasibility of suppling offshore oil and gas facilities by the proposed combined hybrid farm was assessed. The project optimized the configuration of the hybrid wave and wind energy farm to satisfy offshore oil and gas platform demands and reduce the variation of power generation, so that it may be feasibility to gradually substitute the gas turbines. Through matching the local wave and wind conditions, the project was able to maximize the power output while minimize the variation within limited ocean surface area. The project addressed the advantages of hybrid wave and wind devices, as well as theoretical prospection of wave harvesting device and wind turbine combination. To validate the proposed optimization model, a case study was explored by using Vesta V90 3MW wind turbines and Pelamis 750kW wave energy converters to supply five offshore platforms in more than 45 m deep water areas. The results indicated the possibility of bringing wave energy into large commercial operation and utilization with minor investment and environmental impact.</jats:p>",

The sinusoidal output frequency and voltage of the power supply can be controlled independently from 16 to 24 kHz and from 1 to 10 kVpeak, respectively. A helium APPJ load is used to assess the performance of the developed power supply. It is shown that the developed high-voltage power supply operates effectively, and the designed PFC converter improves the input current distortion of the power supply. Not only the power factor of the power supply is increased from 0.41 to 0.95, but it also provides a low-ripple DC voltage, which reduces the high-voltage ripple of the output from 730 to 50 Vp-p. In this paper, the proposed design integrates the PFC converter into the high-voltage power supply so that the developed power supply has better electrical characteristics and the overall power supply can be significantly miniaturized.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When a supplier fails to comply with social and environmental standards, the buyer’s reputation suffers. Reputation costs can typically be very high for the buyer, whereas the supplier’s liability is often limited. Conventional procurement strategies such as dual sourcing mitigate the buyer’s operational risk, but they often do so at the expense of increasing its reputation risk and sourcing costs. In this paper, we propose a risk-sharing contract for managing the buyer’s reputation concerns. We find that by sharing some of the supplier’s operational loss, the buyer may (in some conditions) decrease its reputational risk, but this has to be balanced against an increase in the operational risk. Risk sharing also reduces sourcing costs because the buyer takes on some of the worst-case loss of a wealth-constrained supplier. These results suggest that risk sharing can be superior, as a procurement strategy, to conventional approaches such as dual sourcing or penalty contracts. This is true when reputation and sourcing costs are a significant concern and operational costs are not that high. Under some conditions, the buyer may choose risk sharing even if it increases reputation risk in order to reduce procurement costs. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management. </jats:p>",

The study found that the service levels affected the profit of each entity in the supply chain. The service levels of self-operated stores were higher than those of the flagship stores, and the opening of direct sales channels had a stimulating effect on the service levels of e-commerce platforms to a certain extent. In consideration of the service levels and the ability to build direct sales channels, the direct sales-flagship store marketing model is the best choice for manufacturers whereas e-commerce platforms are more inclined to open self-operated stores.

Different leak detection studies have been examined in literature using different types of technologies and data. Currently, although machine learning techniques have achieved tremendous progress in outlier detection approaches, they are still limited in terms of water leak detection applications. This research aims to improve the leak detection performances by refining the choices of learning data and techniques. From this perspective, commonly used techniques for leak detection are assessed in this paper, and the characteristics of hydraulic data are investigated. Four intelligent algorithms are compared, namely k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, logistic regression, and multi-layer perceptron. This study focuses on six experiments based on identifying outliers in various packages of pressure and flow data, yearly data, seasonal data, night data, and flow data difference to detect leakage in water distribution networks. Different scenarios of realistic water demand in two networks from the benchmark dataset LeakDB are used. Results demonstrate that the leak detection accuracy varies between 30% and 100% depending on the experiment and the choices of algorithms and data.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the study is to know the effects of transportation on supply chain in manufacturing specially Sulfo. The study adopted the descriptive and correlation designs in order to get the understanding of the findings from the respondents who were the employees of sulfo and some customers. The population of this study was totalised 136 respondents. The sample size was 58. The findings demonstrated that there is a relationship between transportation and supply chain management. This is confirmed by a Pearson correlation of .970 between transportation and supply chain. Thus, the conclusion was that transportation have effects on supply chain management. The researcher recommended that SULFO management should continue to building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronizing supply with demand and measuring performance globally, providing on having sufficient raw materials which are used in production, by finding others suppliers so that in case there is shortage of raw materials, others suppliers provide. Finally, Sulfo should manage production cost for getting high profit. It is suggested that the model can be used for shippers in negotiating service improvements with carriers and by carriers in negotiating service improvements with shippers.</jats:p>"

It is confirmed that even for houses with relatively low thermal characteristics built in accordance with regulatory documents, the role of solar radiation in the formation of the heat balance, espe-cially at the beginning and end of the heating season, is important. Studies showed that due to the combined influence of external meteorological factors, with the improvement of the thermal characteristics of houses, the correlation between the energy demand for creating a favorable microclimate and the outdoor air tem-perature significantly worsens. It is determined that in this case, the value of the approximation reliability decreases from 1 (with a linear dependence) to 0.55 and lower (with the maximum possible improved ther-mal characteristics of the house today). This position significantly corrects the operating modes and charac-teristics of the ST. In particular, this makes it necessary to improve the automatic control system of ST. And this, in turn, increases the investment component of the system. A method was developed for calculating exergy needs to create thermal comfort inside the house by taking into account, using the probability theory, the influence of the random nature of meteorological factors within the heating period, on the basis of which, in the conditions of the region, it is shown and calculated that when determining the seasonal exergy needs for the heat supply of the house, the use of a stationary approach leads to an underestimation of the results by 12...28% compared to the dynamic approach</jats:p>",

Akibat gempa tersebut hampir seluruh bangunan madrasah rusak berat. Setelah masa tanggap darurat selesai gedung madrasah dibangun kembali. Termasuk listrik yang disuplai oleh PLN. Namun dalam hal penyediaan listrik masih terdapat kekurangan yaitu kurangnya kontinuitas pelayanan, dimana seringnya terjadi pemadaman listrik. sementara kegiatan belajar mengajar di madrasah sedang berlangsung sehingga dirasa cukup mengganggu. Selain itu MTs juga berencana mengikuti ujian nasional berbasis komputer sehingga pasokan listrik ketika ujian tidak boleh terhenti. Masalah ketidaksinambungan pasokan listrik PLN tersebut perlu diatasi melalui penyediaan suatu sumber listrik cadangan yang akan menggantikan pasokan listrik ketika PLN padam. Listrik cadangan yang yang diusulkan adalah berbasis Unintruptable Power Supply (UPS) yang mempunyai berbagai kelebihan. Kelebihan tersebut adalah waktu pindah yang cepat dan lebih senyap. Sistem UPS tersebut, terdiri dari serangkaian baterai/aki, inverter dan pengisi baterai. Ketika listrik PLN dalam kondisi menyala, maka sebagian energi listrik disimpan dalam baterai melalui suatu modul pengisi baterai. Ketika listrik dari PLN padam, energi listrik yang tersimpan dalam baterai tersebut akan disalurkan ke beban melalui suatu mekanisme saklar pindah. Dengan kata lain beban yang sebelumnya disangga oleh listrik PLN akan segera dipindah dan disangga oleh UPS ketika listrik PLN padam. Berbagai macam cara instalasi UPS yang paling umum adalah UPS dihubungkan ke salah satu stop kontak. Namun cara ini hanya efektif bila beban yang disangga hanya sedikit, misalnya 1 buah komputer. Untuk sekala beban yang lebih luas yaitu seluruh beban di gedung sekolah maka UPS perlu dipasang di tiap sentral listrik (papan hubung bagi). Oleh sebab itu umumnya perlu modifikasi jaringan kelistrikan suatu gedung sekolah. Adapun hal-hal yang perlu diperhatikan dalam penentuan lokasi UPS: 1) kedekatan dengan sentral/MCB 2) sirkulasi udara 3) keamanan. Dari Uji coba, didapatkan bahwa sistem UPS yang telah dipasang memenuhi beberapa kriteria yang diharapkan antara lain: 1) kemudahan perawatan 2) kemudahan pemasangan 3) memenuhi standar keamanan dan 4) biaya instalasi murah. Manfaat kegiatan PPM diantarannya: 1) mitra mendapatkan sumber listrik cadangan yang bermanfaat bilamana listrik PLN padam, khususnya untuk  persiapan ujian yang berbasis komputer 2) menghemat biaya pembelian BBM dan perawatan daripada menggunakan genset 3) mendapatkan sumber listrik cadangan yang senyap dan tidak mengganggu aktifitas belajar mengajar.</jats:p>"

A two-dimensional field-circuit model based on the finite element method and the complex magnetic vector potential has been shown as a very time-effective tool in the analysis of their steady states compared to time-domain models. This continuation work presents a validated computational algorithm that enables the inclusion of the nonsinusoidal and/or asymmetrical voltage supply in the multi-harmonic field-circuit model of these machines that was presented in the previous works by the authors. The extended model accounts for both spatial harmonics due to slotting and/or winding distribution and the time-harmonics due to voltage waveform. The applicability range of the model therefore increases to cases when the machine is supplied with a nonsinusoidal three-phase system of voltages with symmetry or asymmetry that can be decomposed into three symmetrical components. Its short execution time characteristic allows for much more insightful design studies of the contribution of voltage supply- and slotting-related harmonics to the overall efficiency of the machine than is possible with the time-consuming time-domain models. The proposed computational framework has never been presented in the literature. The model is verified positively by the comprehensive time-domain model. It is especially useful in design studies on solid rotor induction motors related to the optimisation of the efficiency of induction motor-based drive systems.</jats:p>"

Increasing rainfall causes serious hydrological problems in cities. Rainfall does not infiltrate the soil, but mostly flows through the sewer pipes into the stream. Most old urban watersheds have combined sewer pipes. When rainfall exceeds the capacity of the combined sewer pipes, sewage mixed with stormwater overflows the sewer pipes and flows directly into the stream. This is called Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs). CSOs enter the stream with non-point source pollutants accumulated on the surface and pollute the stream. CSOs are one of the major water quality problems in older urban watersheds. This can be solved by replacing the combined sewer pipes with separated sewer pipes, but in reality it requires astronomical costs. As an alternative, the Low Impact Development (LID) technique has recently been introduced. In this study, we analyzed the effects of climate change on CSOs in urban watersheds and applied LID techniques to offset the effects. The LID facility was applied with the most commonly used Bio-Retention cells.</jats:p>",

The aim of this research is to examine the effect of climate change and industrialization on the water quality of the Sabarmati river using a mathematical model. For this study, four important towns along the lower Sabarmati River have been considered and water quality data was considered from 2005 to 2015. In this study, different water quality parameters were considered to derive a water quality model. Results show the water quality downstream after Ahmedabad city is worse compared to the other location where the Maximum WQI is 0.71 at Rasikapur and average WQI is 0.50 for the same location for the last 15 years. It has been observed that the effect of the monsoon and also by comparing time scale water quality model the role of regulations for industrialization also plays an important role in the quality of Sabarmati river.</jats:p>",

The room design was constructed using SolidWorks software. Air distribution observations were created using ANSYS Workbench simulation software. The use of a supply angle of 90° results in an even distribution of air with a low inlet velocity, whereas in conditions of a supply angle of 60° requires a higher inlet speed. Thus, the uniform air distribution is able to be realized by the proper configuration which results an appropriately room temperature and saves energy usage.</jats:p>",

Hydrological models, which can simulate the process of rainfall-runoff, can be used to obtain reliable estimates of streamflow from precipitation data and the physical characteristics of basins. The focus of the present study was to estimate the outflow of 19 sub-basins located in Guilan Province, northern Iran. To achieve this, hybrid models were developed by integrating the IHACRES (identification of unit hydrograph and component flows from rainfall, evapotranspiration, and streamflow) hydrological model with the intelligent-based GMDH (group method of data handling) model. The IHACRES model was calibrated using monthly ground-based precipitation and temperature data as well as satellite-based precipitation data. The lowest and highest Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) for the IHACRES models were, respectively, 0.14 and 0.68 in the calibration phase and 0.11 and 0.73 in the validation phase. It was also observed that using satellite-based precipitation data reduces NS by 10–75% in the 19 sub-basins under study. After calibrating and validating the IHACRES models, the hybrid models were developed by integrating IHACRES and GMDH models. The lowest and highest NS for the hybrid models were, respectively, 0.23 and 0.81 in the calibration phase and 0.11 and 0.81 in the validation phase. It was observed that, on average, integrating IHACRES and GMDH increases the NS by 44.1% in the calibration phase and 37.0% in the validation phase in comparison with the IHACRES model. According to the NS, the hybrid model had ‘acceptable’ performance in six sub-basins in which the IHCRES model had ‘unacceptable’ performance. It was observed that integrating the IHACRES model with a data-driven model (the GMDH model) can generally improve the simulation results in all sub-basins under study.</jats:p>",

The removal of phosphorus using ORPC was studied in actual river water and the results found that over 75.0% phosphorus was removed by adding ORPC at 30 mL h−1 flow rate in initial phosphorus concentrations of 0.76 mg L−1. The ORPC was further used to evaluate the changes of aluminum phosphate (Al-P), ferric phosphate (Fe-P) and calcium phosphate (Ca-P) in sediment. Fe-P, Al-P, and Ca-P in the sediment increased from 0.14, 0.196, and 1.63 mg g−1 to 0.159, 0.372, and 2.74 mg g−1 respectively within 28 days, indicating that the total dissolved phosphorus in the overlying water could be adsorbed by ORPC and further transformed into Al-P, Ca-P, and Fe-P in the sediment, thus inhibiting the release of endogenous phosphorus in sediment to the water. In addition, the performance of ORPC with various contents of SA and CaO2 was investigated. In summary, ORPC can be employed to adsorb phosphorus in water and prevent phosphorus release from sediment, therefore achieving the purpose of controlling phosphorus and maintaining DO at a reasonable level.</jats:p>",

The clean water was tested for physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters, and the results showed that the water quality was in accordance with the Regulation of the Indonesian Ministry of Health No. 416 of 1990 about the Terms and Monitoring of Water Quality. However, the result from the simple chemical inspection test of the water showed that it did not fulfil health standards i.e., the residual chlorine score not equal to 0 (zero). It is suggested that more attention and supervision are conducted by water management authorities to ensure the standard residual chlorine level of 0 (zero). Additionally, expired reagents or reagents that have already changed color should not be used as it will affect the parameters tested. Keywords: Quality of clean water, clean water supply facilities, water sampling process</jats:p>"

The role of government in green supply chain management has become especially significant. This paper proposes a green supply chain model with a duopoly structure, in which two manufacturers separately produce green and non-green items sold through a common retailer. The government looks for social advantages and decides subsidies for the green item and taxes for non-green items. Using a centralized and decentralized model, two cases of government interference and no government interference are analyzed with customer green preference. This study focuses on exploring the pricing strategy, greening strategy and comparing the optimal decisions in all the cases to maximize the overall profitability of the supply chain. Numerical results and sensitivity analysis illustrate how the government subsidy on green products and tax policy in non-green products can influence the profitability of supply chain members. The research finding can give valuable experiences to channel members of the supply chain to settle optimum choices with and without government interference by enhancing the green and non-green item market competition. Among the competitive duopoly structure, the centralized model makes more profit and leads to manufactured eco-friendly items.</jats:p>"

The system was designed to serve 35,007 people by 2020 but at the time of the study, the ability of water users association (WUA) to operate and maintain the system as well as the financial sustainability (i.e. if the scheme could run without external support) were unclear. Financial records showed that the WUA collected only 26% of their expected payments in 2018. Over 94% of the WUA members lacked the necessary capacity to manage contracts and human resources and only 16% of the Community Water Point Committees were trained in relevant areas of management. Several key positions had been unfilled and the parts necessary for repairs were unavailable. This is one of the few ex-post evaluations of a GFRPWSS and highlights several key issues for those wishing to implement similar schemes. Findings showed that the water system only partially met the water requirements of the customers, that the WUA struggled technically and operationally to maintain the system and that at the time of the study, the system was financially unsustainable.

The research method used is descriptive qualitative. This study uses primary data and secondary data. Primary data is in the form of data obtained from the company, interviews with stakeholders (farmers, the Department of Agriculture, Association of Indonesian oil palm farmers and other parties), who are involved either directly or indirectly in the CPO supply chain in the company, while secondary data is in the form of journals and other documents. The flow of goods in the CPO supply chain consists of suppliers, including independent smallholders and smallholders who sell FFB to collectors. These company nuclei are directly brought to the palm oil mill. Then the factory processes the FFB into CPO and is sent to several companies that process derivative products. The financial flow starts from consumers to farmers in cash and non-cash. The flow of information begins from farmers to consumers who provide information in FFB selling prices and CPO prices. Transportation is one factor affecting the smooth supply chain of CPO in Kuantan Singingi District.  </jats:p>"

The experiments were conducted on a PE pipe network with and without partial blockage. The experimental pressure signals were damped during a short period of time in the blockage-free case. The numerical model was calibrated by the inverse transient analysis (ITA). The hydraulic transient solver calibrated with one Kelvin–Voigt element showed good consistency with the experimental results. Partial blockages with different lengths and sizes were examined at different locations of the pipe network. Results reveal an increase in head loss, pressure signal damping, and phase shift with increase in blockage. In addition, the location and characteristics of blockages with different sizes were determined using the ITA in the pipe network.</jats:p>",

This study uses a historical dataset acquired from smart water withdrawal taps to determine the most efficient DL neural network architecture for failure prediction in the SWT, leading to a hybrid model's development. After a comprehensive evaluation of the three ML models, findings show that a hybrid combination of the CNN and Bi-LSTM (CNN-BiLSTM) models is a better solution for investigating failures in the SWT.</jats:p>",

Therefore, restaurants have begun to provide local food, which is reflected in “farm to fork” or “locally-sourced” or “farm to table” restaurants. Thus, purchasing sustainable food, specifically local food products, has become one of the most salient sustainability practices in restaurants. Therefore, this study seeks to further explore the influences of the Sustainable Local Food Supply Chain (SLFSC) of green fine-dining restaurants on tourist food experiences and destination branding in the USA. Data were analyzed using the partial least square (PLS) technique of a sample of 232 respondents. The findings of this study showed positive impacts of all sustainability dimensions on most consumption values of tourists (i.e., emotional, epistemic, health, taste/quality, etc.). The findings indicated that each sustainability dimension and overall sustainability of the local food supply chain had strong positive effects on destination branding. Finally, tourist food experiences in totality mediated the relationship between the overall Sustainable Local Food Supply Chain and destination branding. This study contributes to the existing literature by developing and validating a scale to measure the sustainability practices of local food supply chains in restaurants to fill this gap in the literature. Additionally, the findings have intimate important theoretical and practical implications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Vietnam, as more and more organizations are moving toward globalization, green supplier selection (GSS) has emerged as a strategic approach in supply chain management that requires supplier practices in lessening the environmental risks to society. Based on both conventional and environmental criteria, this paper aims to evaluate a set of suppliers by establishing a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)-based framework using an integrated fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) with the VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method. Initially, five GSS criteria of the environmental aspect (wastewater treatment, solid waste generation, energy consumption, air pollution, corporate social responsibility) and conventional criteria (quality, cost, delivery, and technology) are identified from the literature and consulting field experts to employ the MCDM approach. The trustworthiness of the proposed integrated framework is presented by discussing a case study in the coffee bean supply chain in Vietnam. The FAHP is used to generate criteria weights in which fuzzy set theory is applied to translate the linguistic evaluation statements of experts, and VIKOR is used to rank the alternatives against the selected criteria. From FAHP findings, the most important criteria are quantity discount, solid waste generation, order fulfillment rate, logistics cost, and purchasing cost. A consistency test is performed to ensure the uniformity of the expert’s input. The best suppliers are determined through the final ranking of the VIKOR model for the case study. The work presented provides insight to decision-makers of supplier selection that helps determine significant GSS criteria and aids in the minimization of environmental risks to society arising from the supply chain on corporate sustainability standards.</jats:p>"

The capacity of the manufacturer is limited, the manufacturer can increase capacity by investing in capacity, and there are different cooperation contracts among the supply chain members. This paper pushes collecting activities upstream, assumes that the collecting activity can be completed by the supplier, and accepts that there is cooperation between the members, which increases supplier involvement. Dynamic game models among CLSC members are formulated. The optimal decisions of pricing, capacity investment, and collecting channels of the CLSC members are obtained, and the impacts of some important factors, for example, the capacity investment cost coefficient and the cost-sharing factors, on optimal decisions are investigated. The results reveal that the supplier collecting mode performs better in some scenarios; therefore, the management enlightenment desired by the supplier can be obtained. Additionally, the coordination between the manufacturer and the supplier sometimes fails to increase the closed-loop supply chain’s sustainability, which is a finding quite different from some current research results.</jats:p>"

Study of micropollutants' removal showed all examined organic compounds can be sufficiently removed by application of catalytic ozonation either by use of calcite, or by presence of Co(II) or Fe(II) (applied as homogeneous catalysts), while the optimum catalyst between them was found to be calcite. Carbamazepine with kO3 = 3 × 105 M−1s−1 can be easily removed, even by application of single ozonation, while benzotriazole and p-CBA resulted in 50% and 68.2% higher removal after application of catalytic ozonation within 3 min of oxidation reaction, due to acceleration of hydroxyl radicals' production by presence of calcite in the ozonation system. The contribution of hydroxyl radicals in removal of all three micropollutants was evaluated by extraction of Rct and f•OH parameters.</jats:p>",

Lightening the burden not only depends on government agencies, but also needs extensive social organization participation. However, few studies focus on how to promote social cooperation to support the provision of emergency supplies. This study aimed to find out the theoretical mechanism to expand the cooperative networks of supply support organizations during the epidemic. Data from the emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic in China were used. Three cooperative networks from a progressive perspective were constructed based on the cooperative relationships among organizations. The expansion mechanism was verified by the exponential random graph model. The results show that when the institutional network expands into an interactive network, the composition of organization types has changed, but the cooperative network’s efficiency does not improve much. The matching effect of the organizational type and the Matthew effect of nodes are both effective paths to promote cooperative network expansion, however, the structure effect shows that complex relationship structure is not a critical factor. Our findings highlight the importance of core organizations and the function of different types of organizations in building cooperative network as well as providing theoretical frameworks for policymakers to use in guiding and motivating social cooperation in emergency supplies.</jats:p>"

This practice‐focused article examines these questions by looking at data collected on gender dynamics at work and at home in the clothing industries of Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kenya, Lesotho, and Vietnam. While women's empowerment through garment sector employment remains circumscribed by low wages, financial insecurity, and gendered expectations, we find that international interventions, namely the International Labor Organization's Better Work program, has expanded women's abilities to exert agency over their earnings within the context of household resource allocation and has decreased the negative effects of ongoing and systemic financial precarity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lead-acid batteries utilised in electrical substations release hydrogen and oxygen when these are charged. These gases could be dangerous and cause a risk of fire if they are not properly ventilated. Therefore, this research seeks to design and implement a network control panel for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVACS). This is achieved by using a specific range of controllers, which have more than thirty loops of proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) control to achieve a cost-effective design. It performs the required function of extracting hydrogen and oxygen, maintaining the desired temperature of the battery storage room within recommended limits (i.e., 25 ± 1 °C tolerance) without compromising quality, as set out in the user requirement specification. The system control panel allows the user to access control parameters such as changing temperature set-points, fan-speed, sensor database, etc. It does this automatically and allows no human interface after all necessary settings and installation are completed. The hardware is configured to detect extreme hydrogen and oxygen gas content in the battery room and to ensure that the HVACS extracts the gas content to the outside environment. The system’s results show that the network control panel operates effectively as per the recommended system requirements. Therefore, the effective operation of the HVACS ensures sufficient gas ventilation, thus mitigating the risk of fire in a typical battery storage room. Furthermore, this also enhances battery lifespan because of regulated operating temperature, which is conducive to minimise the effect of sulfation in lead–acid batteries (LAB). The extraction of toxic gases, regulation of temperature, ensuring suitable humidity in UPS battery room is important as it provides longer operational service of equipment, thus reducing frequent maintenance in these rooms. This benefits the electricity supply industry and helps in saving for unplanned maintenance costs.</jats:p>"

In 2015, 29% of the global population lacked safely managed drinking water supplies. Ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 becomes the sixth goal in SDGs 2030. The government’s inability to provide water supply has led to the emergence of informality in urban water supply. Tambaklorok located in the northern part of Semarang has been relying on informal practices to fulfill its water need. From this phenomenon in Tambaklorok, the practice of informality continues to be produced through the particular factors other than the physical availability of a network. This research aims to analyze informality in urban water supply in Tambaklorok, Semarang. To carry out this aim, the method that will be used is a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. This research found that informality in urban water supply in Tambaklorok caused by lack of access to networked pipe water supply, water utility roles, and practices in non-networked pipe water supply. The research recommended the alternative scheme of water supply for the community in Tambaklorok.</jats:p>",

This paper provides an integrated approach for assessing the impact of different operational constraints on distribution-network reliability by incorporating component lifetime models, time-varying component failure rates, as well as the monetary cost of customer interruptions in an all-inclusive probabilistic methodology that applies a time-sequential Monte Carlo simulation. A test distribution network based on the Roy Billinton test system was modelled to investigate the system performance when overloading limits are exceeded as well as when preventive maintenance is performed. Standard reliability indices measuring the frequency and duration of interruptions and the energy not supplied were complemented with a novel monetary reliability index. The comprehensive assessment includes not only average indices but also their probability distributions to adequately describe the risk of customer interruptions. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this holistic approach, as the impacts of operational decisions are assessed from both reliability and monetary perspectives. This informs network planning decisions through optimum investments and consideration of customer outage costs.</jats:p>"

Using a nationally representative panel dataset for Nigeria from 2010 to 2015, in combination with armed conflict data, we estimate the average effect of exposure to violent conflict on a household's farm labor supply. Our findings suggest that on average, exposure to violent conflict significantly reduces total family labor supply hours in agriculture. We also find that the decline in family labor supply is driven by a significant decline in the household head's total number of hours on the farm.</jats:p>",

Scientific and accurate establishment of quantitative method for calculating the EV produced by REBF is helpful for humans to understand the benefits of REBF protection directly and optimize the allocation of water resources by means of economics. Based on the characteristics of non-consumable and multi-values of REBF, we first identified its value composition by referring to the EV classification of river. Next, we established calculation methods for each sub-value using evaluation techniques of resources and environment economics. Finally, on the basis of calculation results of sub-values and the relationship of sub-values, we determined the maximum EV supported by each kind of water requirements of REBF, and summed up all independent parts to obtain the total EV. This method can remove repeated calculations in the process of assessing the EV produced by REBF. Our results indicated that the minimum total EV produced by REBF in the Shaanxi section of the Wei River was 4.54 billion yuan in 2017, which is close to previous studies. The new method developed here should provide a better theoretical support for quantitative research of the EV produced by REBF and scientific management of limited water resources coming from river.</jats:p>",

The results show that using the method which includes increasing capacitance to heighten the initial energy of system under the same voltage, using a low-voltage, large-capacitor power supply method under the same initial energy, can effectively increase the impulse generated by Lorentz force and its proportion in the impulse bit.

Decision making in relation to risk management in dairy industry supply chain is significant. This study aimed at designing a Intelligent decision support system (DSS) for risk assessment of dairy agroindustry supply chain and the estimation of dairy price in the risk-based farmer level. The risk assessment is analyzed by fuzzy logic approach which is Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and Fuzzy Assosiative Memories (FAMs). The basic knowledge of this system is obtained through the preparation of rule base of risk assessment and the relation of production cost and risks at the farm based on the expert arguments variables. There are six outputs yielded from RSDA, that is risk assessment in accordance with priority issue, risk assessment for delivery activity, risk source exploration, risk performance, risk management partially and the estimation of production cost and price with risks. The system provides several alternatives which will help decision making in preparing risk management in dairy agroindustry supply chain. Moreover, this system also provides several scenarios of dairy price estimation at the level of farmer who includes risk factor in the farmer. By this system, it is expected that the opportunity of risk and risk impact of dairy agroindustry supply chain can be minimized.</jats:p>"

The effective use of biomethane in gas supply systems requires scientific substantiation, considering the entire range of technological parameters and operating conditions. The methods of graphs and parametric optimization are used to minimize the total reduced costs to the gas supply system to carry out the research. Based on the analysis of gas consumption by the municipal districts of the Belgorod region, a graphical dependence is built and an expression is obtained to determine the annual gas consumption by the population on the population size. The calculation of the mass of organic waste and the density of substrate formation is made, on the basis of which the potential for biomethane production in the municipal districts of the Belgorod region is determined. It has been established that the potential volume of biomethane in the Belgorod region is 633194 thousand m3 / year, or 11% of the total gas consumption. A diagram of the location of biomethane plants and gas pipelines for supplying biomethane to gas networks has been built. The optimal values of the technological parameters of the biomethane gas supply system have been established: the operating range of the biomethane plant depending on the substrate formation density, the length of the gas network for biomethane supply, depending on the gas consumption density.</jats:p>",

For this reason, the potential of groundwater resources is important. In this study, groundwater potential zones in the Ceylanpinar Plain basin were investigated utilizing a weighted overlay analysis method combined with fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches and geoinformation technologies. The groundwater potential zone map was created using 10 theme layers that were produced and processed in a geographic information system (GIS) environment (GPZM). After that, possible groundwater zones were identified and classified into five categories: very good, good, medium, poor, and very poor. By assessing the present open well distribution and yield data of selected wells within the research catchment, the predicted groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) was confirmed. As a result, 17% of the study area was found to be very good, 39% good, 20% moderate, 21.4% poor and 2.6% very poor. This study provides a key estimate and crucial information for regional water administrators and officials in southeast Turkey by giving a map of the groundwater potential region, in order to ensure sustainable groundwater management.</jats:p>",

The irrigation treatments were non-stressed (I1) and post-anthesis water stress (I2) with three wheat cultivars. Evaluation of the model was performed using the coefficient of root mean squared error (RMSE), normalized RMSE and R2. The AquaCrop model performed well in simulating grain yield and final biomass production with R2 &amp;gt; 0.90, and RMSE and normalized RMSE values less than 10. The I1 treatment resulted in higher grain yield and biomass productivity than the I2 treatment. The I2 irrigation resulted in yield reduction of 21 and 24% in the 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 growing seasons, respectively, as compared with I2. Using the measured grain yield and AquaCrop-simulated water balance, the amount of WPET was found to vary from 0.68 to 0.95 kg m−3. The AquaCrop model was able to predict winter wheat biomass and yield production with a good accuracy in the arid conditions of this study and its ability to simulate these variables for different wheat cultivars' was especially notable. The AquaCrop model can be used to explore management scenarios to improve wheat water management in the study region.</jats:p>",

The overall objective of the study is to estimate the demand and supply of cut flowers in Tamil Nadu. Methods: Hosur block in Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu was purposively selected as it is the leader in area and production of rose flowers. A two-stage random sampling method was adopted to select the sample farms with a total sample size of 120. Simple percentage analysis and Data Envelopment Analysis were used to discuss the results. Result: The important period of demand for cut flowers in Hosur block are events like Navratri, Christmas, New Year, Valentine Day, Therthiruvizha, Ramjan and Bakrith. There were 164 days in a year which would be auspicious. On an average 450 bunches of rose, 320 bunches of gerberas and 150 bunches of carnations are used in an event in addition to some other flowers. The technical efficiency measures for Roses indicated that most farmers belonged to the least efficient category ( less than 90 per cent) with a proportion of 62.50 per cent to total.\n</jats:p>"

However, in some cases, the military unit for the implementation of its tasks may act as an independent entity in civil law, and therefore, certain relations are governed not only by constitutional, administrative, economic, but also civil law. This paper will deal with contractual obligations.\nThe supply contract is extremely important in providing Ukraine, its subjects and state entities with the necessary goods, performance of works, provision of services. In essence, the institute of contract law is a legal means of implementing state policy in the field of industrial production, construction, national defense, social assistance, science, culture, the implementation of basic social and production tasks. Currently, there is a trend aimed at increasing the budget funds used through public procurement.\nIn this regard, an urgent problem is the effective legal regulation of public relations related to the supply of goods for public use.

Twelve Sprague Dawley rats underwent surgery and were divided in two groups, breathing either 100% oxygen or atmospheric air during a post-operative period. The peripheral blood oxygen saturation and arterial acid-base status were analyzed for differences between the two groups. We found that oxygen supply after surgery prevented hypoxia but did not result in a significant difference in the blood acid-base status. All rats developed respiratory acidosis, which could not be reversed by supplemental oxygen supply. We concluded that oxygen supply improved oxygen saturation and avoided hypoxia but did not have an influence on the acid-base status.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Carbon estimating plays a vital role in the construction industry. The current focus on introducing zero-carbon construction projects reduces operational carbon, at the expense of Embodied Carbon (EC). However, it is important to reduce overall net carbon emissions. There are various methods to estimate carbon, but the accuracy of these estimates is questionable. This paper reviews a novel methodology, the Supply Chain based Embodied carbon Estimating Method (SCEEM), which was introduced recently to accurately estimate EC in construction supply chains. SCEEM is compared against existing EC estimating methods (Blackbook and eToolLCD) using a case study approach. It is also supplemented with a comprehensive literature review of existing EC methods. The EC values calculated using Blackbook and eToolLCD were mostly higher than SCEEM. Since SCEEM uses actual site data and considers first principles-based value addition method to estimate EC, it is considered accurate. The cross-case analysis revealed that SCEEM provided consistent results. Hence, SCEEM is recommended to accurately estimate EC of any type of project.</jats:p>"

The maximum lead(II) sorption capacity was found to be 75.75 (mg/g) and obtained using 1 g/L MnFe2O4 when pH equals 5.3, a temperature of 25 °C, and contact time as 60 min. The adsorption isotherm study indicated that the Langmuir model was the best model that described the adsorption process using 1 g/L MnFe2O4. Based on the values of correlation coefficient data (R2), the kinetic adsorption parameters were well defined by the second-order kinetic model. Furthermore, the temperature effect findings have been confirmed that the removal of lead ions was endothermic.

The nitrogen removal ability of the reactor was evaluated for 91 days. A 1 m-long dropping nitrification unit was fed with synthetic groundwater containing 30 mg-NH4+-N/L at a flow rate of 2.16 L/d. The outlet of the dropping nitrification unit was connected to the cotton-based denitrification unit. The NH4+ present in the groundwater was completely oxidized (&amp;gt;90% nitrification efficiency) by nitrifying bacteria to nitrite (NO2–) and nitrate (NO3–) in the dropping nitrification unit. Subsequently, the generated NO2– and NO3– were denitrified (96%–98% denitrification efficiency) by denitrifying bacteria in the cotton-based denitrification unit under anoxic conditions. Organic carbons released from the cotton presumably acted as electron donors for heterotrophic denitrification. Nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria were colonized in higher abundance in the dropping nitrification and cotton-based denitrification units, respectively. The total N removal rate and efficiency of the dropping nitrification–cotton-based denitrification reactor for 91 days were 58.1–66.9 mg-N/d and 96%–98%, respectively. Therefore, the dropping nitrification–cotton-based denitrification reactor will be an efficient, sustainable, and promising option for total N removal from NH4+-contaminated groundwater.</jats:p>",

During a field study of ecological migrants in rural Ningxia, the authors witnessed the problems encountered in the implementation of a public housing project. This episode demonstrates how the provision of rural public goods depends on rural governance that responds to the tension between modern development and the values of rural society. The failure of the project stems from the clash between the logic of peasant actions and the performance indicators of cadres, producing an internal rupture between rural society and rural governance. In the process of modernization and urbanization, grassroots government is becoming more bureaucratic and technical, with the prevalence of e-government and especially with village committees turning increasingly administrativized and beholden to superior levels of government, and thus is failing to fully embed itself in rural society.</jats:p>",

We aimed to estimate the rates and evaluate related factors of PIMS. We searched four databases for relevant articles published from January 2000 to March 2021. We then performed a meta‐analysis of the pooled data to estimate the rates and related factors of PIMS using Stata 15.0. Descriptive analyses of textual data were performed to summarise the related factors of PIMS if data could not be synthesised quantitatively. The quality of included studies was assessed using Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS), AHRQ checklist or Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ). Overall, 27 studies were included in this review. At different periods after delivery, approximately 50% of mothers reported PIMS as the reason for stopping breastfeeding, while for breastfeeding mothers, the incidence of PIMS ranged from 10% to 25%. Breastfeeding initiation (OR 4.22, 95%CI 1.57–11.34) and breastfeeding knowledge (OR 7.10, 95%CI 2.00–25.26) were two factors influencing PIMS. Besides, PIMS had a strong negative relationship with breastfeeding self‐efficacy (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = −0.57); moderate negative association with infant suck ability (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = −0.46) and planned breastfeeding duration (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = −0.45); and a moderate positive correlation with formula supplementation (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0.42). Descriptive analyses revealed that infant crying was reported to be a sign of PIMS, and inadequate intake of energy/liquids was a reported cause of it. This review identified a high proportion of women reporting PIMS, particularly among those who stopped breastfeeding. Deliberate interventions were needed to improve breastfeeding for mothers at risk.</jats:p>",

Due to this, defluoridation by using locally available plants is one of the most efficient and sustainable options. Therefore, the current study was intended to investigate fluoride removal efficiency of Tulsi (Ocimum Sanctum) from water, which can be an alternative means to reduce the problem related to its high concentration. A laboratory-based experimental study was implemented by using potentiometric determination in Haramaya University. The leaves of Tulsi were collected, washed with tap water, rinsed with distilled water, and then dried at room temperature, crushed and sieved through a 500-μm stainless steel sieve. The experiments were conducted on water artificially fluoridated by anhydrous fluoride and natural water samples collected from deep well water sources from Adama and Harar town. Data was analyzed using Design of Expert (DOE) and Microsoft Excel. Twenty-nine runs for aqueous solution were conducted at different factor combinations and the optimum combinations were applied for natural water samples. The study depicts that the plant has an efficiency of removing 68.4% of fluoride from water. The best factor combinations to achieve this efficiency was 0.2 g/100 ml, 22.6 min, 5.7 and 6.6 mg/l, adsorbent dose, contact time, pH and initial concentration respectively. pH and initial concentration have a negative effect and adsorbent dose and contact time have a positive effect on removing fluoride from water. Hence, people living in fluorosis endemic areas can use the processed plant as a de-fluoridating agent to minimize adverse health effects.</jats:p>",

In this research, we develop a novel approach to group decision-making problems based on the BWM called G-BWM. This approach helps us to analyze the preferences of decision makers to carry out democratic decision making using the BWM structure. In order to assess the applicability of the proposed methodology and represent its novelty, two numerical examples from the literature with the application to supply chain management (SCM) (i.e., green supplier selection and supplier development/segmentation) are examined and discussed.

With the continued of health crisis caused by this communicable disease, medical device and personal protection equipment become precious commodity for the general public and healthcare professionals. Therefore, there is a growing demand of Personal Protection Equipment especially face mask and N95 respirators in all over countries. Unfortunately, the decade of expansive trade had been distorted by pandemic of Covid-19 that made the medical supplies cannot meet the global demand. Prior to the outbreak of covid-19, there was an interdependency of medical supplies trade through Global Value Chain. GVC had made the production of medical supplies are effectively fragmented and globally integrated. This article tries to examine the architecture of global medical supply through the lens of Global Value Chain (GVC) before and after pandemic. Using a qualitative methodology this article tries to provide analytical descriptive on global medical devices fragmentation. We use the full UN Comtrade data from 1990 to 2018, Foreign Direct Investment Data from OECD and mass media news to track the shifting of medical devices production during pandemic. The main results indicate that the worsening situation of Pandemic Covid-19 has brought state actors and non-state actors to create new pattern in GVC to provide medical devices worldwide.

As part of this investigation, we identify the key features distinguishing \"super sellers\" from regular participants and develop a machine learning based approach for inferring the quality of gigs, which is especially important for the vast majority of gigs with little feedback.\n      \n    </jats:p>"

Flexibility in planning decisions makes modular manufacturing a promising way to address this problem. In this work, the problem of multiperiod process and supply chain network design is considered under demand uncertainty. A mixed integer two‐stage stochastic programming problem is formulated with integer variables indicating the process design and continuous variables to represent the material flow in the supply chain. The problem is solved using a rolling horizon approach. Benders decomposition is used to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem. To promote risk‐averse decisions, a downside risk measure is incorporated in the model. The results demonstrate the several advantages of modular designs in meeting product demands. A pareto‐optimal curve for minimizing the objectives of expected cost and downside risk is obtained.</jats:p>",

The three-parameter distributions (PearsonIII, Log-PearsonIII) are more suitable for modelling annual maxima than distribution functions with only two parameters (Normal, Log-normal, Gumbel). The Mann–Kendall test statistic indicated that there is no statistically significant trend identified in annual maximum discharges or average annual discharges. A positive increasing trend was observed in annual temperature, while annual precipitation shows a decreasing trend which is non-significant. The seasonality analysis found a statistically non-significant weak negative trend in discharge in spring, summer and autumn and a statistically non-significant weak positive trend in winter. During winter, spring, and summer a non-significant negative trend in precipitation was observed, while autumn has experienced a statistically significant increasing trend. Temperatures show a positive trend in all seasons, but only temperatures during the warm period show a statistically significant increase. The results demonstrate that decreasing discharges of the Sava River at the Sremska Mitrovica gauging station are mainly the consequence of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature (increasing evaporation), which is consistent with the results of other studies of the region.</jats:p>",

Thus, there is an increasing impetus to use simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, and hybrid simulation in the context of SCM. In conventional supply chain simulation, the underlying constituents of the system like manufacturing, distribution, retail, and logistics processes are often modelled and executed as a single model.

To understand the current state-of-the-art of DSCS, this paper presents a methodological review and categorization of literature in DSCS using a framework-based approach. Through a study of over 130 articles, we report on the motivation for using DSCS, the modelling techniques, the underlying distributed computing technologies and middleware, its advantages and a future agenda, and also limitations and trade-offs that may be associated with this approach. The increasing adoption of technologies like Internet-of-Things and Cloud Computing will ensure the availability of both data and models for distributed decision-making, which is likely to enable data-driven DSCS of the future. This review aims to inform organizational stakeholders, simulation researchers and practitioners, distributed systems developers and software vendors, as to the current state-of-the art of DSCS, and which will inform the development of future DSCS using new applied computing approaches.</jats:p>",

This study assessed the water stress by applying the water supply stress index (WaSSI) in relation to green (WaSSI<jats:sub>G</jats:sub>) and blue (WaSSI<jats:sub>B</jats:sub>) water resources across six major cropland basins including the Mississippi (North America), San Francisco (South America), Nile (Africa), Danube (Europe), Ganges-Brahmaputra (Asia), and Murray-Darling (Australia) for the past 17-years (2003–2019). The WaSSI<jats:sub>G</jats:sub> and WaSSI<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> results indicated that the Murray-Darling Basin experienced the most severe (maximum WaSSI<jats:sub>G</jats:sub> and WaSSI<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> anomalies) green and blue water stresses and the Mississippi Basin had the least. All basins had both green and blue water stresses for at least 35% (6 out of 17 years) of the study period. The interannual variations in green water stress were driven by both crop water demand and green water supply, whereas the blue water stress variations were primarily driven by blue water supply. The WaSSI<jats:sub>G</jats:sub> and WaSSI<jats:sub>B</jats:sub> provided a better understanding of water stress (blue or green) and their drivers (demand or supply driven) across cropland basins.

A case study was carried out comprising cities in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. The costs of initial installation, the chemical product, the operation of the system, and the control of fluoride levels between the years 2012 and 2017 were considered. The annual per capita cost of the treatment was calculated to estimate the fluoridation weight concerning the total expenses. The fluoridation annual per capita cost ranged from R$ 20.14 (US$ 7.23) in towns with less than two thousand inhabitants to R$ 0.39 (US$ 0.14) in cities with a population of approximately 520 thousand inhabitants. In systems that supply up to 30 thousand inhabitants, the running cost was responsible for most of the expenses, ranging from 98.2 to 84%. For cities with 520 thousand inhabitants, the costs with the chemical product corresponded to 74.7% of the expenses. Compared with the total treatment cost, the water fluoridation cost ranged from 0.2 to 0.6% for population sizes of 30 thousand inhabitants or more and varied from 1.3 to 7.3% for towns with less than 10 thousand inhabitants. Considering that the decision-making process is complex in the field of public policies, and decision-makers suffer multiple influences as for different policy alternatives, knowing the implications of population size for costs is essential for informed decision-making.</jats:p>"

At the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, economic growth surveys did not project that the novel virus could have a negative impact on economic growth. As a result of the rapid spread of the virus and the increase in the number of infection cases, national governments took strict measures to limit the spread of the virus, which led to a significant deterioration in the economic situation in all industries of the economy. Agriculture plays an important role in providing food to the country’s population, yet the pandemic made a negative impact on sales volumes and prices in the domestic and international markets. The research aims to assess the impacts of the pandemic on milk supply chains in Latvia and come up with solutions to stabilizing the situation in the dairy sector. The national restrictions to combat the pandemic also hampered the dairy sector concerning the sale of raw milk and finished products in foreign markets, thereby leading to overproduction and stockpiling of the finished products, price dumping and a significant decrease in milk purchase prices to or below the production cost level for many dairy farms. Although there is no indication that the pandemic would lead to a decrease in the numbers of livestock and farms or output in early 2021, it is too early to assess the overall impact of the pandemic on dairy farming, as uncertainty over the duration of pandemic restrictions is a major risk to farm survival. The operation of the dairy sector was stabilized by means of the support provided by the government, as well as the farms’ accumulated financial and feed resources. In order to identify future challenges for milk supply chains, the research performed an analysis of operational risks for milk producers and processors to identify the most important risks and design recommendations for their elimination. The longer there is uncertainty about the return of the dairy sector to pre-pandemic output levels, the more likely it is that the pandemic is going to lead to a decrease in the numbers of dairy livestock and farms.</jats:p>",

The claim of natural gas is on the continuous increase to meet domestic needs in the city, suburban areas together with industrial, commercial, power generation and diverse usage against the scarcity of gas. The demand for natural gas is on the continuous increase to meet domestic needs in the urban, suburban areas alongside industrial, commercial, power generation and diverse usage against the scarcity of gas. In this situation, LPG becomes a popular alternative energy source to reduce the natural gas crisis along with providing clean fuel in rustic areas. LPG is using by about 81% in its total amount for domestic purposes. At present in 2018 LPG demand in Bangladesh is approximate 750,000 MT and in future 2025 it would be 250, 0000 MT with growth rate 25%, 17 %, 14%, 15 %, 8%, 20% and 17% respectively. Now a day 12 KG LPG cylinders price is BDT 1150-1200 because of the variety of market barriers, government VAT and higher transaction costs which is not affordable for the middle as well as a low-income family though Bangladesh government fixed the price every month. LPG could assume an increasingly significant job in giving cooking energy to low-middle pay family units in Bangladesh if an appropriate advertising structure and circulation plan are masterminded. The aim of this project is to find out the challenges of LPG supply, distribution, and pricing in the growing Bangladesh market and to make a well planned and details road map so that LPG companies of Bangladesh can serve 70% of the domestic cooking fuel through LPG by 2025.</jats:p>"

The values of hydrogen potential (pH) were obtained with a digital pH meter. The analyzes were carried out the 2013 to 2019. The turbidity and free residual chlorine values were obtained according to the method of the Practical Manual of Water Analysis of the National Health Foundation (FUNASA). To determine the microbiological parameters, PetrifilmTM plates (3MTM do Brasil Ltda) were used, following the manufacturer's guidelines. The analyzed values were compared with reference values described in Consolidation Ordinance nº. 5, of September 28, 2017, of the Ministry of Health (MS) which sets the standards for potability of water intended for human consumption. The results varied for all parameters evaluated: pH (3.11 to 8.24), turbidez (0.02 to 3,01), TC (0 to 100%), TTC (0 to 100%) and heterotrophic bacteria (85 to 100%). The values obtained for free residual chlorine were the only parameter to follow the reference values. The highest contamination for TC and heterotrophic bacteria were reported in 2019, higher the limits established in Brazilian legislation. Thus, the water was characterized as unfit for consumption and requires severe control for TC and heterotrophic bacteria.  </jats:p>"

MCOR corresponds to the minimum additional infrastructure investment that is required to achieve a certain level of resilience. To guarantee MCOR, we incorporate the metrics in a multi‐scenario mixed‐integer linear program (MILP) that accounts for resilience in the design phase of interconnected networks. The goal is to obtain optimal generation and transportation capacities with flexible operation under all single‐connectivity disruption scenarios. We demonstrate the applicability of our resilience‐aware framework on a water‐energy nexus (WEN) example focusing on grass‐root design and retrofitting. We further apply the framework to analyze a regional WEN and observe that it is possible to achieve “full” resilience in the expense of additional regional investments.</jats:p>",

An impulse product parameter P is developed and a wide range of effective parameters are studied. The volume-of-fluid (VOF) and overset mesh methods have been used to study landslide-generated tsunamis. Also, a Lagrangian tracking approach coupled with the VOF to simulate the granular movement was developed. The effect of the water reservoir depth, the landslide height, the landslide density and the geometrical parameters on the wave height (elevation) has been investigated using the open-source OpenFOAM software. The results have been presented for dimensionless distances and the normalized geometry of the landslide in the ranges 5–7, and 1–2, respectively. These numbers have been normalized to the height of the landslide (a). According to the results of simulations, the tsunami formation process is divided into three stages, which were analyzed in detail by considering the interactions between the solid and the water reservoir. The Scott Russell wave has the highest impulse product parameter among the impulse wave mechanisms which is 58.6% of the total impulse production. In addition, the duration of the wave propagation has been computed based on the wave height.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As a result of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, numerous countries have become highly interested in sustainability. Manufacturers have been triggered to develop sustainable supply chain strategies in consideration of their value-added processes and stakeholders. This study was conducted, in the context of small- and medium-sized enterprises in the Taiwanese manufacturing industry, in order to examine the relationship between sustainability and business performance from the perspective of the supply chain aspects of business cooperation, operation integration, and enterprise commitment. A total of 290 companies were surveyed and structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the figures from the samples. The results reveal that the implementation of sustainable practices in the context of enterprise commitments, supply chain cooperation, and operation integration has a positive impact on sustainability and business performance. Furthermore, in high-value manufacturing, supply chain cooperation significantly affects sustainable business performance through internal operation integration. These results may serve as a reference for the realization of supply chain sustainability in small- and medium-sized enterprises.</jats:p>"

Considering the rapidly increasing aging population in South Korea, it is important to establish whether the demand for ICU care is met by the currently available ICU beds. However, there have been no reports regarding the relationship between the increase in the number of ICU beds and the increase in the utilization of ICU facilities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the trends in ICU bed supply and ICU bed-days in the adult population.\nMethods\n We evaluated the 9-year trend in ICU bed rates and bed-days in South Korea between 2011 and 2019 in a population-based cross-sectional analysis, using data from the Health Insurance Review &amp; Assessment Service database. We described changes in ICU bed rates in adult (≥ 20 years) and older adult (≥ 65 years) populations. ICU bed-days were categorized similarly and used to predict future ICU bed demands.\nResults\n The ICU bed rate was higher in 2011 than in 2019 (23.3 and 20.2 per 100,000 adults and 161.2 and 107.5 per 100,000 older adults, respectively). The number of ICU bed-days was lower in 2011 than in 2019 (100.5 and 137.8 per 1,000 adults and 59.0 and 86.1 per 1,000 older adults, respectively). In 2019, the regional differences in the ICU bed rate and ICU bed-days nearly doubled and tripled, respectively. The ICU bed occupancy rate in South Korea is expected to rise to 97.7% in 2030.\nConclusion\n A significant discrepancy was found between the supply and demand of ICU beds in South Korea. This discrepancy requires urgent action. Our findings may inform government organizations about the necessity of planning and preparing for future ICU demands and the shortage in their supply.</jats:p>"

If a winning therapeutic emerges, it is unlikely that the existing inventory of the medicine, or even the chemical raw materials needed to synthesize it, will be available in the quantities required. We used retrosynthetic software to arrive at alternate chemical supply chains for the antiviral drug umifenovir, as well as eleven other antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs. We have experimentally validated four routes to umifenovir and one route to bromhexine. In several instances, the software utilizes C–H functionalization logic, and one route to umifenovir employs functionalization of six C–H bonds. The general strategy we apply can be used to identify distinct starting materials, and relieve stress on existing supply chains.</jats:p>"

Peralatan power audio memerlukan power supply yang berdaya yang besar untuk menghasilkan suara yang besar dan tegangan drop yang rendah sehingga dapat memaksimalkan penggunaan energi listrik untuk konsumsi power audio. Power Supply Switching pada umumnya memiliki kekurangan seperti tegangan drop yang tinggi ketika dibebani, serta kurangnya tingkat efisiensi yang disebabkan tidak adanya rangkaian Power Factor Correction  (PFC), sehingga membuat faktor daya pada input power suplay rendah dan mengakibatkan output tidak maksimal. Pada penelitian ini membuat rancangan  Power Supply Switching yang akan dioptimalkan menggunakan topologi half bridge converter dan rangkaian PFC. Pada rangkaian PFC menggunakan IC FA5502 dengan Frekuensi 125 Khz lalu di serahkan dengan menggunakan dioda frekuensi tinggi dan di filter menggunakan kapasitor. Hasil penyerahan masuk ke half bridge converter mengunakan mosfet IRFP 460 dan dikontrol menggunakan IC SG3525 dengan frekuensi switching 79 KHz. Kemudian masuk ke trafo frekuensi tinggi untuk di konversikan ke tegangan rendah, setelah itu disearahkan menggunakan dioda frekuensi tinggi dan masuk kedalam rangkaian filter kapasitor. Power supply ini juga dilengkapi dengan rangkaian proteksi hubung singkat, sehingga jika terjadi hubung singkat maka power supply akan shut down. Dengan rancangan ini didapatkan bahwa power supply yang di buat memiliki drop tegangan yang rendah ini disebabkan karena adanya rangkaian feedback yang meregulasi tegangan outputnya serta terdapat proteksi hubung singkat untuk  mengamankan power supply dan power amplifier yang di supply jika terjadi hubung singkat.</jats:p>"

Inappropriate dump sites have served for many years as marginal disposal sites for a wide range of wastes, including solid waste, fresh sewage and hazardous waste, in developing nations such as Ethiopia. Physical, anthropogenic and organic procedures continuously interact to deteriorate the waste. One of the results of these practices is artificially contaminated leachate, which is potentially hazardous waste from disposal sites. If not managed appropriately, such a dumping site can contaminate groundwater (through leachates) and surface water (through contaminant transport by flooding and groundwater movement). Along these lines, this study focuses on the applications of water quality index in the ground and surface water quality caused by the waste disposal site of Bahir Dar city within the Chilanchil Abay during the study period. Water testing was performed on five samples of surface water and six samples of groundwater in each month from 30th March (dry season) to 20th August (wet season). More than 13 water quality parameters, for example, pH, TDS, electrical conductivity, turbidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), TH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), TC, NO3−, PO43−, Cr, Mn, and Pb contents, were examined in both ground and surface water. It was discovered that water quality status of the Chilanchil Abay watershed ranges from 15.87 to 36.6 for surface water and 42 to 46.2 for groundwater suggesting poor and marginal status for drinking water purpose.</jats:p>",

Adsorption is an effective method for phosphate and nitrate removal from wastewater. It is efficient, quick, easy, low-cost and environmentally friendly. Even though different adsorbents have been developed with excellent properties, lack of compilation, lack of consistency in operational conditions, and lack of other important parameters used for direct comparison and practical use selection were observed. The first aim of this review is to provide facts and figures on novel adsorbents used for nitrate, phosphate, and simultaneous nitrate-phosphate removal and recovery. Second, various adsorbents applied for nitrate and phosphate removal have been compared in terms of the number of cycles that the adsorbent used; retained removal capacity (RR); the removal capacity of the adsorbent considering the threshold limit settled by EU and EPA as equilibrium concentration for phosphate (q0.1) and nitrate (q10); and time to reach the equilibrium capacity (t90). Third, based on the aforementioned criteria, the best adsorbents are proposed and this is the key novelty of this review work. Moreover, future aspects and challenges regarding nitrate and phosphate removal and recovery are presented.</jats:p>",

This study utilizes dyadic survey data collected from both supplier account managers and their customers to explore social media's impacts in the digitalized supply chain context. Drawing upon the knowledge‐based view of the firm, the study proposes and tests a conceptual model. Results indicate that supplier account manager's social media use can increase his or her product and competitor knowledge, which can positively influence customer outcome. Further, the moderation test suggests that when perceived customer demandingness is high, the relationship between social media use and knowledge will be stronger. This study draws much‐needed attention to social media as an emerging digital supply chain management too.</jats:p>",

However, the extent to which this bottom-up, interest-driven content production paradigm meets the needs of consumers of this content is unclear. In this paper, we introduce an analytical framework for studying the relationship between content production and consumption in peer production communities. Applying our framework to four large Wikipedia language editions, we find extensive misalignment between production and consumption in all of them. We also show that this misalignment has an enormous effect on Wikipedias readers. For example, over 1.5 billion monthly pageviews in the English Wikipedia go to articles that would be of much higher quality if editors optimally distributed their work to meet reader demand. Examining misalignment in more detail, we observe that there is an excess of high-quality content about certain specific topics, and that the majority of articles with insufficient quality are in a stable state (i.e. not breaking news). Finally, we discuss technolo- gies and community practises that can help reduce the misalignment between the supply of and demand for high-quality content in peer production communities.\n      \n    </jats:p>"

For this purpose, carotenoid-rich callus was cultured on either BI (modified Gamborg B5) or R (modified Murashige and Skoog MS) mineral media or on modified media obtained by exchanging compounds between BI and R. Callus growing on the BI medium had abundant carotene crystals in the cells and a dark orange color in contrast to pale orange callus with sparse crystals on the R medium. The carotenoid content, determined by HPLC and spectrophotometrically after two months of culture, was 5.3 higher on the BI medium. The replacement of media components revealed that only the N concentration and the NO3:NH4 ratio affected carotenoid accumulation. Either the increase of N amount above 27 mM or decrease of NO3:NH4 ratio below 12 resulted in the repression of carotenoid accumulation. An adverse effect of the increased NH4+ level on callus growth was additionally found. Somatic embryos were formed regardless of the level of N supplied. Changes to other media components, i.e., macroelements other than N, microelements, vitamins, growth regulators, and sucrose had no effect on callus growth and carotenoid accumulation. The results obtained from this model system expand the range of factors, such as N availability, composition of N salts, and ratio of nitrate to ammonium N form, that may affect the regulation of carotenoid metabolism.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The charging time of Li-ion batteries connected in series (LBCSs) power supply is the main concern in an electromagnetic propulsion system. However, the capacity loss of a Li-ion battery is inevitable due to the repetitive operation of LBCSs power supply, which leads to the decrease in the average current. Thus, the voltages of symmetrically distributed pulse capacitors of LBCSs power supply will not reach the setting value in the specified time. This paper proposes a novel closed-loop control method to solve the problem. By collecting the pulse capacitor voltage and the circuit current, the time sequences of Li-ion batteries are recalculated in real time in a closed-loop to increase the average current. The time-domain model of the circuit topology of the LBCSs power supply and an innovative closed-loop control method based on the time sequences recalculation algorithm are described first. Then, the circuit model is built in PSIM for simulation analyses. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the method on the megawatt LBCSs power supply platform. Both the simulation and experimental results validate that the proposed method not only shortens the charging time, but also increases the average current. In practical experiments, the charging time is shortened by 4.5% and the average current is increased by 4.8% using the proposed method at the capacity loss of 50 V.</jats:p>"

Photoelectrocatalysis was used for degradation organic pollutants from produced water. BCN nanostructures were coated on a coil-type copper wire to act as anode electrode in the photoelectrocatalytic process. The effect of different parameters on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency from produced water was investigated by a central composite design (CCD) to maximize photoelectrocatalysis influence as one of the most used methods of wastewater treatment. A 12 run Plackett–Burman design was used for screening of the parameters (initial COD, electrical conductivity, applied cell voltage, UV lamp wavelength, H2O2 concentration, residence time, and initial pH) which led to the selection of residence time and initial pH as effective parameters. Since the core goal of this study was to maximize the COD removal efficiency, the steepest ascent method was used to propel these two parameters to the optimum region. Finally, CCD showed that applying photoelectrocatalysis could lead to 88.79% of the COD removal efficiency which would be an optimum value at a residence time of 15.85 min and a pH value of 3.3. Ultimately, this result was confirmed by experimentation at those conditions.</jats:p>",

The advantages of the proposed circuit are illustrated with theoretical analysis and supported by numerical simulations. The core was combined with a recently proposed switched capacitor, inverter-like integrator implementing offset cancellation and low-frequency noise reduction techniques. Experimental results performed on a prototype designed and fabricated using a commercial 0.18 μm CMOS process are presented. The prototype produces a reference voltage of 220 mV with a temperature sensitivity of 45 ppm/°C across a 10–50 °C temperature range. The proposed voltage reference can be used to source currents up to 100 μA with a quiescent current consumption of only 630 nA.</jats:p>"

According to the requirements of the aircraft’s mass center, the optimal oil supply flow rates of each tank can be obtained quickly, and the deviation between the predicted mass center and the ideal mass center can be minimized during flight. The calculation examples show that the maximum deviation between the predicted mass center and the ideal mass center is 0.63μm when the attitude of the aircraft is always unchanged, and it’s 13.6cm when the attitude of the aircraft is constantly adjusted, which can meet the practical requirements.

A demand shock theory can explain the decrease in firm’s capital expenditures and net debt issuance during crisis period, but there should be no causal link between the two.

В 2007 г. специалистами ЭКОС Групп были построены и введены в эксплуатацию очистные сооружения для сточных вод завода по производству минеральных удобрений. Вводу в эксплуатацию предшествовали полноценные опытно-промышленные испытания на пилотной установке производительностью 1 м3/ч. Предварительные пилотные испытания являются наиболее верным шагом при реализации проектов по возведению канализационных очистных сооружений. На пилотной установке были апробированы предлагаемые технологические решения: дозы химических реагентов, последующее осветление, фильтрация и сорбция на безнапорных фильтрах. В результате были определены технологические параметры, принятые к проекту, и основные показатели качества исходной сточной воды. Эффективность очистки при фильтровании через ершовый фильтр составила до 80%. Показана необходимость усреднения исходных сточных вод и использования ступени биологической очистки. По завершении работ заказчик получил надежные, простые в эксплуатации очистные сооружения, что позволило прекратить сброс сточных вод в городскую канализацию и сократить собственное водопотребление на производственные нужды.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The introduction of recycling water supply is an important factor in reducing the negative impact of industrial enterprises on the environment.

Preliminary pilot tests are a smart move in the implementation of projects for the construction of wastewater treatment facilities. The proposed process solutions were tested in the pilot plant: dosages of chemicals, subsequent clarification, filtration and sorption in gravity filters. As a result, the process parameters and the main indicators of the quality of raw wastewater were determined. The filtration efficiency in a ERSH was up to 80%. The necessity of raw wastewater balancing and the use of a biological treatment stage is shown. Upon completion of the work, the customer received reliable, easy-to-work treatment facilities; effluent discharge into the municipal sewer was ceased and the water consumption for the production needs was reduced.</jats:p>",

In Brazil, the water supply sector corresponds to 2.6 % of the total energy consumed in the country, with pumping systems being responsible for over 90 % of the total energy consumption. It is extremely common to find supersized facilities with pump motor sets operating outside their ideal points, with it being a common practice to perform flow and pressure control through the installation of valves. The use of reducing valves inserts unnecessary pressure drops into the hydraulic system, increasing energy consumption. The objective of this work is to present an energy balance of a study sector of the Autonomous Water and Sewage Service (AWSS) of a municipality in the south of Minas Gerais, Brazil, aiming to elucidate the electric energy consumption of the system and where the reduction in such consumption may occur. For this, we measured data such as the efficiency of the pump motor sets, calculated performance indicators and water loss indices, and applied the energy balance adapted. This work presents an application of a water-energy balance with adaptations to a Brazilian water supply system, under the perspective of the energy efficiency in lift station pump motor sets.</jats:p>"

Based on univariate sensitivity analysis, uncertainty in hydrogen demand has a very strong impact on the overall system costs. Therefore we consider a scenario tree for a stochastic mixed integer linear programming model that incorporates the uncertainty in the hydrogen demand. The model consists of two configurations, which are analyzed and compared to each other according to production types: water electrolysis versus steam methane reforming. Each configuration has a cost minimization target. The concept of value of stochastic solution (VSS) is used to evaluate the stochastic optimization results and compare them to their deterministic counterpart. The VSS of each configuration shows significant benefits of a stochastic optimization approach for the model presented in this study, corresponding up to 26% of infrastructure investments savings.</jats:p>",

The surveyed population was divided into five age groups: 16-21, 22-35, 36-45, 46-60 and 61-74 years old. The parameters of carbohydrate metabolism (glucose, lactate, pyruvate) were determined in the blood serum, the content of thiamine (thiamin diphosphate effect) and riboflavin - in hemolysates, and the values of the lactate/pyruvate ratio (Lac/Pyr) were calculated. Statistical data processing was performed by nonparametric methods. An increase in glucose levels was found in persons of older age groups. Age-related fluctuations of metabolites of carbohydrate metabolism were manifested by a lower content of lactate and the value of the Lac/Pyr ratio in persons aged 16-21 years. Regardless of the age and region of the survey, there were revealed high lactate concentrations, Lac/Pyr values and reduced pyruvate levels, as well as low glucose levels in group aged 16-21 year in AR. For vitamins B1, B2, no pronounced age-related changes were observed, while the content of riboflavin was higher in persons of SR. Moderate hypovitaminosis of thiamin was detected in 13-20,1% and 6,1-22,7% of cases in SR and AR, pronounced - 8,3-11,6% and 4,6-23,5%, respectively, vitamin B2 deficiency was noted in 19,4-23,9% of persons in the AR and in 33,8-42,9% of persons in the AR. Vitamins in both regions at different age periods contributed to the formation of levels of indicators of carbohydrate metabolism: glucose and pyruvate in SR, lactate in AR.</jats:p>",

In a competitive market, running a business smoothly in a highly suitable place is day by day becoming tough due to the very high fare for those locations. Thus, limited storage is available in those elite places with high fares, and a retailer takes a financial risk by stocking huge amounts of products in those limited storage stores. Thus, the appropriate financial analysis is required to find out optimal strategies (financial decisions) to sustain a business organization of electronic products in a global competitive business environment. As a result, when bulk purchases of electronic products, for example, T.V., Fridges, Oven, etc., have been made by the retailer, he faces two problems. The first one is related to the limited storage; as a result, he has to pay a considerable amount to hold the products for a long time. The second one is shortages of liquid money as he invested massive amounts. To avoid these problems, he offers some price discounts on the market’s original selling price to sell the products quickly for a limited time prior to recovering his capital investment. For that reason, a price, time, and stock dependent realistic demand function have been considered in this proposed paper with two modes of discount policy. The proposed model has been solved by a classical optimization technique from calculus and provides some insights for the retailer. Some numerical examples and graphs are provided to illustrate the model.</jats:p>"

Through a ground theory approach, we develop a conceptual framework that relates the social, cognitive and temporal complexities of a wicked problem with characteristics of SSCM. Furthermore, we propose business strategies to mediate this relationship.

Managing fresh products, such as fruits and vegetables, is a particularly complicated task, since they are perishable with short shelf lives and are vulnerable to environmental conditions. This makes traceability of fresh produce very significant. The present study provides a brief overview of the relative literature on fresh produce traceability systems. It was concluded that the commercially available traceability systems usually neither cover the entire length of the supply chain nor rely on open and transparent interoperability standards. Therefore, a user-friendly open access traceability system is proposed for the development of an integrated solution for traceability and agro-logistics of fresh products, focusing on interoperability and data sharing. Various Internet of Things technologies are incorporated and connected to the web, while an android-based platform enables the monitoring of the quality of fruits and vegetables throughout the whole agri-food supply chain, starting from the field level to the consumer and back to the field. The applicability of the system, named AgroTRACE, is further extended to waste management, which constitutes an important aspect of a circular economy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since mineral supplements for horses commonly contain macro minerals, although the requirement for such is usually covered by roughage-based diets, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different dietary calcium levels on mineral serum concentrations and bone metabolism. The trial was conducted in 30 young warmblood stallions (2–3 years) that were divided into two groups for a five-month feeding trial. The groups were fed a hay- and oat-based diet and were either supplied with high (Ca-High) or moderate (Ca-Moderate) calcium excess. While in Ca-High calcium supply was about 2–2.5-fold of the requirement, in Ca-Moderate calcium requirements were slightly surpassed (1.5–1.6-fold). In order to monitor the effects of the different calcium supply, blood samples were taken during the trial and analysed for levels of macro and trace elements as well as concentrations of two bone markers. In Ca-Moderate a trend towards higher phosphorus serum levels compared to Ca-High was observed which was significant at the end of the trial (p = 0.0002). Furthermore, results showed no influence of the diet on bone markers. Results support the idea that forage-based rations for horses do not necessarily have to be supplemented with macro minerals but with trace elements.</jats:p>"

However, the ability to provide and sustain access to nutritious and safe food continues to be a major concern and a challenge for almost any country around the world, including developed countries. Some serious and global public health risks arise from food supply chains. These include food safety and adulteration risks in which unsafe food is sold for human consumption, antimicrobial resistance risks that are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the overuse of antibiotics, zoonotic disease risks (i.e., viruses and diseases that transfer from animals to humans through food supply chains), food waste, and also food security issues such as food deserts and the diet disparity among different segments of the population. This article gives an introduction to these various risks and reviews directions in the current academic literature to address these challenges. The article also seeks to highlight important new research directions in these areas, and especially those that might be of significant interest to the operations research community.</jats:p>",

To this end, a pilot activity was implemented. Two selected pilot areas were hydraulically separated to increase water pressures within the areas. The results showed that the durations of water supply increased from 3.5 to 12 hours and from 6 to 18 hours per day in the pilot areas. The water pressure in each pilot area increased from 2 to 10 m and from 3 to 18 m, respectively. Wastewater contamination was also eliminated after increasing the water pressure. Customers were informed of these achievements through workshops, flyers, and banners on streets, which encouraged them to shift from a flat rate system to a metering system. Consequently, the total billed amounts for two pilot areas in March 2019 increased by 65.0% and 97.0%, compared with those from November 2016. The bill collection ratios also increased from 48.2% to 56.9% and from 48.1% to 60.6% during pilot activities. Improving services of water supply utilities through the formation of a water distribution area with an increase in water pressure is recommended as an effective method for revenue augmentation.</jats:p>",

Although continuous monitoring is recognised as an essential step to inform the planning and design of water services, a knowledge gap has been identified in the integration of water use monitoring, HWSs and community participation. This research compares water practices of households with and without HWSs, integrating both quantitative and qualitative data. Water use data were collected at selected households via smart meters at 30 minute intervals. R computing software was used for data analytics and dashboard visualisation. Qualitative data on water practices was collected through one-to-one interviews, on-line surveys and community workshops. On a per capita basis, sites with HWSs have a 20% lower total water demand and 41% lower mains water demand than sites without HWSs. Depending on the level of sophistication of the installed HWS, the reduction of mains water use across the participants ranged from 20% to as high as 80%. Almost all sites with HWSs were able to meet the state government targets (40–60 kL/person/y) on annual per capita mains water usage. The seasonality of rainwater supply versus the weather-independent supply of greywater was observed in the data. The qualitative data collected during community engagement highlighted the importance of establishing a personal connection between the individual and the water resource and of involving the resident in the different stages of harvesting, using and disposing of water. This is expected to contribute to a higher perceived value of the water resources by improving awareness, making knowledge more accessible, improving the transparency between the community needs and the water utility decisions. To this end, the role of digital technologies in the water sector plays a role in assisting with the paradigm shift from centralised water networks to an integrated and community-empowered, centralised-hybrid water system.</jats:p>",

With a small on-chip capacitor, the output voltage of the rectifier might ring if the circuit experiences significant changes in current. The reference circuit is the first block after the rectifier, and the entire system relies on its robustness. A fully integrated dual-voltage reference circuit for bio-implantable applications is presented. The proposed circuit utilizes nonlinear current compensation techniques that significantly decrease supply variations and reject high-supply ripples for various frequencies. The reference circuit was verified using a 0.35 µm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. Maximum PSRR values of −112 dB and −128 dB were obtained. With a supply range from 2.8 to 12 V, the proposed design achieves 0.916 and 1.5 mV/V line regulation for the positive and negative reference circuits, respectively.</jats:p>"

Quantitative evaluation and research on the ecosystem water supply services in this area are beneficial for developing conservation planning and establishing ecological compensation mechanisms in water conservation areas. In this paper, based on the land use, meteorological, soil, and field observation data of the research area, the InVEST water yield model is used to estimate the water supply of the ecosystem in the Zhangcheng District. The model quantitatively analyzes the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of water supply services in the basin and the influence of different topographic factors. The results show that the average supply of ecosystem water in the Zhangcheng District is approximately 45 mm, and there is a degree of spatial heterogeneity. The total water supply in the Zhangcheng District is relatively small. The water resource supply in the southwest is relatively small, the rainfall in mountainous forest areas in the southeast is high, its water supply is higher, and the supply of forest land water is relatively high. The high-value areas are mainly distributed at 1500 to 3500 m and 15°~40°; the water supply on the sunny slope is greater than that on the shady slope. With the increase in altitude and slope, the water supply in the basin tends to increase first and then decrease.</jats:p>"

The identification of the supply–demand relationships and risks of ecosystem services is of considerable importance to the management of regional ecosystems and the effective allocation of resources. This paper took the Yihe River Basin as the research area and selected water yield, carbon sequestration, food production, and soil conservation to assess changes in the supply and demand of ecosystem services and their matching status from 2000 to 2018. Risk identification and management zoning were also conducted. Results show the following: (1) The spatial distribution of the four ecosystems service supply and demand in the Yihe River Basin was mismatched. The food production supply levels in the middle and lower reaches and the upstream water yield, carbon sequestration, and soil conservation supply levels were high. However, most of the areas with high demand for ecosystem services were concentrated downstream. (2) From 2000 to 2018, the supply of water yield and carbon sequestration in the Yihe River Basin decreased, while that of food production and soil conservation increased. The demand for the four ecosystem services also increased. (3) Water yield faced considerable supply–demand risks. Fifty percent of the sub-basins were at a high-risk level, and the risk areas were concentrated in the middle and lower reaches. The three remaining services were mainly at low-risk levels. The Yihe River Basin was divided into eight types of supply–demand risk spatial management zones based on the ecosystem service supply and demand levels, which will help promote refined regional ecosystem management and sustainable development. The supply and demand assessment of ecosystem services from a risk perspective can integrate the information of natural ecosystems and socio-economic systems and provide scientific support for watershed spatial management.</jats:p>"

The optimization process is intended to adjust the performance of PEMFCs by appraising the optimal parameters that produce a good estimation of the current–voltage (I–V) curve. In order to build an accurate equivalent circuit model for PEMFCs, a reliable and effective parameter extraction algorithm, termed a supply–demand-based optimization (SDO) algorithm, is proposed in this paper. Nine parameters (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4, Rc, β, λ, l, and Jmax) are evaluated, to minimize the sum squared deviation (SSE) between the experimental and simulated I–V curves. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the SDO algorithm, four sets of experimental data with diverse characteristics and two well-known PEMFC stacks (BSC500W and 500W Horizon) are employed. Comparison of the simulated and experimental results clearly demonstrates the superiority/competitiveness of the SDO algorithm over five well-established parameter extraction algorithms, i.e., the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), grey wolf optimization (GWO), Harris hawks optimization (HHO), and genetic algorithm (GA). Several evaluation criteria, including best SSE, worst SSE, mean SSE, and standard deviation, show that the SDO algorithm has merits in terms of PEMFC modeling.</jats:p>"

To implement hydrogen energy system in large-scale, a comprehensive hydrogen supply network should be built to supply the hydrogen with optimal infrastructure arrangement. Although the optimization of hydrogen supply chain has been extensively studied, the investigation of an integrated hydrogen-electricity supply chain is still lacking. Considering the interconvertibility of hydrogen and electricity, this study presents a spatial optimization framework that integrates geographical information system with mathematical modelling for the design and optimization of a photovoltaic-based hydrogen-electricity supply chain. The proposed framework allows the concurrent targeting of vehicle fuel and electricity demands as well as the identification of suitable locations for supply chain infrastructures. Case study results showed that the minimum cost of hydrogen-electricity supply chain is about 14.9 billion USD/y assuming two days of autonomy, and the cost of battery constitutes 43% of the total supply chain cost. When the days of autonomy is 8 and above, electricity storage in the form of hydrogen and reconversion through fuel cell is preferred.</jats:p>"

We present results from a large-scale community health worker study designed to increase the availability of and demand for malaria diagnostic testing in a rural, malaria-endemic region in western Kenya between 2015 and 2017. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Community Health Workers (CHWs) provided free malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test(mRDT) in the community. Those with a positive malaria test were provided with a discounted first-line antimalarial over-the-counter. We conducted a community-based survey to collect individual study outcomes at 12- and 18-months post-implementation. In addition, we collected monthly testing data from the 244 participating CHWs and also conducted in-depth interviews with a random sample of 70 CHWs. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> From the survey, 55% (n=948/1738) reported having a malaria test for their recent illness with 38% having been tested by a CHW. Being aware of a local CHW (95% CI:1.10-2.04) and belonging to a wealthy household (95% CI:1.14-2.06) were associated with higher malaria testing uptake from any source. Poorer households were more likely to receive a test from a CHW. School-aged children between 5-17 years were more than twice as likely to be tested by a CHW (95% CI:1.47-4.14). Both confidence in AL treatment (95% CI:1.54-4.92) and perceived accuracy of an RDT performed by a CHW (95% CI:1.12-5.27) were strongly and positively associated with testing by a CHW. In adjusted analyses, specific CHWs attributes were significantly associated with higher testing rates including formal employment (95% CI:0.05-2.70), those serving more than 50 households (95% CI:0.70-2.74) and those serving areas with a higher proportion of positive tests (95% CI:1.05, 3.22). On both the supply side and the demand side, confidence in a test performed by a CHW was strongly correlated with the success of the intervention.<jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold>Scale-up of community-based malaria testing intervention through CHWs is feasible and effective at reaching the poorest households. In order to maximize the impact of such interventions, it is important to recognize factors that may restrict both delivery and demand for such services.</jats:p>"

The US$1 billion ‘Dhaka environmentally sustainable water supply project’ aims to resolve this by providing raw water to the city from the Meghna River. The first construction package of a river intake, 22 km raw water pipeline and 500 Ml/day water treatment plant is due for completion in 2023, with three more packages currently under design. As of December 2020, two are bid and awaiting award, one will be tendered in the first quarter of 2021. Routing and constructing 100 km of pipelines up to 1.6 m in diameter through the city’s highly congested urban environment is proving extremely challenging, as is dealing with the geotechnical and seismic conditions and the need to cross major rivers while ensuring social and environmental safeguards.

A country's economic groëth refers to the growth of that country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The interest rate is one of the determining factors of economic groëth. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment and other influencing factors, the Republic of North Macedonia in recent years has maintained low inflation rates and  interest rates.&#x0D;\nEmpirical analysis of the paper  is based on data obtained from the Central Bank of Republic of North Macedonia on a quarterly basis for the period from 2008 to 2020. Through the use of co integration tests (Johanensen test), Granger causality test, autocorrelation test, VAR, ARCH and GARCH process, it is verified that the rate interest rate is a determining variable and has a long-term relationship with economic groëth.&#x0D;\nThe co integration test (Johannesen test) shoës that in all equations the results are statistically significant and the variables have a long-run relationship betëeen them. Then the use of the Granger test of causality  notes that money supply causes interest rate changes; they also cause a change in economic groëth.&#x0D;\nThe unit root test is used to determine the level of integration of variables .The use of the Granger causality test then points out that the money supply causes  changes on  interest rate ; GDP also causes interest rate changes. The interest rate causes the change of economic groëth. Government spending causes the change of economic groëth. The effective exchange rate causes the change of economic growth.&#x0D;\nEvidence of co integration allowed the application of the VAR model, which enabled the identification of variables that affect economic groëth in the Republic of North Macedonia, both in the short and long term.&#x0D;\nIn the end, all variables are tested together and it turns out that logarithmic GDP and interest rates have an impact on economic growth.&#x0D;\nThe conclusions from the data analysis are that all variables are interrelated and have an impact on economic growth.&#x0D;\nAlso there can be identified and other economic factors that have impact on economic growth that are not included on this paper.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2007, Unilever, the world’s largest tea company, announced plans to source its entire tea supply sustainably, beginning with the certification of its tea producers in East Africa to Rainforest Alliance standards. As a major buyer of Kenyan tea, Unilever’s decision pushed tea producers across Kenya to subscribe to Rainforest Alliance’s sustainable agriculture standard in order to maintain access to the global tea market; according to a 2018 report, over 85% of Kenya’s tea producers were Rainforest Alliance certified. Drawing on ethnographic material among supply chain actors across different sites along the sustainable tea value chain (from those designing and disseminating standards to tea traders to smallholder tea farmers), this article examines how these actors frequently attributed the power to determine the outcomes of certification to a faceless ‘market’. Deferring to ‘the market’, we observe, served primarily to mask the outsized power of lead firms (in particular Unilever) to determine conditions of tea production and trade. At the same time, ‘the market’ was also in some cases qualified by our interlocutors, allowing them implicitly (and at times explicitly) to reveal power and give it a face. Concealing and revealing power in this way, we suggest, can be seen as a mode of engagement among supply chain actors operating in ‘sustainable’ supply chains, like the Rainforest Alliance-certified Kenyan tea supply chain, in which the power of lead firms tends to be consolidated through market-driven sustainability initiatives. Such a mode of engagement mitigates exclusion from sustainable supply chains while maintaining space for critique. </jats:p>",

There are no defined methodologies for the hydraulic characterization of porous pipes; in addition, their performance is questionable because the permeability of the wall in contact with water seems to decrease with time. Thus, this study aimed to perform the hydraulic characterization of porous pipes. Experiments were performed to assess the variation in permeability over time, the head loss, the friction factor, and the roughness. Statistical tests were performed to investigate possible significant differences between treatments. The results showed that the permeability varies over time and tends to decrease with each application of water. After a certain period, the permeability tends to become constant, and a stable flux can be determined, being the lowest average permeability and flux values found 0.591 × 10−15 m² 0.109 m³·m−2·s−1. There is variability in the permeability between pipe samples from the same batch as well as variability within the same sample, as indicated by the fact that some samples are similar to each other while others differ when performing a pairwise multiple comparison.</jats:p>",

In this environment, we incorporate a manufacturer and two rival retailers who compete against one another for selling price and advertisement of a product, where the members offer trade credit facilities to the downstream players. We consider that the manufacturer invests in green technology to curtail the emission during the production and rework process. The retailers provide advertisements to expand their businesses, where market demands are dependent on their selling prices, advertisement frequencies, and the green innovation level. Here, we analyze the model under the cap‐and‐trade policy for various subcases of the centralized and decentralized systems and discuss a solution algorithm for the optimal results. For the practical feasibility test of the model, numerical analysis is examined, and the impact of variations of the critical parameters is studied. The study's primary motive is to figure out the optimal operative strategies and collaborative actions on the decision variables, which leads to the profits of the supply chain to a lofty extent. We observe that the offered credit periods are highly responsive to the profit functions so that the chain members have to be more careful and draw a compact plan for credit policy. Moreover, the manufacturer has to invest in green technology up to a certain level, as, after that level, high investment costs will hamper the optimal profit. Besides, the retailers must have adequate policies for selling prices and advertisement frequencies to acquire a higher yield.</jats:p>",

For each inner reference point, weakly/ɛ-properly Pareto optimal solution was generated using augmented achievement function. All the generated solutions (points) are presented as potential positions for particles in the particle swarm optimization PSO. The proposed algorithm has been reinforced with a novel chaotic contraction operator to retain the feasibility of the particles. To prove the validity of our algorithm, the obtained results are compared with true Pareto optimal front and three of the most salient evolutionary algorithms using inverted generational distance metric IGD. In addition it was implement to detect the most cost and time efficient blood supply chain to provide the required blood types demand on the blood transfusion center in emergence situation, where, it is required to solve this real life application with predefined supply time and predefined supply cost, which is considered as reference point to get the nearby Pareto optimal solution.

This paper reviews how one international supply chain performed and identifies lessons that may be helpful to improve future resilience. Economic and employment data through November 2020 are used to review the effects of COVID-19 on operations of the bioenergy supply chain in the southeastern United States (SE United States) that utilizes wood fiber to fabricate pellets. Conditions associated with the production of pellets in the SE United States changed with the outbreak of COVID-19. Federal and state government programs and classification of workers in this sector as “essential” during the pandemic helped maintain the woody pellet supply chain and other industries during a period of general shut down in 2020. The availability of personal protective equipment, long-term supply contracts, and established safety cultures are among the factors that enhance supply chain resilience while limited availability of skilled workers, inadequate stakeholder engagement, and dependence on external policies are among factors that reduce resilience. The analysis concludes with recommendations for the SE pellet supply chain, and other biomass supply chains, to improve their resilience to future disturbances. When best practices are implemented, SE United States biomass offers opportunities to contribute to post-pandemic economic recovery while incentivizing better forest resource management.</jats:p>"

This contribution seeks to provide a theoretical and empirical framework for operationalizing the CE principles into the olive oil supply chain, that plays a central role in the agroecological systems of the Mediterranean region. A scoping literature review has been conducted in order to identify the available pathways so far explored by scholars for reshaping the olive oil supply chain from a circular perspective. The analyzed literature has been charted on the base of the circular pathway examined, and according to the supply chain subsystem(s) to which it refers. Results are discussed highlighting the main issues, the technology readiness level of the available pathways, the prevailing approaches and knowledge gaps. A synthetic evidence map is provided, framing visually the scrutinized pathways into the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s CE ‘butterfly’ graph. The work is intended to be a valuable baseline for inquiring how circularity can be advanced in the specific supply chain of olive oil, and which are the strategic opportunities, as well as the barriers to overcome, in order to foster the transition.</jats:p>"

A filtration process resulted in 285 samples with the variables free residual chlorine, turbidity, apparent color, pH, fluoride, total coliforms and Escherichia coli. For water consumption purposes, the Water Quality Index developed by the Sanitation Company of Goiás, Brazil, was used. A multivariate calibration of the weights of importance of the parameters included in the original index was performed, resulting in the WQI-VRP. Comparing the medians of the two indexes, it was found that there were significant differences (p&lt;0.05), qualifying the WQI-VRP as more restrictive. The results indicated that 89.8% of the samples were classified as non-compliant samples by WQI-VRP, while 10.2% were classified as compliant samples. Of the 285 samples analyzed, 72 samples of chlorine, 12 of total coliform, 5 of E. coli, 2 of color, 200 of fluoride and 26 of pH, were below or above the minimum or maximum values required by Brazilian legislation. The pH and fluoride correspond to the critical variables of the study region, as they were the parameters that showed the greatest increases in relative weights when comparing the original index with the calibrated one. These results confirm the use of the WQI-VRP as an efficient tool to assess the quality of drinking water in Brazilian subtropical and temperate lotic systems.</jats:p>"

In the existing research, the balance between the construction of the life circle and the needs of the people in the life circle still needs to be further fulfilled. This paper is based on the city’s multi-source large data set including 2018 AutoNavi POI (Point of Interests), OSM (OpenStreetMap) road network data and LandScan population data set, and evaluates the current status of Shanghai’s 15min-CLC through the fusion of kernel density estimation, service area analysis and other statistical models and proposes relevant optimization suggestions. The results show that there are the following shortcomings: (1) From the perspective of different types of infrastructure service facilities, the spatial construction of Shanghai’s overall life service facilities and shopping service facilities needs to be optimized. (2) From the perspective of comprehensive evaluation, the comprehensive service convenience of infrastructure service facilities in the downtown area is relatively high, while the comprehensive service convenience of urban infrastructure service facilities in the suburbs and outer suburbs is relatively low; The diversity of basic service facilities in the 15min-CLC in the downtown area is more consistent with the population distribution; However, in the peripheral areas of the urban area, too many infrastructure service facilities have been constructed. Based on the above shortcomings and the perspective of supply and demand matching, relevant optimization strategies are proposed in different regions and different types of infrastructure service facilities: (1) focus on the construction of basic service facilities in the urban fringe and urban-rural areas, improve the full coverage of the basic service facilities, and appropriately reduce the number of basic service facilities in the downtown area. (2) The development of community business models can be used to promote the development of new life service facilities and shopping service facilities. (3) Improve community medical institutions through facility function conversion, merger and reconstruction, etc. (4) Optimize the hierarchical basic service facility system and improve the population supporting facilities of basic service facilities in the 15min-CLC. This paper incorporates people’s needs and concerns on the living environment into the 15min-CLC evaluation model, and uses Shanghai as an example to conduct research, summarizes the existing shortcomings, and proposes corresponding optimization strategies based on the matching of supply and demand. This article attempts to explore a replicable 15min-CLC planning model, so that it can be extended to the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, to provide reference for further research on the 15min-CLC, and to promote urban construction under the concept of sustainable development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The information asymmetry between the pension service integrator and the pension service providers will affect the efficiency of the whole supply chain, and information sharing can solve this problem to a certain extent. To achieve information sharing, mutual trust is the first condition and mutual trust is also one of the important means of endogenous incentives. In this paper, the trust incentive coefficient is embedded in the principal-agent model. Considering the service capability coefficient, the communication degree coefficient, and the information sharing degree coefficient of the pension service providers, the trust incentive model of the supply chain of the pension service is constructed, the model is solved, and the conclusion is drawn. Finally, the correctness of the conclusion is verified by the numerical simulation using SAS software. The final results show that, under the condition of information asymmetry, the trust incentive coefficient of the pension service integrator to the pension service providers is positively correlated with the effort coefficient, the service capability coefficient, the communication coefficient, and the information sharing degree coefficient of the pension service providers, while it is positively correlated with the effort cost coefficient, the output sharing coefficient, and the risk aversion coefficient of the pension service providers. The variance of number and external environmental variables is negatively correlated. This research has shown that the trust is a means of incentive for pension service providers to share information. This research has a certain practical significance for improving the service efficiency of the pension services supply chain and optimizing the level of pension services.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Managers of urban water systems constantly make decisions to guarantee water services by overcoming problems related to supply-demand imbalances. A preferred strategy has been supply augmentation through hydraulic infrastructure development. However, despite considerable investments, many systems seem to be trapped in lackluster development pathways making some problems seem like an enduring, almost stubborn, characteristic of the systems: over-exploitation and pollution of water sources, distribution networks overwhelmed by leakages and non-revenue water, and unequal water insecurity. Because of these strategies and persistent problems, water conflicts have emerged, whereby social actors oppose these strategies and propose alternative technologies and strategies. This can create development pathways crossroads of the urban water system. To study this development pathway crossroads, we selected the Zapotillo conflict in Mexico where a large supply augmentation project for two cities experiencing water shortages is at stake. The paper concludes that urban water systems that are engaged in a trajectory characterized by supply-side strategies may experience a temporal relief but neglect equally pressing issues that stymie the human right to water in the medium and long run. However, there is not a straightforward, self-evident development pathway to choose from, only a range of multiple alternatives with multiple trade-offs that need to be thoroughly discussed and negotiated between the stakeholders. We argue that this development pathway crossroads can cross-fertilize technical disciplines such as socio-hydrology, and social disciplines based on hydrosocial studies, which both ambition to make their knowledge actionable and relevant.\n                        </jats:p>"

Without this power, modern civilized life cannot think for a moment. Thereby\na huge amount of electrical energy is needed. We have to generate a considerable amount of electricity\nto meet the growing demand maintaining necessary conditions and constraints. A rapid divergent\nstrategy called Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) has been introduced to distribute generated\nenergy economically during times of crisis. The problem of economic load dispatch is solved with\nthe help of Optimal Power Flow (OPF) formation. The OPF is a primary tool related to the optimum\ngeneration schedule available in an interconnected power system to reduce production costs subject\nto the limitations and constraints of the relevant system. The static economic dispatch optimizes\nover single dispatch intervals, which is called “ED static”. Due to high load variability and uncertainty,\nthe ED-static is not working properly. Thereby a deterministic look-ahead dispatch is established,\nwhich takes care of the increasing renewable penetration. To take decisions against uncertainty,\nstochastic load dispatch is required. In this research paper, an economic study of the modified\nIEEE 5 bus power system will be presented. Moreover, some intelligent changes to this system will\ninclude the goal of reducing costs, including maximum power supply.

From a technical perspective, the study of the propagation characteristics of acoustic waves generated by the leakage in the water supply pipeline is necessary for detecting the leak location on the basis of acoustic signals. In this study, a 3D transient leakage acoustic wave propagation equation was derived by combining the principles of fluid dynamics and Lighthill acoustic analogy theory. The propagation of the leakage-induced noise in water supply pipeline was modelled theoretically. We simulated the propagation of a leakage acoustic wave under different conditions for different target scenarios encountered in actual pipeline inspections. Specifically, we analysed the effect of different factors, such as the pipe size and acoustic source characteristics, on acoustic propagation. Finally, the simulated experiments were practically performed using a self-designed simulated water supply pipeline and self-developed spherical water supply pipeline detector to validate the simulation analysis. The results of this study provide a theoretical guidance and basis for the analysis of characteristics of leakage acoustic wave signals and the recognition of leakage conditions in water supply pipelines.</jats:p>"

Using the sequential model, we derive the farmer's optimal farm size, the agrodealer's optimal wholesale price and the insurance company's optimal premium rate. The result shows that under both insurance mechanisms, premium subsidies can promote the farmer to increase the farm size. However, we find that under loan guarantee insurance, when the premium subsidy is relatively high, the farmer's farm size increases with the poor harvest risk. Under yield insurance, the farmer's conditional value‐at‐risk (CVaR) value increases with respect to the premium subsidy rate. Under loan guarantee insurance, the premium rate increases with respect to the premium subsidy. As a result, the farmer's CVaR value decreases with respect to the premium subsidy rate when it is relatively high. Further analysis indicates that with the same government subsidy expenditure, the efficiency of premium subsidies to increase the farmer's production quantity is better under loan guarantee insurance mode, but the efficiency of premium subsidies to increase the farmer's CVaR value is better under yield insurance.</jats:p>",

More effective benzene removal was achieved in an OA-Fe(II)/SPC system with suitable HAH, ASC and SAS addition, compared to the parent system.

Results of scavenger tests showed that HO• is indeed the dominant free radical for benzene removal in every system, but the addition of HAH, ASC and SAS increased the contribution of O2•− to benzene degradation. HAH, ASC and SAS enhanced OA-Fe(II)/SPC systems could be well utilized to acidic and neutral conditions, while HCO3−, high concentration of HA and alkaline conditions were not favorable to benzene removal.

The most significant results were the hydraulic circuit of the heat pump, the aerodynamic circuit of the air supply path to the heat pump evaporator, the balancing heat exchanger control system, taking into account the requirement to ensure the operation of the control valve in a single-phase flow. The significance of the results obtained consisted in obtaining the dependences between the CO temperature graph and the parameters of the thermodynamic cycle of the heat pump, which ensured the operation of the control valve of the heat pump in a single-phase environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The quality of herbs used to make herbal medicinal products largely influences the safety and effectiveness of these herbal treatments. It is therefore important to investigate the extent to which manufacturers are ensuring the quality supply of herbal medicine used in production of herbal medicine. This study examines how small and medium scale manufacturers assure the quality and continual improvement of the raw materials (raw materials) used for production of medicinal products in a developing economy, the state of Ghana, and the methods used by the company. The study adopted exploratory research design. Using interview quide with open ended questions, data was collected from 88 respondents (small and medium scale manufacturers and their representatives). The data was analysed using NVivo 11. Findings of the study indicated that herbs were collected from the wild (forest), physical inspection of the herbs and best manufacturing practices, good relationship management or collaboration were measures used to promote quality of raw material supply. Also, proper documentation or recording of processes and quality measures do not have much attention or acceptance among Traditional Medicine Practitioners (TMPs).</jats:p>"

The personalized needs of customers and private customization have become the hot issues of current research. The service industry is the core enterprise of the service industry. Optimizing the service industry supply network and reasonably allocating the tasks are the focus of the research at home and abroad. Under the background of BD, this paper takes the optimization of service industry supply network as the research object and studies the task allocation optimization of service industry supply network based on the analysis of customers’ personalized demand and user behavior. This paper optimizes the supply chain network of service industry based on genetic algorithm (GA), designs genetic operator, effectively avoids the premature of the algorithm, and improves the operation efficiency of the algorithm. The experimental results show that when m = 8 and n = 40, the average running time of the improved GA is 54.1 s. The network optimization running time of the algorithm used in this paper is very fast, and the stability is also higher.</jats:p>",

However, in practice, ecolabels may not always comply with legal requirements in terms of reliability, accuracy and clarity, and sometimes deliberately mislead the consumer. In Russia and many other developing countries, the problem of inaccurate information on the environmental properties of goods and services is still not recognized. The only regulatory document that currently defines the basic principles for developing and using environmental labels and declarations is the national versions of international standards ISO 14020/14021/14024/14025-Environmental Labels Package. This paper contributes to the literature in two main dimensions. It assesses the degree of prevalence of ecolabeling in the Russian market of everyday goods and the reliability and informational content of frequently used labels (supply-side research). Second, it estimates the consumers’ awareness and reaction to ecolabeled products (demand-side research). The most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that low consumer awareness keeps the level of greenwashing low, but at the same time does not stimulate eco-innovations. We suggest developing smartphone applications that allow buyers to check the compliance of ecolabels on a product with ISO standards directly during the shopping process. We propose to use this approach as a cost-effective and straightforward way to simultaneously raise consumer awareness of ecolabeling and reduce the likelihood of greenwashing.</jats:p>"

PDP Kahyangan Jember implements supply chain management in its business, however there are still some problems in its implementation and management. Some of the issues are the quantity of ground coffee production that does not meet the targeted quantity, decreased coffee beans quality, and reduced coffee yields. These problems can be reduced using a risk management approach. This study aimed to identify the activities of the ground coffee supply chain in PDP Kahyangan Jember and its risks, to determine the level of the risks, and to develop a risk management strategy for PDP Kahyangan Jember ground coffee supply chain. This study used the House of Risk (HOR) method which consists of two phases, i.e. HOR 1 and HOR 2. HOR 1 is used to identify risks in the supply chain. HOR 2 is used to develop a strategy for handling these risks. The HOR 1 analysis results show there are 28 risk events and 33 risk sources, with 15 priority risk sources being considered in the risk management strategies preparation. The results of HOR 2 analysis show eight priority management strategies that can be implemented by PDP Kahyangan Jember.</jats:p>",

However, these techniques can be considered costly and complex, since they use computational equipment and tools that make it difficult to implement into operational practice. In this regard, especially in developing countries, there is a need for progress in energy efficiency measures with low economic dependence on both equipment and tools, guaranteeing necessary environmental and social benefits. This study evaluated energy efficiency measures in a water supply system through the use of (i) a frequency inverter and (ii) replacing the electric motor with a more efficient motor. The first measure did not show economic attractiveness, revealing that frequency inverters do not always have applicability in reducing energy costs. However, the necessity of a soft starter should be noted, as well as suggested studies that have changes in the operating system that can make this measure attractive. The second measure demonstrated economic potential and reinforced the importance of commercial availability and technical regulation of high-efficiency motors, since the payback period was 4 years, with application potential throughout the water supply system.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

In this paper, with the help of Petri nets and the tool “Yasper”, the dynamic process of supply and operation of supply vessels is simulated. Simulation is depending on the wind and wave conditions and the type of work that the supply vessel performs in cooperation with the platform. Input data are: Sea state, wind state, fuel consumption, type of vessel operation, distance from the mainland and the number of daily departures of the vessels from the port. The paper presents a model with discrete events in the process of supplying the platform, starting from the port and going out to sea until the work around the platform is completed and returning to the port. The report can provide information on the usability of the vessels and the approximate cost of the supply vessels on a voyage from port to the platform and back.</jats:p>",

Carbon emissions and total costs were calculated at the build, acquire, and fulfill stages from suppliers and enterprises. The analysis results showed that the highest environmental impact was at the build stage which produces carbon emissions of 133,314.8 kg CO2. The frying process contributed the highest carbon emission, which was 117,600 kg CO2. CV XYZ was in the intolerable region condition in the Global Impact matrix. The resulting carbon footprint is 16.84 kg CO2/kg with a unit cost of 0.32 €/kg. The recommendation strategy was substituting firewood with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to lower carbon emissions by up to 40%.</jats:p>",

When such mid-scale supply chains are formed among multiple business partners with shared ethics or values related to the qualities of the food and the business relationships along the supply chain, they may be termed “values-based supply chains (VBSCs).” Most of the research on VBSCs to date has relied primarily on a case study approach that investigates the performance of VBSCs from the perspective of VBSC founders or leaders. In contrast, this research seeks out the perspectives of farmers who participate in VBSCs. A nationwide farmer survey conducted in 2017 offers original insights on farmer motivations for participating in VBSCs and how they are being used by farmers relative to other marketing channels. We find that VBSCs serve farms of all sizes. Overall, smaller farms were more likely to market a higher percentage of overall sales through their VBSC and more likely to rank their VBSC as one of the top three marketing channels in their portfolio. But it was the larger farms that were more likely to perceive VBSC-specific benefits. Our findings confirm that while there is a limited volume of product that such regional supply chains can currently handle, farmers view VBSCs as a valuable marketing option that aligns with their own values and preserves their product’s identity.</jats:p>",

The silver-based pinhole-free SPR biosensor produced with non-perpendicular CAP treatment of both glass substrate and silver film shows E. coli detection in the distilled water in the range of 104 colony forming unit (CFU/ml) to 108 CFU/ml with better sensitivity compared to the untreated silver-based SPR biosensor.</jats:p>",

However, the ambiguity of information and the different goals of stakeholders demand that the humanitarian supply chain must be resilient. This research adopts the use of literature review and expert opinions to identify the indicators that affect the resilience of the humanitarian supply chain using the flood event in Hechuan District, China in 2020 as an example. Based on the combination of fuzzy Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and Analytic Network Process (fuzzy-DEMATEL-ANP), the interrelationships between the indicators and the weights of each indicator are calculated. The research results indicate that decision-makers in the humanitarian supply chain should vigorously coordinate the cooperation among stakeholders, ensure the effective transmission of information, and formulate forward-looking strategic plans. At the same time, these key decision makers should also be aware of the need to adjust their strategies at different stages of the flooding event in order to achieve a flexible humanitarian supply chain that responds to the varying demands over the course of a flooding event. The results of this study will help professionals involved in humanitarian supply chains to develop strategies and plans to become more resilient thus helping to reduce losses from natural hazards such as floods.</jats:p>"

This limits our capability of modeling CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions from inland waters to the atmosphere. To generate such a model, we quantified how the POM supply rate and POM reactivity control CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> production in anoxic surface sediment, by amending sediment at different frequencies with different quantities of aquatic and terrestrial POM. From the modeled CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> production, we derived parameters related to the kinetics and the extent of CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> production. We show that the extent of CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> production can be well predicted by the quality (i.e., C/N ratio) and the quantity of POM supplied to an anoxic sediment. In particular, within the range of sedimentation rates that can be found in aquatic systems, we show that CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> production increases linearly with the quantity of phytoplankton‐derived and terrestrially derived POM. A high frequency of POM addition, which is a common situation in natural systems, resulted in higher peaks in CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> production rates. This suggests that relationships derived from earlier incubation experiments that added POM only once, may result in underestimation of sediment CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> production. Our results quantitatively couple CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> production in anoxic surface sediment to POM sedimentation flux, and are therefore useful for the further development of mechanistic models of inland water CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emission.</jats:p>",

A theoretical model to stochastically describe 21 personal water-use activities was developed, corresponding to lifestyle levels based upon Maslow's hierarchy of physiological needs. From this model, the expected value of ABC was 92 L/capita/day (LPCD) and includes restrictions on several everyday activities and thus would be better as a minimum target during stringent water restrictions. A more realistic expected value for non-wasteful, indoor-only water use was determined to be 175 LPCD.

The temperature of the 0–40 cm soil layer varied with air temperature, but the range of fluctuation decreased with depth. Irrigation affected the distribution of soil water, increased soil heat capacity, and reduced the impact of air temperature on soil temperature, thus delaying the impact of air temperature on soil temperature. High-frequency drip irrigation could therefore effectively improve SWC, reduce water stress during the period of watermelon growth, and effectively delay the effect of air temperature on soil temperature, providing a theoretical basis for developing reasonable irrigation strategies and regulating soil water and heat in gravel-mulched fields.</jats:p>",

This paper examined the factors impeding distribution channels in Supply Chain of beverage products and recommended strategies for improving the same. Qualitative approach was adopted and data were drawn from a purposive sample of 50 respondents through interviews and focus group discussions. Accordingly, distribution channels in Supply Chain was impeded by poor transportation, inadequate storage facilities, inability to improve quality and poor marketing services. The study recommends some ways to minimise the impediments. These include ensuring suitable road infrastructures; providing soft loans and grants to the distribution channels in order to buy modern storage facilities; adequate and reliable storage facilities and ensuring adequate electric power supply. The inability to value addition should be alleviated through empowering financially to obtain enough capital of buying effective handling and storage facilities. Authorities responsible for quality assurance should play their active role in ensuring quality assurance and standards of beverage products; to improve marketing services, devising the innovative ways of reaching the customers by adopting adequate promotion techniques. Therefore, factors impeding the role of distribution channels in Supply Chain of beverages can be alleviated through improvement of storage, distribution and transportation, value addition and quality as well as improving marketing services.</jats:p>",

Conventional price-transmission econometrics test for a theory-based spatial-arbitrage restriction that long-run equilibrium prices in spatially distinct markets differ by no more than transaction costs. The conventional approach is ill-equipped to test for price transmission when endogenously unstable markets do not equilibrate due to systematic arbitrage-frustrating frictions including financial and institutional transaction costs and biophysical constraints. We propose a novel empirical framework using price data to test for market stability and price transmission along international-domestic supply chains incorporating nonlinear time series analysis and recently emerging causal-detection methods from empirical nonlinear dynamics. We apply the framework to map-out and quantify price transmission through the global-exporter–processor–producer coffee supply chain in Papua, New Guinea. We find empirical evidence of upstream price transmission from the global market to domestic exporters and processors, but not through to producers.</jats:p>"

In the first circuit, pure helium is used as coolant and the main helium fan is used to promote the coolant circulation. In order to meet the requirements of service environment and performance, the main helium fan adopts the non-lubricant active magnetic bearing (AMB) system as its support system. For the high-speed rotating equipment supported by AMBs, losing power would lead to bearing failure and cause serious damage to the equipment. In this paper, the power supply system of AMBs is optimized. The power supply of AMB system is connected with the DC-link of the motor converter through DC/DC converter. During normal operation, the AMB system is supplied by external power supply, and the DC/DC converter is used as the backup redundant power supply. In the event of a power failure accident, the DC/DC converter is put into operation, converting the remanet kinetic energy of the motor into stable power to maintain the normal operation of the AMB system. The DC/DC converter adopts two-stage topology structure of the former BUCK converter and the later LLC converter, and completes the voltage stabilization control of the latter LLC converter through the digital signal processor (DSP). Experimental results show that this scheme can realize the power loss protection function of the rotating equipment supported by AMBs.</jats:p>",

While FMD poses a serious threat to livestock production in the United States, little is known about producers' uptake of the enhanced biosecurity practices included in the SBS Plan. In this study, we benchmark adoption and feasibility-of-adoption perceptions for U.S. cattle producers. Our results show adoption of the 13 enhanced biosecurity practices is generally low. Especially concerning is the low adoption of the three strongly-recommended pre-outbreak practices—having a biosecurity manager, having a written operation-specific enhanced biosecurity plan, and having a line of separation. Adoption of the pre-outbreak practices is likely low because the benefits of adopting the practices depend on a low probability, uncertain event. That said, producers who have adopted the pre-outbreak practices are more likely to have higher feasibility ratings for the remaining enhanced biosecurity practices, suggesting that adoption of the strongly recommended practices is associated with adoption of all enhanced biosecurity during an FMD outbreak. Complementarity is examined and shows that adoption of the pre-outbreak practices coincides with adoption of the outbreak-specific practices. Taken together, our results suggest that adoption of the strongly recommended pre-outbreak practices could help facilitate a quicker and more effective U.S. cattle industry response to an FMD outbreak in the United States.</jats:p>"

Econometric results suggest that female and joint decision-makers are more likely to sell maize to consumers or retailers in the main local market where the maize price is higher than to wholesale merchants directly from the farm. Individual decision-makers (male or female) who grow improved maize varieties are more likely to sell to wholesalers directly from the farm. This may be an indication of the effectiveness of joint decisions over individual decisions related to the market price. We also found that improved maize varieties distributed to farmers in the study area are of poor quality and that there is a lack of modern storage facilities so that farmers have to sell immediately after harvest during the lower price season. Thus, there is a need for policies promoting the distribution of high-quality maize seeds and encouraging investments in the establishment of modern maize storage facilities in the study area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Microbiological safety of water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is one of the priority tasks in maintaining and strengthening the public health. The purpose of this work was to review the results of foreign and domestic sanitary and microbiological studies on the microbiological safety of water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Search Strategies. The authors of this article codeveloped a search strategy that was the same for each database. Traditional search of sources by keywords was carried out in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases in English, Russian and Kazakh languages with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fifty-three sources out of 116 were selected as analytical materials. The depth of the search was from 1977 to 2020. The criteria for includingpublications in the review were as follows: publications in Russian and English that are in open full-text access and contain statistically confirmed conclusions. Summary reports, newspaper articles and personal messages were excluded from the review. Results. Ensuring the microbial safety of the drinking-water supply relies on the use of many barriers from the water collection to the consumer in order to prevent contamination from drinking water or reduce it to acceptable levels, not harmful to health. Safety is enhanced when multiple barriers against contamination are established, including protecting water resources, selecting and implementing a range of appropriate treatment measures, and regulating distribution systems (piped or non-piped) to maintain and protect the quality of treated water. The preferred strategy is a regulatory approach that focuses on preventing or reducing the entry of pathogens into water sources, and on reducing reliance on water treatment to remove pathogens. Conclusion. Thus, ensuring the microbial safety of WASH requires the following: an assessment of the entire system to determine the potential harmful factors that may affect it; determination of control measures to reduce or eliminate these harmful factors as well as operational monitoring to ensure the effective functioning of barriers from infection within the system; and developing regulatory plans to describe actions to be taken both under normal conditions and in unforeseen circumstances.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>Введение. Обеспечение микробиологической безопасности водоснабжения, санитарии и гигиены (ВСГ) является одной из приоритетных задач в сохранении и укреплении здоровья населения. Целью настоящей работы явился обзор результатов зарубежных и отечественных санитарно-микробиологических исследований по проблеме обеспечения микробиологической безопасности водоснабжения, санитарии и гигиены (ВСГ). Стратегия поиска. Авторы этой статьи совместно разработали стратегию поиска, которая была одинаковой для каждой базы данных. Традиционный поиск источников по ключевым словам проводился в базах данных PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science и Google Scholar на английском, русском и казахском языках по критериям включения и исключения. В качестве аналитического материала были выбраны пятьдесят три источника из 116. Глубина поиска составляла с 1977 по 2020 год. Критерии включения публикаций в обзор были следующими: полнотекстовые публикации на русском и английском языках, находящиеся в открытом доступе и содержащие статистически подтвержденные выводы. Краткие отчеты, газетные статьи и личные сообщения были исключены из обзора. Результаты. Обеспечение микробной безопасности питьевого водоснабжения основано на использовании множества преград на пути от водосбора до потребителя в целях предупреждения заражения питьевой воды или сокращения заражения до уровней, которые не вредны для здоровья. Безопасность возрастает, если установлено множество преград по предупреждению заражения, включая защиту водных ресурсов, надлежащий выбор и осуществление ряда мер по очистке, а также регулирование систем распределения (водопроводных или не водопроводных) для поддержания и защиты качества обработанной воды. Предпочтительной стратегией является подход регулирования, при котором основной акцент ставится на предупреждении или сокращении проникновения патогенных микроорганизмов в источники воды, а также на уменьшении зависимости от процессов очистки для удаления патогенов. Заключение. Таким образом, обеспечение микробной безопасности ВСГ требует проведения оценки всей системы для определения потенциальных вредных факторов, которые могут воздействовать на эту систему; определения мер контроля, необходимых для сокращения или устранения вредных факторов, а также оперативного мониторинга для обеспечения эффективного функционирования преград от заражения в рамках системы; и разработки планов регулирования для описания действий, предпринимаемых как в нормальных условиях, так и в непредвиденных обстоятельствах.</jats:p>\n                                                    <jats:p>Кіріспе.

Moreover, an engineering experiment was carried out to confirm the comprehensive degradation coefficients of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), nitrogen ammonia (NH4+-N), and total nitrogen (TN) (0.014 d−1, 0.024 d−1, 0.019 d−1, and 0.005 d−1, respective). Circulation system was the main force that expedited water changes and pollutant movement, increased the lake average water speed from 0.003 m/s to 0.008 m/s, and could effectively reduce the COD, NH4+-N and TN concentration nearly by 35, 32, and 5%. The high concentrations nitrogen and phosphorus in the reclaimed water would accelerate the deterioration of water quality, and the concentrations of TP, NH4+-N, and TN in the lake increased from 0.080 mg/L, 0.53 mg/L, and 1.53 mg/L to 0.090–0.096 mg/L, 0.71–0.81 mg/L, and 1.89–2.08 mg/L, respectively. The circulation system could slow the water quality deterioration but cannot eliminate the eutrophication risk. Improving the hydrodynamic conditions was proposed for enhancing water quality in urban landscape lakes.</jats:p>",

The objectives of this study to analyze the comparative study of the effect of electricity supply on the performance of small and medium-scale enterprises in Calabar South and Calabar Municipality.The survey research design was adopted and a twelve (12) item structured questionnaire was used to obtain a sample size of 248 small and medium scale business owners and power holding staff randomly selected from the population. The results of the study revealed that there is a significant effect of electricity supply on the performance of small and medium-scale enterprises in Calabar South and Calabar Municipality. The results further revealed that insufficient electricity supply significantly affect the performance of small and medium-scale enterprises in Calabar South and Calabar Municipality.The study concludes that there are enormous difficulties being experienced by businesses in Cross River State and other parts of Nigeria due to inadequate and unreliable electric power supply. Thus an inadequate and unreliable supply of electricity imposes costs and therefore constrained firms’ operational performance as firms suffer high overhead cost due to the deficient electricity supply from the national grid. The study recommends that the Nigerian government needs to consider the issue of power supply reliability very seriously by facilitating both private and public investment in electricity infrastructure.</jats:p>",

This study aims to develop a moisture migration model that improves the quantification of moisture content at an arbitrary point of the soil at any time for the whole process of infiltration under steady rainfall. The model was derived from the Richards equation using the flux-concentration relation, which was validated by numerical solutions calculated by Hydrus-1D software to evaluate the performance of the model. Results showed good accuracy and high adaptability for the moisture migration simulation of a wide range of soil types, and is applicable for short-duration and long-duration steady rainfall. Moreover, it can also reflect the stratification phenomenon for soil profile wetting by infiltration. Our analysis indicates that the flux and surface volumetric moisture content together can bound the boundary conditions of rainfall infiltration, which presents a shift from constant-flux to constant-concentration during long-duration steady rainfall. The migration rate of the wetting front in the later stage of infiltration positively correlates with rainfall intensity under the constant-flux condition, while it finally stabilizes at Ks/(θs − θi) under the constant-concentration condition (i.e., Ks – saturated hydraulic conductivity, θs – saturated volumetric moisture content, θi – initial volumetric moisture content).</jats:p>",

With the intensification of the contradiction between fiscal revenue and expenditure, adopting the goal of adjusting the fiscal expenditure structure is conducive to improving the efficiency of fiscal funds. This paper establishes a theoretical model of the efficiency of the fiscal expenditure structure under the goal of Inclusive Green Growth, and on this basis, it constructs an index system of Inclusive Green Growth. Then, it applies a DEA-Malmquist model to analyze the efficiency of the fiscal expenditure structure. The results show that from 2007 to 2018, the growth rate of Inclusive Green Growth index showed a downward trend, which was mainly due to the decline in the growth rate of economic development. It rebounded after 2016, and the growth of the inclusiveness level played a major role. In time and space, the development resources tend to the unbalanced development trend of the eastern region; the average total factor productivity of the fiscal expenditure structure in space is the lowest in the east. The fiscal expenditure should be inclined to social expenditure and green expenditure, the western region should be inclined to economic expenditure, and the allocation of the expenditure structure in the central region should imitate the high-efficiency areas. In order to achieve the comprehensive development goal, this paper provides an analytical idea for the adjustment of the fiscal expenditure structure.</jats:p>"

An integrated approach including Fuzzy Interpretation Structure Model (FISM), Fuzzy Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (FMICMAC) analysis, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is structured in reaching this purpose. Specifically, the impact of factors on the LO relationship will be determined through the FISM-FMICMAC method, then FAHP will use the results from this FISM-FMICMAC analysis step to perform the determination of the level of importance of contributing factors to the LO relationship. The fuzzy number formats of this paper are all in trapezoidal format. To evaluate the proposed framework, a typical example of logistics activity in the Mekong Delta Rice Supply Chain (SuC) was selected. The results have shown the impact level of 14 factors on the LO relationship under 4 clusters (Dependent, Linkage, Independent Autonomous). Finally, only the 10 most outstanding of the 14 factors were used to conduct FAHP analysis to find the global weightages which contribute to the LO relationship by each factor.</jats:p>",

The present research was conducted at the Chaj Doab, Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) of Pakistan, using the WEAP (Water Evaluation and Planning) model. Six different scenarios were developed, and the results showed that the current available surface water is not sufficient to meet crop water demands. The Lower Jhelum Canal (LJC) command area is more sensitive to water scarcity than the Upper Jhelum Canal (UJC). The future (up to 2070) climate change scenarios for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 showed a decrease in catchment reliability up to 26.80 and 26.28% for UJC as well as 27.56 and 27.31% for LJC catchment, respectively. We concluded that scenario 3 (irrigation efficiency improvement through implementation of a high efficiency irrigation system, canal lining, reduction and replacement of high delta crops with low delta crops) was sufficient to reduce the canal water deficit in order to optimize canal water allocation. Improvement in the irrigation system and cropping area should be optimized for efficient canal water management.</jats:p>"

Next, we investigated using the combined UV/H2O2/O3 advanced oxidation process to treat water containing DCBQ. A Box–Behnken design was used to optimize the parameters of the UV/H2O2/O3 process, which gave the following optimum DCBQ removal conditions: UV dose of 180 mJ/cm2, O3 concentration of 0.51 mg/L, and H2O2 concentration of 1.76 mg/L.

This paper presents an extension of ergonomic inventory modeling with a new mathematical model which integrates relaxation allowance and endurance time to the ergonomic inventory model. The rest allowance is determined by endurance time, contraction time, and relative force based on several items such as weight, and it helps to prevent ergonomic risks and fatigue of the back muscles. The model has been analyzed in a numerical work based on our specific simulator and parameteric analysis to present validness in different scenarios.

Seasonal effects and pH have captured interest as potential factors affecting THM formation in the water supply and distribution systems. We investigated THM occurrence in the water supply chain, including raw and treated water from water treatment plants (coagulation, sedimentation, sand filtration, ClO2-disinfection processes, and distribution pipelines) in the Chiang Mai municipality, particularly the educational institute area. The effects of two seasons, rainy (September–November 2019) and dry (December 2019–February 2020), acted as surrogates for the water quality profile and THM occurrence. The results showed that humic acid was the main aromatic and organic compound in all the water samples. In the raw water sample, we found a correlation between surrogate organic compounds, including SUVA and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (R2 = 0.9878). Four species of THMs were detected, including chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform. Chloroform was the dominant species among the THMs. The highest concentration of total THMs was 189.52 μg/L. The concentration of THMs tended to increase after chlorination when chlorine dioxide and organic compounds reacted in water. The effect of pH on the formation of TTHMs was also indicated during the study. TTHM concentrations trended lower with a pH ≤ 7 than with a pH ≥ 8 during the sampling periods. Finally, in terms of health concerns, the concentration of TTHMs was considered safe for consumption because it was below the standard (&lt;1.0) of WHO’s Guideline Values (GVs).</jats:p>"

A modified method for determining the critical threshold residual (CTR), the intersection point on a semi-log plot between first-order total chlorine fitted decay curves before and after the breakpoint, was developed. Unlike the CTR as originally defined, initial sample conditions were retained rather than artificially raising the monochloramine concentrations. The CTR calculated with this modified method can more easily be applied to distribution system scenarios. In addition, four types of decay curves were identified and could distinguish differences in the microbial contribution to disinfectant residual decay. This study revealed that chloramine decay batch tests should be evaluated based on decay curve type, decay rates, and the CTR value, in addition to the microbial decay factor, which has been used alone in previous studies. The batch test approach and evaluation criteria established here can be used to predict conditions favorable for rapid chloramine decay and nitrification, and that monitoring and control strategies should be implemented.</jats:p>",

Sites from one area experience advective input of thermogenically produced electron donors by seepage from deeper layers, whereas sites from the other area are diffusion-dominated and electron donor-depleted. In both locations, Archaea dominate at temperatures &gt;45 °C and Bacteria at temperatures &lt;10 °C. Yet, at the phylum level and below, there are clear differences. Hot seep sites have high proportions of typical hydrothermal vent and hot spring taxa. By contrast, high-temperature sites without seepage harbor mainly novel taxa belonging to phyla that are widespread in cold subseafloor sediment. Our results suggest that in hydrothermal sediments temperature determines domain-level dominance, whereas temperature-energy interactions structure microbial communities at the phylum-level and below.</jats:p>"

In this study, persulfate (PS) activated by nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) coupled with chelated L-cysteine (L-cys) process was investigated for BTEX degradation in contaminated groundwater. BTEX degradation had a significant acceleration and improvement with the removal from 62.7 to 100% along with the increasing dosage of L-cys from 0.12 to 0.27 M in 24 h. Further, the compact nZVI catalytic cylinder and nZVI encapsulated L-cys catalytic cylinder were successfully manufactured by encapsulating nZVI, and nZVI and L-cys together with additives of cement, river sand, stearic acid (SA) and zeolite. The SEM image, XRD patterns and FTIR spectra showed that the manufactured catalytic cylinder had a porous structure and encapsulated nZVI and L-cys successfully. Six successive cycles of BTEX degradation were completed and the degradation rate decreased gradually in each cycle. The catalytic activity of nZVI encapsulated L-cys catalytic cylinder was superior to nZVI catalytic cylinder in each cycle. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results indicated that HO• was the dominant active species in the BTEX degradation process. Benzoic acid (BA) scavenge experiments showed that L-cys could increase the yield of HO• in the PS/nZVI system. The HO• yields of PS/nZVI encapsulated L-cys catalytic cylinder system were 3.2 to 4.8 fold higher than those of the PS/nZVI catalytic cylinder system. The possible mechanisms of PS activation by nZVI encapsulated L-cys catalytic cylinder were supposed. Homogeneous Fenton reaction and heterogeneous catalysis on the nZVI surface are two co-existence mechanisms in the PS/nZVI encapsulated L-cys catalytic cylinder system. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanism of nZVI encapsulated L-cys catalytic cylinder activating PS, showing its potential applications for the remediation of groundwater.</jats:p>",

This paper explores the intermediariesâ€™ role on value addition and quality improvement in the context of urban fresh fruits and vegetable (FFVs) supply chain in Dar es Salaam city to understand impediments to value addition and quality improvement. Qualitative approach was adopted and data were collected using documentary review, in-depth interviews, and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and non-participant observations based on the purposive sample size of 60 respondents. Thematic data analysis strategy was adopted and data were analysed using MAXQDA software. Findings showed that the intermediariesâ€™ inability to value addition and quality improvement for urban fresh fruits and vegetables were determined by a number of factors. The inability to facilitate packaging and packing was related to inadequate knowledge and awareness of packaging facilities, limited financial capital to buy modern packaging facilities and lack of quality and value assurance regulatory authorities. Impediments to branding and labelling rotated around inadequate branding and labelling technology and tools, inadequate knowledge and skills, financial difficulties by the intermediaries. Impediments to grading and sorting emanated from lack of proper grading and sorting tools and lack of knowledge and awareness on value addition and quality improvement. Impediments to collection were caused by lack of modern harvesting and collection tools, lack of modern storage facilities as well as climate changes and variation. Lastly, impediments to inspection and arrangement revolved around poor timing for conducting inspection, lack of enough fund to buy inspection tools and poor coordination of inspection. Strategies for overcoming the impediments include introduction and enforcement of relevant laws, regulatory mechanisms, appropriate policies and regulations that would effectively govern issues of fruits and vegetable value addition and quality improvement, sensitizing intermediaries on proper knowledge and skills, provision of financial assistance to intermediaries to facilitate packing and packaging of the FFV as well as improvement of marketing and selling strategies.</jats:p>",

We analyze the buyer's cost reduction effort and its impact on farmer participation to characterize the effect of contract farming on the agricultural product supply and all stakeholders. Additionally, we explore the impact of the HVA's production cost. We analytically show that all contract and non‐contract farmers are better off after an introduction of contract farming for HVA. Hence, contract farming can improve the farmers’ income and alleviate poverty. However, if HVA is costly to produce, there will be an inequality‐widening type of contract farming in which contract farmers are more efficient than non‐contract farmers, and the income disparity among farmers will widen. Otherwise, there will be an inequality‐reducing type in which contract farmers are less efficient than non‐contract farmers such that the income disparity among farmers will decrease. More importantly, the buyer benefits from a lower HVA's production cost, but this can hurt all contract and non‐contract farmers for a given equilibrium type. Moreover, reducing the HVA's production cost can increase the supply of a substitutable traditional product along with the switch of equilibrium from the inequality‐widening type to the inequality‐reducing one. </jats:p>",

Simultaneously, it is evident that every node of the bioenergy supply chain, from cultivation of energy crops to production of electricity and heat, is vulnerable to climate change impacts. However, climate change assessments of bioenergy supply chains neither account for the global nature of the bioenergy market, nor the complexity and dynamic interconnectivity between and within different sub-systems in which the bioenergy supply chain is embedded, thereby neglecting potential compounding and cascading impacts of climate change. In this paper, systems thinking is utilised to develop an analytical framework to address this gap, and aided by causal loop diagrams, cascading impacts of climate change are identified for a case study concerning imports of wood pellets from the United States to the European Union. The findings illustrate how the complexity and interconnectivity of the wood pellet supply system predispose the supply chain to various cascading climate change impacts stemming from environmental, social, political and economic domains, and highlight the value of using system-based analysis tools for studying such complex and dynamic systems.</jats:p>",

Although mevalonate is a native metabolite in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, its production is challenged by the relatively low flux toward acetyl-CoA in this yeast. In this study we explore different approaches to increase acetyl-CoA supply in S. cerevisiae to boost mevalonate production. Stable integration of a feedback-insensitive acetyl-CoA synthetase (Se-acsL641P) from Salmonella enterica and the mevalonate pathway from Enterococcus faecalis results in the production of 1,390 ± 10 mg/l of mevalonate from glucose. While bifid shunt enzymes failed to improve titers in high-producing strains, inhibition of squalene synthase (ERG9) results in a significant enhancement. Finally, increasing coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis by overexpression of pantothenate kinase (CAB1) and pantothenate supplementation further increased production to 3,830 ± 120 mg/l. Using strains that combine these strategies in lab-scale bioreactors results in the production of 13.3 ± 0.5 g/l, which is ∼360-fold higher than previously reported mevalonate titers in yeast. This study demonstrates the feasibility of engineering S. cerevisiae for high-level mevalonate production.</jats:p>",

We present estimates of a structural discrete choice model that incorporates service intensity (services provided per hour) and contract choice into a labour supply framework. We use our estimates to predict (ex ante) the effects of contracts on physician behaviour and welfare, as measured by average equivalent variations. The supply of services is reduced under an MR contract, suggesting incentives matter. Hours spent seeing patients is less sensitive to incentives than the supply of services. Our results suggest that a reform forcing all physicians to adopt the MR system would have substantially larger effects on physician behaviour than were measured under the observed reform. A pure salary (per diem) reform would sharply reduce services but would increase time spent seeing patients.</jats:p>",

The manufacturer’s CSR and the recycler’s fairness concerns are introduced to the benchmark model in turn, and the optimal decision-making problems under different models are studied and compared. The findings show that the manufacturer’s utility will increase and the recycler’s utility will decrease when the manufacturer undertakes CSR within a reasonable range. The optimal utility of manufacturers does not change, and the utility of the recycler is affected by the proportion of CSR undertaken by the manufacturer when the recycler considers fairness concerns. Based on the CSR and fairness model, this paper constructs a dynamic decision system of production quantity and eco-innovation effort. We analyze the influence of adjustment speed on the dynamic decision system and obtain the conditions required to maintain system stability. The research conclusion indicates that with the increase of adjusting parameters, the system gradually appears chaotic state from a stable state and the chaotic state of the system has a negative impact on the utility of manufacturer and recycler. In order to avoid chaos in the system, this paper uses the delayed feedback method to control the system.</jats:p>",

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) commit states, Uganda inclusive, to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. According to the SDG 6 resolutions, the rights to water and sanitation are legally binding upon states, which have the primary responsibility to ensure their full realization, including unserved and under-served areas. While the SDGs came into force after 2015, it is not clear the extent to which Uganda's policies, legal instruments and practice are aligned to the SDGs. A combined methodology was adopted to undertake the study under a cross-sectional design. The study reviewed relevant literature such as sector performance reports on water and sanitation. Purposive sampling was used to select relevant informants for primary data. Key informant interviews were held with representatives of relevant government agencies, United Nations agencies, civil society organisations, indigenous communities and the private sector. Findings indicate that while the Government of Uganda has made tremendous efforts regarding the right to water and sanitation, enormous challenges and gaps remain. For instance, the pro-poor strategies to access safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities are largely insignificant.</jats:p>",

The system generalized method of moment (system GMM) is used to study the data of Asian countries and four subregions in Asia. The estimation results show that logistics operation consumes nonrenewable energy such as fossil fuels, which has a negative impact on environmental sustainability and energy demand. The service quality and capability (LPITC) in the logistics performance index has a significant contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The logistics infrastructure (LPIIN) has significantly reduced the energy consumption in Asia, while the customs (LPIC) has significantly increased the energy demand. Other indicators of LPI also have a significant impact on the environment and energy in different subregions of Asia. Industrialization and urbanization both increase carbon emissions in Asia, while trade opening reduces carbon emissions. At the same time, these three variables have a positive impact on reducing energy consumption. The results show that logistics performance is significantly related to environmental degradation and energy, and renewable energy and green supply chain management can reduce the harmful effects of logistics activities on environment and energy. Therefore, Asian countries should give priority to environmental sustainability in supply chain management and encourage the application of green practices in logistics.</jats:p>",

Considering four scenarios (the energy conversion, energy capital savings and loans, energy exports and cement production carbon emissions), this paper adopts the energy consumption method and input-output method to analyze China’s carbon emissions structure on the supply-side and demand-side of energy, and finally provides policy recommendations for China’s structural emission reduction. The results show that, if the four influencing factors were not considered, the measurement of carbon emissions from the final demand was 44.91% higher than the baseline scenario, 12.36% lower than the baseline scenario from intermediate demand, and 10.23% lower than the baseline scenario from the total. For China’s carbon emissions structure on the supply-side of energy, the carbon emissions from high-carbon energy, represented by raw coal, accounted for 66.805% of the total energy-related carbon emissions, while the carbon emissions from low-carbon energy, represented by natural gas, only accounted for 2.485%. For China’s carbon emissions structure on the demand-side of energy, the carbon emissions from intermediate demand (enterprise production) accounted for more than 95% of total energy-related carbon emissions, while the carbon emissions from final demand (residents and government use) accounted for less than 5%. For each specific industry in intermediate demand for energy, the heavy industry, electric power, fossil energy, and chemical industry have high carbon emissions and low carbon emissions efficiency. However, the agriculture, construction, light industry, and service are the opposite. Finally, we provide policy recommendations for improving the accuracy of carbon emissions measurement and carbon emissions efficiency.</jats:p>"

Here, we show that the surface ocean state regulates INP concentration and ice cloud presence in the boundary layer. Arctic research cruise data from the marginal ice zone in the Chukchi Sea in November 2018 revealed high number concentrations of INPs active greater than °C and ice‐containing clouds under high wave conditions. Chemical analysis revealed high contents of organic carbon and sea salt that coincided with the increased oceanic turbidity.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mitochondrial movement and distribution are fundamental to their function. Here we report a mechanism that regulates mitochondrial movement by anchoring mitochondria to the F-actin cytoskeleton. This mechanism is activated by an increase in glucose influx and the consequent O-GlcNAcylation of TRAK (Milton), a component of the mitochondrial motor-adaptor complex. The protein four and a half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2) serves as the anchor. FHL2 associates with O-GlcNAcylated TRAK and is both necessary and sufficient to drive the accumulation of F-actin around mitochondria and to arrest mitochondrial movement by anchoring to F-actin. Disruption of F-actin restores mitochondrial movement that had been arrested by either TRAK O-GlcNAcylation or forced direction of FHL2 to mitochondria. This pathway for mitochondrial immobilization is present in both neurons and non-neuronal cells and can thereby adapt mitochondrial dynamics to changes in glucose availability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In modern electrical power distribution systems, the effective operation of inverter-based arc suppression devices relies on the accuracy of faulty phase selection. In the traditional methods of faulty phase selection for single-phase-to-ground faults (SPGs), power frequency-based amplitude and phase characteristics are used to identify the faulty phase. In the field, when a high-resistance SPG occurs in the system, traditional methods are difficult for accurately identifying the faulty phase because of the weak fault components and complicated process. A novel realizable and effective method of faulty phase selection based on transient current similarity measurements is presented when SPGs occur in resonantly grounded distribution systems in this paper. An optimized Hausdorff distance matrix (MOHD) is proposed and constructed by the transient currents of three phases’ similarity measurements within a certain time window of our method. This MOHD is used to select the sampling time window adaptively, which allows the proposed method to be applied to any scale of distribution systems. Firstly, when a SPG occurs, the expressions for the transient phase current mutation in the faulty and sound phases are analyzed. Then, the sampling process is segmented into several selection units (SUs) to form the MOHD-based faulty phase selection method. Additionally, the Hausdorff distance algorithm (HD) is used to calculate the waveform similarities of the transient phase current mutation among the three phases to form the HD-based faulty phase selection method. Finally, a practical resonant grounded distribution system is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC, and the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method is compared and verified under different fault resistances, fault inception angles, system topologies, sampling time windows and rates of data missing.</jats:p>"

Dew water harvesting by passive radiative cooling is an unconventional water source that is easy to use, install, and shows great potential in several places in the world. This paper aims to experimentally evaluate the dew yield through passive radiative cooling in Vicosa city, Minas Gerais, Brazil by using standard white plastic for dew harvesting, developed by the International Organization for Dew Utilization (OPUR), polypropylene plastic, black plastic, packaging tape, and anodized aluminum as condensing surfaces during two different periods. The polypropylene plastic and packing tape materials used in this present research have not been researched before in the literature. However, they have demonstrated potential for harvesting dew. As a result, the average water collected was, respectively, 0.151, 0.135, 0.140, 0.127, and 0.046 mm/night using the OPUR standard plastic, polypropylene plastic, black plastic, and packaging tape, and anodized aluminum as condensing surfaces. Although relatively small water volumes were harvested, this water should not be neglected since it can supplement the water demand for irrigation, human and animal consumption, among other uses in drought periods.</jats:p>",

Poor water quality may be related to several contamination sources and can pose a health risk for the ecosystem and for people. The calcium ion is a determinant of water hardness, and its excess in the human body can result in a series of complications and diseases such as renal and bladder lithiasis. The seeds of the pitombeira (Talisia esculenta) were used to produce phosphoric acid activated carbon (PAC). Adsorption studies were conducted by batch technique, and isothermal and kinetic models were systematically used to evaluate the potential of PAC to remove Ca2+ ions from aqueous media. The adsorbent was characterized using BET surface area (141.6 m2/g), SEM, pHPZC (2.75), Boehm titration, and by content analysis of the moisture and ashes. The time required for the system to equilibrate was only 5 min. According to the kinetics study, the data were best fitted by the pseudo-second-order model, while the equilibrium sorption data fitted well with the Freundlich model, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 19.05 mg/g, with 90% of Ca2+ ions removal. Therefore, due to its efficiency and low cost, PAC could be employed as an alternative adsorbent for Ca2+ removal.</jats:p>",

At the same time, little research has been done in the field of electromagnetic compatibility (spectral composition of current consumption).  The aim of the study is to determine, using computer simulation, the nonsinusoidality of the current consumption with an RL-load from a voltage regulator based on a pulse-width conversion.  The study of the spectral composition of the supply current of an active-inductive load with a pulse-width voltage regulator was carried out using the provisions of the theory of electrical circuits of sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal periodic current using computer simulation.  To analyze the spectral composition of the supply current of the RL-load with the selected voltage regulator, a simulation computer model was created, which consisted of a three-phase power supply and an RL-load, a rectifier with a transistor switch. The regulation of the applied voltage to the consumer was carried out according to the principle of a pulse-width voltage converter.  As a result of studying a model of a regulated power supply based on a pulse-width converter and working on an active-inductive load, it was found that even with an initial voltage of the fundamental harmonic regulator of 34 V, the nonsinusoidality of the consumption current is 0.19%, which corresponds to the quality standard for electricity.  It is advisable to use this regulator for a controlled electric drive of ventilation systems with an increased slip motor, for example, in \"Climate-4M\" units.

The rate of the reaction is much slower in reverse micellar medium compared to aqueous medium under identical conditions (kˈAq = 2.84×10−3 sec−1, krm =1.34×10−4 sec−1). The rate constants for the reaction in the reverse micellar medium have been determined at different values of W {W=[H2O]/[CTAB]} and at different concentrations of CTAB. It was found that the observed rate constant decreases with W.

These patterns reflect the resistance to decomposition as an aspect of resilience and are therefore used in product quality assessment complementary to chemical analyses. In the presented study, rocket lettuce from a field trial with different radiation intensities, nitrogen supply, biodynamic, organic and mineral fertilization, and with or without horn silica application was investigated with all three image forming methods. The main objective was to compare two different evaluation approaches, differing in the type of image forming method leading the evaluation, the amount of factors analyzed, and the deployed perceptual strategy: Firstly, image evaluation of samples from all four experimental factors simultaneously by two individual evaluators was based mainly on analyzing structural features in CapDyn (analytical perception). Secondly, a panel of eight evaluators applied a Gestalt evaluation imbued with a kinesthetic engagement of CCCryst patterns from either fertilization treatments or horn silica treatments, followed by a confirmatory analysis of individual structural features. With the analytical approach, samples from different radiation intensities and N supply levels were identified correctly in two out of two sample sets with groups of five samples per treatment each (Cohen’s kappa, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.0079), and the two organic fertilizer treatments were differentiated from the mineral fertilizer treatment in eight out of eight sample sets with groups of three manure and two minerally fertilized samples each (Cohen’s kappa, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.0048).

Since further experiments revealed that Cs<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> release from contaminated plants to the external medium is proportionally lower in the two <jats:italic>kup9</jats:italic> mutant alleles, we proposed that <jats:italic>KUP9</jats:italic> disruption could impair Cs<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> efflux. By contrast, K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> status in <jats:italic>kup9</jats:italic> mutants is not affected, suggesting that <jats:italic>KUP9</jats:italic> disruption does not alter substantially K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> transport in experimental conditions used.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main part of scientific research is the results of the experiment, because they make it possible to establish the existing dependencies of the course of processes on a real object, confirm theoretical calculations and a mathematical model of an electrothermal-mechanical system. The work is devoted to the issue of experimental research of power supplies for measuring and recording equipment. According to the purpose, a technique was proposed by which experimental studies of the presence of pulses, noise and fluctuations in the output voltage of pulse and transformer power supplies were carried out. The influence of the deviation of the output voltage on the fluctuations of the voltage readings on the measuring and recording equipment has been investigated. Based on the results of experimental studies of power supplies, the proposed technique can be taken as a basis for selecting power supplies in accordance with the requirements for the required accuracy of reading indicators from the measuring equipment in accordance with their accuracy class, within the total error permissible for this type of experiment. A power source for measuring and recording equipment was selected for experimental studies of an electrothermal-mechanical system to intensify the process of methane formation in a biogas reactor in order to determine as accurately as possible the energy costs for biogas production, due to the fact that the process of producing biogas is long, therefore, a large error in determining energy costs affects an increase in actual energy costs in production in relation to the calculated and experimental data. The practical value of the work lies in the fact that the use of power supplies with a lower ripple of the output voltage in experiments will reduce the processing time of the obtained data arrays, increase the efficiency of the experiment and the accuracy of the revealed dependencies. The methodology presented in the work also makes it possible to more efficiently use financial resources for the purchase of devices in the preparation and conduct of scientific and experimental research.

We show that decreased resistance to bacteria in low N is correlated with lower apoplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and lower jasmonic acid (JA) pathway expression. Consistently, pretreatment with methyl jasmonate (Me‐JA) increased the resistance of plants grown under low N. In parallel, we show that in planta titres of a nonvirulent type III secretion system (T3SS)‐deficient Ea mutant were lower than those of wildtype Ea in low N, as expected, but surprisingly not in high N. This lack of difference in high N was consistent with the low expression of the T3SS<jats:italic>‐</jats:italic>encoding <jats:italic>hrp</jats:italic> virulence genes by wildtype Ea in plants grown in high N compared to plants grown in low N. This suggests that expressing its virulence factors in planta could be a major limiting factor for Ea in the nonhost <jats:italic>Arabidopsis</jats:italic>. To test this hypothesis, we preincubated Ea in an inducing medium that triggers expression of <jats:italic>hrp</jats:italic> genes in vitro, prior to inoculation. This preincubation strongly enhanced Ea titres in planta, independently of the plant N status, and was correlated to a significant repression of JA‐dependent genes. Finally, we identify two clusters of metabolites associated with resistance or with susceptibility to Ea. Altogether, our data showed that high susceptibility of <jats:italic>Arabidopsis</jats:italic> to Ea, under low N or following preincubation in <jats:italic>hrp</jats:italic>‐inducing medium, is correlated with high expression of the Ea <jats:italic>hrp</jats:italic> genes in planta and low expression of the JA signalling pathway, and is correlated with the accumulation of specific metabolites.</jats:p>",

In the present study, the occurrence and distribution of six representative QNs in three urban DWTPs of China were investigated. The results showed that the concentrations of total QNs in the three source waters ranged from 26.4 ng/L to 313.8 ng/L and all of the six QNs were detectable with a detection frequency of 100% (4.6 to 121.7 ng/L). Enrofloxacin (ENR) and ofloxacin (OFL) were the dominant species of QNs and accounted for 40.1% to 79.5% of the total QNs. After the treatments, there were still considerable QNs in the finished water (total amounts of 74.9 ng/L to 148.4 ng/L). The adsorbed QNs could be readily treated with the removal of turbidity by DWTPs, but only a part of the dissolved QNs (13.6% to 68.5%) can be removed. This implies that the dissolved QNs were more hazardous in the source water. Pre-oxidation and disinfection could remove 15.8 ± 8.3% and 16.9 ± 10.8% of dissolved QNs, respectively, depending on the chemical structure of QNs and the types of oxidant. Chemical oxidation was more efficient than coagulation-sedimentation and filtration for the treatment of dissolved QNs. Ozone-granular activated carbon filtration may fail to remove dissolved QNs in the actual DWTPs, because of the insufficient dosage of oxidant and the competition effect of natural organic matter.</jats:p>",

A capacitor-based pulsed power supply (PPS) system with a modular design is developed to excite the magnetosheath coils to generate the required amplitude and duration of the magnetic field.

Each set of PF PPS and TF PPS consists of nine modules and four modules, respectively, and each module consists of a charge and discharge unit. The PF PPS can provide a pulsed current of no less than 360 kA for the corresponding PF coil at 0.11 ms when the charging voltage is 20 kV, and the duration of the pulsed current from the peak to 10% of the peak is no more than 0.6 ms.

The detailed design of the PPS has been discussed in this paper, and the detailed design of the main components in the discharge unit of the PPS is also given in this paper.

During the lab experiments, carried out in a circular rectangular flume device, water velocity in the flume was altered by controlling the gate switch, and the flow rate was controlled from 0 to 1 m/s. Sediment from the Le'an River and chlorine-removed tap water were used as experimental sediment and water, respectively. Through analyses of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb concentration in water at different flow rates, the relationship between the release flux (y) of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb and the flow rate (x) was established with a fitting error of less than 15%. In order to judge the reliability of the conclusions, experimental results were verified outdoors. The results showed when the sediment particle size is between 0 and 250 μm, within 1 hour, a quadratic polynomial correlation between the release flux of Cu, Cd, and Pb from river sediments and water velocity when the water pH is 5–9 and the flow rate is 0–65 cm/s; when the water pH is 5–9, the flow rate is 0–35 cm/s, the release flux of Zn from river sediments was shown to have a quadratic polynomial relationship with water velocity. The error between the calculated and measured values of heavy metals released from sediment in the Le'an River were within 5–30%. Our results can provide a theoretical reference for the control and treatment of heavy metal pollution in rivers and further improve corresponding water quality models.</jats:p>",

Finally, according to more than five million pieces of charging operating data collected over a period of two years, the charging load composition and characteristics under different charging station types, daily types and weather conditions are analyzed. The results show that bus, high-way, and urban public charging loads are different in concentration and regulation flexibility, however, they all have the potential to synergy with power grid and cooperate with renewable energy. Especially in an urban area, more than 37 GWh of photovoltaic (PV) power can be consumed by smart charging at the current penetration rate of EVs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. In forest headwater streams, metabolic processes are predominately heterotrophic and depend on both the availability of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and a favourable C:N stoichiometry. In this context, hydrological conditions and the presence of riparian forests adjacent to streams can play an important, yet understudied role determining dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3−) concentrations and DOC:NO3− molar ratios. Here, we aimed to investigate how the interplay between hydrological conditions and riparian forest coverage drives DOC and NO3− supply and DOC:NO3− stoichiometry in an oligotrophic headwater Mediterranean stream. We analysed DOC and NO3− concentrations, and DOC:NO3− molar ratios during both base flow and storm flow conditions at three stream locations along a longitudinal gradient of increased riparian forest coverage. Further, we performed an event analysis to examine the hydroclimatic conditions that favour the transfer of DOC and NO3− from riparian soils to the stream during large storms. Stream DOC and NO3− concentrations were generally low (overall average ± SD was 1.0 ± 0.6 mg C L−1 and 0.20 ± 0.09 mg N L−1), although significantly higher during storm flow compared to base flow conditions in all three stream sites. Optimal DOC:NO3− stoichiometry for stream heterotrophic microorganisms (corresponding to DOC:NO3− molar ratios between 4.8 and 11.7) was prevalent at the midstream and downstream sites under both flow conditions, whereas C-limited conditions were prevalent at the upstream site, which had no surrounding riparian forest. The hydroclimatic analysis of large storm events highlighted different patterns of DOC and NO3− mobilization depending on antecedent soil moisture conditions: drier antecedent conditions promoted rapid elevations of riparian groundwater tables, hydrologically activating a wider and shallower soil layer, and leading to relatively higher increases in stream DOC and NO3− concentrations compared to events preceded by wet conditions. These results suggest that (i) increased supply of limited resources during storms can promote in-stream heterotrophic activity during high flows, especially during large storm events preceded by dry conditions, and (ii) C-limited conditions upstream were gradually overcome downstream, likely due to higher C inputs from riparian forests present at lower elevations. The contrasting spatiotemporal patterns in DOC and NO3− availability and DOC:NO3− stoichiometry observed at the study stream suggests that groundwater inputs from riparian forests are essential for maintaining in-stream heterotrophic activity in oligotrophic, forest headwater catchments.\n                        </jats:p>"

We consider a three-tier supply chain consisting of one supplier, one transporter and one retailer with centralized and decentralized decision-making.

In the decentralized supply chain, a revenue-sharing contract is established to explore each partner’s decisions on ordering quantity, wholesale price and profits. The results show that (1) the tag cost of RFID has different effects on the pricing decisions, ordering quantity and profit of an FPSC, and if the amount of transportation time compression increases, the range of the tag cost’s boundary value will be wider when adopting RFID technology; (2) when the members of an FPSC choose the optimal wholesale price, optimal initial fare and appropriate revenue-sharing coefficient, the FPSC can achieve a win–win result; and (3) the amount of transportation time compression has a positive correlation with the expected profit of the supplier, transporter and retailer but has a negative correlation with loss of the product. </jats:p>",

Results of the descriptive statistics show that the average age, level of education, number of household members participating in maize production of the farmers were 44 years, 7 years and 9, respectively. The outcome of the multiple regression analysis established that maize supply is directly and significantly responsive to quantity of maize output sold (proxy for market participation) (0.956) and technical efficiency of farmers (739.29) at (p&lt;0.01) of probability. Other significant variables were age (61.653), level of formal education (114.074) and years of farming experience, which were significant at different levels (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.01, respectively). In conclusion, maize supply is directly and significantly responsive to market participation and technical efficiency of farmers.

However, the relative role of these factors and the sensitivity of channel steepness to rapid (&gt;1 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) uplift rates remain unclear. We conducted field and topographic analyses of fluvial bedrock channels with varying channel bed lithology and sediment source rock along the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan, where uplift rates vary from 1.8 to 11.8 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and precipitation is relatively consistent (1.5–2.7 m yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), to evaluate the controls on bedrock channel steepness. We find that channel steepness is independent of rock uplift rate and annual precipitation but increases monotonically with sediment size and substrate strength. Furthermore, in reaches with uniform substrate lithology (mudstone and flysch), channel steepness systematically varies with sediment source rock but not with channel width. When applied to our data, a mechanistic incision model (saltation‐abrasion model) suggests that the steepness of Coastal Range channels is set primarily by coarse‐sediment supply. We also observe that larger particles are mainly composed of resistant lithologies derived from volcanic rocks and conglomerates. This result implies that hillslope bedrock properties in the source area exert a dominant control on the steepness of proximal channels through coarse‐sediment production in this setting. We propose that channel steepness may be insensitive to uplift rate and flow discharge in fast‐uplifting landscapes where incision processes are set by coarse sediment size and supply. Models assuming a proportionality between incision rate and basal shear stress (stream power) may not fully capture controls on fluvial channel profiles in landslide‐dominated landscapes. Processes other than channel steepening, such as enhanced bedload impacts and debris‐flow scour, may be required to balance rock uplift and incision in these transport‐limited systems.</jats:p>",

However, the current techniques and methods used for association analysis are not very effective because they are based on continuous data. In general, there is different degrees of monotone relationship between continuous data, which makes the analysis results easily affected by monotone relationship. The multicollinearity between continuous data distorts these analytical methods and may generate incorrect results. Meanwhile, we cannot know the association rules and value interval between features and water supply. Therefore, the lack of an effective analysis method hinders the water supply association analysis. Association rules and value interval of features obtained from association analysis are helpful to grasp cause of water supply fluctuation and know the fluctuation interval of water supply, so as to provide better support for water supply dispatching. But the association rules and value interval between features and water supply are not fully understood. In this study, a data mining method coupling kmeans clustering discretization and apriori algorithm was proposed. The kmeans was used for data discretization to obtain the one-hot encoding that can be recognized by apriori, and the discretization can also avoid the influence of monotone relationship and multicollinearity on analysis results. All the rules eventually need to be validated in order to filter out spurious rules. The results show that the method in this study is an effective association analysis method. The method can not only obtain the valid strong association rules between features and water supply, but also understand whether the association relationship between features and water supply is direct or indirect. Meanwhile, the method can also obtain value interval of features, the association degree between features and confidence probability of rules.</jats:p>"

Different ecological types are supposed to affect the presence and variation of sediment phosphorus. On the basis of field investigations, the total sediment phosphorus load in Zhushan Bay was 1,457.48 mg/kg, nearly four times that of the hydrophyte-dominated area. Thereinto, 41.1% was in the form of iron and aluminum-bound phosphorus, which explicitly indicated the phosphorus contamination there. Analytical methods such as Pearson correlation, contamination assessment and principal component analysis were conducted to find out that ‘contamination’ was not equivalent to ‘release risk’. The contamination classification of East Lake Taihu was ‘clean’ in general. However, 63.3% of the total phosphorus could be mobilized under certain conditions. Therefore, light phosphorus loading does not equate to less release risk. In the long run, the implicit phosphorus release by the activation of organic phosphorus in hydrophytic areas needs close attention. This study provides a reference to understand the influence of hydrophytes and algae on the phosphorus cycle of sediment.</jats:p>",

We used a calibrated HYDRUS − 2D model coupled with a validated crop water production function to quantitatively determine the response of a soil − cotton system to three factors (IA, WS, and AS) in 30 scenarios under film mulched drip irrigation. These scenarios included five IAs, two ASs, and three WSs. Under the same IA and WS, the transpiration, evapotranspiration, yield, and WPs were lower, whereas the evaporation, drainage, soil water storage, and leached salt were higher under higher AS (over the salt tolerance threshold of cotton) scenarios. Under lower AS scenarios, desalination processes (20.2 to 166.8 g m−2) occurred in freshwater (0.38 dS m−1) irrigation scenarios and salt accumulated (425.8 to 1,442.4 g m−2) in saline water (3.10 and 7.42 dS m−1) irrigation scenarios. Desalination processes (2,273.4 to 4,692 g m−2) occurred in the higher AS scenarios. Salinity risk warning should be the focus for cotton fields with lower AS and saline water irrigation. Our results may help to identify the salinity risk to support sustainable cotton production in Xinjiang.</jats:p>",

The Indian dairy industry faces immense wattage issue due to improper infrastructure for the cold chain storage facilities, resulting in unsatisfied customers. A study is undertaken to comprehend the supply chain framework that handles perishability issues in production and distribution. Researchers propose a multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear supply chain coordination model under uncertain environments to minimize the cost of transportation, offset wastage of products and neutralize the losses due to insufficiencies of transit and storage amenities. The proposed model is meant for managing the delivery with lesser deterioration losses for producers, warehouses, and retailers. The model considers various costs for holding, halting, discounts on purchased cost, transportation cost for truckload policy under regular and unforeseen circumstances of curfew, and identify the rate of deterioration to know the impact on the cost for all players involved in the SCM framework. To handle uncertainty of objective functions, fuzzy set concepts and the defuzzification method are imposed, and fuzzy non-linear programming algorithms are used to get the single objective function from the defuzzified multi-objective functions. Data analysis is done on Lingo 18.0 software. Rate of deterioration is highest for the warehouse, which indicates that efforts should be made to augment warehouse facilities for less spoilage to reduce losses in cost.

However, most studies only focus on the status quo of water security in a static state and ignore the flow characteristics of water resources in water security assessment. This paper integrates multi-source data to construct a water supply and service supply–demand balance and spatial flow model in the Lianshui River Basin, simulates the spatial pattern of the service flow of the aquatic water ecosystem in the Lianshui River Basin from 1990 to 2018, and quantifies the service flow. Results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2018, the water supply in the Lianshui River Basin first decreased, then increased, and finally decreased. Water yield was the highest in 2010 and lowest in 2000. (2) Water demand increased year by year, and the amount of area with a poor water resource security index increased, indicating that water security was deteriorating. (3) The four main beneficiary areas in the basin are the urban area of Lianyuan City, the county seat of Shuangfeng County, the Louxing District of Loudi City, and the urban area of Xiangxiang City and nearby towns. The service flow showed the same changing trend as the water yield. In 2018, the water resource gap in the beneficiary area was as high as 4.49 billion m3. Local governments should actively build a water-saving society, improve the efficiency of industrial and agricultural water-saving and residents' awareness of water-saving, and improve the water resources in the river basin. The research can provide a scientific basis for realizing the sustainable development of water resources in the Lianshui River Basin and improving the ecological compensation mechanism, and can also provide references for water resources management in other river basins.</jats:p>",

Different physicochemical parameters were used to determine the supplies’ Water Quality Index (WQI); all of the communities presented good quality. The analysis indicates that many water quality parameters were within limits set by the international standards, showing levels of “excellent and good quality” according to WQI, mainly during the dry season (except at San Pedro Jácuaro and Irimbo communities in the rainy season). However, some sites showed “poor quality” and “unsuitable drinking water” related to low pH levels (&lt;5) and high levels of turbidity, color, Fe, Al, Mn, and arsenic. Multivariate statistical analysis techniques (Principal Component and Hierarchical Cluster) and geographic information system (GIS) identify potential sources of water pollution and estimate the geographic extension of parameters with negative effects on human health (mainly in communities without sampling). According to multivariate analysis, the Na+/K+ ratio and water temperature (22–42 °C) in various sites suggest that the WQI values were affected by geological and geothermal conditions and physical changes between seasons, but were not from anthropogenic activity. The GIS established predictions about the probable spatial distribution of arsenic levels, pH, temperature, acidity, and hardness in the study area, which provides valuable information on these parameters in the communities where the sampling was not carried out. The health risk assessment for dermal contact and ingestion showed that the noncancer risk level exceeded the recommended criteria (HQ &gt; 1) in the rainy season for three target groups. At the same time, the carcinogenic risk (1 × 10−3) exceeded the acceptability criterion in the rainy season, which suggests that the As mainly represents a threat to the health of adults, children, and infants.</jats:p>"

Current studies usually pay more attention to the effect of pollution control indicators, and there are few reports on the evaluation of LID facilities from the perspective of enhancing the value of water resources. Taking the Maluan Bay area of Haicang, Xiamen as an example, an evaluation model of water resource value was established based on the SWMM software and the pollution loss model. From the perspective of economic quantification, the value of water resources brought by three types of LID facilities, such as green roofs, permeable pavement and infiltration gallery, under rainfall conditions in different recurrence intervals was simulated and calculated. In the single rainfall event of 1–10a recurrence interval, the water resource value brought by the green roofs is 679.14–787.49 RMB/hm2, the permeable pavement is 79.07–383.37 RMB/hm2 and the infiltration gallery is 825.45–1,021.79 RMB/hm2. The results show that the value of water resources brought by the three types of LID facilities decreases with the increase of rainfall recurrence interval.</jats:p>",

Methods of intellectual analysis of profiles of mode indicators were used to identify regularities in the formation of the operation mode of the facility. The mathematical apparatus of pattern recognition algorithm with training was used to classify the profiles of mode indicators. Methods of self-organization of models of complex systems were used for structural and parametric identification of the classifier model. Results. The necessity of the analysis of the characteristics of operation mode of the pumping station of water supply, obtained from the monitoring system, to identify regularities in the formation of water supply was substantiated. The daily graph of water consumption from the water supply network was used as a mode indicator of the water supply process. Indicators of water supply volumes and graph unevenness were used to describe the water supply graph. The expediency of application of self-organization methods for solving the problem of classification and construction of the classifier model was substantiated. Structural and parametric identification of the classifier model for daily water consumption graphs was performed using GMDH Neural Networks. The search for the optimal model was performed in three classes of neural networks. Better neural network structure was chosen on the basis of criterion of regularity. The K-block cross-validation strategy was used to test the models. The results of the verification of the classifier model showed the high quality of the classification. Originality. A method for identifying changes in the operation conditions of the water supply facility due to the influence of seasonal factors, based on the usage of the classifier of profiles of daily water consumption graphs from the water supply network, was proposed. Practical value. The constructed model of the classifier allows defining of belonging of a profile of the daily water consumption graph, received from monitoring system of the water supply mode, to one of typical classes. The fact of class change indicates a change in the actual operation conditions of the water supply facility. Conclusions. Analysis of daily graphs of water consumption using the pattern recognition algorithm makes it possible to establish the change in the actual operation conditions of the water supply facility caused by the influence of seasonal factors. The usage of neural networks of GMDH makes it possible to perform automatically structural and parametric identification of the classifier model. Application of the offered principles is a basis of effective planning of operation modes of pumping station of water supply. References 16, tables 3.</jats:p>",

However, these partnerships do not realise their potential with a decline in PPP transactions over the past decade. The drivers of success for PPP projects have become a subject of investigation to understand the downward trend. This study evaluates the different critical success factors pertinent to client characteristics that influence PPP projects in South Africa. The study followed a qualitative research inquiry that employs a grounded theory (G.T.) approach involving semi-structured interviews with nine professionals involved in PPP projects selected using a snowball sampling technique. Interviews were conducted on video conferencing and through phone calls. Seven responses were considered relevant to the research, and two were considered irrelevant and were disregarded. An in-depth analysis of the data gathered was conducted through a selective coding process using NVivo. The analysis revealed the research’s emergent themes: client experience and in-house technical capabilities; client risk attitude; client willingness to be involved and trust in the private sector, available financial markets, and political support and stability. By applying the framework established, the chances of success and decline in the use of PPP projects can be considerably improved in South Africa through greater engagement between the public and private sectors in infrastructure investment and delivery. The study’s main limitation is the smallness of the sample size and the use of the snowball sampling technique in which the initial respondents are likely to refer to other respondents who share similar points of view and beliefs. To counter this limitation, the researchers ensured that the convenient sample of initial subjects comprised professionals from different backgrounds.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, the ratio of herbivores to carnivores in mesozooplankton is difficult to identify in field samples. Here, we investigated changes in the mean TP of mesozooplankton in a highly dynamic environment encompassing four distinct habitats in the southern South China Sea: the Mekong River plume, coastal upwelling region, shelf waters, and offshore oceanic waters. We used a set of variables derived from bulk and amino acid nitrogen stable isotopes from particulate organic matter and four mesozooplankton size fractions to identify changes in the nitrogen source and TP of mesozooplankton across these habitats. We found clear indications of a shift in N sources for biological production from nitrate in near‐coastal waters with shallow mixed layer depths toward an increase in diazotroph‐N inputs in oceanic waters with deep mixed layer depths where diazotrophs shaped the phytoplankton community. The N source shift was accompanied by a lengthening of the food chain (increase in the TP). This may provide further support for the connection between diazotrophy and the indirect routing of N through the marine food web. Our combined bulk and amino acid δ<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N approach also allowed us to estimate the trophic enrichment (TE) of mesozooplankton across the entire regional ecosystem. When put in the context of literature values, a high TE of 5.1‰ suggested a link between ecosystem heterogeneity and the less efficient transfer of mass and energy across trophic levels.</jats:p>",

The hydrological regimes at the JTO (Songzi, Taiping, and Ouchi) had been changed due to the Jingjiang Cutoffs (JC), the Gezhou Dam (GD), and the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). Based on hydrological data from 1955 to 2019, the variation trend in annual streamflow was detected using three techniques, and the hydrological alteration was assessed with the Range of Variability Approach. Conclusions are as follows: (1) the inflection points consistent with human activities and the time series were divided into periods of P1 (1955–1971), P2 (1972–1985), P3 (1986–2002), and P4 (2003–2019); (2) human activities made a greater contribution to streamflow change than climate change; (3) the hydrological alteration degree caused by the JC, GD, and TGD projects were 56%, 47%, and 52% at the Songzi outlet; 57%, 41%, and 57% at the Taiping outlet; and 57%, 41%, and 57% at the Ouchi outlet; and (4) the ability of division from the Yangtze River to Dongting Lake is weakening and the hydrological regimes at the JTO are deteriorating due to the JC, GD, and TGD, resulting in negative impacts on the biotic composition, structure, and function of riparian ecosystems. This study provides useful insight for ecosystem protection under hydrological alteration.</jats:p>",

This review evaluates packaging contribution to the environmental performance of seafood products. Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies were evaluated by both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis assessed how direct (e.g., packaging material) and indirect impacts (e.g., influence on seafood loss and waste) have been considered, while the quantitative analysis evaluated packaging contribution to products’ weight and climate change impact. Qualitative analysis revealed that seafood LCAs focus mainly on direct environmental impacts arising from packaging materials, for which some articles conducted sensitivity analysis to assess materials substitution. Recycling was found to be the most common recommendation to diminish direct potential environmental impacts arising from packaging end‐of‐life. However, standardized recovery rates and other end‐of‐life options (e.g., reuse), should be considered. Quantitative analysis revealed that cans' production contributes significantly to the overall climate change impact for canned products. On average, it contributes to 42% of a product's climate change impact and 27% of a product's weight. Packaging has a lower contribution when considering freezing, chilling, and other post‐harvesting processing. It represents on average less than 5% of a product's climate change impact (less than 1 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> eq/kg) and 6% of a product's weight. Packaging material production is more relevant to aluminum, tinplate, and glass than for plastic and paper. Therefore, it is essential to accurately include these materials and their associated processes in inventories to improve the environmental assessment of seafood products.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this study is to review past works in water demands and sustainable water supply planning in Nigeria as reported by many researchers and to determine how to improve the water supply infrastructure sustainably. Nigeria is endowed with abundant surface water and ground water resources. The mean annual rainfall along the coast in the south east is 4 800 mm while it is less than 500 mm in the north east. These water sources are not tapped to the fullest and most of them are polluted and unsafe for use, resulting to scarcity of potable water in most communities. Water crisis is prevalent in most cities and this is further exacerbated by deteriorating infrastructure, political instability, and poorly regulated water laws. The result of the water crisis has led to detrimental consequences for its citizens as child mortality and water-borne disease-related deaths have grown exponentially. Unsuitability of water distribution facilities, quantity of water transported, too much walking distance, long lines at water points, poor maintenance and inadequate bulk water development brought about inefficiency of the facility. The water demand and supply in some countries in the world and many towns in Nigeria were reported. The method adopted in the study involved the use of journals, books and other related literature. The result showed that water supply systems in most places in the country are in poor state, unorganized and incomplete. All countries highlighted showed many problems at various degrees in provision of the facility. Attempt was made to fill some gaps in the literature. Public enlightenment, financing, monitoring, maintenance and juicy annual remuneration packages for best water users are recommended as powerful tools towards sustenance of the water supply infrastructure.</jats:p>"
