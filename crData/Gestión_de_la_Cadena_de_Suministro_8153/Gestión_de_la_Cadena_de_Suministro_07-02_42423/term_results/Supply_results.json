The aim of this work was to evaluate the nitrogen and sulphur concentrations in leaf tissues of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu grown in nutrient solutions with combined rates of both nitrogen and sulphur. An experiment was conducted in a greenhouse during the Spring season in Piracicaba-SP, Brazil, using ground quartz as substrate. A fractionated 5² factorial design was used, with 13 combinations of nitrogen and sulphur rates in the solutions, in mg L-1, as follows: 14 and 3.2; 14 and 32; 14 and 80; 126 and 12.8; 126 and 64; 210 and 3.2; 210 and 32; 210 and 80; 336 and 12.8; 336 and 64; 462 and 3.2; 462 and 32, and 462 and 80. The experimental units were set in a randomized block design, with four replications. Plants were harvested twice. Emerging leaves, recently expanded lamina and mature lamina were sampled separately at each harvest time. In these three types of tissues the nitrogen concentration was closely related to the nitrogen supply in the solution, whereas the sulphur concentration, N:S ratio and chlorophyll meter (SPAD) readings depended upon the supply of both nitrogen and sulphur. Mature lamina did not relate well to the changing in sulphur supply. To properly assess the nitrogen and sulphur concentrations, N:S ratio and SPAD readings for the Marandu grass, the two recently expanded lamina were the best tissues to indicate the availability of both nitrogen and sulphur in the nutrient solution.</jats:p>",

With a consumer base focused in the United States, can an organisation leverage the benefits of NAFTA to their individual advantage?

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Embryos of many marine invertebrates are encased in gelatinous masses for part or all of development. Because gel and intervening embryos retard oxygen flux, such a life-history mode profoundly affects partial pressures of metabolic gases surrounding embryos. However, little is known about relationships between egg-mass structure and the opportunities and constraints imposed on structure by metabolic gas transport. We examined the effects of four factors (temperature, embryo age, embryo density and egg-mass size) on the metabolism of egg masses using both natural egg masses of a nudibranch and artificial egg masses made from sand dollar embryos and low-melting point agarose. Both temperature and embryo age strongly affected metabolic rates of nudibranch embryos. For embryos of a given age (stage), rates of oxygen consumption roughly doubled between 12 and 21°C; from early cleavage to the veliger stage, consumption rose two- to fourfold, depending on temperature. Oxygen profiles in egg masses showed that advanced embryonic age,and to a lesser extent high temperature, both led to steeper oxygen gradients into egg masses. Egg masses containing advanced embryos at 21°C had very low central oxygen levels. Small-diameter artificial masses (2 mm diameter)had virtually no internal oxygen gradients regardless of embryo density or temperature, while medium (4 mm) and large diameter (10 mm) artificial masses had oxygen profiles that depended strongly and interactively on embryo density and temperature. Together, our data on natural and artificial egg masses suggest that (i) multiple factors have strong effects on metabolic rate; (ii)rates of oxygen transport are relatively invariant with temperature in simple,artificial systems but may vary more strongly with temperature in natural egg masses; and (iii) the four factors – temperature, embryo age, embryo density and egg-mass size – interact in important ways bearing on egg mass design.</jats:p><jats:p>A simple mathematical model is developed to provide a quantitative means of estimating primary and interactive effects of the different factors. We also show that in T. diomedea the gel itself is the main barrier to oxygen transport into egg masses, and that the metabolic activity of embryos increases substantially when embryos are artificially released from the capsules that contain them within the gel mass.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is a growing need for integrating environmentally sound choices into supply‐chain management research and practice. Perusal of the literature shows that a broad frame of reference for green supply‐chain management (GrSCM) is not adequately developed. Regulatory bodies that formulate regulations to meet societal and ecological concerns to facilitate growth of business and economy also suffer from its absence. A succinct classification to help academicians, researchers and practitioners in understanding integrated GrSCM from a wider perspective is needed. Further, sufficient literature is available to warrant such classification. This paper takes an integrated and fresh look into the area of GrSCM. The literature on GrSCM is covered exhaustively from its conceptualization, primarily taking a ‘reverse logistics angle’. Using the rich body of available literature, including earlier reviews that had relatively limited perspectives, the literature on GrSCM is classified on the basis of the problem context in supply chain's major influential areas. It is also classified on the basis of methodology and approach adopted. Various mathematical tools/techniques used in literature<jats:italic>vis‐à‐vis</jats:italic>the contexts of GrSCM are mapped. A timeline indicating relevant papers is also provided as a ready reference. Finally, the findings and interpretations are summarized, and the main research issues and opportunities are highlighted.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Following the cessation of dewatering in the southern part of the Durham Coalfield in 1974, groundwater levels rose in both the mine workings and the overlying Magnesian Limestone Aquifer (MLA). A pollution plume has since been migrating through the MLA, with sulphate concentrations greatly exceeding potable water standards. Prediction of future plume development requires specification of whether upflow of mine water to the MLA occurs from a small number of point sources or in a diffuse manner (i.e. distributed over most of the area in which the MLA is underlain by mineworkings). A programme of conceptual and numerical modelling has addressed this issue. Mine plans and geological information were used to characterize the flooded mine system and its interface with the MLA. Piezometric and meteorological data were used to constrain finite difference simulations of groundwater flow in the MLA. Flow velocity vectors derived from these flow simulations allowed modelling of plume migration by solution of the advection–dispersion equation. The results of these simulations illustrate that it is necessary to invoke both point and diffuse upflow to explain the observed patterns of pollutant migration to 2003. Predictive modelling of further plume migration indicates that sulphate concentrations are likely to rise to unacceptable levels in the most proximal public supply wells within the next two decades.</jats:p>",

This difficulty can be averted if conscious efforts are made to offset it and to stimulate positive responses from the supply side. Whether such responses prevail over the shorter‐term management difficulties depends on the efficacy of state actions — and of aid — to bolster the supply side. The outcome is likely to be mixed, depending on country circumstances.</jats:p>",

Extant research has not only confirmed the costly nature of supply chain disruptions but has also contributed relevant insights on such related issues as supply chain risks, vulnerability, resilience, and continuity. In this conceptual note, we focus on a relatively unexplored issue, asking and answering the question of how and why one supply chain disruption would be more severe than another. In doing so, we argue, de facto, that supply chain disruptions are unavoidable and, as a consequence, that all supply chains are inherently risky. Employing a multiple‐method, multiple‐source empirical research design, we derive novel insights, presented as six propositions that relate the severity of supply chain disruptions (i) to the three supply chain design characteristics of density, complexity, and node criticality and (ii) to the two supply chain mitigation capabilities of recovery and warning. These findings not only augment existing knowledge related to supply chain risk, vulnerability, resilience, and business continuity planning but also call into question the wisdom of pursuing such practices as supply base reduction, global sourcing, and sourcing from supply clusters.</jats:p>",

Recent policy changes on the PGA TOUR suggest that TOUR players may be responsive to exemption status and expected earnings. Using the previous year’s real earnings per event as a proxy for expected earnings and controlling for player effects and exemption status, ordinary least squares results indicate that players’ annual entry decisions change with an exemption status change but not with higher expected earnings. An exempt, non-elite PGA TOUR player whose exemption is set to expire in at least 2 years enters slightly fewer tournaments, whereas an increase in expected earnings has no effect on tournaments entered. This suggests that the PGA TOUR would do well not to ignore possible effects of future policy changes on player annual entry decisions. </jats:p>",

This study analyzed how demography will determine future blood demand and supply in a well‐characterized region.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:</jats:bold> The population of the main catchment area of the University Hospital Greifswald (415,000 inhabitants) was projected to the year 2015 based on 1‐year age groups provided by the population registry, based on 2002 rates assuming stable death rates and migration patterns. Data on donors and recipients for the years 1996 through 2004 were extracted from the database of the Department of Transfusion Medicine.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> Until 2015, the increase in the older population will result in an 11.8 to 13.9 percent increase of blood transfusions. Assuming constant motivation to donate blood as in 2004, the decrease in the younger population will cause a 27.5 to 32.6 percent decrease of blood donations until 2015.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold> The increased demand for blood coincides with a significant reduction in blood donations. From 2008 the shortfalls will grow to 32 to 35 percent of the total demand in 2015 in the area studied. The demographic trends will affect many regions in Europe similarly. Coordinated efforts will be required to prevent blood shortages based on these demographic trends in western societies.</jats:p>",

Using cross-sectional data from a wide range of manufacturing industries, we develop and validate an operational measure of the exploration-exploitation concept. In line with theory-based arguments, our analysis suggests that the value of supply-side, demand-side, and spatial exploration and exploitation is contingent on the environment. While boundary-spanning supply-side search is found to be positively associated with innovation in more-dynamic environments typical of the entrepreneurial regime phase of technology evolution, such exploration appears to hurt innovation in less-dynamic environments. In a reverse fashion, while boundary-spanning demand-side search is found to be favorably associated with innovation in less-dynamic environments, it appears to harm innovation in a more-dynamic context. Interestingly, spatial boundary-spanning search seems to contribute to innovation in more- as well as less-dynamic environments. With the caveat that the substantive findings of this study are based on cross-sectional data, we discuss the implications of our work and future research directions. </jats:p>",

Here, we report on the interaction between S and N supply, plant growth, and quality parameters and discuss the relevance of this interaction in relation to crop‐management strategies. Broccoli plants supplied with insufficient amounts of S or N showed typical deficiency symptoms and yield decreases. In contrast, total glucosinolate concentrations were high at insufficient N supply, independent of the S level, and low at insufficient S supply in combination with an optimal N supply. This was mainly due to the presence of the alkyl glucosinolates glucoraphanin and glucoiberin. Furthermore, with S concentrations above 6 g (kg DM)<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> and an N : S ratio lower than 10:1, the glucosinolate concentrations were on average around 0.33 g (kg fresh matter)<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> and differed significantly from those plants characterized by an S concentration below 6 g (kg DM)<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> and an N : S ratio above 10:1. In addition, N : S ratios between 7:1 and 10:1 promoted plant yield and enhanced overall appearance. Therefore, to produce broccoli (and potentially other <jats:italic>Brassicaceae</jats:italic>) with higher crop yields and enhanced product quality in the field, it is vital to establish the optimal S and N nutritional status of the plant and to integrate this information into crop‐management strategy programs.</jats:p>",

Male and female rheumatologists are equally distributed up to age 44; above age 44, men predominate. The percent of women in adult rheumatology is projected to increase from 30.2% in 2005 to 43.6% in 2025. The mean number of visits per rheumatologist per year is 3,758 for male rheumatologists and 2,800 for female rheumatologists. Assuming rheumatology supply and demand are in equilibrium in 2005, the demand for rheumatologists in 2025 is projected to exceed supply by 2,576 adult and 33 pediatric rheumatologists. The primary factors in the excess demand are an aging population which will increase the number of people with rheumatic disorders, growth in the Gross Domestic Product, and flat rheumatology supply due to fixed numbers entering the workforce and to retirements. The productivity of younger rheumatologists and women, who will make up a greater percentage of the future workforce, may also have important effects on supply. Unknown effects that could influence these projections include technology advances, more efficient practice methods, changes in insurance reimbursements, and shifting lifestyles.

Transportation costs are lower for large ships than for small ships, but their use increases planning complexity and creates problems in production. In 2001, the company faced overwhelming operational challenges and sought operations-research-based planning support. The CEO, Sturla Steinsvik, contacted Møre Research Molde, which conducted a project that led to the development of a decision-support system (DSS) for maritime inventory routing. The core of the DSS is an optimization model that is solved through a metaheuristic-based algorithm. The system helps planners to make stronger, faster decisions and has increased predictability and flexibility throughout the supply chain. It has saved production and transportation costs close to US$7 million a year. We project additional direct savings of nearly US$4 million a year as the company adds even larger ships to the fleet as a result of the project. In addition, the company has avoided investments of US$35 million by increasing capacity utilization. Finally, the project has had a positive environmental effect by reducing overall oil consumption by more than 10 percent. </jats:p>",

All these maps were compiled from sources available in the UK, almost entirely by the temporary Royal Engineers officers W.B.R. King and F.W. Shotton, under conditions of strict secrecy. Their purpose was to guide military enhancement of water supplies, especially by deployment of Royal Engineers well drilling teams, to sustain the invasion force in Normandy and its advance eastwards to Germany. A uniquely complete set of maps is preserved, together with many associated documents, in the Shotton Archive of the Lapworth Museum of Geology at Birmingham. The maps are more complex than those hastily prepared by German military geologists during the summer of 1940 to guide a cross-Channel amphibious assault in the opposite direction, into southern England. They are significant as the first British attempt to produce groundwater development potential maps for a large area at detailed (1:50 000) scale, and as the precursors of modern-day groundwater harvest potential maps.</jats:p>",

All the material was studied through direct dissection, and dissection enlarged with a 90‐diopter magnifying glass, establishing origin, course, and anastomoses of the genital arteries. Axial calibers of the uterine and the main vaginal arteries were compared. An anatomical and a historical compilation of the uterine artery was made, with special reference to anastomotic areas in the lower sector. <jats:italic>Results.</jats:italic> Three main pedicles were determined in the lower uterine blood supply: a cephalic one constituted by the uterine artery, a medial one made up by the cervical artery, and a distal one formed by the vaginal arteries. Different types of anastomoses were distinguished among the upper, middle, and lower pedicles. All types of anastomoses displayed similar features and were interconnected along the isthmic‐vaginal borders, or as an intramural anastomotic network. In many cases, a transmedial interuterine anastomosis of axial caliber equivalent to the uterine artery itself could be observed. The bibliography consulted provided neither detailed descriptions of the cervical‐segmental arterial system nor of the vaginal system or its anastomoses. In two cases, images were found in books that show this anastomotic system without further explanation. <jats:italic>Conclusion.</jats:italic> A not very well known anastomotic system was described between uterine and vaginal arteries.

From the 2000 California Department of Consumer Affairs list of 25,273 dentists, we identified Latino U.S. dental graduates (USDGs) by “heavily Hispanic” surnames and Latino international dental graduates (IDGs) by country and school of graduation. From the 2000 U.S. census Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), we described Latino dentist characteristics such as Spanish language capacity and practice location. The number of Latino dentists acquiring licenses to practice in California has fallen dramatically, by nearly 80 percent, between 1983 and 2000. This decline is not merely an affirmative action issue; it results in an issue of access. Latino dentists are far more likely to speak Spanish and be located in a heavily Latino area than non‐Latino dentists. Currently, although the supply of Latino dentists is dwindling, the Latino population is growing rapidly. In California and out‐of‐state schools, first‐year matriculation of Latino USDG must increase. Further, non‐Latino dentists should be prepared and given incentives to learn Spanish and locate practices in areas of need. The reintroduction of IDG Latino dentists needs to be seriously considered.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The intensity of this response may vary between populations of the same species on a small spatial and temporal scale. We used 5 yr of data from 6 Eurasian red squirrel <jats:italic>Sciurus vulgaris</jats:italic> populations from the southern Alps to explore differences in body size and body mass among neighbouring populations, in relation to habitat type and variation in food supply. We also investigated sexual dimorphism in these traits and whether phenotypic variation affects local survival and female reproductive success. Mean hind foot length, a measure of body size, did not differ between sexes but differed between areas. Seasonal variation in body mass was small with no evidence for fattening in autumn. Females were slightly heavier than males, but this difference was largely explained by mass gain of females during reproduction. The size of conifer seed crops, the major food supply, varied strongly over years and between habitats, but this variation corresponded only weakly with autumn body mass. Differences in size and mass between populations were partially explained by habitat‐related differences in body size and variability of seed‐crops, suggesting differential selection for smaller squirrels in spruce‐larch forests against selection for larger and heavier animals in mixed broadleaves and conifer forests and in Scots pine forests with more stable seed production. The probability of reproduction by females increased with body mass, but varied strongly between habitats and years, with more females reproducing in years with rich seed‐crops. In both sexes, body mass positively affected probability of settlement and length of residency. Our results suggest that in temporally variable environments that differ in overall amount of food resources, individual variation in body mass is related to habitat type, and that having a relatively high body mass, within each population, positively affects male and female settlement success and local survival, and female reproductive success.</jats:p>",

Primary energy produced from both conventional hydrothermal and enhanced (or engineered) geothermal systems (EGS) was considered on a national scale. This paper summarizes the work of the panel which appears in complete form in a 2006 MIT report, ‘The future of geothermal energy’ parts 1 and 2.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In the analysis, a comprehensive national assessment of US geothermal resources, evaluation of drilling and reservoir technologies and economic modelling was carried out. The methodologies employed to estimate geologic heat flow for a range of geothermal resources were utilized to provide detailed quantitative projections of the EGS resource base for the USA. Thirty years of field testing worldwide was evaluated to identify the remaining technology needs with respect to drilling and completing wells, stimulating EGS reservoirs and converting geothermal heat to electricity in surface power and energy recovery systems. Economic modelling was used to develop long-term projections of EGS in the USA for supplying electricity and thermal energy. Sensitivities to capital costs for drilling, stimulation and power plant construction, and financial factors, learning curve estimates, and uncertainties and risks were considered.</jats:p>",
