Several studies have indicated that this consumption can be reduced by as much as 40 to 50 percent through cost-effective energy conservation (e.g., Dubin, 1977; Taussig, 1978). Examples of conservation actions include installation of low voltage lamps, more effective placement of lights, electronic controls for air conditioners and lights, evaporative precoolers on air conditioners and refrigerators, heat recovery systems, and so on. These actions have been found to offer, on average, exceptionally good rates of return, both to the firms that take the actions and from a social perspective (Train and Ignelzi, 1987). </jats:p>",

The plants were subjected to a light/dark cycle of 16/8 h (18/12°C). Results obtained with the two genotypes were essentially similar. In the light, xylem nitrate transport and shoot nitrate reduction approximately equalled the amount of nitrate absorbed by the root. A drastic decline in translocation to the shoot in darkness was entirely attributable to decreased transpiration since no major changes in xylem nitrate concentration were observed. Darkening caused only a slight decrease in nitrate uptake, while root nitrate reduction was enhanced. Nitrate starvation for 2 days did not significantlly affect dry matter increment, but resulted in a drastic drop in previously accumulated nitrate, indicating that the stored nitrate is accessible and can sustain unrestricted growth. Uptake increased upon re‐addition of nitrate and after 8 h it was about twice that of non‐starved plants. During recovery, restoration of root nitrate pools and root nitrate reduction took precedence over shoot nitrate accumulation and reduction. Net nitrate uptake and removal of nitrate from the root to the transpiration stream seem to be decisive for the rate of root nitrate reduction.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, most dynamic modeling procedures rely heavily on the sample data for specification. This is due to a lack of <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> information useful for determining the appropriate lag structure. However, there is frequently a rich source of information that can be used to define lag structures in agricultural supply models. This information is related to the biological and physiological processes characterizing agricultural production. In this paper, a quarterly econometric model of supply response in the U.S. hog industry is specified and estimated. This model incorporates relevant biological features of hog production directly into the specification. The structural integrity of the model is evaluated by examining post‐sample predictive ability and mean‐path elasticities. The results indicate performance that is consistent with observed behavior in the U.S. hog industry.</jats:p><jats:p>Nous disposons aujourd'hui de toute une gamme de méthodes et de techniques empiriques pour ľestimation des rapports économiques dynamiques.

(Brassicaceae), and Vicia faba L. (Leguminosae), which differ in their types of nectary vascular supply, was determined. Radioactivity was detected in all floral organs when excised flowering plant tops were cultured in sucrose solution containing a combination of <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C-labelled and formulated (unlabelled) insecticide. In A. reptans and B. napus, combined nectary tissue and nectar contained the most radioactivity on a fresh weight basis. Radioactivity was detected in floral nectar of all species, and in extrafloral nectar of V. faba. Estimated concentrations of insecticide were much higher in extrafloral than in floral nectar of V. faba; the presence of xylem in the nectary vasculature to the former may be responsible. However, the presence of xylem is not necessary for the secretion of systemic insecticides by nectaries. </jats:p>",
