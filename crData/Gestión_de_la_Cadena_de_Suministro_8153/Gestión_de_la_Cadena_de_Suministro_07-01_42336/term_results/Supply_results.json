What once was utilized by the military and used for academic purposes is now employed by companies for e-business marketing strategies and alliances in the supply chain. Historically, companies have found many ways to work together, playing different roles with regard to manufacturing, supplying, selling, delivering, and buying in the supply chain. Most of the time, according to role, members of each company get together in a shared space (i.e., marketplace) to work on a particular project (i.e., delivering quality goods or services to customers). The emergence of the Internet has brought an appropriate media to expand markets and enable collaboration with partners in all stages of product manufacturing, testing, and delivering through electronic commerce. Support for these collaborations over the Internet, called e-coalition here, is what this chapter is about.</jats:p>"

The role of trust and deception in supply chains for real-time enterprises is discussed, and a logical framework for fraud and deception is explained in this chapter. EBR is considered as a way to manage trust in the supply network. This chapter explores cooperation and negotiation, trust and deception in e-supply chains by providing methodologies and intelligent techniques for multiagent trust, negotiation, and deception in an e-SC. Finally, a unified model is developed for integrating cooperation and negotiation, trust and deception in e-supply chains.

Often several supply chains cross over the common resources, calling for the sharing of resources and prioritization. This leads to the definition of pre-specified service quality as seen by the end user of the supply chain. In this chapter, a feedback mechanism that conveys the status of the supply line starting from the tail end is discussed. The advantages of using a predicted and shifted slippage or loss rate as the feedback signal are highlighted. Based on the feedback, the source is expected to change the rate of transfer of the commodity over the supply chain. With this, the resources would get utilized effectively, reducing the stranded time of the commodity down the line. The service quality in terms of delay and loss rate gets improved.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply chain environment today is a collaborative business environment in which the members of supply chains are interlinked with each other. Hence the collaboration extends in supply chains to inter- and intra-enterprise applications, the so-called collaboration tools, such as customer relationship management, supplier relationship management, e-business and employee-business integration. In order to achieve this collaboration, supply chains also realize the need to implement integrated collaboration tools, which integrate tightly their intra- and inter-supply chain processes. With new technologies like Web-enabled services, wireless applications, and software applications, the supply chain today needs frameworks that consider the requirements of collaborative supply chain scenarios. This chapter thus will introduce a framework to ensure that collaboration at all supply chain levels is considered at a very early stage of the project so that the integrated supply chain collaboration can be designed and implemented. A case study of an application of collaboration tools is presented. This framework was used successfully to design and implement a collaborative integrated-enterprise system for a manufacturing enterprise. However, collaboration in supply chain is only effective if the collaboration tools are integrated or used jointly by supply chain and their collaborative partners. Therefore, this chapter first explains the concept of collaboration tools and its importance in the supply chain, evaluates the requirements for supply chain management (SCM), and tries to ascertain the collaborative problem areas specifically within supplier and SCM relations.</jats:p>"

However, the benefits of interconnectivity are not gained without risk. Though essential to support collaboration, increased use of information technology has removed internal and external protective barriers around an organization’s assets and processes. Thus, supply chains are better able to satisfy the needs of customers while more vulnerable to an array of IT-specific risks. This chapter identifies the sources of IT threats in the supply chain, categorizes those threats, and validates them by means of a survey of 188 companies representing a range of supply chain functions. Analysis suggests that supply chain risk is affected by IT threats, and therefore the benefits of collaboration facilitated by IT integration must exceed the increase in risk due to IT security threats.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Setting performance targets and managing to achieve them is fundamental to business success. As a result, it is common for managers to adopt a satisficing objective—that is, to maximize the probability of achieving some preset target profit level. This is especially true when companies are increasingly engaged in short-term relationships enabled by electronic commerce. In this chapter, our main focus is a decentralized supply chain consisting of a supplier and a retailer, both with the satisficing objective. The supply chain is examined under three types of commonly used contracts: wholesale price, buy back, and quantity flexibility contracts. Because a coordinating contract has to be Pareto optimal regardless of the bargaining powers among the agents, we first identify the Pareto-optimal contract(s) for each contractual form. Second, we identify the contractual forms that are capable of coordination of the supply chain with the satisficing objectives. In contrast to the well-known results for the supply chain with the objectives of expected profit maximization, we show that wholesale price contracts can coordinate the supply chain with the satisficing objectives, whereas buy back contracts cannot. Furthermore, quantity flexibility contracts have to degenerate into wholesale price contracts to coordinate the supply chain. This provides an important justification for the popularity of wholesale price contracts besides their simplicities and lower administration costs. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to the model by considering different types of objectives for different agents.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter analyses the effects of increased transparency in supply netchains. The term netchain refers to both chain and network aspects. Three levels of transparency are distinguished: history transparency (e.g., tracking and tracing), operations transparency (e.g., collaborative logistics planning), and strategy transparency (e.g., joint innovation). Using an example in the Dutch egg sector, the chapter shows how the role of the individual company changes in a netchain and discusses the implications. Though technology push makes transparency feasible and economically attractive, social-psychological barriers exist that should be taken seriously. A brief review of cases from several continents shows that these barriers vary across cultures, depending on prevailing attitudes towards relationships and authority. Transparency may run counter to tradition, to trust, and to entrepreneurial freedom in the netchain, but it also offers opportunities for creating netchains that are profitable to all participants. To grasp these requires vision on behalf of those involved.</jats:p>"

The project improved the operations at Valvex and resulted in many benefits. This chapter describes the implementation of the e-SCM system at Valvex and its integration with the existing ERP system. The process of implementation and integration was marked by many challenges, and some of them were unique to a Chinese manufacturing organization. Using several smart strategies the project team was able to overcome these challenges and complete the project successfully. Several lessons can be learned from the experience of Valvex which may be useful for organizations that plan to undertake similar projects.</jats:p>"

Despite the increasing focus on supply chain management and business collaboration, studies in the area of performance management still narrowly look at the single enterprise and its “within-enterprise” processes. Most of these existing studies are losing relevance in today’s industrial dynamics, where business models, such as that of the supply chain, are merely the tip of an emerging trend in new organization alliances, boundary redefinition, and market structures. This chapter goes beyond existing work to develop a better understanding of the issue of performance management from a supply chain management perspective. The goal is to demonstrate how today’s manufacturing systems and processes could be measured and managed in the context of the extended business of which they are part—back through the supplier chain and forward into the distribution and customer chain. The chapter’s intended major outcomes for its readers are: a clearer understanding of the concept of supply chain management through performance, and a process for designing a supply chain performance measurement system. Additional information emerges throughout the chapter.</jats:p>"

Existing supply chain research has focused on supply chains for manufactured goods, but the agricultural industry differs from manufacturing, being characterized by horizontal alliances and imprecise output predictions arising from uncontrollable factors such as weather and rates of natural increase. This chapter explores the downstream information flows in a sheep meat supply chain. It identifies stakeholders and the nature and efficiency of their information exchanges. Findings show that important information is generated in several tiers along the supply chain, but this information is not always shared and opportunities for increased supply chain competitiveness are lost. The lack of information sharing is explained by the unwillingness of partners to commit to tight contractual agreements, the lack of adequate technological infrastructure, and the absence of regulations mandating certain information flows.</jats:p>"

The chapter goes on to introduce a manual supply chain game, by which dynamic supply chain mechanisms can be simulated and further analyzed using a game-theoretic model. With the help of the game-theoretic model, externalities are identified that negatively impact supply chain efficiency. The conclusion drawn from this chapter is that incentives are necessary to overcome these externalities in order to align supply chain objectives. The authors show that the game-theoretic model, in connection with the supply chain game presented, provides an informative basis for the future development of incentives by which supply chains can be aligned in order to reduce supply chain risks.</jats:p>"

By conceptualizing virtual integration as an efficient and effective vertical coordination mechanism, the study discussed in this chapter developed a model to examine the role virtual integration plays in improving manufacturing performance and the antecedent factors that can lead supply chain members to rely on virtual integration to govern supply chain integration. Based on the resource-based view and transaction costs theory, the suppliers’ specific investments and environmental uncertainty are identified as critical antecedents to virtual integration. The results show that the suppliers’ specific investments can significantly improve the manufacturers’ achievement of manufacturing goals, thereby motivating the manufacturer to rely on virtual integration to better coordinate with the suppliers who made significant idiosyncratic investments for enhancing transaction value while controlling the potential hazards.</jats:p>"

The framework is designed to stimulate action by pinpointing where the gaps are, and leveraging technology to bridge those gaps. This is done using a balanced scorecard revolving around five critical variables: value, variety, velocity, variability, and visibility. The maturity level of each of these critical variables is classified using a six-level capability maturity continuum: ignorance, awareness, understanding, approach, action, and culture. This integrated approach of combining critical variables, balanced scorecard, and capability maturity helps leverage technology for the right purposes, and significantly improves the performance and productivity of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The current research examines the role that the relative strategic importance of the existing buyer–supplier relationship plays in reverse auction usage, including the type of governance structure established and the three previously mentioned outcomes. Results indicated that existing buyer/supplier relationships characterized as strategic opted for relational forms of governance in reverse auctions. When using transactional governance, this research provides empirical support for reports that reverse auctions result in reduced purchase prices and increased purchaser productivity.

It is assumed that if companies across supply chains have visibility of demand, inventory levels, processes, etc., that organizational performance improves. This research explores the antecedents of high levels of supply chain visibility from a resource‐based theory perspective across five different external supply chain linkages. We find that the level of visibility across these linkages differs considerably based on various contributing factors which are both technology and non‐technology based. Using resource‐based theory, we identify those factors that can give a sustainable competitive advantage to a supply chain linkage through a “distinctive” or high level of visibility.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

How this lot is structured and whether suppliers are required to adhere strictly to its composition (i.e., quote on all items in the bundle versus a subset) may significantly impact the competitiveness of the bidding and the buyer's perceived performance of the purchase. To better understand bundling practices and experiences, a survey of purchasers that aggregate several SKUs into a single bundled RFQ was undertaken. Within this context, respondent replies are categorized by buyer‐imposed bidding requirements according to whether suppliers are <jats:italic>required</jats:italic> to submit bids on all items in the bundle, merely <jats:italic>encouraged</jats:italic>, or <jats:italic>free</jats:italic> to bid on any item combination in the bundle.

Both anecdotal and empirical evidence have shown that ERAs can lower purchase prices. However, researchers are only just beginning to investigate how ERAs impact perceptions of opportunism as compared to sealed bids and traditional negotiations. Further, researchers have yet to examine how perceptions of opportunism surrounding ERAs might in turn affect such outcome variables as trust, commitment, conflict, and ultimately nonprice attributes of supplier performance. The authors address this gap in the research by developing a theoretically grounded model of the interrelationships among these five variables, and empirically testing the model through a survey of buying organizations that rely heavily on ERAs to select and source from suppliers. The authors' findings suggest that increased levels of opportunism harm supplier nonprice performance, through both their more obvious impact on dysfunctional conflict and their more latent effects on relationship trust and commitment.</jats:p>",

We discuss the main components of the RFID technology, which includes RFID transponders, RFID readers, RFID middleware, and RFID labels. A detailed classification and explanation for each of these components is provided, followed by the benefits and applications that can be achieved by adopting this technology. After discussing all possible applications, we describe the business benefits and how stakeholders can benefit. This is followed by a detailed outline of the adoption challenges, where we discuss issues like the security, privacy, cost, scalability, resilience, and deployment and some existing solutions. Once the issues are discussed, we divert our attention to some successful RFID deployment case studies to describe the adoption of RFID technology that has already begun and how many big organizations across the world are showing interest in this technology. Since this chapter takes into consideration a variety of audiences like researchers, business executives, business consultants, hobbyists, and general readers, we tried to cover material relevant to each target audience. For business executives and consultants interested in knowing who can offer complete RFID solutions, we allocated a dedicated section for RFID vendors where we provide a comprehensive list of RFID vendors across the globe. For researchers, we listed some open issues in the section of adoption challenges. For advanced users, in-depth technical details are provided in the section where we discuss security and privacy enhancing protocols.</jats:p>"

A large online retailer usually has multiple distribution centers serving different geographical regions. This chapter explores how to handle transshipment among distribution centers in a geographically dispersed network. We investigate transshipment strategies in a continuous review system with dynamic demand. We present a dynamic program that identifies the optimal transshipment rule. However, the dynamic program is time consuming and might be difficult for practitioners to implement. Therefore, we propose three distinct heuristic decision rules for making transshipment decisions. By employing numerical experiments, we analyze simulated results through various combinations of demand rates and delivery costs. We provide comments and suggestions based on the comparative results generated from different decision rules. As a result, we identify a good heuristic rule, which can be conveniently implemented and used in practice to determine effective transshipment policies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter addresses the development cycle of recent ‘services’ models. It considers that all products involve services and consequently maybe be considered as service systems. First, the issue of ‘services’ is described; next, the enhancement of ‘services’ via value creation is described, along with the progression from supply and demand chains, to value chains, to service value chains, and finally to service value networks. This progression pathway has developed over time, and has enabled ‘service’ and ‘e-service’ businesses to deliver and further develop competitive business solutions. The combinations of integrated, highly competitive, e-supply chains delivering the final ‘services’ suite to the frontline business seller moves the e-supply chain model to a more advanced level. Today, the recent concept of utilizing service value networks offers a key to future competitive solutions. Service value networks house fully integrated e-demand and e-supply chains working in harmony to the deliver both services and e-services. They are also highly agile and offer customer-induced flexible business solutions to customer requests. This chapter highlights the progression to service value networks. In addition it also offers the manager a balanced scorecard structural mechanism via which management controls over e-services and service value networks may be developed and maintained.</jats:p>"

A service value network may be defined as “the flexible, dynamic delivery of a service, and/or product, by a business and its networked, coordinated value chains (supply chains and demand chains working in harmony); such that a value-adding and target-specific service and/or product solution is effectively, and efficiently, delivered to the individual customer in a timely, physical, or virtual manner.” The service value network offers a future pathway for a business to develop its e-supply chain systems. It captures the contacting customer, and integrates the customer’s (virtual e-customer, virtual e-business customer, or physical customer) demands via its virtual or Web site interface into its integrated downstream service networks, seeks solutions, and delivers the appropriate business solutions back to the customer. Value-enhanced business encounter solutions are readily deliverable for targeted customers. The procedure to research and develop a service value network is described.</jats:p>"

The models demonstrated benefits from automatically captured real-time information in supply chain operations. The resulting visibility creates chances to operate businesses in more responsive, dynamic, and efficient scenarios. The actual initiative of such novel RFID enabled applications is therefore to encourage intelligent supply chain management to dynamically respond changes and events in real-time. As the RFID implementation costs are continuously decreasing, it is expected that more novel business models would be inspired by the technological advancement to foster more intelligent supply chains in the near future.</jats:p>"

Case examples of commercial applications of RFID in supply chain management are evaluated by Jones et al. (2004). A recent development, low power wireless personal area networking, WPAN, can offer advantages over RFID in certain circumstances. It is the purpose of this article to evaluate RFID and wireless personal area networks with respect to each other and to identify the features that give one an advantage over the other.

The explosion of the Internet and other e-business technologies has made real-time, online communication throughout the entire supply chain a reality. Electronic supply chain management (e-SCM) is a reference to the supply chain that is structured via electronic technology-enabled relationships. This chapter concentrates on the development of a procedure referred to as eSCM-I for e-SCM process improvement. The procedure focuses on process mapping and relies on principles of coordination theory. It is based on SCOR to standardize the process and take advantage of this technique of benchmarking/best practices potential. The procedure employs IDEF0 technique for mapping the processes.</jats:p>"

The aim is to provide better insights into inter-organisational relationships (IORs) enabled by the application of newer types of Internet technology in different contexts, and to develop a new conceptual framework of e-supply relationships. In this research, the conceptualisation of the transformation process of e-supply relationships represents circuits of interactions between managerial actions and social structures, as well as the particular cultural and technological context within which the interactions take place.</jats:p>"

Two new control methods using the fan airflow station (FAS) are presented in this paper. In the first method, the supply fan speed is controlled to maintain a constant system resistance, which is calculated based on the measured fan head, and airflow, which is calculated by the FAS. In the second method, the supply fan speed is controlled to maintain the duct static pressure set point, which is reset based on the airflow ratio measured by the FAS. The innovative methods can be applied to systems with either direct digial control (DDC) or pneumatic control boxes. The case studies show that the new control method can significantly save supply fan power and increase fan efficiency.</jats:p>",

Both problems require drastic complexity reduction, which is addressed effectively by clustering using SOMs. In the first problem, we cluster machines into cells and we use Latent Semantic Indexing for effective training of the network. In the second problem, we group the distribution sites into clusters based on their geographical location. The available vehicle time is distributed to each cluster by solving an appropriate non-linear optimization problem. Within each cluster an established orienteering heuristic is used to determine the clients to be served and the vehicle route. Extensive experimental results indicate that in terms of solution quality, our approach in general outperforms previously proposed methods. Furthermore, the proposed techniques are more efficient, especially in cases involving large numbers of data points. Neural networks have and will continue to play a significant role in solving effectively complex problems in supply chain applications, some of which are also highlighted in this chapter.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of evolutionary computation is significant for the development and optimisation of strategies for dynamic and uncertain situations. This chapter introduces three cases in which evolutionary computation has already been used successfully for strategy generation in the form of work on the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, Rubinstein’s alternating offers bargaining model, and the simple supply chain model. The first two of these show how evolutionary computation has been applied to extensively studied, well-known problems. The last of these demonstrates how recent statistical approaches to evolutionary computation have been applied to more complex supply chain situations that traditional game-theoretical analysis has been unable to tackle. The authors hope that the chapter will promote this approach, motivate further work in this area, and provide a guide to some of the subtleties involved in applying evolutionary computation to different problems.</jats:p>"

In order to make smarter use of global resources, the companies should pay attention to the quality of information to provide better services to their customers. This paper examines the factors influencing information quality and investigates the influences of information quality on supply chain performance. The information quality is classified into four types: accuracy, completeness, consistency and timeliness. The influencing factors include technological, organizational, and environmental characteristics. Supply chain performance is measured based on financial and non-financial indices. It can be found that the extent of information quality will increase supply chain performance and the extent of information quality is influenced by technological, organizational and environmental characteristics. The authors hope to understand the factors that influence information quality towards better supply chain performance will not only inform researchers of a better design for studying information quality but also assist in the understanding of intricate relationships between different factors.</jats:p>"

Les habitudes historiques concernant l’achat des produits alimentaires jouent ici un rôle central et l’article observe l’équilibre entre les composants historiques, sociaux et environnementaux des produits locaux/localisés. A partir de ces terrains de recherche et de ces expériences il s’est avéré possible de déterminer différentes compréhensions de « produits locaux » en relation avec le concept de « distance alimentaire/ food miles ».

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management recently has been developing into a dynamic environment that has to accept the changes in the formation of the supply chain. In other words, the supply chain is not static but varies dynamically according to the environmental changes. Therefore, under this dynamic supply chain environment, the priority is given not to the management of the existing supply chain but to the selection of new suppliers and outsourcing companies in order to organize an optimal supply chain. The objective of this research is to develop a multi-agent system that enables the effective formation and management of an optimal supply chain. The multi agent system for optimal supply chain management developed in this research is a multi agent system based on the scheduling algorithm, a cooperative scheduling methodology, which enables the formation of an optimal supply chain and its management. By means of active communications among internal agents, a multi-agent system for optimal supply chain management makes it possible to quickly respond to the production environment changes such as the machine failure or outage of outsourcing companies and the delivery delay of suppliers. This research has tried to suggest a new direction and new approach to the optimal supply chain management by means of a multi-agent system in dynamic supply chain environment</jats:p>"

The feeding structures are specialised cells with a high metabolic activity and a tremendous capacity in translocation of nutrients. The required nutrients are provided by the plant transport systems – water and inorganic solutes from the xylem, assimilates such as sugars and amino acids from the phloem. Here we discuss the available data on the mechanisms by which nutrients are translocated into the nematode feeding sites. The interaction between Heterodera schachtii and Arabidopsis thaliana serves as a model system for cyst nematodes. In this case sufficient data are available to propose a conclusive concept for the mechanisms of nutrient flow: basically, in the early stages of nematode development syncytia are symplasmically isolated, so that transport proteins are responsible for the nutrient supply. Later, connections to the phloem via plasmodesmata are established, so that developing females are well supplied with assimilates. The interactions of root-knot nematodes with their hosts share a number of similarities but the data currently available are not sufficient to draw similar conclusions. As nutrient supply and functionality of feeding structures are the basis of biotrophic parasitism of sedentary nematodes, it is tempting to unravel the mechanisms by which both plant and nematodes influence each other via nutrient fluxes.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The changing economic and political environment challenges multinational corporations to redesign their existing production and distribution network and to develop new strategies to meet customer service levels at lowest cost. This paper reviews the literature on supply chain design since 1999 with the objective of supporting the development of richer supply chain models capable of taking all logistics costs into account thereby optimizing the full cost of ownership for multinational corporations and allowing for a consolidation of value adding activities in high-wage regions.</jats:p>"

Based on the concept of a virtual organization, it is argued that the key factors in delivering an integrated virtual value chain are trust and the control of risk. The connection between trust and the control of risk is demonstrated. Trust can be examined along three dimensions: competence, integrity, and benevolence. These dimensions of trust were used by the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in this study as the criteria for choosing business partners. Risks such as poaching, stealing, transaction-specific, information asymmetries, and loss of resource control were confirmed by the SMEs as the main sources of their resistance to participation in a virtual value chain. It is proposed that managers should pay attention to trust building and the control of risks at all stages of the development of a virtual value chain in order to drive collaboration forward</jats:p>"

However, less is known about the details of how information is used to manage relationships and coordinate customers and suppliers in chains. In earlier stages of the research, a dynamic model of interorganisational information management systems (IOIMS) and relationships was developed. This chapter presents an evaluation of this model based on a survey of Australian food processors and a green life industry case study and an evaluation of a revised version of this model. It was found that a strategic-oriented IOIMS were positively associated with IOIMS satisfaction that was, in turn, positively associated with perceived current outcomes (satisfaction with performance, perceived responsiveness, and strength of relationship trust). However, (attitudinal) commitment to develop long-term customer/supplier relationships was not significantly associated with the IOIMS, IOIMS satisfaction, or current outcomes. Results were moderated by the nature of the business environment—power/dependency, experience, and market uncertainty. These findings are discussed along with implications for management and suggestions for future research.</jats:p>"

To gain competitiveness, firms have to constantly update their operational strategies and information technologies through collaborative efforts of a “network” of supply chain members rather than the efforts of an individual firm. In sum, the foci of this chapter are: (1) an overview of supply chain management (SCM) issues and problems, (2) supply chain coordination and integration, (3) the latest IT applications for improved supply chain performance and coordination, and (4) strategic IT alliances. This chapter concludes with a discussion of business implications and recommendations of future research.</jats:p>"

The IESC is described as a set of consecutive stages connected by communication and transportation links, and the design and reconfiguration aim of the DSS consists of selecting the partners of the stages on the basis of transportation connections and information flows. More precisely, the first DSS level evaluates the performance of all the IESC candidates and singles out the best ones. The second DSS level solves a multicriteria integer linear optimization problem to configure the network. Finally, the third DSS level is devoted to evaluating and validating the solution proposed in the first two modules. The chapter proposes the use of some optimization techniques to synthesize the first two levels and illustrates the decision process by way of a case study.</jats:p>"

Exports from the nine largely goods sectors, with almost three quarters of merchandise export value, are dominated by electronics-related equipment and products. Priority goods have diverse supply and trade characteristics but among the common performance issues and development options for attention in ASEAN are the high levels of trade and nontrade costs and complications. These are mainly caused and compounded by inadequate transport connectivity, cross-border clearance problems, and diverse and exacting trade rules and technical regulations. Meanwhile, greater supply linkages have yet to be achieved for enhanced collective efficiency in textiles and clothing within the region and/or across ASEAN, People’s Republic of China, and South Asia. Higher levels of product and process creativity and innovation, moreover, are needed to lift local value addition and to upgrade to high-premium, more sophisticated activities and services, especially in electronics-related sectors. All these issues and options have become more pressing against the backdrop of People’s Republic of China’s speedy progress in competence building, technology catch-up, and manufacturing competitiveness. The extensive and complex agenda for further research and information dissemination concerning regional integration and competitive globalization in ASEAN, and more generally East Asia, is thus well highlighted. </jats:p>",

Employing an inductive case-study approach to theory building, broadly in the tradition of grounded theory, this chapter develops a process model that captures the complexity of intra-industry interactions in the course of IOSCM adoption and argues for a normative path that necessarily has to be taken to achieve the increasing levels of integration envisioned in IOSCM initiatives.

However, a common limitation with such systems is the inhibition or toxicity posed by the starting substrate as well as limited aqueous solubility in many cases. In this review, we discuss the supply of substrate to bioconversions. The delivery of substrate via an auxiliary, which may be water‐miscible, or a second phase such as a water‐immiscible organic solvent, adsorbing resin, or a gas, is examined through recent examples in the field. Finally, guidelines for experimental planning and process considerations are suggested to facilitate the choice of substrate delivery method and accelerate process development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This work summarizes the results of the CFD analyses to investigate the effect of the geometrical parameters for a typical coverplate-disk cavity and blade broach system also known as the blade cooling flow supply system. A turbofan high pressure turbine was used as the test vehicle for this investigation. The main objective was to explore potential improvements in engine SFC (aerodynamic performance) by reducing the parasitic work while minimizing the impact on the factors that affect the durability of the turbine blades; feed pressure, temperature, and mass flow. Various tangential on-board injection (TOBI) blade cooling flow supply systems were considered: i) Phase 1 compared the radial TOBI and axial TOBI, ii) Phase 2 compared coverplate-disk cavity shapes, and iii) Phase 3 compared blade broach shapes. The in-house CFD code NS3D was used for the analyses. Compared to the radial TOBI, the axial TOBI has a positive impact on the parasitic work (lower) and blade feed temperature (lower) while it has a negative impact on the blade feed pressure (lower). Further, the coverplate-disk cavity shapes investigated had no significant impact on the parasitic work, blade feed pressure, and blade feed temperature. The CFD solutions show that the major portion of the parasitic work is due to flow turning at the broach entrance. Finally, reducing the blade broach cross-section by sloping up the lower wall has no significant impact on the parasitic work and blade feed temperature but a negative impact on the blade feed pressure and mass flow. Modifying the broach pressure side wall shape is preferred among the blade broach geometries investigated. Future work to improve the CFD analysis consists of performing unsteady analyses to better capture the vortex flow in the blade broach, and including upstream stationary components with either iterative boundary condition modeling or an unsteady multi-stage approach.</jats:p>",

The fact that cruises as a form of tourism supply are not tied to just one destination has contributed to a more rapid development of globalization processes in the cruise industry. The growth in demand and the economy of scale have caused the appearance of gigantism. Ships have become floating hotels or destinations similar to on-land resorts, and the ports visited have become part of the program offered onboard. Today, ships that carry few thousand people including passengers and crew, and offer a multitude of facilities, can be viewed as a global microcosms, considering that the passengers and crew come from various countries around the world. The multinational atmosphere onboard is frequently marketed as part of the cruise experience. This is further strengthened by the fact that a ship does not usually sail under the flag of its country of domicile, but rather under a flag of convenience that allows the company to lower considerably their running costs and access to global laborforce markets. Today, cruising is worldwide, demands show high growth rate, new markets are emerging, new cruise regions are developing, and the profile of cruise passengers is changing. Multinational companies cover almost all cruise regions, and the sector is dominated by three corporations that control more than 75% of the market.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to investigate the integration of information sharing and supply chain practice in supply chain management. Data from 125 North American manufacturing firms were collected. The results show that (1) effective information sharing significantly enhances effective supply chain practice; (2) supply chain dynamism has significant positive influence on effective information sharing as well as effective supply chain practice. Supply chain dynamism has more influence on information sharing than supply chain practice; (3) and effective supply chain practice becomes more important when the level of information sharing increases. The findings show that both effective information sharing and effective supply chain practice are critical in achieving good supply chain performance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Scholars advocated the government administration to deal with the public health, and thus transferred the public health from individual activities which were free from external influence and destitute of specialized management to systematic and organized conducts which were in charge of governments at various levels.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The electric power industry in the United States and in other countries is undergoing profound regulatory and operational changes. The underlying rationale behind these transformations is to move once highly monopolized vertically-integrated industry from a centralized operation approach to a competitive one. The emerging competitive markets and an increase in the number of market participants have, in turn, fundamentally changed not only electricity trading patterns but also the structure of the electric power supply chains. This new framework requires new mathematical and engineering models and associated algorithmic tools. Moreover, the availability of fuels for electric power generation is a topic of both economic importance and national security. This paper uses the model developed by Nagurney and Matsypura (2004, 2006) as the foundation for the introduction of explicit fuel suppliers, in the case of nonrenewable and/or renewable fuels, and their optimizing behavior, into a general electric power supply chain network model along with \"direct-supply\" generation. We derive the optimality conditions for the various decision-makers, including fuel suppliers, power generators, suppliers, as well as the transmission service providers and the consumers at the demand markets. We establish that the governing equilibrium conditions satisfy a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem. We provide qualitative properties of the equilibrium flow pattern; in particular, existence of a solution and uniqueness under suitable assumptions. Finally, we discuss how the equilibrium fuel supply and electric power flow pattern can be computed.</jats:p>",

The article discusses the architecture of the agent and the agent community when there is cooperative matching of volume. We present a Dynamic Programming algorithm to describe the agent’s decision process, and heuristic algorithms as the practical solution methodology. The results of a simple experiment show the improvement achieved by cooperation.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mega cities with rapid growth are challenged by two main problems concerning water supply and sanitation. One is water scarcity because local demand exceeds local supply. The other is that the infrastructure for water supply and the collection and treatment of wastewater cannot keep up with the rapid growth of the mega cities. The transfer of conventional centralised water and wastewater systems from industrialised countries to mega cities does not seem appropriate, because of the rapid and almost unpredictable growth in mega cities on the one hand and the regional shortage of water which requires an economical use and reuse wherever possible on the other hand. The transition from centralised to semi-centralised supply and treatment systems (SESATS) may be one method of resolution to the grave discrepancy between the rapid growth of cities and the provision of supply and treatment infrastructure. One important aspect of planning semi-centralised wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure including intra-urban water reuse is the assessment of the optimal size. Therefore, factors and indicators, which have an effect on the scale of semi-centralised sanitation systems, have to be developed. Beside the introduction in SESATS some of these factors, criteria and indicators and their effects on the system's scale will be introduced in this paper.</jats:p>",

We reliably utilize this region by taking advantage of the dual blood supply from superficial circumlex iliac (SCIA) and superficial inferior epigastric (SIEA) arteries and name the flap “Free SCIA/SIEA skin flap.” The arterial pedicle is selected between SCIA and SIEA according to vascular anatomy which is explored through an incision along the inguinal ligament prior to skin island planning. Among 57 free SCIA/SIEA skin flap transfers, two flap failures occurred; circulatory impairment was restored by taking the patient back to the operating room in four cases; major size discrepancy was noted in one end‐to‐end arterial anastomosis; and no vein grafts were required. Mostly an extended length of skin island is harvested irrespective of wound size in order to utilize the proximal skin as a vascular carrier that compensates for short pedicle. We conclude that, with the current microsurgical expertise, free SCIA/SIEA skin flap is versatile even when the skin quality is considered. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Microsurgery, 2007.</jats:p>",

Members of meat and wool supply chains, particularly pastoral producers, are both aware of and interested in implementing various forms of environmental assurance, but significant costs combined with few private benefits have resulted in low adoption rates. The main reason for the lack of benefits is that the end user (the consumer) does not value environmental assurance and is not willing to pay for it. For this reason, global food and fibre supply chains, which compete to supply consumers with safe and quality food at the lowest price, resist public pressure to implement environmental assurance. This market failure is further exacerbated by highly variable environmental and social production standards required of primary producers in different countries, and the disparate levels of government support provided to them. Given that it is the Australian general public and not markets that demand environmental benefits from agriculture, the Australian government has a mandate to use public funds to counter this market failure. A national farm environmental policy should utilise a range of financial incentives to reward farmers for delivering general public good environmental outcomes, with these specified and verified through a national environmental assurance scheme.\n</jats:p>"

As such, sustainable development is a rich area for academic research that is still in its infancy and has the potential to affect future government policy, current production operations, and identify new business models.

There is a tension between a rights-based approach to service provision and the politics of sustainability and conservation. The interplay between these parallel dynamics is about the politics of the South African transition to democracy. But South Africa is not an island. So, finally, there is the global water debate, with its human rights, economic, anti-privatisation/imperialism and environmental dimensions.

The Indian auto component manufacturers would see an exponential growth in output over the next decade. The industry is growing at a compounded rate of 20-25%, much faster than that of the domestic market (10-14 %). Many consider this growth in exports as just the tip of the iceberg similar to that witnessed by the information technology industry in the early 1990s.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To cover the increasing demand of on-board electrical power and for further reduction of emissions, the conventional auxiliary power unit (APU) may be replaced by a fuel cell system with an expected efficiency increase of 25% to 50% when compared to start-of-the-art GT-APU. The main components of an in-flight FC system are a compressor-turbine unit, a kerosene reformer, and the fuel cell. Polymer exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM-FC) may be favored because of their currently advanced level of development, their high power density and the available liquid water in the cathode-off gases which can be used as service water on-board. Transient requirements may have significant impact on system design and operating range and will therefore be addressed in this paper. During in-flight operation, air has to be compressed from the ambient to a pressure near standard conditions, which allows the application of state-of-the-art PEM-FC and ensures a constant power density independent from the operating altitude. A centrifugal compressor is chosen for pressurization of the system and is powered by a radial turbine, which allows autonomous operation at cruising altitude without external power. For off-design operation and transients, electric support from the PEM-FC is necessary, see [1]. The radial turbine itself is run by the hot exhaust gases from a post-combustor using the remaining energy in the cathode off-gases. A thorough trade-off between suitable compressor techniques for the air supply system was carried out in [1]. Turbomachinery revealed to be favourable for the PEM air supply system due to their low specific weight and high efficiency. The air supply system resembles the turbocharger for a combustion engine (Fig. 1), which represents a good starting point for a successful integration into the flight environment and further development due to known technology. Based on a turbomachinery design which satisfies the system requirements, the dynamic behavior of the air supply system is analyzed when coupled to the PEM fuel cell. The main focus is on the detection of sensitive system parameters causing system response delay or critical operating conditions. The present paper suggests system features, turbomachinery design parameters and controller types which achieve inherent stability and fast response of the air supply system throughout the entire flight envelope.</jats:p>",

Data was gathered from the Institute for Supply Management and the Council of Logistics Management members using the survey technique.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper presents the methodology of a conducted questionnaire survey and the results regarding energy consumption in the tourism of Primorsko-Goranska County (Croatia). The attitudes about energy consumption management and practical aspects concerning consumption are highlighted. The pool consists of three major groups of tourism objects: hotels and related facilities, camping parks and marinas. The plan was to analyze 91 tourism object, but only from 30 objects was achieved the response (33% rate). Largest share of the pool is located in the coastal area (73%), and much smaller shares are in the mountain region (13%) and the islands (13%). The results of analysis show that the largest amount of energy is used for interior heating/cooling (26,0%) and food purposes (24,5%), then for the illumination (17,3%), hot water (17,0%), laundering and ironing (10,4%), cleaning and waste disposal (2,6%) and other (2,1%). The attitudes about saving are emphasized and 96,7% of surveyed managers suppose that it is possible to manage the energy consumption and that energy increasingly influences their sustainable business activities. Information technology equipment for energy consumption control was installed in 16,7% of facilities and only 13,3% of businesses were exploiting renewable energy sources (RES) in 2007.</jats:p>"

SCM involves coordinating and integrating material, information and money flows, both within and across several companies. The integration of these flows is perceived in quite distinct ways by different communities, raising some semantics-related problems. To assist organizations in achieving a unified view of the Supply Chain (SC), a new ontology, named SCOntology, is introduced in this chapter. SCOntology is a framework to formally describe a SC at various abstraction levels, by sharing a precise meaning of the information exchanged during communication among the many stakeholders involved in the SC. Moreover, SCOntology provides a foundation for the specification of information logistics processes and also sets the grounds for measuring and evaluating a SC by stating different metrics and performance-related concepts.</jats:p>"

On the other hand inlet temperature distribution and also oil speed distribution at the inlet is the result of flow phenomena in the gap between bearing pads. These phenomena are complex and in many cases additionally affected by a special bearing design incorporating various arrangements of forced oil supply to the gap between pads. The reason for such arrangements is more efficient introducing of the lubricant cooled in an external cooling system to the oil film. Not much is known about flow phenomena in the gap between the pads and even less if the bearing is fitted with any kind of directed lubrication system. One of those special bearing arrangement is a leading edge groove (LEG) design described by Mikula [1] Experimental results showed that LEG lubricating system in comparison to flooded lubrication caused about 10–20°C drop in maximum temperature in high-speed bearings. But not much is known of potential benefits of using this lubrication method in large low-speed bearings applied in water turbines. There were no attempts of adaptation of this lubrication system to large size bearings. In this case modeling is necessary because of large cost of experiments. Contemporary computer codes of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) enable one to study flow between bearing pads or in lubricating groove and even to build models of a whole hydrodynamic bearing within CFD systems. Some results of modeling lubricant flow in the gap in a bearing with a directed lubrication system are presented in the paper.</jats:p>",

Consequently, maximal oxygen uptake (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max) decreases. &lt;i&gt;Objectives:&lt;/i&gt; The current study investigated exercise oxygen utilization during maximal aerobic exercise in trained and untrained elderly. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; Fifteen trained (59.3 ± 1.1 years) and 15 untrained (60.1 ± 1.1 years) elderly underwent a peak cardiopulmonary exercise test on a bicycle ergometer. Arterial O&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;was defined from echocardiograph and venous oxygen content. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; At rest, trained compared to untrained elderly had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher values of end diastolic volume (108.1 ± 5.8 and 100.7 ± 6.2 ml, respectively) and stroke volume (68.1 ± 4.3 and 57.3 ± 6.5 ml, respectively), while heart rate (68.7 ± 9.3 and 81.3 ± 8.2 beats · min&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively), and mean arterial blood pressure (90.6 ± 6.9 and 95.4 ± 7.2 mm Hg, respectively) were significantly lower. At peak aerobic test, the trained elderly, compared to the untrained subjects, achieved significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher values of end diastolic volume (156.1 ± 8.2 and 134.1 ± 7.6 ml, respectively), stroke volume (123.0 ± 7.9 and 96.0 ± 4.8 ml, respectively), cardiac output (20.2 ± 1.5 and 15.0 ± 1.3 liters·min&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively) and oxygen uptake (42.1 ± 2.1 and 31.1 ± 2.4 ml·kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;·min&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively), while diastolic blood pressure (70.3 ± 5.6 and 77.5 ± 4.2 mm Hg, respectively) and total peripheral resistance [4.3 ± 0.8 and 5.9 ± 1.41 (dyn·s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;·cm&lt;sup&gt;–5&lt;/sup&gt;)·10&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively], were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; The present study suggests that the differences between trained and untrained elderly in absolute oxygen uptake of the working muscles and peak power output at maximal exercise test are due to physical activity status. The higher aerobic capacity in the trained elderly is related to increased cardiovascular function and to a lesser extent to increased muscle mitochondria concentration and capillarity. Although untrained elderly have reduced maximal oxygen uptake at peak aerobic exercise, intrinsic regulation of mitochondrial function does not seem to be significantly altered because of aging associated physical inactivity. Therefore, untrained elderly can partially compensate for their lower cardiac output by increasing oxygen extraction to levels comparable with those of trained elderly.</jats:p>"

We investigated parental attitudes regarding supply of alcohol to minors, in a country which recently increased alcohol availability and where drinking per se is not prohibited at any age. A postal survey of 748 parents of 13‐17 year‐olds (80% response) in three New Zealand communities was undertaken. Parents indicated agreement/disagreement with statements concerning teenage drinking and sources of alcohol, and described factors they considered in deciding whether to supply alcohol. Four in five parents disagreed with permissive statements such as ‘It's okay for parents to give their teenager one or two drinks to take to an unsupervised party’, and 59% agreed that ‘No one should supply alcohol to someone who is underage’. Recent suppliers commonly said they would only supply if there was suitable adult supervision at the drinking location. Many said they would only supply at home with a meal and reported restrictions on quantity and strength, e.g. ‘no spirits or mixed drinks’, ‘small quantity only’. Parents generally opposed supply to minors or they specified responsible conditions of supply. They favoured legal restrictions on availability and promotion, and greater enforcement of liquor laws. The findings should be interpreted in light of social desirability bias and limitations of generalisability outside the participating communities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Globalization and the resultant complexity of today's supply chains require that enterprises be agile and proactive. This communication looks at a refinery supply chain where disruptions such as crude arrival delay could make the current schedule infeasible and necessitate rescheduling of operations. Existing approaches for generating (near) optimal schedules for a real‐world refinery typically require significantly large amounts of time. This is undesirable when rectification decisions need to be made in a short time. Further, when the problem data given to the existing scheduling approaches are changed, as is the case during a disruption, the optimizers follow different solution paths and result in substantially different schedules. A heuristic rescheduling strategy is proposed that overcomes both these shortcomings. The key insight exploited here is that any schedule can be broken into operation blocks. Rescheduling is performed by modifying these blocks in the original schedule using simple heuristics to generate a new schedule that is feasible for the new problem data. Our strategy avoids major operational changes by preserving—as far as possible—the blocks in the original schedule. The major advantages of the proposed method are its real‐time computational performance and the minimal changes to the operations as compared to total rescheduling. Further, the proposed strategy can also identify many feasible schedules and allow refinery personnel to select one by considering other factors that cannot be adequately modeled in a scheduler. Our method is illustrated using five types of disruptions occurring in a refinery. The various factors that affect the robustness of a supply chain in the face of disruptions are also discussed. © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2007.</jats:p>",

At the design level, proponents of frameworks such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) seek to motivate designers and building owners to employ environmentally desirable materials. A prominent component of this approach is boosting availability of “green” building materials through programs that will certify to buyers that materials meet environmental standards. For wood products, this has resulted in several forms of “green certification” for forest management. Increasingly large areas of forest are now being certified worldwide. Yet it remains difficult for designers of green buildings, or consumers seeking green furniture, to obtain certified wood products.</jats:p><jats:p>Many, if not most, of the logs now being harvested on green certified forest land worldwide are not reaching the store shelf with a certified label. Marketing certified wood all the way to the retail shelf has proved to be much harder than initially thought by proponents of certified products. This article explains the sources of these difficulties and outlines an approach to identifying products with high potential for marketing as certified products. Because of complex, multilevel supply chains for many wood products, support is required at all processing and distribution levels for a product to reach the retail customer with its green label.</jats:p><jats:p>Market participants' purchase size and frequency, basis for product selection, buying influences, and price sensitivity are evaluated to identify product and market approaches likely to increase success rates for certified wood products. The article concludes with recommendations for expanding markets for green building materials.</jats:p>",

From the perspective of the timber industry sector, this study is important because supply chain efficiency is a key component in an organisation’s strategy to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Strong improvement in supply chain performance is possible with improved B2B communication, which is used both for building trust and providing real-time marketing data. Traditional methods such as electronic data interchange (EDI), which are used to facilitate B2B communication, have a number of disadvantages such as high implementation and running costs and a rigid and inflexible messaging standard. Information and communications technologies (ICT) have supported the emergence of Web-based EDI which maintains the advantages of the traditional paradigm while negating the disadvantages. This has been further extended by the advent of the Semantic Web which rests on the fundamental idea that Web resources should be annotated with semantic markup that captures information about their meaning and facilitates meaningful machine-to-machine communication.</jats:p>"

Business rules are guidelines for how an enterprise should conduct its business and provide better service to customers. Business rules are being widely deployed in supply chains to support real-time decision-making. The research reported in this chapter is aimed at designing a dynamically adaptable data-sourcing service for deploying business rules effectively in supply-chain management. Such a data sourcing service is important since execution of business rules requires data to be retrieved from various data sources spread across the enterprise, including the enterprise data warehouse. We propose an ontology-based approach to implement the data-sourcing service for business rules. Our approach captures semantics of business rules and provides an agent-enabled mechanism that dynamically maps business rules to individual database schemas in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The shaping of a coast is the result of the interaction of ground and marine factors. To study the formation mechanism of the coast, it is necessary to study both the characteristics of the source from which the transported materials originate, that is the rivers discharging in it, and the characteristics of the receiver of these materials, that is the coastal zone. The results of such a study contribute to the application of a administrative action plan to this system, based on the principles of the integrated administration and the viable evolution. In this work the dynamics that shapes the coast ofAg. Varvara are examined. To this purpose, both the natural supply mechanism of the Ag. Varvara 's coastal zone with materials from the Voulgaris river and the settlement mechanism of these materials are under investigation. The most significant factors influencing the characteristics of the Voulgaris river - which is the main materials supplier of the coast – and shaping the evolution of the Ag. Varvara 's coatal zone, are the catchment area as well as the interactions taking place in it, the type and the quantity of the transported material, (geological factor), the tectonic movements influencing the shaping of the area, and finally the climatic conditions. The geomorphologic-morphotectonic analysis points to the fact that, while there is substantial supply of material to the river bed, only a small percentage of that is being transported to the coast. This is attributing to the diminished transportation capability of the river. Other factors contributing to this are the longer than expected length of the river bed, its small slopes, an the low rainfall level in the area</jats:p>"

Intranodular blood supply is useful in characterizing these nodules. However, nodules with preserved portal blood supply may be malignant or benign, and it is unknown how often these nodules develop into overt hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was performed to clarify the rate of malignant transformation in such lesions with preserved portal perfusion in cirrhotic liver. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; From 1995 to 1997, in 98 patients, we performed CT during arterial portography and ultrasound angiography with intra-arterial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection for 113 nodules &lt;3 cm in diameter to determine the intranodular blood supply. Of these, 48 nodules in 36 patients were diagnosed as ‘benign nature nodules’ on the basis of the blood supply of the nodules, which included arterial hypovascularity with preserved portal supply. Percutaneous biopsy of the nodule was undertaken for all nodules for histopathologic diagnosis. Thirty-two nodules in 22 patients that were not diagnosed as early HCC were followed-up clinically without any treatment to clarify the natural course of the nodules. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Twelve nodules in 14 patients did not increase in size and no new nodules appeared in any part of the liver. Ten nodules in 7 patients did not increase in size or arterial vascularity but typical overt HCC appeared in other areas of the liver. Only two nodules in 2 patients increased in size and developed into hypervascular overt HCC during the 15- and 34-month observation periods, respectively. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; Nodules with preserved portal perfusion in cirrhotic liver have a low risk of malignant transformation compared with the surrounding liver parenchyma.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the present study, the influence of various scenarios of supply ship collisions, namely, bow, stern and also broad-side impacts on a jacket-pile-soil system is investigated. In the previous study of ship impact on an 8-leg North-Sea Jacket Platform by Amdahl et al. [2] and also other authors, the effect of jacket-pile-soil interaction was not considered. The collision points on the jacket structure are also taken as joints and mid-span of leg, horizontal and vertical braces, namely, hard and soft impact points. The speed and the weight of the colliding vessel are also varied for typical supply vessels. Several supply ship collision analyses are carried out for bow, stern and broad-side impact scenarios on an 8-leg North-sea Jacket platform It is observed that by taking into account the jacket-pile-soil interaction effects, in particular in softer clay soils the amplitude of displacement response after supply ship impact at the deck level is increased due to yield in the upper soil layers. Contrary to this finding, less linear dynamic effects can be seen in the studied jacket-pile-soil system subjected to the supply ship impact. It can also be concluded that for soft impact scenario, the dynamic effects in the global response of the platform located in the mainly OC clayey soil may be much less than those for hard impact scenario on the same platform. For instance, for a brace impact at its mid-span, a less significant dynamic effect has been observed than for a leg impact. The duration of impact in such cases is shown to play an important role in determining the dynamic influence of the platform response. The relative energy absorption of the platform is shown to be more for broad-side loading. It is shown that the global response of the jacket platform during the collision with a supply vessel might depend largely on the scenario of the impact and to some extent on the pile-soil behavior. It is found that for the bow and stern impact scenarios, the energy contribution of the local member dent or buckling might be more significant than for the broad-side loading for which the global frame energy contribution and the overall inertia effect of the platform might be a dominant factor.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nManganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient in all organisms but may become toxic when present in excess. To investigate whether interior and coastal varieties of Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco, var. glauca (DFG) and var. viridis (DFV)] differed in Mn tolerance, seedlings were exposed to excess Mn in hydroponic solutions. Root growth, biomass production, Mn concentrations in different tissues and Mn subcellular localisation were determined. Both varieties showed similar whole-plant Mn accumulation and biomass reduction in response to increases in Mn in the nutrient solution. Since excess Mn inhibited root elongation growth more strongly in DFG than in DFV, biomass allocation in DFV was shifted towards a relative increase in root biomass and a relative decrease in DFG. X-ray microanalysis showed that Mn enrichment in cell walls and vacuoles of DFV root cortex and epidermis cells was higher than in DFG. In roots, precipitates were observed in which Mn concentrations correlated with phosphorus (P) and to a minor extent with calcium. We suggest that the higher persistence of root growth under Mn stress in DFV was caused by greater entrapment in the vacuole and in the apoplast and by more efficient Mn detoxification in insoluble complexes with P than in DFG. To investigate whether P supply affected Mn uptake and toxicity, Douglas fir seedlings were exposed to excess Mn under P deficiency. In P-limited seedlings of both varieties, roots growth was less sensitive to excess Mn than under sufficient P-supply, although in planta Mn concentrations were not diminished. In DFG, which maintained P homeostasis under limited P supply, the negative effect of Mn stress was partially reversed, showing that Mn susceptibility is affected by P metabolism.\n</jats:p>"

Infected and uninfected plants were grown under high (9 mM) and low (2.25 mM) nitrogen (AberDove, Fennema; CS, AR1, AR37) or under high (2 mM KH2PO4) and low (0.05 mM KH2PO4) phosphorus (AberDart, Fennema; CS, AR1). Quantitative realtime Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) was used to estimate endophyte concentrations in harvested leaf tissues. High N and P supply as well as high carbohydrate content of the host grass reduced endophyte concentrations. Alkaloid production was also reduced under both increased N supply and in the high sugar cultivar, and was linearly related to endophyte concentration (except ergovaline). The results stress the need for wider quantification of fungal endophytes in the grassland/ foliar endophyte context, and have implications for how introducing new cultivars, novel endophytes, or increasing nutrient inputs, affect the role of endophytes in grassland ecosystems.

However, adoption of eBusiness in supply chains has been slower than expected, particularly in small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper reports findings of a longitudinal study of four supply chains in different sectors over a 4‐year period. Specifically it examines the barriers to adoption of eBusiness technologies and therefore to achievement of integrated information in supply chains. Differences between firms in supply chains and between supply chains are examined. The study reveals disparity between existing and planned use of eBusiness by larger downstream firms compared to upstream SMEs. The SMEs are cautious, only planning to invest in eBusiness if dominant downstream customers force them; however, they do not appreciate the full benefits to be gained from eBusiness adoption. The downstream larger businesses are forging ahead with eBusiness in ‘eIsolation’ and are not providing supply chain leadership. They are creating eLands with SMEs adrift of them.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Journal bearings are widely used for supporting high speed rotating machinery such as turbine, compressor and HDD spindle etc, because of their high load carrying capacity, stability and durability. Recently, the engineering trend is oriented to higher speed and smaller sizes of rotating machinery, and then it is important to enhance stabilities for the journal bearings. Tilting pad journal bearing is generally used for high-speed rotating machineries because of their advantages of stabilization. However, there are some problems using for compact size rotating machineries for their high manufacturing cost and complicated structure. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the stability of more simple bearings compared with tilting pad bearing in order to use for small size rotating machinery. This paper describes the stabilization method of journal bearing based on the combination mechanism with starved lubrication and orientation angle change. From the results of stability experimental study of journal bearings, it is clarified that the stabilization of bearings is improved drastically by using above techniques.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nMany physiological mechanisms associated with nutrient supply have been implicated as improving plant growth under drought conditions. However, benefits to plant growth under drought might derive from an increased recovery of soil water through osmotic adjustment in the shoots and especially in the roots. Thus, experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of the nutrients N, P and K applied singly or in combination, on the osmotic adjustment and turgor maintenance in the roots and leaves of maize seedlings. The seedlings were harvested between 18 and 37 days after sowing according to the soil matric threshold potentials. Soil matric potentials and shoot and root biomass were determined at harvest. Turgor pressure and osmotic adjustment of the leaves and roots were estimated by measurements of their water and osmotic potentials. Results showed that plants with either of the combined fertilisation treatments NPK or NP grew faster at a given level of drought stress than those with no fertilisation, N, P or K applied individually or the combined nutrient treatments PK and NK. Among the fertiliser applications with either a single or two combined nutrients, plants treated with any of N, P or NP grew faster than those with either K or NK. The association between the interactive effects of nutrients and drought stress on the osmotic adjustment and turgor maintenance in roots may partially explain the role of nutrients in drought tolerance of maize seedlings. In particular, the roots exhibited a higher osmotic adjustment than the leaves for all nutrient treatments, suggesting that shoot growth shows a higher sensitivity to water deficit compared to root growth. We conclude that the maintained turgor of roots under drought stress obtained with an optimal nutrient supply results in better root growth and apparently promotes overall plant growth, suggesting that osmotic adjustment is an adaptation not only for surviving stress, but also for growth under such conditions.\n</jats:p>"

We find that the conceptual domain of B2B‐SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) technical skills, (2) change disposition, (3) conflict management, (4) market acuity, (5) coordinated logistics, (6) knowledge channels, and (7) fluid partnering. Operational indicators that tap into constructs pertaining to each B2B‐SC dimension are developed through an iterative process.</jats:p><jats:p>In the second stage, we conduct a field study to more fully assess the measurement properties of item and scale reliability and validity using a covariance structure framework.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this study was to compare the diet composition based on rumen contents of mouflons from two localities differing in food supply. In northern Moravia (NM), secondary forests with dominance of conifers prevailed, whereas in southern Moravia (SM) forests with broad-leaved trees dominated. A total of 50 (NM, n = 23; SM, n = 27) quantitative and qualitative rumen analyses were carried out. In rumen specimens from both localities broad-leaved tree species predominated (NM 32.56% of volume; SM 38.92% v) during the autumn-winter season. Among the woody plants, ash was the most frequently consumed in both localities and in both diets approximately the same amount was found (17% v). In SM the mouflon consumed a high-energy diet of various seeds (34% v); acorns and horse chestnuts were the most abundant. Coniferous shoots were consumed in NM (14% v) twice as much as in SM (7% v). A higher number of food items (S = 70) and food diversity (H' = 3.49) was found in NM than in SM (S = 58; H'= 2.88). The quantitative similarity index (SI) of both diets (individual diet items) was low (SI = 39.12%). When calculated for the main diet groups the SI was higher (73.60%). The nutritional value (metabolisable energy) of the diet was correlated with diet quality (seeds, broad-leaved tree leaves). Mouflon is considered as a typical grazer but we found that during autumn and winter periods both Moravian subpopulations preferred browse and, where available, high-energy food for successful over-wintering. In SM the individuals had a non-significant tendency to be heavier and also their body fat content was higher (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.035). The body condition of mouflons was thus related to the quality of the food supply in the biotope.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Analyzing the proliferation of item‐level RFID, recent studies have identified the cost sharing of the technology as a gating issue. Various qualitative studies have predicted that conflict will arise, in particular in decentralized supply chains, from the fact that the benefits and the costs resulting from item‐level RFID are not symmetrically distributed among supply chain partners. To contribute to a better understanding of this situation, we consider a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer. Within the context of this retail supply chain, we present analytic models of the benefits of item‐level RFID to both supply chain partners. We examine both the case of a dominant manufacturer as well as the case of a dominant retailer, and we analyze the results of an introduction of item‐level RFID to such a supply chain depending on these market power characteristics. Under each scenario, we show how the cost of item‐level RFID should be allocated among supply chain partners such that supply chain profit is optimized. </jats:p>",

Smart Integrated eOperations appears to be re-engineering the industry structure. Within the next few years, new policies and practices will establish operational networks and collaborative partnerships between O&amp;G producers and the service-support-supply market through active integration for effective and efficient management of offshore production assets. Adaptation of Smart Integrated eOperations is largely stimulated by rapid development in application technology, large-scale information and communication (ICT) platforms, and the foreseen substantial commercial benefits of well-integrated collaborative industry infrastructure. This is a very novel macro-scale program, and the Norwegian O&amp;G Industry has already launched major initiatives in this regard to realize its fully functional status by the year 2010. The sophisticated information and communication platform called Secure Oil Information Link (SOIL) and Onshore support centres (e.g., ODC and OOC of ConocoPhillips, Norway) represents major icons of this digital era. However, as per the existing circumstances on NCS, this long-range development scenario presents itself with a multitude of challenges, particularly those relating to human and organizational interfaces, which have to be overcome to ensure long-term sustained benefits.</jats:p>"

A search of the PubMed database for articles containing “primary care physician supply” or “primary care supply” in the title, published between 1985 and 2005, identified 17 studies, and 10 met all inclusion criteria. Results were reanalyzed to assess primary care effect size and the predicted effect on health outcomes of a one-unit increase in primary care physicians per 10,000 population. Primary care physician supply was associated with improved health outcomes, including all-cause, cancer, heart disease, stroke, and infant mortality; low birth weight; life expectancy; and self-rated health. This relationship held regardless of the year (1980–1995) or level of analysis (state, county, metropolitan statistical area (MSA), and non-MSA levels). Pooled results for all-cause mortality suggest that an increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 population was associated with an average mortality reduction of 5.3 percent, or 49 per 100,000 per year. </jats:p>",

The aim of this work is to investigate the network organization level of supply chains in case of remote maintenance application and to understand how maintenance policies are coupled with information technology (IT) solutions. To this purpose two literature reviews are presented: firstly, on the supply chain and network integration, and then on the evolution of maintenance using information technology. Following this, the paper present four specific industrial case‐studies of eMRO network organisation. They have been chosen as reference models from a set of practical applications and pilot tests performed by the authors in different production sectors in the last 5 years. Technology complexity environments, maintenance outsourcing level, and supply chain integration context are discussed for each case‐studies with particular regards to the profitable forms of collaboration provided by the introduction of IT and the Web. This analysis work toward the development of a framework useful to: (1) classify different e‐maintenance systems and understand the relationships between the different members of the network, and (2) identify the variables which can influence the introduction and development of the systems.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Its power, mandate, and in many ways preparedness to execute a common foreign policy towards the GME, let alone as specific as a common foreign energy strategy, are limited.

Cornicabra, trained in a central leader form for hedgerow planting, were grown outdoors in 45-L weighing lysimeters to evaluate the effect of water supply on growth and development. Four treatments were established and maintained for 155 days during spring–autumn. Treatment T100 was irrigated to maintain the potting medium close to water-holding capacity by progressive replenishment of consumption that was measured at weekly intervals by weighing and recording drainage. Treatments T80, T60, and T40 received 80, 60, and 40%, respectively, of the water applied to T100. For these treatments, transpiration and leaf area were measured every fortnight. Dry matter in roots, stems, and leaves was measured at the beginning and end of the experiment. Leaf conductance was measured at 09 : 00 and 12 : 00 solar time every fortnight and at c. 2-hourly intervals throughout one day each month. Over the experimental period, T100 produced 0.42 ± 0.01 m2 leaf area, 319.6 ± 60.4 g dry biomass, and transpired 77.5 ± 1.1 L water. Water stress significantly reduced leaf area development and dry matter production (P &lt; 0.05) in T60 and T40, but not in T80. There was no effect on dry matter partitioning to the various organs of the trees or the roots/aerial part ratio. Leaf conductance was more sensitive to water stress than vegetative growth, with significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) established among treatments 3 weeks before differences were observed in transpiration. In autumn, transpiration and leaf conductance increased in all treatments independently of soil water status. Over the experiment, transpiration efficiency (TE, g/L) increased with reduced water supply, with a significant difference (P &lt; 0.10) between T100 and both T60 and T40. The study has established that maximum growth of young olive plants can be achieved, without effect on the distribution of biomass between organs, at water supply less than that required to support maximum transpiration.</jats:p>"

This issue is critical as the SEC and the PCAOB continue to defend the requirement that SMEs adhere to the internal control reporting requirements of Section 404 in the Act, albeit at a revised level of expectation focusing on more of a top-down risk-based approach. Cross-sectional case study data is used to explore the impacts of SOX on SMEs adopting organizational theories as a lens for observing behavior and outcomes. The results of the study confirm that there are both benefits and costs associated with SOX compliance. All of the organizations studied experienced substantial improvements in enterprise risk management approaches. However, the level of difficulty experienced by the various organizations in implementing SOX requirements was highly variable and could be traced back to the underlying factors in structural inertia theory: size, complexity, experience with change, experience with strict controls, and adaptability. Perhaps the most important finding is that SOX does impact organizational flexibility to various degrees as predicted by theory; and this impact can in turn affect production cycle times, information technology investment, supply chain performance, and ultimately, market competitiveness.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A mixed integer programming model that aims at supporting the tactical wood procurement decisions of a multifacility company is presented. This model allows for wood exchanges between companies. Furthermore, the material flow through the supply chain is driven by both a demand to satisfy (\"pull\" strategy) and a market mechanism (\"push\" strategy), enabling the planner to take into consideration both wood freshness and the notion of quality linked to the age of harvested wood into log, chips, and end-product demands. An inability to consider alternative plans for implementation, and the difficulty of assessing the performance of these plans in an uncertain environment, are two shortcomings of the manual planning process. A planning process, based on human planner – decision support system interactions that allows a company to overcome these shortcomings is therefore presented. The process combines Monte Carlo methods and an anticipation mechanism that will, in the long term, enable the company to take into account equipment transportation costs. The proposed planning process leads to a multicriteria decision-making problem where the human planner has to select a plan to implement from a set of candidate plans. A hypothetical test case shows that it is possible to manage the wood flow from stump to end market in such a way as to preserve freshness and extract higher value from the logs processed in the mills. The test case also shows that the proposed planning process achieves an average profitability increase of 8.8% compared with an approach based on a deterministic model using average parameter values. Finally, a sensitivity analysis reveals that the accuracy of standing inventory on harvest blocks and the anticipated market conditions are the most important parameters to consider in selecting a good wood procurement plan. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper addresses the three-dimensional analysis of unsteady flow in the RWT (Refueling Water Tank) for the prediction of the potential for air ingression into the ECC (Emergency Core Cooling) pump during the SBLOCA (Small Break Loss Of Coolant Accident) at KSNPs (Korean Standard Nuclear Power plants). Upon the receipt of RAS (Recirculation Actuation Signal) by the occurrence of SBLOCA, the RWT outlet valve is designed to be isolated manually. At the nuclear power plants without the provision of automatic isolation operation of the valve on the downstream of the RWT line, the refueling water begins to discharge from the RWT, which may result in forming and developing the vortex flow in the RWT, under the condition of the minimum pressure of containment and minimum water level of containment recirculation sump during the phase of RAS. Due to the vortex flow, when the water level is below the critical height, a dip starts to develop, causing air ingression before the refueling water drains fully. Hence it can be surmised that there is a possibility of ECC pump failure due to air ingression into the ECC supply line even before the RWT is fully drained. Therefore, in this work, when the RAS is actuated followed by the SBLOCA occurrence, a quantitative evaluation for the maximum limiting allowable time for the manual closing of RWT outlet valve is carried out to eliminate the possibility of air ingression into the ECC pump from the RWT. To do this, the unsteady flow field in the RWT including the drain pit with the connected discharge piping in the process of SBLOCA is analyzed using a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code. In addition, the transient flow behavior accompanying air entrainment resulting from the dip formation due to vortex flow at the upper part of RWT is examined and the applicable limiting time of the isolation valve closing for preventing air ingression is assessed.</jats:p>",

This phenomenon is widely recognized in the agronomic whole plant literature but poorly recognized in the floriculture literature. We calculated supply and demand balances for water, total dry matter (TDM), and minerals during a 6-day postharvest evaluation of the spatially diverse, detached, indeterminate inflorescence of <jats:italic>Lupinus havardii</jats:italic> Wats. ‘Texas Sapphire’ held in deionized water. The apex approximately doubled its original (harvest day) amounts of total N, P, K, Mg, and S and increased its TDM and water content by 55% and 85%, respectively, all at the expense of lower-most mature flowers. Net export from the lower mature flower fraction and, when applicable, upper mature flowers, accounted for the following apical gains: 46% of TDM, 102% of water, 100% of N, 94% of P, 99% of K, and 54% of Mg and S. Directed reallocation of resources from the senescing lower mature flowers (the main “target”) to the apical sink (the “mobilizing center”) bore a marked resemblance to the coupling of remote sink demand with vegetative decline reported in monocarpic plants (i.e., vegetative-to-reproductive exchanges), but with two distinguishing characteristics: 1) the TDM and mineral exchanges were strongly restricted to flowering units, and 2) the contributions of water, N, P, and K exports to apical sink demand were at or near 100%. This article is the first that we are aware to provide an internal supply and demand balance sheet reflecting, quantitatively, the postharvest reallocation of internal resources from mature reproductive tissues to generative reproductive tissues of a cut inflorescence.</jats:p>",

We found the cumulative stand mortality (CSM) was significantly greater in buffer units compared with reference units and that mortality varied with distance from the stream. In the inner zone (0–10 m from stream), the mean difference in CSM between buffer and reference units was relatively small (22% of unlogged CSM), but the CSM in the buffer units of the outer zone (10–20 m from stream) was more than double (120%) the CSM in the reference units. The greater CSM in the buffer units is primarily the result of a significant increase in mortality by windthrow at a small proportion (11%) of the logged units. We found that logging caused an increase in the proportion of tree recruitment to the stream from the outer zone of buffers and changed the shape of the LWD source distance recruitment curve. Based on our findings, we estimate the future potential supply of LWD is diminished by 10% compared with an unlogged reference stand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Plants alternate between a net surplus of carbon in the light and a net deficit at night. This is buffered by accumulating starch in the light and degrading it at night. Enough starch is accumulated to support degradation throughout the night, with a small amount remaining at the end of the 24-h diurnal cycle. This review discusses how this balance between the supply and utilisation of carbon is achieved in Arabidopsis. It is important to regulate starch turnover to avoid an acute carbon deficiency. A 2–4 h extension of the night leads to exhaustion of starch, a collapse of sugars, a switch from biosynthesis to catabolism and an acute inhibition of growth by low carbon, which is not immediately reversed when carbon becomes available again. In starchless pgm mutants, where sugars are depleted each night, this leads to a recurring inhibition of growth that is not reversed until 5–6 h into the following light period. Several lines of evidence show that starch accumulation is regulated in response to events that are initiated during periods of low carbon. Starch accumulation is decreased when small amounts of sucrose are included in the growth medium. Sets of sugar-responsive genes were identified by supplying sugars to carbon-starved seedlings, or by illuminating 5-week-old plants in the presence of 350 or 50 ppm [CO2]. Almost all of these genes show large diurnal changes in starchless pgm mutants, which are driven by the depletion of carbon during the night. Many show significant diurnal changes in wild type plants, showing that ‘anticipatory’ changes in signalling pathways occur before acute carbon limitation develops. However, these diurnal changes of transcripts do not lead to immediate changes of enzyme activities. Whereas an extension of the night leads to major changes of transcripts within 4–6 h, changes in enzyme activities require several days. In pgm, enzyme activities and the levels of &gt;150 metabolites resemble those found in wild type plants after several days in the dark. It is concluded that diurnal changes in transcript levels are integrated, over days, as changes in the levels of enzymes. We hypothesise that this facilitates an adjustment of metabolism to a mid-term shift in the conditions, while ignoring noise due to diurnal changes and day-to-day fluctuations. The rapid adjustment of starch synthesis after a period of acute carbon depletion is a consequence of the transient inhibition of growth. This leads to accumulation of sugars when carbon becomes available again, which triggers a large increase in trehalose-6-phosphate. This signal metabolite promotes thioredoxin-dependent post-translational activation of ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase. Mid-term acclimation to a decreased carbon supply may be mediated by a combination of post-translational regulation, longer-term changes in enzyme activities, and a decrease in the rate of growth.</jats:p>"

Using a combination of case studies and survey data from a diverse sample of industries, the research examines how industry context, firm characteristics and firm‐level strategic resources, such as purchasing teams, influence the exploitation of e‐business technologies and the relationship between e‐business technology use and firm performance. Based on a synthesis of related literatures from transaction cost economics and the relational view of the supply chain, a two‐dimensional framework for e‐business technology is proposed with transactional and relational dimensions. However, empirical analysis indicated that transactional technologies can be further subdivided into two factors: dyadic cooperation and price determination. Significant differences were found between the two dimensions in terms of their overall levels of adoption, with dyadic coordination being the most widely adopted. In addition, the development of strategic resources expanded, in particular internal and customer teams, the use of e‐business technologies expanded. Purchasing organizational structure and firm size also were positively related to the adoption of transactional e‐business technologies. Finally, of particular importance to practitioners, e‐business technologies targeted at reducing dyadic coordination costs lead to improved financial performance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Prey supply was defined as the surplus biomass that could be removed without affecting future prey generations and was limited to cohorts consumed by predators. Demand was represented by the annual consumption by the predator community (piscivorous fishes) and was estimated with bioenergetics models. Our demand estimates were conservative because predators may have greater demand for prey than what they actually consume. Together, clupeids (gizzard shad <jats:italic>Dorosoma cepedianum</jats:italic>, threadfin shad <jats:italic>D. petenense</jats:italic>, and alewife <jats:italic>Alosa pseudoharengus</jats:italic>) and <jats:italic>Lepomis</jats:italic> spp. accounted for 80% of overall prey fishes consumed. Median annual demand for clupeids and <jats:italic>Lepomis</jats:italic> spp. combined was 271 kg/ha (90% confidence interval = 183–552 kg/ha) from August 1996 to July 1997 and 182 kg/ha (92–509 kg/ha) from August 1997 to July 1998. Median supply during these times was 848 kg/ha (103–18,989 kg/ha) and 413 kg/ha (317–540 kg/ha). Dividing supply values by demand values yielded supply–demand ratio distributions with medians of 2.9:1 (0.3:1–67.5:1) and 2.3:1 (0.8:1–4.8:1) for the two periods. Using a historical area–density data set (coves sampled with rotenone; <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 22 years), we found the median annual supply to be 167 kg/ha (49–982 kg/ha), demand to be 109 kg/ha (51–239 kg/ha), and the supply–demand ratio to be 1.5:1 (0.4:1–10.4:1). Historical values of the supply–demand ratio were less than 1:1 (i.e., supply was insufficient to meet demand) 32% of the time. The latter estimate is minimal because the threshold supply–demand ratio (the ratio below which predators are forage limited) was probably greater than 1:1, as predators cannot capture all prey with 100% efficiency and our definition of demand was conservative. We suggest adjusting demand to equal the median historical supply.</jats:p>",

The RSC can potentially reduce negative environmental impacts of extracting virgin raw materials and waste disposal. If so, investment in the reverse supply chain should not be made in isolation, but instead must be integrated with investments selected to improve the forward supply chain. After defining and operationalizing these constructs, a survey of plant managers was used to empirically assess the linkages between supply chain investments, organizational risk propensity (i.e., willingness to take risk) and business uncertainty. Reverse supply chain investment had two primary dimensions: reconditioning (i.e., high‐value recovery) and recycling and waste management (i.e., low‐ or no‐value recovery). Ongoing investment in the forward supply chain was significantly related to investment in recycling and waste management, but not to investment in reconditioning. Moreover, risk propensity was found to mediate the relationship between the external business uncertainty and investment in the forward and reverse supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The model is demonstrated to perform well in simulating the various features of the reservoir's thermal stratification regime in each of the years, including the timing and duration of stratification, the dimensions and temperature of the layers, and the periods of internal wave oscillations in stratified layers. The average root mean square error for temperature predictions for the 14 years is 1.30 ºC. The validated model is applied in a probabilistic manner to investigate the impacts of sedimentation on the temperature of the withdrawn water (T<jats:sub>w</jats:sub>) that enters a stream with a salmonid fishery, and features of the stratification regime. The predicted effects of sedimentation include a shift toward higher T<jats:sub>w</jats:sub> values, a shortening of the duration of stratification, and decrease in the depth of the epilimnion in fall. The effects on T<jats:sub>w</jats:sub> are exacerbated for the reservoir because of localized sedimentation adjoining the intake that increasingly limits access to cooler layers.Key words: hydrothermal model, temperature, model, reservoir, water supply, model projections, sedimentation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\"> The previous decade has witnessed an unprecedented expansion and consolidation of supermarket chains on a global scale. Notwithstanding a wealth of recent research on the global expansion of multinational food retailers, the existing literature largely overlooks the transformation of supply networks and resulting impacts on firms, workers and regions in host countries, where international supermarket chains procure the vast majority of food products for local markets. In addition, the bulk of previous research has been carried out in developed nations, ignoring one of the most striking trends of the past decade – the rapid and unfettered expansion of international retailers in developing countries, especially Asia and Latin America. This paper provides an assessment of the impacts of the globalization of retailing on supply-network linkages between food retailers, intermediaries and small-scale agricultural producers in Yucatán, Mexico. In the context of a global production networks (GPN) framework, this case study reveals that the transformation of supply networks, and concomitant implications for small-scale producers, is mediated by locally contingent relationships among national and international food retailers, intermediaries, state government officials, and agricultural and livestock producers, as well as global economic processes. Durante la última década hemos sido testigos a la expansión y consolidación de cadenas de supermercados a una escala global. No obstante los numerosos estudios recientes enfocados en la expansión global de las tiendas de autoservicio, ha pasado casi desapercibido la transformación de las redes de distribución y las consecuencias para las empresas, trabajadores, y regiones en países receptores, donde los supermercados multinacionales surten la gran mayoría de sus productos para los mercados locales. Además, se ha realizado la gran mayoría de los trabajos de investigación anteriores en países desarrollados, sin tomar en cuenta una de las tendencias más sobresalientes de la última década – la proliferación desbordada de las cadenas multinacionales en países en vías de desarrollo, especialmente Asia y América Latina. En este trabajo se analizan los impactos de la globalización entre las tiendas de autoservicio, los intermediarios y los pequeños productores agropecuarios en Yucatán, México. En el contexto del marco conceptual GPN (redes de producción globales), este estudio de caso revela que la transformación de las redes de producción, y las consecuencias para los pequeños productores, surge tanto de las relaciones locales entre las cadenas de autoservicio, los intermediarios, funcionarios del gobierno estatal, y los productores mismos, como de los procesos económicos globales. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a mathematical model is derived via Lagrange’s Equation for a shear building structure that acts as a foundation of a non-ideal direct current electric motor, controlled by a mass loose inside a circular carving. Non-ideal sources of vibrations of structures are those whose characteristics are coupled to the motion of the structure, not being a function of time only as in the ideal case. Thus, in this case, an additional equation of motion is written, related to the motor rotation, coupled to the equation describing the horizontal motion of the shear building. This kind of problem can lead to the so-called Sommerfeld effect: steady state frequencies of the motor will usually increase as more power (voltage) is given to it in a step-by-step fashion. When a resonance condition with the structure is reached, the better part of this energy is consumed to generate large amplitude vibrations of the foundation without sensible change of the motor frequency as before. If additional increase steps in voltage are made, one may reach a situation where the rotor will jump to higher rotation regimes, no steady states being stable in between. As a device of passive control of both large amplitude vibrations and the Sommerfeld effect, a scheme is proposed using a point mass free to bounce back and forth inside a circular carving in the suspended mass of the structure. Numerical simulations of the model are also presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Advances in intelligent transportation systems have resulted in deployment of surveillance systems that automatically collect and store extensive networkwide traffic data. Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models have been developed for a variety of dynamic traffic management applications. They are designed to estimate and predict the evolution of congestion with detailed models and algorithms that capture travel demand and network supply and their complex interactions. The availability of rich time-varying traffic data spanning multiple days provides the opportunity to calibrate a DTA model's inputs and parameters offline so that its outputs reflect field conditions in future offline and online real-time applications. The state of the art of DTA model calibration is a sequential approach, with supply model calibration (assuming known demand inputs) followed by demand calibration with fixed supply parameters. An offline DTA model calibration methodology is presented for simultaneous estimation of all demand-and-supply inputs and parameters, with sensor data. A minimization formulation that can use any general traffic data and present scalable solution approaches for the complex, nonlinear, stochastic optimization problem is adopted. A case study with DynaMIT, a DTA model with traffic estimation and prediction capabilities, is used to demonstrate and validate the methodology. Archived sensor data and a network from Los Angeles, California, are used to demonstrate scalability. Results indicate that the simultaneous approach significantly outperforms the sequential state of the art in terms of modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. </jats:p>",

Industry cluster theory emphasizes the explicit and implicit benefits that accrue to various economic players due to geographic proximity. As such, it provides a contrasting view to the current pressure on supply chains to seek out the “best” partners, regardless of location. We review the theory behind industry clusters, and illustrate it using the example of the New England cotton textile industry. Incorporating these concepts into future research has the potential to improve our understanding of how decisions regarding supply chain location and sourcing decisions are currently made, and what role location‐based benefits should play in these decisions. </jats:p>",

A key challenge in this role is to balance the often conflicting pressures created by sustainable development—firm‐level economic performance versus environmental degradation and social disruption. Drawing on complexity theory, risk management, stakeholder theory and the innovation dynamics literature, we discuss the problems of integrating sustainable development concerns in the supply chain, specifically the applicability of life cycle assessment (LCA). Many authors have emphasized the importance of the “cradle to grave” approach of LCA in optimizing closed‐loop supply chains, improving product design and stewardship. Based on two case studies (an agricultural biotechnology and an oil and gas company) with supporting data collected from key stakeholders, we argue that sustainable development pressures have increased complexities and presented ambiguous challenges that many current environmental management techniques cannot adequately address. We provide a framework that addresses these deficiencies and discuss implications for practitioners and management theory.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To promote land-efficient development that supports nonautomobile modes of transportation, many municipalities are trying to implement parking policies that minimize parking oversupply and use existing parking supply more effectively. A commonly proposed strategy is for municipalities to lower their minimum parking standards. However, parking supply decisions are based on many factors, and experience shows that reducing parking standards does not always lead to corresponding reductions in parking supply. Using the results of an extensive commercial parking survey conducted across the City of Toronto, Canada, this study develops an empirical approach to determine whether reductions in parking standards are likely to lead to reductions in the amount of parking supplied by new development. It is proposed that the proportion of existing sites supplying less parking than existing standards require can be used as an indicator of the likelihood of developers to respond to reductions in parking standards by providing less parking. This assumes that the development characteristics of surveyed sites can be considered representative of current development practices. Applying such an analysis to Toronto, it is expected that reducing the parking standards for general office, medical office, and general retail uses will be a successful strategy in encouraging new development to provide fewer parking spaces on average. Such a strategy will be less successful for bank and large grocery uses, which tend to provide more parking and are less sensitive to minimum parking standards. </jats:p>",

With the aid of historical data, new data collection, and mathematical simulation modeling, the relation between the magnitude and timing of groundwater withdrawals on the stage and flow of water in the stream was derived. Fish sampling and habitat modeling were used to assess the effects of human influence on certain reaches of the Fenton River.

This study developed a new scheme for supplying energy using dual energy sources to enhance the regeneration of ATP and lower the rate of phosphate accumulation. In the proposed scheme, where creatine phosphate (CP) and glucose were simultaneously used as the energy sources, the phosphate released from the CP was subsequently used in the glycolytic pathway for the utilization of the glucose, which enhanced the ATP supply and reduced the rate of inorganic phosphate accumulation. When tested against different proteins, the developed method produced 2–3 times more protein than the conventional ATP regeneration methods using single energy sources. Biotechnol.
