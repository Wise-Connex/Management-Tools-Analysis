      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The demand for higher education in South Africa continues to increase, placing pressure on public higher education institutions to satisfy this demand. Supply chain management is one of the practices that may be implemented to ensure that public universities improve their operations and can, therefore, meet the increased demand for higher education in the country.Objectives: This study aimed to explore the barriers to the implementation of supply chain management practices at a South African public university.Method: The study used a qualitative case study approach using a sample of 17 members of management and staff at a South African traditional university in the Limpopo Province. Data were collected using a combination of a focus group discussion and semi-structured in-depth interviews.Results: The study generated eight themes that embody the barriers to the implementation of supply chain management at the institution. These themes were labelled as stakeholder buy-in, knowledge of supply chain management, supply chain systems and processes, procurement policy and practices, implementation of supply chain management, stakeholder change management, human resource management and organisational culture.Conclusion: Various internal barriers impair the implementation of supply chain management practices at the institution. Administration at the institution has invested limited resources, time and initiatives to ensure the successful implementation of supply chain management. The focus should be directed to finding lasting solutions to each of the barriers identified in this study. Further studies should address the issue of external barriers to supply chain management in public higher education institutions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Global supply chains have evolved from a traditional simple supply chain to one that is filled with complexities and uncertainties. The increase in road freight transportation has resulted in an escalation in the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere, impacting climate change.Objectives: The purpose of this article was to investigate the implementation of sustainable supply chain initiatives in reducing GHG emissions within the South African road freight transport industry.Method: This research utilised a case study approach and used primary data, obtained through self-administered questionnaires, to explore the adopting sustainable transport management practices.Results: The main drivers for implementing sustainable initiatives are pressure from consumer and brand protection, pressure from top management, and cost saving and revenue. Eco-driving, eco-routing and increasing vehicle carrying capacity are the most adopted sustainable supply chain initiatives implemented. The key benefits resulting from implementing sustainable initiatives were operational cost savings, improved competitive advantage and enhanced supplier relationships. Also, the lack of government support, lack of understanding of the cost and insufficient manpower were identified as the foremost challenges associated with the implementation of these sustainable initiatives.Conclusion: The results reveal that organisations are placed under enormous pressure to implement sustainable practices. This study identifies various sustainable initiatives to reduce GHG emissions and addresses the associated benefits and challenges when implementing these initiatives.</jats:p>"

Independent operation of 500kV and 220kV system, improved the reliability of power supply of nuclear power plant. However, the DC 220V power system used to control the 500kV and 220kV system in the switch station of partial nuclear power project is not independently configured, and the design form of one set of DC system is used in the transformer station. In recent years, there are many accidents that AC power enters into the DC power system, resulted in the loss of power source in the transformer station. The loss of external power source in the whole plant is very significant. In this paper, the influence of AC power entering into DC power system on relay protection device is analyzed, the measures to prevent the AC power into DC power system are discussed, the necessity of independent configuration of DC control power system for the 500kV priority power system and 220kV auxiliary power supply system is analyzed.</jats:p>",

Not only must they contend with multiple dimensions of risk in decision‐making, they must reconcile decision‐making with broader organizational interests. This study examines the influence of organizational communication regarding supply chain risk on individual decision‐making strategies and the perceptions of risk. A multi‐stage experimental design is applied, in which decision‐makers make decisions across three dimensions of risk and adjust their risk‐taking behavior after being presented with organizational communication regarding supply chain risk levels. The relationship between organizational communication and the perceptions of supply chain risk is then explored after decision‐makers are allowed to adjust their supply chain strategies. The results suggest that decision‐makers adapt sourcing strategies in response to organizational communication regarding supply chain risk. Specifically, they make riskier decisions when the organization communicates improvements in supply chain risk levels. However, when given specific instructions to reduce risk, they do not adjust their supply chain strategies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The management of financial flows in the supply chain is an integral part of effective supply chain management and is an emerging research area. A breach in the relationships between firms and financial providers may not only affect the financial health of the focal firms, but also disrupt the financial stability of their supply chains. Building on life‐cycle theory, this research examines the critical role of trustworthiness in the financial supply chain relationships in the event of a contract breach. Although literature has established that trustworthiness is vital to interfirm supply chain relationships, we further propose that changes in trustworthiness are particularly relevant when interfirm relationships are impacted by negative shocks such as contract breaches. Trustworthiness change (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TC</jats:styled-content>), therefore, is likely to serve as a key determinant in the nonbreaching party's decision to continue on in a relationship. Using archival data from multiple data sources, we find evidence that<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TC</jats:styled-content>significantly influences the likelihood of relationship continuity in the aftermath of contract breaches, and that the effect is not linear. In addition, the effect is stronger for breaches that occur earlier in the duration an interfirm relationship, and when the breaches are less severe. These findings offer several important implications for both financial supply chain relationship theory and practice, which are discussed in the paper.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A service supply chain (SSC) is a supply network that transfers resources into services with or without physical products, to satisfy cus-tomer needs. So it’s evident that without offering the right service at the right time to the right person, the service is incomplete, inconsistent and ineffective. In the same context, the retirement field faces the challenge of offering the correct pension to the right pensioner the first month of his retirement. This paper approaches this challenge from a SSC perspective as a case study for dealing with continuity in service supply chain. It uses a methodology that combine Analysis-Specification-Design-Implementation (ASDI), Office Support Systems Analy-sis and Design (OSSAD), Business Process Management (BPM), and Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR). It analyzes and mod-els the Moroccan retirement SSC, simulates the behavior of \"the management of civil pension rights\" process, and proposes a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to evaluate the continuity in the service supply chain. Hence, this work provides guidance on the performance analysis of a SSC.   </jats:p>"

Various forms of uncertainty may arise in the application of MCDA methods, including imprecision, inaccuracy or ill determination of data. The ELECTRE family methods deal with imperfect knowledge of data by incorporating ‘pseudo-criteria’, with discrimination thresholds, to interpret the outranking relation as a fuzzy relation. However, the task of selecting thresholds for each criterion can be difficult and ambiguous for decision-makers. In this paper, we propose a confidence-interval-based approach which aims to reduce the subjective input required by decision-makers. The proposed approach involves defining the uncertainty in the input values using confidence intervals and expressing thresholds as a function of the interval estimates. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by applying it to evaluate the water supply and sewerage services in Spain. Results show that the confidence interval approach may be interesting in some cases (e.g. when dealing with statistical data from surveys or measuring equipment), but should never replace the preferences or judgments of the actors involved in the decision process.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the transportation mode has been considered as a decision variable. With regard to the complexity of such network, a new swarm intelligence algorithm known as a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm has been employed to tackle this problem. The effectiveness of the present model and approach is evaluated by a numerical experiment, and the results show that the added environmental performance is actually proportional with the increased cost. Additionally, the comparison between different mode decisions shows that a better trade-off between two objectives will be obtained when considering the transportation mode selection.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design problem consisting of both forward and reverse material flows. Here, a four-echelon single-product system is introduced in which multiple transportation channels are considered between the nodes of each echelon. Each design is analyzed for the optimum cost, time and environmental impact which form objective functions. The problem is modeled as a tri-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. The cost objective aggregates the opening cost (fixed cost) and the variable costs in both forward and reverses material flow. The time objective considers the longest transportation time from plants to customers and reverse. Factors of environmental impact are categorized and weighed using an analytic network process (ANP) which forms the environmental objective function. A genetic algorithm (GA) has been applied as a solution methodology to solve the MILP model. Ultimately, a case problem is also used to illustrate the model developed and concluding remarks are made regarding the results.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In the summer of 1968, Richard O’Feldman must have wondered how he came to be playing the flute on the back of a killer whale. The curly-haired twenty-eight-year-old was no stranger to marine mammals. Growing up on Miami Beach in the 1940s, he had often seen bottlenose dolphins. “Back in those days, Biscayne Bay was teeming with them,” he recalled, and his mother told him tales of dolphins rescuing downed pilots. Thirsting for adventure, fifteen-year-old O’Feldman lied about his age to join the National Guard and later enlisted in the navy. Over the next five years, he rode a US destroyer around the world, hearing his first dolphin calls in the ship’s sonar room and training to become a navy diver. Not yet twenty-one when he left the service, he dabbled in treasure hunting off the Florida coast before finding work at the Miami Seaquarium. His first day on the job, O’Feldman joined the marine park’s collection crew on an expedition to capture dolphins in Biscayne Bay. “In those days, you didn’t need a permit,” he explained. “You could do whatever you wanted.” As a diver, his task was to search for entangled dolphins while keeping the net clear of coral snags. The collection method made casualties inevitable. “I would find dolphins wrapped up dead,” he admitted. “We killed a lot.” By 1962, O’Feldman had helped capture more than a hundred bottlenose dolphins. The Miami Seaquarium kept some for display, but it sold most to other marine parks. Among them were US buyers such as Marineland of the Pacific and Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium, as well as a growing number of European dolphinariums. “Places were just opening,” he noted, “and we were supplying them.” Among the eager customers was his former employer, the US Navy, which had just launched its Marine Mammal Program. O’Feldman saw nothing wrong with captivity—“never questioned it at all,” he told me. Never, that is, until he began working with the animals himself.</p>",

The authors conducted an extensive search for academic publications on lean, agile, and leagile (hybrid) supply chains in context with automobile industries, published since year 1990 in reliable repositories such as Google Scholar, Scopus and ResearchGate. None of these papers used bibliometric analysis on the topic. This paper systematically maps, publications on lean, agile, and legal strategies in automobile industry published during 1990–2017. A five-step process is followed, namely (i) defining appropriate search terms, (ii) initial search results, (iii) refinement of search results, (iv) initial data, statistics, and (v) data analysis; adopted for inclusion of relevant documents for publication and citation analysis. Selected documents include primary search term ‘automobile' along with associated secondary terms such as ‘lean', ‘agile', ‘lean and agile', and ‘leagile' as part of the title, abstract, or keywords. The analysis finds several documents on lean or agile strategies, but only one document exists on ‘leagile' paradigm. Maximum articles are contributed on engineering subjects followed by business, management and accounting and computer sciences. Large publication and high citation counts were observed for lean from United States and Chinese authors, whereas Indian authors contributed in agile studies. This article identifies areas of current research interests discussing crucial contributions by several authors' and provides potential directions for further research investigations in the field.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this research is to address a gap in construction supply chain research, and consider  if  supply  chain  integration  is  applicable  in  long-term  work  programmes  in  civil infrastructure.  This   qualitative   research   draws   on   data   provided   by   semi-structured   interviews   with contractors, clients, sub-contractors and materials providers from two roading network case studies.  The data were analysed using ethnographic content analysis in three stages, which generated propositions aligned to aggregate dimensions identified in the literature. The findings suggest that thereis an underlying demand and value for increased integration, and  a  willingness  and  trust  amongst  the  focal  actors  to  integrate  more  with  upstream  and horizontal partners.  However, implementation would be hindered by the focal actors’ limited capabilitiesand  maturity  in  supply  chain  management  and  supply  chain  integration.    The research  concludes  that  focal  actors,  delivering  long-term  programmes  of  planned  and response works, could adapt prevailing supply chain methodologies to benefit from increased integration.    The  research  contributes  to  knowledge  through  an  increased  understanding  of supply chain integration considerations in asset maintenance and renewal programmes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is one of the most important transportation problems in logistics and supply chain management. The standard CVRP considers a fleet of vehicles with homogeneous capacity that depart from a warehouse, collect products from (or deliver products to) a set of customer locations (points) and return to the same warehouse. However, the operation of carrier companies and third-party transportation providers may follow a different network flow for collection and delivery. This may lead to non-optimal route planning through the use of the standard CVRP.Objective: To propose a model for carrier companies to obtain optimal route planning.Method: A Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem for Carriers (CVRPfC) model is used to consider the distribution scenario where a fleet of vehicles depart from a vehicle storage depot, collect products from a set of customer points and deliver them to a specific warehouse before returning to the vehicle storage depot. Validation of the model’s functionality was performed with adapted CVRP test problems from the Vehicle Routing Problem LIBrary. Following this, an assessment of the model’s economic impact was performed and validated with data from a real carrier (real instance) with the previously described distribution scenario.Results: The route planning obtained through the CVRPfC model accurately described the network flow of the real instance and significantly reduced its distribution costs.Conclusion: The CVRPfC model can thus improve the competitiveness of the carriers by providing better fares to their customers, reducing their distribution costs in the process.</jats:p>"

On the one hand, the discourse on energy poverty in developed countries (known as “fuel poverty”) is discussed (especially in the European Union), focusing on different forms of definitions and measurement, coping strategies, and attempts to combat the problem. On the other hand, the discourse on energy poverty in developing countries is outlined, highlighting especially rural electrification processes and gender relations. It is shown that energy poverty is deeply embedded in wider social, economic, political, and cultural structures, reflecting inequalities both within and across nations. Therefore, the chapter concludes that measures and interventions to tackle energy poverty must take into account wider societal structures and power relations in order to achieve a just and sustainable energy system and society.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research examines buyer–supplier relationship resilience associated with a psychological contract breach by the buying organization. Our study covers the span of buyer‐induced negative events from prebreach to postrepair. Specifically, we investigate the role of the nature of the interorganizational and interpersonal relationships in preventing initial trust loss (prebreach) and the effectiveness of different repair processes (penance and regulation) in promoting subsequent trust repair (postbreach). The effects are analyzed on two levels: interorganizational and interpersonal. We use social exchange theory to derive the study's hypotheses and a scenario‐based role‐playing experiment to test them. The results suggest that effective interorganizational trust repair can help to transform the nature of an interorganizational buyer–supplier relationship from adversarial to collaborative. Furthermore, initially adversarial interpersonal ties exacerbate the extent of interorganizational trust loss in collaborative interorganizational buyer–supplier relationships, while collaborative interpersonal ties help prevent initial interorganizational trust loss. Our study makes three contributions. First, it extends the psychological contract literature by investigating purchasing managers’ mitigation strategies in response to a buyer‐induced negative event. Second, it accounts for the role of interpersonal ties in buyer–supplier relationship resilience. Third, it underscores the effectiveness of trust repair mechanisms, such as penance and regulation, in actually improving buyer–supplier relationship resilience after a psychological contract breach.</jats:p>",

There is no denying the fact that the contamination of water leads to numerous health hazards. The facility of safe and adequate drinking water to the growing urban population continues to be one of the major challenging tasks for any state. In India, according to the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD); continuous potable water supply to every households are directly related with the Service Level Benchmark (SLB) of the city. This study is applied research and it designs and builds a detail project report for 24x7 water supply system at Sabarmati and old Wadaj ward of Ahmedabad city. It includes feasibility study; software based hydraulic design, operation and maintenance strategy and economic feasibility for the project by studies of research paper, case study, census data, need and demand of the future. The present water supply practice is non-confirming to designed hydraulic parameters, and also the system is severely affected insufficient hydraulics, leading to many of the current critical issues which keep the Local Authorities in an evitable brutal circle. Using data from the local government body, the papers presents the condition of intermittent water supply network and compare it with continuous water supply system of selected District Metering Area (DMA) of Ahmedabad in Gujarat (India).\n                        </jats:p>"

Yet developing and fostering sustainability partnerships among supply chain organizations remains challenging. Bounded rationality and opportunistic behaviors are likely to hinder joint sustainability collaboration and performance. The literature has called for a better understanding of the governance of green supply chain collaboration. This study applies transactional cost economics as a conceptual framework to investigate the relationships among transaction features, governance mechanisms, and environmental performance. Using the data collected from 969 plants in 17 countries, the statistical analysis compares and validates the effectiveness of three alternative governance mechanisms: contractual governance, problem-solving cooperation governance, and information-sharing governance. The statistical results reveal significant performance differences in how firms apply alternative governance mechanisms to mitigate opportunism, manage adaptation problems, and improve green supply chain collaboration and performance. Overall, this study makes research contributions by confirming the mediation effects of governance mechanisms on green supply chain practices. For green supply chains to be a viable practice, firms should apply governance mechanisms in proper alignment with the nature of the collaborative and environmental conditions.</jats:p>"

Once FBPS merged with Caudhill school the entire institution began running as a complex adaptive system where each company, FBPS and Caudhill, management started acting as separate parts of the total institution but instead showing one structure while interacting with the community FBPS was apparently ineffective as an open system by the time of its closure because it is undoubtedly obvious they were not sympathetic to the stakeholders, meaning, the kids and the parents’ wishes, it started performing like a closed system. The organization was not effective as a complex adaptive system because its continuity was threatened and clearly the separate units or factors of the organization were not communicating effectively amongst each other in the general interest of what was best for the company.

The successful activity in the unstable economic environment is impossible without proper strategic analysis and the formation of the effective management system that requires the search for new techniques, the development of logistics-oriented concepts, management approaches to logistics processes that can ensure the goals achievement under the continuous systemic development and disturbance flow. The goal of the research is to improve the technique and develop a management model for logistics processes, considering the effect of the disturbance flow. In accordance with the goal, it is necessary to solve the following scientific problems: to reveal the patterns of logistics processes for the formation of a signal system on management points within the framework of management structures; to develop components of the management technique for logistics processes, taking into account the disturbance flow; to systematize and supplement the principles of logistics processes for the formation of the rational totality of components in the management technique. Thus, the implementation of the proposed management technique for logistics processes will lead to the formation of optimal management impacts within each element, subsystem and the entire structure of the supply chain, ensuring the sustainable development vector at each time period and achieving the goals set under the influence of the disturbance flow, adaptability, flexibility and efficiency of processes.</jats:p>",

The authors use a similar approach based on latest data to estimate the volume of water lost by water utilities around the world. The conclusion of this study is that the 2006 estimates were extremely conservative and that realistic NRW estimates are significantly higher. The global volume of NRW has been estimated to be 346 million cubic metres per day or 126 billion cubic metres per year. Conservatively valued at only USD 0.31 per cubic metre, the cost/value of water lost amounts to USD 39 billion per year. Not only is this an enormous financial concern, but elevated NRW also detracts from water utilities, in a time of increasing scarcity and climate change, from reaching their goals of full service coverage, at a reliable level of service at an affordable price.</jats:p>",

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis respon penawaran petani jagung terhadap perubahan harga input dan output. Dalam penelitian ini, juga dilakukan upaya untuk menguji respon penawaran petani jagung di Indonesia dengan menggunakan metode Error Correction Model (ECM). Penelitian ini menggunakan data sekunder. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa penawaran petani terhadap jagung dipengaruhi oleh harga kedelai, upah tenaga kerja, harga benih, harga pupuk urea, harga pakan, dan harga jagung impor. Petani jagung juga responsif terhadap harga jagung, oleh karena itu, kebijakan stabilitas harga dan kebijakan harga dasar dapat diberlakukan kembali untuk mendukung swasembada jagung. Penelitian ini juga merekomendasikan bahwa masih perlu kebijakan subsidi input dan perluasan lahan untuk meningkatkan penawaran jagung. Demand for maize in Indonesia keeps growing due to low maize production, while consumption keep increasing (excess demand).

Results of the study shows  that supply of maize farmers is influenced by price of soybeans, wages of labor, prices of seed, of urea fertilizer, of feed, and of imported maize. Maize farmers are also responsive to changes in maize prices and therefore the policy of maize floor price can be re-applied to support the national food self-sufficiency. In addition the input subsidy and land expansion policies are still necessary to increase maize supply.</jats:p>"

Aiming at the stability problem of multi-load mode, this paper mainly analyzes how the number of loads influences the system stability and defines the boundary condition of the load quantity. Meanwhile, an L-shaped coil structure and the T-shaped magnetic core structure are proposed to solve the problem of coil breakdown for high-power supply situations. The proposed structures effectively reduce the supply coils’ self-inductance on the premise of guaranteeing the power transfer, and ensure the security of the multi-load system. At last, the validity of theoretical analysis is verified by simulations and experiments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\t \tMany energy storage technologies are fundamentally “materials-dependent”; they are enabled directly by, or designed around, a particular material or materials. Society's acute dependence on materials has increased in recent years as these technologies tap into an ever broader range of the periodic table and, therefore, into a broader set of underdeveloped and complex supply chains. In particular, growth in lithium-ion battery (LIBs) materials for the transportation and electricity sectors has led to extensive discussion of whether raw materials supply will meet the material requirements for these batteries. This presentation will cover balance between supply and demand for the metal content associated with compounds used in LIBs. We investigate the supply of nickel, cobalt, and lithium over the next 10 years and overlay scenarios of projected demand for LIBs over the same time period. We find that nickel has sufficient supply to meet the anticipated increase in demand for LIBs, but that there may be challenges in rapidly scaling the use of materials associated with lithium and cobalt in the short term. Due to long battery lifetimes and multiple end uses, recycling will play a modest role in filling the gap in short-term supply. We also explore the risks associated with the geopolitical concentrations of these elements, particularly for cobalt. Based on this initial screening, we perform a more detailed assessment of how cobalt supply may develop in the future particularly based on the byproduct nature of primary cobalt extraction from nickel and copper.  </jats:p>",

This paper deals with the optimization of logistics processes at an underground waste storage site by means of solving scheduling issues and reducing setup times, with the help of a simulation model. Specific to underground waste storage is the fact that it is often only a side business to actual mining. With limited capacity and resources, all legal requirements must be met, while the business should still be profitable. This paper discusses the improvement of a logistical system’s performance using machine scheduling approaches with the support of a plant simulation model. The process sequence is determined by means of a priority index. Genetic algorithms are then applied to improve the priority index to further increase performance. Results of the simulation model show that the performance of the logistics system can be increased by up to 400 percent, ensuring adequate system performance for current as well as future demand without changes to the system’s capacities and resources.</jats:p>"

However, water balance needs long and sufficient hydrologic data. Since many data was not available at those regions, generating hydrologic data over a long period and filling the missing data were necessary. Then 24 scenarios with different water supply conditions were simulated. It was found that the dam was unable to support water demand for irrigation together with domestic and tourism due to water level requirement. Then, by supplying water from Khabour River and cancelling the irrigation project, the water level of the reservoir was enhanced, as shown on Scenario-10. In addition, it was identified that Khabour water contribution should be priority of the program to survive the reservoirâ€™s goals in case of integrated water resource management at the Dam.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study by taking the East Java region as a case study, the research will focus on the resilience of the investment climate on labor fluctuations and the deterioration of infrastructure quality. The data used are at district and city level in East Java starting from year 2007 until year 2014 which is yearly. Dependent variable in this research is total investment (INVESTMENT) that enters into districts and cities in East Java in the form of foreign direct investment (PMA) and domestics investment (PMDN), while the independent variable is divided into two categories namely labor supply shock and infrastructure quality. To represent employment conditions, several independent variable were selected namely human development index (HDI), labor force participation rate (LFPR), and district / municipal minimum wage (UMK). The other independent variables representing the quality condition of the infrastructure consisted of good road length (ROAD), power supply electricity (electricity) and government expenditure on infrastructure (GMODAL). By using panel data regression analysis in 38 districts in East Java, it can be concluded that the coefficient of UMK that contradicts with the theory can be explained from the phenomenon of data where, the minimum wage increase of city districts start 2007 to 2013 slightly has impact on the total investment value. On the other hand, infrastructure variables such as roads, electricity and allocation of government funds do not significantly affect the value of investment in East Java.Keywords: Data Panel Regression, Fixed Effect Model, Minimum Wage and Infrastructure.</jats:p>"

The most effective variables in pipe failures are material, age, length, diameter and hydraulic pressure. To evaluate these models, the data collected in recent years in the water distribution network of district 1 in Tehran were used, with a total length of 582,702 m of pipes, and 48,500 consumers. The results demonstrate that among the four studied models, the logistic regression model is best able to give a good performance and is capable of predicting future accidents with a higher probability.</jats:p>",

It also aims to examine the relationships among customer’s perception in the SSCM practices, self–brand connection, trust, purchase intention, and the willingness to pay a price premium. Previous studies were reviewed, and statistical analysis was conducted with reliability and validity tests, correlation analysis, and a structural equation model. A smartphone industry was selected and a total of 367 data were utilized for this empirical study. The analysis results showed that the customer’s perception of a brand’s SSCM has a positive impact on the customer’s self–brand connection and trust prospectively. Customer’s participation in SSCM also had a positive relation to customer’s self–brand connection and to trust. Self–brand connection and trust played mediating roles between the customer’s perception and purchase intention and between the customer’s perception and the willingness to pay a price premium. The same mediating roles of self–brand connection and trust were found between customers’ participation and purchase intention as well as between customers’ participation and the willingness to pay a price premium. This study identifies the roles of customers as end users in sustainable supply chain management. This study provides managerial insights about customers’ perception of SSCM and their participation in it, resulting in better financial outcomes and improved operational excellence.</jats:p>"

Conditional on being gainfully employed, lesbians are found to have a higher labour supply than heterosexual women, even controlling for factors such as the number of children and the characteristics of the spouse. The reverse is true for gay men. The analysis of occupational structure shows that lesbians are more likely to sort into male‐dominated occupations, while the reverse is true for gay men. The findings of this article have implications for the correct interpretation of the sexual orientation related earnings gaps.</jats:p>",

Data on the hydrodynamic thermal electron emission converter (HTEEC) developed in Baltic State Technical University VOENMEH, and also on option of its laboratory sample (LS) are provided in the present article. The HTEEC device is that in active zone HTEEC the current of flows of weakly ionized plasma (FWIP) with high speeds will be organized (0,5-7 km/s and above). It allows to have working surfaces of the cathode and GITEP anode at distances much more than sizes, characteristic of classical TEC, in 0,3-0,5 mm. Thus reliability of HTEEC due to lack of need of maintenance of fine-line spacing and minimizing of negative effects of change of form of active surface of the cathode increases. The laboratory sample is intended for carrying out complex pilot studies of the HTEEC device for two types of propulsive masses -combustion products of organic fuel and inert gases with additives of alkaline metals. Results of the real research have found the reflection when working on the subject «Geksapod» which is carried out to Baltic State Technical University VOENMEH.

The performance of hotel industry in Bandung tend to be sluggish and decrease performance. This happens because the hospitality business in Bandung City attracted many businessmen supported by an increasing numbers of domestic and foreign tourist visits every year. The purpose of the research is to determine the behavior of supply chain management and marketing ability to the company's performance directly or through the competitive advantage as a mediator This research is multivariate analysis with SEM PLS data processing. The study was conducted on 77 managers hotel taken using stratified random sampling technique. The results show that supply chain management practices have a positive effect on competitive advantage, but do not have influence on the performance. In contrast to marketing capability that has an influence on competitive advantage and firm performance. This study also shows that competitive advantage can mediate the relationship of marketing capability to firm performance, but can not mediate the supply chain management practices relationship to firm performance in the hospitality industry of Bandung City.</jats:p>"

Due to the crude oil restrictions and its environmental impacts, a replacement of other energy sources has become more important in recent years. Natural gas is one of the replacements as a cleaner source with a more suitable calorific value than oil in comparison with other renewable energy sources. Therefore, utilization of natural gas as the main source of replacement strategies in the energy system has accelerated at the national level. However, the natural gas energy system is a complex system including different influencing and influenced variables that affect social and economic factors. This research has developed a system dynamics model to understand the complexity of the natural gas energy systems at the macro-level. The model shows the effective sub-systems of energy system with their related variables. It helps to predict the effective factors of an energy supply system based on statistics approaches. After that, three scenarios are defined based on expert opinions and the behaviors of the sub-systems in each scenario is analyzed. The approach also helps to understand unknown consequences of a decision or scenario in the energy system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Public water supply systems (PWSS) are critical infrastructure that are vulnerable to contamination and physical disruption. Exploring susceptibility of PWSS to such perturbations requires detailed knowledge of supply system structure and operation. The physical structure of the distribution system (i.e., pipeline connections) and basic information on sources are documented for most industrialized metropolises. Yet, most information on PWSS function comes from hydrodynamic models that are seldom validated using observational data. In developing regions, the issue may be exasperated as information regarding the physical structure of the PWSS may be incorrect, incomplete, undocumented, or difficult to obtain in many cities. Here, we present a novel application of stable isotopes in water (SIW) to quantify the contribution of different water sources, identify static and dynamic regions (e.g., regions supplied chiefly by one source vs. those experiencing active mixing between multiple sources), and reconstruct basic flow patterns in a large, complex PWSS. Our analysis, based on a Bayesian mixing model framework, uses basic information on the SIW and production volumes of sources but requires no information on pipeline connections in the system. Our work highlights the ability of SIW to analyze PWSS and document aspects of supply system structure and operation that can otherwise be challenging to observe. This method could allow water managers to document spatiotemporal variation in flow patterns within PWSS, validate hydrodynamic model results, track pathways of contaminant propagation, optimize water supply operation, and help monitor and enforce water rights.\n                        </jats:p>"

All authors confirm the fact that the main cause of hypoparathyroidism is a violation of the blood supply of parathyroid glands, as well as their damage or even accidental removal during surgery. Having analyzed the real cases, and based on our own experience, we came to the conclusion that in order to prevent complications, we will need to study the types of blood supply of the parathyroid glands in details. To this end, we have performed 46 unilateral microdissections and X-ray angiography studies of the arterial supply at 23 organocomplexes of the neck. 42 upper and 43 lower parathyroid glands were detected. It has been established that the main feeding vessel of parathyroid glands is the inferior thyroid artery (type I). The association of glands with the inferior thyroid artery was revealed in 71.8% of cases. A mixed variant of blood supply (simultaneously from the superior and inferior thyroid arteries) was revealed in 14.1% cases (type II). Only 10.6% of the gland were fed isolated from the superior thyroid artery (type III). In addition, in 8.7% cases in the preparations there was no inferior thyroid artery. In 3.5% cases, the connections of the lower parathyroid glands with the thyroid arteries were not reliably detected. Most probably, their feeding was provided at the expense of small collaterals from surrounding organs (type VI).</jats:p>"

Severe and prolonged drought events began occurring towards the end and these have continued into the 21st century. This study aims to analyze variations in the moisture supply from the Mediterranean Sea (MDS) during meteorological drought episodes occurring over the CEU region over the last three decades. A total of 51 meteorological drought episodes (22 with summer onsets, and 29 with winter) are identified over the CEU during the period 1980–2015 through the one-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI-1), and their respective indicators, including duration, severity, intensity, and peak values, are then computed. Lagrangian forward-in-time analysis reveals that negative anomalies of moisture coming from the MDS prevail in all episodes except seven. Linear regression analysis between variations in the MDS anomalies and indicators of the drought episodes shows a significant linear relationship between severity, duration, peak values (winter), and MDS anomalies, which implies that drought episodes last longer and are more severe with an increase in the negative anomaly of moisture supply from the MDS. Nevertheless, no linear relationship is found between the intensity and peak values (annual, summer) of drought episodes and anomalies in the moisture contribution from the MDS.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to analyze the performance of organic vegetable supply chains in each member chain to determine the direction of improvement in the fulfillment of consumer needs optimally. The performance of supply chains at the farm level will be differentiated by individuals and commodities. The analytical method used is the Supply Chain Operational Reference (SCOR) model taking into account the internal and external attributes. The primary data used is taken through observation and interview process, meanwhile secondary data obtained from related institutions. The results of measuring the performance of organic vegetable supply chains at all levels of the responsiveness and flexibility attributes have achieved the superior performance position. Meanwhile, the value of organic vegetable supply chain performance on asset attributes at the farm level only reaches a good position. But at the corporate level has reached the best performance position (superior). In general, the performance of the organic vegetable supply chain on the cost attribute still has not achieved good performance. So there is the need for improvement efforts through minimization of cost in each supply chain activity to improve performance.</jats:p>"

Buyers and suppliers in this industry work in collaboration with each other to achieve an optimal supply chain performance. The purpose of this study is to investigate the drivers of supply chain performance in the food retail industry in Gauteng province. These drivers are known as buyer- supplier trust (BST), buyer- supplier commitment (BSC) and supply chain relationship longevity (RL). This study adopted a quantitative method where a questionnaire was used to collect data from 429 food retailers in the Gauteng province. The study used a convenience sampling technique to select respondents. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 24.0 and Smart PLS were used to assist in the data analysis. The results of the research revealed that buyersupplier trust, buyer- supplier commitment and RL have a strong, positive and important impact on supply chain performance. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that to achieve supply chain performance, businessâ€™s operators should develop a significant relationship based on trust, commitment and relationship longevity. Furthermore, the results of this study provide useful insights on how businesses should benefit from trust, commitment and relationship longevity as well as how to improve supply chain performance. Practical and theoretical contributions, implications and recommendations are provided. </jats:p>"

In theory, a number of different contracts can solve this issue and induce first-best investment levels by the supplier. In this study, we investigate the performance of these contracts in a two-tier supply chain. We develop an experimental design where retailers and suppliers bargain over contract terms—and have the ability to make multiple back-and-forth offers—while also providing feedback on the offers they receive. One key result from our study is that an option contract and a service-level agreement are best at increasing first-best investment levels and overall supply chain profits. However, these same contracts also generate the largest inequity in expected profits between the two parties. We find that both of these results are driven by the bargaining tendencies of retailers and suppliers, which we refer to as “superficial fairness.” In particular, retailers and suppliers place more emphasis on negotiating the wholesale price, while partially overlooking any secondary parameter, such that final wholesale prices end up roughly halfway between the retailer’s selling price and the supplier’s production cost. We show that this bargaining behavior contributes to higher investment levels observed in the option contract and service-level agreement, along with the inequitable payoffs.</jats:p><jats:p>The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0654 .</jats:p>",

In a traditional supply chain, the objective of improving energy efficiency is targeted at the level of single parts of the value making chain. Industry 4.0 technologies make it possible to build hyperconnected logistic solutions, where the objective of decreasing energy consumption and economic footprint is targeted at the global level. The problems of energy efficiency are especially relevant in first mile and last mile delivery logistics, where deliveries are composed of individual orders and each order must be picked up and delivered at different locations. Within the frame of this paper, the author describes a real-time scheduling optimization model focusing on energy efficiency of the operation. After a systematic literature review, this paper introduces a mathematical model of last mile delivery problems including scheduling and assignment problems. The objective of the model is to determine the optimal assignment and scheduling for each order so as to minimize energy consumption, which allows to improve energy efficiency. Next, a black hole optimization-based heuristic is described, whose performance is validated with different benchmark functions. The scenario analysis validates the model and evaluates its performance to increase energy efficiency in last mile logistics.</jats:p>"

This power supply configuration represents the concept of the micro-grid system. The research work proposes reliability improvement of the emergency power supply by introducing distributed energy sources and large-scale energy storage systems. The proposed system was modelled with reliability block diagrams and analysed with Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the system’s reliability in terms of loss of power supply probability (LPSP). The analysis takes into consideration, the failure probability of the components combined with the power unavailability due to the intermittent energy sources. The results show that the proposed system reduces the LPSP.</jats:p>",

The basic equations are analyzed relating the heat transfer to the heating system with water temperature in the manifold, the inside air temperature and the characteristics of the heaters, with a review of possible methods of regulating the heat supply near the beginning and the end of the heating period provided taking into account requirements of normative documents of the Russian Federation. Calculations are performed to determine the amount of the main components of the heat balance of a residential building on the example of one of the standard projects used currently in the climatic conditions of Moscow taking into account the constructive structural characteristics of the building and its occupancy level. Analysis of the obtained results and conclusions regarding the appropriateness of the application of this arrangement are provided. It is established that the actual heat output of the heating system when using a chilled water network down-stream the hot water supply heat exchangers as a heat source enables to maintain the safe indoor temperature in the building, with the average daily temperature of outdoor air above +2° C in conditions of moderate amount of heat received with solar radiation. It is shown that the use of this arrangement is virtually not accompanied by additional costs, provides hydraulic resistance of the heating system and gives a system-wide effect in the form of higher electricity generation at thermal consumption when using cogeneration.</jats:p>"

The spirit of the assessment recognizes the importance of studying change in relation to historical dynamics, in addition to critiques of normative rationalism's inability to influence effective change in public policy. The research included interviews with social stakeholders, documentary analysis and direct observation. Three plans elaborated between 1980 and 2015 were studied. The results demonstrate that: (1) the emphasis of normative rationalism contributed to neglecting sanitation services; (2) the principles of intersectorality and social participation are fundamental to evolving from normative rationalism to strategic planning and communication on water supply and sanitation in Belém; (3) a large portion of local stakeholders are contrary to the privatization of sanitation services, while the most technically and economically powerful decision-makers in government defend that the State no longer has sufficient capacity to promote universal service coverage; and (4) a significant portion of civil society in Belém indicated their serious opposition to future scenarios for the water supply and sanitation sector that maintain technocracy in related public policies; however, such perspectives were not considered in the elaboration and implementation processes of government planning.</jats:p>",

In that end, we utilized the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test approach developed by Pesaran et al. (2001) and the granger causality test. The empirical investigation indicates strong evidence of long run relationship among variables in all countries covered by the study except Togo. Oil price and inflation are positively linked in a very large majority of the member countries. There is positive and significant relationship between budget deficit and price level in Burkina Faso and Niger. In addition, our empirical work supports strong evidence that monetary expansion is positively linked with price level in Burkina Faso, Mali and Togo. In short run, the Granger causality demonstrated that budget deficit doesn’t cause money growth in WAEMU countries. It should be mentioned that the oil price has not an impact on inflation in all countries at short term. So, the main finding of this study is that oil price drives up inflation in the WAEMU zone in long term, but not in short time. As policy implication, the study suggests, among others, some improvements in growth policy, trade policy, general tax policy, raw material production, fuel efficiency and diversity.</jats:p>"

Even though supply chain responsiveness is a contemporary issue hardly any research has been done in Sri Lanka on this topic. Supply chain responsiveness is very relevant to the apparel industry, which is accountable for more than half of the industrial exports of Sri Lanka. Firstly, factors influencing the supply chain responsiveness were identified through the literature review, and later a questionnaire survey was conducted among 33 large apparel companies in Sri Lanka. The findings revealed that the supply chain responsiveness is highly correlated to Organizational Factors, Mutual Understanding, Flow of Information and Relationship and Decision Making. However, there is a correlation only when these factors are taken together but not individually except Mutual Understanding. The findings will be useful for managers and policy makers in the apparel industry to improve the responsiveness in their organizations and the industry.</jats:p>"

Oleh karena itu, dengan adanya  penggunaan metode FUZZY TOPSIS untuk memecahkan masalah pemilihan pemasok ini. Metode FUZZY TOPSIS menentukan pemasok yang memiliki kinerja terbaik dengan menggunakan kriteria yang diberikan oleh pengguna. Dengan menggunakan metode ini keputusan pemilihan pemasok dapat melakukan secara otomatis menggunakan sistem IT pada perusahaan masing-masing, sehingga dapat meminimalkan masalah pengguna dari memilih pemasok terbaik. Contoh dari ini adalah proyek oleh Perusahaan Pengolahan Air di Kabupaten Tangerang untuk menemukan pemasok terbaik dalam sistem distribusi air. Untuk pemasok yang DEI, HP, dan KSP dan diberikan criteria pengguna seperti “Commercial by Costumer”, “Technical Proposal”, “Work Plan &amp; methodology”, dan “Staff Competence”. Dengan menggunakan criteria pengguna untuk membuat matriks keputusan sebagai masukan untuk FUZZY TOPSIS. Hasilnya adalah pemasok KSP menunjukkan performa terbaik dengan nilai 0.50078 lebih baik dari pemasok lainnya.Kata Kunci : fuzzy topsis, supply chain, ERP, pemasok.</jats:p>"

Efficient management of water distribution networks involves factoring in water and energy losses as the key criteria for planning pipe renewal. Prioritizing the replacement of a pipe according to the highest value of unit headloss due to ageing does not consider the impact on water and energy consumption for the whole network. Thus, this paper proposes a methodology to prioritize pipe replacement according to water and energy savings per monetary unit invested – economic prioritization. This renewal plan shows different results if comparing with replacing pipelines with regard to age and it requires calculating water and energy audits of the water distribution networks. Moreover, the required time to recover the investment performed needs to be calculated. The methodology proposed in this work is compared with the unit headloss criterion used in a real water-pressurized network. The results demonstrate that using the unit headloss criterion neither water, energy nor the investment is optimized. Significant water and energy savings are not fully exploited.</jats:p>",

The decision variables are selected as the pumping rate to river flow ratio, and the intake operation time to time of non-operation ratio. The model combines the Genetic Algorthim and the Artificial Neural Networks techniques to find the optimum solution. The application indicated that the required number of the randomly generated solutions and the number of cross over process for a stable optimum genetic algorithm solution are (100) and (1) respectively.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reduced oil supply flow rates in fluid film bearings can cause cavitation, or lack of a fully developed hydrodynamic film layer, at the leading edge of the bearing pads. Reduced oil flow has the well-documented effects of higher bearing operating temperatures and decreased power losses; however, little experimental data of its effects on system stability and performance can be found in the literature. This study looks at overall system performance through observed subsynchronous vibration (SSV) patterns of a test rig operating under reduced oil supply flow rates. The test rig was designed to be dynamically similar to a high-speed industrial compressor. It consists of a flexible rotor supported by two tilting pad bearings in vintage, flooded bearing housings. Tests were conducted over a number of supercritical operating speeds and bearing loads, while systematically reducing the oil supply flow rates provided to the bearings. A low amplitude, broadband SSV pattern was observed in the frequency domain. During supercritical operation, a distinctive subsynchronous peak emerged from the broadband pattern at approximately half of the running speed and at the first bending mode of the shaft. Under lightly loaded conditions, the amplitude of the subsynchronous peak increased dramatically with decreasing oil supply flow rate and increasing operating speed. Under an increased load condition, the subsynchronous peak was largely attenuated. A discussion on the possible sources of this SSV including self-excited instability and pad flutter forced vibration is provided with supporting evidence from thermoelastohydrodynamic (TEHD) bearing modeling results.</jats:p>",

However, it has not been known about cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms for cystine-dependency. Cystine dependency of 9 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and 6 breast cancer cell lines was measured using cystine-deprived medium or sulfasalazine, an inhibitor of system xc-. Cultivation with cystine-deficient media significantly reduced the growth in 9 cell lines, moderately in 3 cell lines, but in 2 cell lines including SNU398 cells. Sulfasalazine dose-dependently decreased the growth of cystine-dependent cell lines, which was prevented by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol which reduces cystine to be shuttled via L-type transporter system. To identify regulatory mechanisms to render cells to be less dependent on extracellular cystine, siRNA kinase library was screened in SNU387 cells. The siRNAs to decrease viability of SNU387 cells in cystine-deficient media were identified. These research suggest cellular heterogeneity for the dependency on extracellular L-cystine and the kinase which may support cysteine supply in the absence of extracellular cystine could be a potential candidate for targeting cysteine metabolism.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Do Hyung Kim, Seung Jin Lee.

Based on entropy theory and dynamic theory, we analyze and simulate the influences of decision variables and parameters on the stability and entropy of asymmetric dual-channel supply chain systems using bifurcation, entropy diagram, the parameter plot basin, attractor, etc. The results show that decision variables and parameters have great impacts on the stability of asymmetric dual-channel supply chains; the supply chain system will enter chaos through flip bifurcation or Neimark–Sacker bifurcation with the increase of the system entropy, and thus the system is more complex and falls into a chaotic state, with its entropy increased. The stability of the system can become robust with the increase of the probability that product a becomes a probabilistic product, and it weakens with the increase of the risk preference of customers for probabilistic products and the relative bargaining power of the retailer. A manufacturer using the direct selling channel may obtain greater profit than one using traditional selling channels. Using the method of parameter adjustment and feedback control, the entropy of the supply chain system will decline, and the supply chain system will fall into a stable state. Therefore, in the actual market of probabilistic selling, the manufacturers and retailers should pay attention to the parameters and adjustment speed of prices and ensure the stability of the game process and the orderliness of the dual-channel supply chain.</jats:p>"

The chronic nature of the disease makes the lifetime cost of the treatment exorbitantly high. The medicine cost contributes a major size of expense in diabetes management. To make healthcare available to poorest of the poor, it is imperative to control the rising cost of diabetes treatment. The earlier research works done in this area focuses more on inventory management techniques to control the cost of healthcare. Less interest is shown in the role of better supply chain partnership (SCP) in reducing the cost of procurement of medicine. The purpose of this paper is to develop and use the SCP assessment framework for a diabetes clinic.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The sediment budget associated with future coastline change in the vicinity of tidal inlets consists of four components; sea level rise-driven landward movement of the coastline (i.e., the Bruun effect), basin infilling effect due to sea level rise-induced increase in accommodation space, basin volume change due to variation in river discharge, and coastline change caused by change in fluvial sediment supply. These four components are affected by climate change and/or anthropogenic impacts. Despite this understanding, holistic modelling techniques that account for all the aforementioned processes under both climate change and anthropogenic influences are lacking. This manuscript presents the applications of a newly-developed reduced complexity modelling approach that accounts for both climate change and anthropogenically-driven impacts on future coastline changes. Modelled results corresponding to the year 2100 indicate considerable coastline recessions at Wilson Inlet (152 m) and the Swan River system (168 m) in Australia and Tu Hien Inlet (305 m) and Thuan An Inlet (148 m) in Vietnam. These results demonstrate that coastline models should incorporate both climate change and anthropogenic impacts to quantify future changes in fluvial sediment supply to coasts to achieve better estimates of total coastline changes at tidal inlets. Omission of these impacts is one of the major drawbacks in all the existing coastline models that simulate future coastline changes at tidal inlets. A comparison of these modelled future coastline changes with the predictions made by a relevant existing modelling technique (Scale Aggregated Model for Inlet-interrupted Coasts (SMIC)) indicates that the latter method overestimates total coastline recessions at the Swan River system, and the Tu Hien and Thuan An Inlets by 7%, 10%, and 30%, respectively, underlining the significance of integrating both climate change and anthropogenic impacts to assess future coastline changes at tidal inlets.</jats:p>"

This paper deals with the prioritization of critical sustainability criteria and the sustainability strategy selection (SSS) using an integrated weighting approach. This approach consists of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the subjective and objective weight integrated approach (SOWIA) and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and is found to be effective for solving this multi‐criteria decision‐making problem. The proposed methodology is applied to solve a real‐time supply chain decision‐making issue of an Indian manufacturing industry. From a sustainability perspective, the results indicate the second strategy set as the best among the given alternatives, with an objective factor of 0.5. The robustness of the results has been analysed to identify the uncertainty in the final ranking. The consistency of the final ranking has been evaluated based on different objective factor values. The novelty of this paper pertains to addressing the most relevant SSS problem involved in a manufacturing supply chain and in establishing a hybrid approach for solving it. This approach offers a flexible provision for decision‐makers to incorporate the appropriate level of subjectivity and objectivity into their decisions based on their degree of expertise. This study is unique and carries a high originality value, as it offers a new structured and flexible approach to solving the SSS problem.</jats:p>",

Thus, formation of a supply chain model including multiple buyers and variable production rate is more acceptable than assuming a single-buyer with constant production rate model. This paper considers a supply chain network, where a single-vendor manufactures products in a batch production process and supplies them to a set of buyers over multiple times. Instead of assuming a fixed production rate, as commonly used in the literature, a variable production rate is introduced by the vendor and the production cost of the vendor is treated as a function of production rate. The continuous review inventory model is applied for multiple buyers to inspect inventory levels and a crashing cost is incurred by all buyers to reduce their lead times. The lead time demand follows a normal distribution. The unsatisfied demands at the buyers end are partially backordered. A model is formulated to minimize the joint expected cost of the vendor-buyers supply chain system. A classical optimization technique is utilized to solve the model. An improved algorithm is developed to obtain the numerical solution of the model. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the model.</jats:p>",

We model the phenomenon as a sequential move game with asymmetric information. Absent behavioral considerations, the unique Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium implies zero investment. However, with social preferences, the hold-up problem may be mitigated. We propose a model that incorporates social preferences and random errors, and solve for the equilibrium. In addition, we look at reputation and find it to be effective for increasing investment. We conduct laboratory experiments with human subjects and find that a model with social preferences and random errors organizes our data well.</jats:p>",

However, how to achieve the sustainable and stable improvement of the enterprise synergy innovation in a supply chain cooperative network is a common topic of research. Based on a survey of 236 enterprises in 53 supply chain cooperative networks, this study found: (1) Integrative leadership has a positive impact on the enterprise synergy innovation performance in a supply chain cooperative network; (2) Knowledge integration and network relationship embeddedness play partial mediating roles between integrative leadership and the enterprise synergy innovation performance, respectively; (3) Knowledge integration and network relationship embeddedness play a sequenced mediating role between integrative leadership and the enterprise synergy innovation performance; (4) The partial mediation role of knowledge integration and network relationship embeddedness are of no significant difference; however, their single mediating roles are greater than that of the sequenced mediating role of knowledge integration and network relationship embeddedness. This paper further emphasizes the key role of the core organization leadership in a cooperative network and discusses its functional route, which is of great importance in developing the theory system of leadership and providing guidance for the cooperation of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

That is to say, brand reputation, other brands’ involvement in the final product and emotional appeal were the most distinguishing characteristics identifying emotion-oriented customers. In this sense, companies serving such customers adjusted their SC strategies to channel a direct emotional impact. It was noticed that personalization was pivotal and companies were increasingly required to customize and create unique products to attract and further satisfy the customers. Thus, multiple sourcing strategies were often employed with an increasing number of suppliers to ensure that increasing material supply need would be met. As for performance-oriented companies, cost, quality and innovation capabilities emerged as key signals to be embedded in operations management. Companies serving performance-oriented customers were characterized by low product value and medium level of customization, and kept their core activities, including design and architecture, vertically integrated. In order to generate cost advantages without compromising product quality, single sourcing strategy was largely implemented. What the findings suggested is that the customization level and the product value were positively correlated. To illustrate, companies having more exclusive products were found allowing their customization and customer involvement in higher degrees.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Due to a relatively unexplored nature of the phenomenon, this study opted for a method by which individual and collective reconstructions were explored in a not well-investigated area, that is, the luxury yacht industry.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>In some industries (e.g., semiconductors, electronics, and agribusiness), buyers place noncommitted orders (called soft orders) to manufacturers in an effort to guide the manufacturer's production decisions. After the buyers know their own demand, they place purchase orders (called firm orders). These orders are often placed very close to the production start time or even after the production start time so that it is not possible for the manufacturer to revise its production schedule. The discrepancies between the soft order and the firm order often result in high excess inventories at the manufacturer. Without any commitment related to the soft orders by the buyers and the production by the manufacturer, the soft orders are often not effective. We hence propose a penalty contract, through which the buyers pay a penalty for canceling some portion of their soft orders. This contract can perfectly coordinate the decentralized supply chain of one manufacturer and multiple buyers and can lead to Pareto improvement in profits relative to the wholesale price contract for all firms in the supply chain. Our results indicate that it is more likely for the contract to achieve coordination and Pareto improvement when the manufacturer allocates the supply in proportion to the firm orders than when it allocates the supply according to the soft orders. We also illustrate the contract by using the data from a leading manufacturer in the industry.</jats:p>",

The system consists of a membrane filtration process with appropriate pretreatments, including coagulation, pre-chlorination, and anion exchange (IE) process. The results of the pilot-scale experiments revealed that the hybrid system can produce treated water with color of around 5 Pt-Co, dissolved manganese concentration of no more than 0.05 mg/L, and a silt density index (SDI) of no more than 5 when sufficient coagulant and sodium hypochlorite were dosed. Although the IE process effectively reduced the color of the water, a moderate increase in the color of the IE effluent was observed when there was a significant increase in the color of the raw water. This resulted in a severe membrane fouling, which was likely to be attributed to the excess production of inorganic sludge associated with the increased coagulant dosage required to achieve sufficient reduction of color. Such severe membrane fouling can be controlled by optimising the backwashing and relaxation frequencies during the membrane filtration. These results indicate that the hybrid system proposed is a suitable technology for treating highly-colored surface water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>On November 27, 2013, President Obama signed into law the Drug Quality Security Act (DQSA). Title II of the DQSA, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), replaces all existing or future state-wide drug track or trace systems with a new federal drug tracing program that uses pedigrees and product identifiers for verification of the drugs being accepted by the buyer. While the full implementation of the DSCSA is projected to take about ten years from its enactment, both the implementation framework and milestones of the new federal tracing program have been carefully laid out. In this essay, we will explore the current state of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain and the imperatives behind the DSCSA. At the crux of this essay is an analysis of the DSCSA implementation plan, its challenges according to feedback from stakeholders, and its potential effectiveness against the entrance of substandard and counterfeit drugs into the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nTopic: Student Project&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Patients were grouped according to the duration of insulin supply: 30 days, 90 days, and a combination of both 30 day and 90 day prescriptions. Generalized estimating equations which account for repeated measures within patients were used, with robust estimates of variance. Prescription duration was regressed on HbA1c (dependent variable) with alpha=0.(2-tailed). There were 16,725 eligible patients (9362 with 30-day, 1280 with 90-day, and 6083 with both 30- and 90-day prescriptions). The mean number of HbA1c tests/patient was 3.1. Patients who used 30-day prescriptions had HbA1c values that were 0.65 greater than those with 90-day prescriptions (p&amp;lt;0.001). Patients who used a combination of 30-day and 90-day prescriptions had HbA1c values that were 0.37 greater compared to 90-day prescriptions (p&amp;lt;0.001). The predicted HbA1c values were 8.33% (95% CI: 8.31%, 8.36%) for 30-day, 8.05% (95% CI: 8.03%, 8.08%) for the combination, and 7.69% (95% CI: 7.64%, 7.73%) for 90-day prescriptions. Results were similar when stratified by age. For those &amp;lt;20 years of age, the predicted HbA1c values were 8.95% for 30-day, 8.71% for the combination, and 8.33% for 90-day prescriptions. For those ≥20 years of age, the results were 8.26%, 7.96% and 7.64%, respectively. Patterns were similar when stratified by sex. Mailed prescriptions were also associated with lower HbA1c (p&amp;lt;0.001). Predicted HbA1c was 7.58% (95% CI: 7.53%, 7.63%) when all prescriptions were mailed and 8.21% (95% CI: 8.19%, 8.23%) when not. After simultaneous adjustment for age, sex, duration of supply, and mailed status, both 90-day prescriptions and mailed prescriptions were associated with lower HbA1c values (p&amp;lt;0.001 for both). In patients with type 1 diabetes, 90-day insulin prescriptions and mailed prescriptions were both independently associated with lower HbA1c values.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosure</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>M.A.M.

Bed materials from iron and manganese removal filters (FeRF, MnRF) as well as a catalytic bed (G1) were investigated. The reference material was MnO2-coated quartz sand (MnQS). The efficiency of Ni(II) sorption was investigated as a function of pH. It was found that the naturally formed coating on FeRF was characterised by the highest sorption efficiency (80–88%) in the wide pH range (4–9) of the solution. Sorption on MnRF was weaker (35–45%). G1 and MnQS, which contained only manganese oxides, were characterised by a very low sorption efficiency of 0–6% and 3–8%, respectively. A lower Ni(II) removal efficiency was observed at an initial pH close to the pHpzc values. During Ni(II) sorption, the pH of the solution was not constant and tended towards the value of pHpzc for all tested materials. The slightly pH-dependent sorption of Ni(II) indicates that its removal depends more on the chemical composition and the specific surface area of the oxide coatings covering the bed materials.</jats:p>",

Under plausible conditions, capital accumulation raises the marginal product of labor and hence the female wage rate. Unless the economy is trapped in a lower equilibrium, the fertility rate starts to decline at a certain level of the female wage rate and then turns upward at a higher wage level, presenting a fertility rebound. For such fertility rebounds to appear without policy intervention, the availability of external child care at high female wage rates is crucially important. The external child‐care price must be lower at high female wage rates. Otherwise the fertility rate might continue to decline.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ocean energy holds out great potential for supplying remote maritime areas with their energy requirements, where the grid size is often small and unconnected to a continental grid. Thanks to their high maturity and competitive price, solar and wind energies are currently the most used to provide electrical energy. However, their intermittency and variability limit the power supply reliability. To solve this drawback, storage systems and Diesel generators are often used. Otherwise, among all marine renewable energies, tidal and wave energies are reaching an interesting technical level of maturity. The better predictability of these sources makes them more reliable than other alternatives. Thus, combining different renewable energy sources would reduce the intermittency and variability of the total production and so diminish the storage and genset requirements. To foster marine energy integration and new multisource system development, an up-to-date review of projects already carried out in this field is proposed. This article first presents the main characteristics of the different sources which can provide electrical energy in remote maritime areas: solar, wind, tidal, and wave energies. Then, a review of multi-source systems based on marine energies is presented, concerning not only industrial projects but also concepts and research work. Finally, the main advantages and limits are discussed.</jats:p>"

The properties of the bulk natural organic matter (NOM) and the DBP precursor content of that NOM are unique to each source. Knowledge about the relative importance of these three sources would be valuable in understanding the natural variability in DBP precursor occurrence and in managing source waters for the purpose of minimizing DBP precursors. In this study, we used temporal and spatial water quality data from a drinking water reservoir to shed light on autochthonous and benthic sources of NOM and DBP precursors. The Cannonsville Reservoir (New York) was chosen for this work because of its well‐documented water quality. To assist in the data analysis, we developed a series of two‐dimensional contour plots that bring clarity to benthic and near‐surface (algal) processes on water quality. Combining conventional water quality parameters with DBP precursor analysis can facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of limnological factors that define DBP precursor levels. These data were compared with known properties of NOM and related natural biochemical parameters. From this analysis, we conclude that algal‐dominated NOM contributes disproportionately to dihaloacetonitrile formation, whereas watershed‐dominated NOM is especially rich in trihaloacetic acid and trihalomethane precursors as well as ultraviolet‐absorbing substances. The sediment‐dominated precursor behaved like a mix of the other two but most resembled the watershed NOM.</jats:p>",

The retailer orders the product from the manufacturer prior to the beginning of the selling periods. We consider two types of customers: (1) strategic customers who take their future options into account and time their purchases accordingly and (2) myopic customers who consider only their current options. We compare the resulting equilibria for these two scenarios and evaluate the impact of customers’ strategic behavior. We find that strategic customer behavior always benefits the manufacturer. Interestingly, it may also improve the profitability of the retailer and the entire supply chain in some cases. Strategic customer behavior and decentralization are often regarded as detriments to supply chain performance. We find that, however, the combination of these two factors may not result in the worst supply chain performance. When customers are sufficiently patient, a decentralized supply chain that faces strategic customers actually outperforms the supply chain with only one of those factors at play. Finally, we show that when customers are strategic, the retailer’s and manufacturer’s profits with price commitment, availability commitment, or quick response can be lower than those when customers are myopic. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0651 . </jats:p>",

For identification, we exploit partially overlapping peer groups. Using Norwegian administrative data, we find positive and statistically significant family peer effects, but only on the intensive margin of women's labor supply. These are in part driven by concerns about time allocation from early childhood and concerns about earnings from age five. (JEL J12, J16, J24, J31) </jats:p>",

Suppliers and customers that are in linked, close supply chain relationships have higher short interest on average. Further, higher short interest increases the likelihood of large, linked customers reporting negative earnings surprises, whereas suppliers with high short interest are more likely to report negative earnings surprises, irrespective of the supply chain structure. Short selling is informative to capital markets because these suboptimal relationships eventually lead to dependent suppliers being delisted from a stock exchange for financial distress reasons.</jats:p>",

The material for the study was obtained from cadaveric dissections. We dissected 50 human ankles observing different types of arterial blood supply. Our classification system is based on the vascular variations of the anterior aspect of tibiofibular syndesmosis and corresponds with vascular density. According to our study the mean vascular density of tibiofibular syndesmosis is relatively low (4.4%) and depends on the type of blood supply. The highest density was observed among ankles with complete vasculature and the lowest when lateral anterior malleolar artery was absent (5.8% vs. 3.5%, respectively). Awareness of various types of tibiofibular syndesmosis arterial blood supply is essential for orthopedic surgeons who operate in the ankle region and radiologists for the anatomic evaluation of this area. Knowledge about possible variations along with relatively low density of vessels may contribute to modification of treatment approach by the increase of the recommended time of syndesmotic screw stabilization in order to prevent healing complications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The reliable and stable operation of power apparatus is important for the development of GIS. It is important to utilize condition monitoring technologies and anticipate possible failures in advance. Many papers have been published about the partial discharge detection with UHF or X-ray in laboratory, but seldom in field application. Thus, many engineers at project sites are not familiar with the current professional diagnosis techniques. Recently, during the GIS routine data analysis obtained by partial discharge online monitoring system, it was found that the UHF monitoring signals’ developing trend of the 220 kV GIS No. 2 high-voltage side of transformer in phase C at an actual station was abnormal and needed further detection. In order to precisely investigate the problem and then guide the operation and maintenance activities, a series of professional diagnoses were conducted. Three new types of partial discharge detection and positioning methods were applied for accuracy, including UHF partial discharge detection based on multi-stage amplified signal demodulation and multiple weighted averages processing; the partial discharge detection based on the signal radiation hole of insulation disk at the ground connection; and the positioning method based on UHF-SHF. After a series of troubleshooting works, the partial discharge defects have been diagnosed, and the case can be referred in the field monitoring of GIS.</jats:p>"

One alternative here is the evaporation of rainwater, which reduces hydraulic loads on sewers. Rainwater evapotranspiration using helophyte mats on building roofs is a possible approach. Helophytes are able to transpire considerably more rainwater than extensively planted green roofs. Other than conventional green roofs helophyte mats in the form of wetland roofs require a permanent water supply on a daily basis. Greywater application can be an additional advantage in terms of nutrient supply of the wetland roof after being treated microbiologically within the plant carrier mat. The treatment of greywater using a helophyte-planted roof can help to meet the water and nutrient requirements of the helophytes even during rain-free periods. However, it must be ensured that the root mat treats the greywater to a sufficient extent. It was shown under practical conditions that a 0.1 m-thick helophyte mat is suitable for treating typical domestic greywater at loads of up to 15 L m−2 d−1.</jats:p>",

At this juncture, the main point is to bring required resources together in the right place and at the right time. Otherwise, health-care institutions cannot serve the affected people because of the non-availability of supply. To achieve it, public health-care institutions should give more importance to the SC principles.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Success in SC flexibility in health care can directly affect patient welfare.

However, it was determined that less attention has been given to understanding patient satisfaction as a result of SC operations. The results indicate that patient responsiveness improvement should be included into strategic plans, and SC efforts should be used as a means of satisfying patient needs quickly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the mentioned relationships at public hospitals. Findings of this paper will have a significant contribution for researchers and health-care professionals in understanding the impact of SC to patient responsiveness.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) of type 316L austenitic stainless steel powder has been an established manufacturing practice for more than twenty five years within the oil and gas sectors and more recently in the naval defence industry. The successful ASME Code Case approval (N-834) has facilitated the manufacture of 316L components via Powder Metallurgy HIP (PM/HIP) for the civil nuclear sector. However, a number of issues have tended to hinder the uptake of PM/HIP as an alternative viable manufacturing route for both castings and forgings.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Firstly, the powder specification for 316L and HIP processing parameters has typically been left to the discretion of the manufacturers. As such, the finer details of HIP product specification require greater clarity and definition for optimum performance/reproducibility. Secondly, comparison of historical data for 316L PM/HIP has shown variation in the Charpy impact toughness performance. These differences have been attributed to the oxygen content of the atomised powder, with greater oxygen contents yielding product with reduced impact properties.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Based on these factors, a systematic study of the current state of the art of 316L commercial powder production, encapsulation/consolidation and selected HIP parameters was undertaken in collaboration with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). A 316L powder specification was developed that primarily limited the oxygen content of the powder to under 130ppm. This lower oxygen limit reflects the improvements that commercial powder suppliers have been making over the past decade to ensure greater powder cleanliness.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The test programme generated a significant body of test data based on 3 × 3 × 3 matrix of: powder supply, HIP service provider and HIP sustain times. The results were excellent across the full range of variables studied with all test billets passing the specification requirements of ASTM A988 and additional imposed requirements.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Very consistent 316L material properties were produced for billets manufactured via differing HIP service providers across the comprehensive destructive test programme. This demonstrates the robustness and uniformity of the PM/HIP supply chain in producing 316L material of the requisite quality. In addition, no significant difference in material properties was noted for material pressed between 2–8 hours hold time, suggesting that the HIP process window is large with respect to hold time.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Of significant note was that material produced with one powder yielded material with consistently the highest strengths and Charpy impact toughness. This has been attributed to chemical composition of the powder, which featured both a low oxygen and also a high nitrogen content.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper studies supply chain model for imperfect quality items under which unit price and unit marketing expenditure imposed by the buyer, regulates the demand of the item. It is presumed that with the accustomed supply chain model, all produced items are of good quality, coincidentally, it engrosses some percentage of defective items. Thus, inspection process becomes essential for the buyer to segregate the defective items, which are then sold at discounted price at the end of the screening process. In this paper, a supply chain model is ensued to substantiate the interaction and democracy of the participants in the supply chain, the buyer and seller, is pitched by non-cooperative and cooperative game theoretical approaches. In the non-cooperative method, the Stackelberg game approach is used in which one player behaves as a leader and another one as a follower. The co-operative game approach is based on a Pareto efficient solution concept, in which both the players work together to enhance their profit. Lastly, to demonstrate the significance of the theory of the paper, numerical examples including sensitivity analysis are presented.</jats:p>",

The plantation was prepared on 28 May, 2015 with about 10 cm high transplants. The soil surface was mulched with wooden chips (5 cm layer). The aim was to evaluate the environmentally friendly fertilizers (Dudarit - 150 g m-2, Sprintalga – 0.04% concentration four times 200 mL per plant). During the vegetation period pruning was applied at 30 cm plant height at the 4th double leaf from the soil surface and two cuttings (13 Aug and 29 Sept). By evaluating the effect of treatment on the leaf surface and chlorophyll content, statistically significant results were not found. Higher SPAD (relative chlorophyll content) value was measured in the middle of the growing period compared to the end of the vegetation when the plants were older and the temperature started to decrease. The positive effect of Dudarit and Sprintalga was clear on the plant height and biomass production. The dried herb yield was higher (4 kg m-2) on treated plots comparing to control (3 kg m-2). Although increased photosynthetic intensity was not detected on treated plots, the plantation showed greater vitality and side shoot improvement to control plots. Under our circumstances, the environmentally friendly fertilization (Dudarit and Sprintalga) has increased the dried leaves yield with 20% by similar stevioside and rebaudioside-A content.</jats:p>"

These models predict that species will need to disperse to higher altitudes to persist in a warmer world. However, thermal stress and, thus, thermoregulatory behavior may depend on atmospheric oxygen as well as environmental temperatures. Severe hypoxia causes animals to prefer lower body temperatures, which could be interpreted as evidence that oxygen supply limits heat tolerance. Such a constraint could prevent animals from successfully dispersing to high elevations during climate change. Still, an effect of oxygen supply on preferred body temperature has only been observed when oxygen concentrations fall far below levels experienced in nature. To see whether animals perceive greater thermal stress at an ecologically relevant level of hypoxia, we studied the thermoregulatory behavior of lizards (<jats:italic>Sceloporus tristichus</jats:italic>) exposed to oxygen concentrations of 13% and 21% (equivalent to PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> at 4000 m and 0 m, respectively). In addition, we exposed lizards to 29% oxygen to see whether they would accept a higher body temperature at hyperoxia than at normoxia. At each oxygen level, we measured a behavioral response to heat stress known as the voluntary thermal maximum: the temperature at which a warming animal sought a cool refuge. Oxygen concentration had no discernable effect on the voluntary thermal maximum, suggesting that lizards experience thermal stress similarly at all 3 levels of oxygen (13%, 12% and 29%). Future research should focus on thermoregulatory behaviors under ecologically relevant levels of hypoxia.</jats:p>",

Although affording the setup cost of facilities requires a huge financial investment, a meticulous planning to recoup it has been neglected by an overwhelming majority of previous studies. To fill this gap, an economical investment plan of facilities is determined by striking a trade‐off between the contribution of the stockholders’ capital and the loan arrangement. In the context of a multiperiod three‐echelon SCS, the model also determines the optimum location of plants and the best supply and distribution patterns. The model maximizes the fill rate and the net present value of the periodic cash flow including the sale revenues minus the mortgage payment, purchase, and transportation costs. To solve the proposed problem, a finely tuned Pareto‐based nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA‐II) and a multi‐objective biogeography‐based optimization (MOBBO) algorithm are employed. Moreover, the solution methods are equipped with the heuristic DROP approach and data envelopment analysis to expedite the convergence process and derive the most efficient solutions, respectively. The experiments indicate the adequacy of the solution methods due to the close proximity to the results of the exact branch‐and‐bound method via the general algebraic modeling system optimization software. Finally, the results of a case study associated with designing SCS of an emerging biofuel industry demonstrate the significant implication of the research.</jats:p>",

It also reflects complete control scheme of grid-side converter, which makes it easier to analyze unstable phenomena mentioned above. Moreover, this paper improves the impedance modeling of the network by taking the network impedance and admittance into detailed consideration. In addition, based on the proposed train-network model, the 3D figure and zero-pole diagram are also presented for the analysis of the stability of the integral system.

Как следствие, возникает проблема и для питьевой воды. В работе приводится процесс подготовки данных о параметрах исходной воды, забираемой из водохранилища, которые ежемесячно (с 2002 по 2014 год) учитывались на предприятии при дезодорации воды. Приведенные параметры оказывают существенное влияние на органолептические свойства конечной воды. Подготовка данных для анализа проводится методом главных компонент К. Пирсона. Данные, полученные в пространстве R9, переводятся в пространство меньшей размерности R3. Понижение размерности позволяет снизить автокорреляцию между компонентами.

It was shown that arsenate can be adsorbed more strongly than antimonate. Such multiple adsorption/desorption cycles showed that the CF-Fe sample had approximately 96% of the first antimonate adsorption at the seventh cycle.

Plant root simulator (PRS) probes can be used to examine nutrient availability during phytoremediation, but their use under wetland conditions is limited. This study examined nutrient availability using PRS probes during phytoremediation of biosolids vegetated with cattail. The probes were buried in the sediment for seven sequential 2‐wk burial periods beginning in June 2014. Plants were harvested to determine biomass yield and nutrient content. Nitrogen supply rate did not change significantly with sampling period in June and July (4.5 to 5.9 μg cm<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup> [2 wk]<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>) but increased thereafter to 11.8 μg cm<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup> (2 wk)<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. Phosphate supply rate (20.5 to 24.2 μg cm<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup> [2 wk]<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>) did not differ significantly among sampling times. Cumulative supply rates of the macronutrients N, P, K, Ca and Mg (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0.77–0.92) and the micronutrients B, Fe, and Mn (r = 0.7–0.81) were highly correlated with cattail uptake, while the correlation was weaker for Cu (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0.42) and Zn (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0.40). Maximum attainable biomass yield (0.87 kg m<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup>) coincided with the period of maximum nutrient uptake, indicating that harvesting cattail between late August and early September maximizes nutrient removal.

The modified ceramic membranes showed NF membrane performance with around 1,000 Da molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) and 58% CaCl2 rejection. The removal efficiencies of uranium species by these successfully modified ceramic NF membranes exhibited differences depending on the pH conditions (pH 5.0, 7.4, and 10.0), and achieved the highest rejection of 91% at pH 7.4. This behavior is due to the dominant aqueous species of uranium in pH 7.4, (UO2)2CO3(OH3)−, which has the largest molecular weight among the conditions and the negatively charged species having electrostatic attraction to the positively charged ceramic NF membranes. The ceramic NF membrane prepared here is expected to be feasible in the advanced water treatment process to remove radioactive compounds.</jats:p>",

However, in Lebanon like in most developing countries, the majority of blood donations still come from family/replacement donors (around 75%) followed by voluntary donors for only 15%; compensated donors yet account for 10% of blood donations. Lebanon has a decentralized and fragmented blood supply system where private health care facilities predominate over the public system; thus, numerous challenges and roadblocks—that are discussed in this article—are likely to delay the fulfillment of the WHO resolution. By properly addressing (and resolving) those caveats, it should be expected that Lebanon can forecast achieving (or at least getting close to) 100% voluntary nonremunerated blood donation within the next decade.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, the energy demand and supply situation in the Republic of Korea (ROK) has been largely affected by the fluctuations in the energy markets around the world. Such a situation has provided a basis for requiring improvements to power plant facilities. The automatic generator voltage control systems in large-scale power plants are adopting a rapid-response static excitation method to improve the transient stability. A domestic commercially developed large-scale triple-redundant excitation system is currently operated by the 1000 MW-class nuclear power plant and its efficiency has been verified at the same site. However, such a system is too costly for smaller power plants so that a reliable and low-cost redundant digital excitation control system was developed and introduced in this study to resolve the cost problem. The system has improved its stability and reliability at the same time through double (redundant) configuration. Additionally, the system’s performance was put to the test by conducting a series of control function tests after applying it to the gas turbine used in a thermal power station. This study includes the development of system hardware, simulations as well as on-site experiments and each element was validated as a result. Also, the study discusses and validates the method used for replacing the protective relays at the Kanudi power plant operating in Papua New Guinea. The replacement of 27 and 81 protective relays at the existing power plant was carried out as they did not function properly. New relays were installed after removing the power supply in the existing panel. The individual power output sections of new relays were connected in parallel with the existing properly functioning relays, as previous protective relays had only allowed monitoring without outputting the contents. Thus, the new protective system was designed to enable both existing and new relays to carry out the detection function. It was validated that the replacement was successful. The new system with the new relays is performing properly by protecting its power generator and preventing further accidents.</jats:p>"

At these elections, voters faced a choice between two broad blocs: parties that accepted the “liberal-orthodox” model of post-communist politics, and those that rejected this model and the political elites associated with its implementation. I find that there is a coherent set of populist attitudes among the Polish electorate, and that it correlates with economic and cultural attitudes in ways consistent with the supply-side divide between liberal and anti-liberal parties. Analysis of the individual and combined impact of these attitudes on voting behaviour reveals that populism plays a significant role both in structuring the sentiments of voters towards particular kinds of political parties and in determining how they cast their vote. </jats:p>",

The phenomenon in which the variation of upstream members' orders is amplified than the variation of downstream members' demands in the supply chain is called the bullwhip effect (BWEF). Most of existing research studies did not realize the demand dependency of market demands. Thus, this research focused on the study of the influence of the demand correlation coefficient between two market groups on the BWEF. The incoming demand processes are assumed the separate first-order moving-average, [MA(1)] demand patterns. The scope of the supply chain structure used in this research is composed of one manufacturer and two distribution centers.

As part of its decision-making process, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) evaluated the occurrence of perchlorate in public drinking water by sampling public water systems (PWSs) as part of the first implementation of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 1) between 2001 and 2005. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the current representativeness of the UCMR 1 dataset. To achieve this objective, publicly available sources were searched to obtain updated perchlorate data for the majority of large PWSs with perchlorate detections under UCMR 1. Comparison of the updated and UCMR 1 perchlorate datasets shows that the UCMR 1 dataset is no longer representative because the extent and degree of occurrence has decreased since implementation of UCMR 1. Given this finding, it seems appropriate for regulatory bodies engaged in decision-making processes over several years to periodically re-evaluate the conditions that prompted the regulatory effort, thereby ensuring that rules and regulations address actual conditions of concern.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>e-Business technology adoption within the Ghanaian construction context has been described as   abysmal,   particularly   among   Ghanaian   construction   micro   and   small   businesses   (GCMSBs).  Elucidating  the  salience  of  e-business  technology  in  engendering  construction  procurement improvement, this study focuses on the development of capability within GCMSBs to  engage  with,  and  benefit  from,  the  adoption  of  such  technologies.  The  study  adopts  a  qualitative  multi-case  study  research  design.  Consequently,  three  (3)  projects  were  selected  based on pre-determined case selection criteria.  Forty-five (45) interviewees were recruited from  the  projects  and  government  agencies  in  a  manner  suggestive  of  purposive  sampling.  Excerpts  from  the  interview  sessions  were  transcribed  and  subsequently,  analysed  through  thematic analysis. Findings confirmed that the absorptive capability of GCMSBs were indeed at  a  low  level  due  to  inadequate  training  and  education,  and;  non-investment  in  capability  development. A conceptual model to facilitate the adoption process in GCMSBs was proposed. These  findings,  as  epitomized  in  the  conceptual  framework,  contribute  to  the  burgeoning  discourse on the development of innovative capabilities within Micro and Small businesses in the  construction  industry  in  developing  economies.  Furthermore,  this  study  highlights  the  positive influence of the adoption of e-business technologies on the capacity and capability of GCSMBs. Such improvements on the part of these firms through the framework will translate into  optimal  working  relationships  between  them  and  foreign  construction  firms  working  within the local Ghanaian context. And, through such relationships, foster growth within these GCSMBs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current paper presents a structural equation model with four variables (Government, Infrastructure, Proximity to market, and supply chain Agility) affecting the Financial performance of a company. Six hypotheses or relationships among variables are proposed, supposing that Government and market Proximity are key elements to achieve a greater Agility in supply chains, considering the regional Infrastructure to determine the impact on Financial performance in manufacturing companies. The model is validated with data from a survey applied to 225 persons in 65 manufacturing companies located in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. The model is evaluated using partial least squares, and the findings indicate that there is a direct and positive effect from the Government on regional Infrastructure with a rate of 0.436. When the Government supports the availability of land, energy resources, transportation, telecommunications, mobile telephones, and other services, a positive change is achieved in the Infrastructure and supply chain Agility. Furthermore, the Government also has a direct and positive effect on the market Proximity at a rate of 0.171; consequently, the regional Infrastructure also has an effect on it. Similarly, the market Proximity directly and positively influences the supply chain Agility, as well as a company’s Financial performance at a rate of 0.506.</jats:p>"

This study aims at evaluating changes in the risk of the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms and advancing the understanding of how nitrogen and phosphorus affect the growth of cyanobacteria in a eutrophic lake, Lake Vombsjön, in southern Sweden. Our results show that TP (total phosphorus) has stronger positive correlation with cyanobacteria biomass than DIP (dissolved inorganic phosphorus); DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) has a stronger negative correlation with cyanobacteria biomass than TN (total nitrogen); and DIN:TP has a stronger negative correlation with cyanobacteria biomass than TN:TP. The highest amount of cyanobacteria biomass, above WHO (World Health Organization) Alert Level 2 (10 mm3/L) for drinking water correspond to the DIP/TP ratio below 10. To diminish the growth of cyanobacteria in Lake Vombsjön, TP and DIN control should be in focus, preferably a TP below 20 µg/L, and the DIN:TP ratio should be maintained at a level of at least above 10, but preferably above 50, thereby reducing the likelihood for a nitrogen limiting situation which may favor cyanobacteria dominating blooms.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Potassium (K) is an essential macronutrient for maintaining crop productivity, but the economic benefit of K fertilizer often has been neglected. We collected a database from 60 maize field experimental sites in Northeast China between 2005 and 2012 to study the impacts of potassium (K) application rates on yield, K concentrations in grain and straw, plant K uptake, and to evaluate the economic optimum K rate (EOKR) for maize under different levels of soil indigenous K supply (IKS). The results showed that the average maize yield in Krec treatment (the recommended K rate) was highest and was 32.1% higher than that in K0 treatment (no K fertilization). Compared to K0, the application of K did not significantly increase grain K concentration, whereas it significantly increased K concentration in the straw. Plant K uptake in K150 treatment (150% of the recommended K rate) was higher than that in Krec treatment, but grain yield was lower than that in Krec treatment. Thus, the result indicates that luxury K absorption occurred in K150% treatment due to excessive K application. Thus, the application rate of K should be further optimized. Based on the modified Mitscherlich model, the average economic optimum K rate (EONR) was 135.24, 124.27, and 96.54 kg K2O/ha for the low, medium, and high levels of soil indigenous K supply (IKS), respectively. The average economic optimum yield (EOY) at a high IKS level was similar to the average yield in Krec treatment, whereas the EOKR could reduce by a K rate of 37.9–63.7 kg K2O/ha compared to Krec treatment. This study highlights the importance of K application to improve grain yield and provides a promising fertilizer recommendation method for minimizing fertilizer inputs and optimizing maize production.</jats:p>"

We assessed the impact of two land use scenarios on the supply of ESS in a mountainous watershed in Xishuangbanna Prefecture, People’s Republic of China. We combined time-series data derived from spatially explicit ESS models (InVEST) with a sequential, data-driven algorithm (R-method) to identify potential tipping points (TPs) in the supply of ESS under two rubber plantation expansion scenarios. TPs were defined as any situation in which the state of a system is changed through positive feedback as a result of accelerating changes. The TP analysis included hydrological, agronomical, and climate-regulation ESS, as well as multiple facets of biodiversity (habitat quality for vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant species). We identified regime shifts indicating potential tipping points, which were linked to abrupt changes in rubber yields, in both scenarios at varying spatial scales. With this study, we provide an easily applicable method for regional policy making and land use planning in data-scarce environments to reduce the risk of traversing future TPs in ESS supply for rubber producing land use systems.</jats:p>"

In this paper, an index system for the comprehensive evaluation of water resources allocation in arid areas is established in response to the shortage of water resources, over-utilization of groundwater, and an unreasonable structure of agricultural water demand in the arid region of northwest China. It has been formulated based on current river basin water resources allocation practices and consideration of the fairness, efficiency and resource utilization rationality of water resources allocation. The projection tracking dynamic clustering approach was applied to analyze alternative water resource allocation schemes in the Kiz River Basin. It is concluded that the evaluation results demonstrate the following. (1) The PPDC model takes the actual measured value of the index as the basis for comprehensive evaluation, and it avoids the bias caused by the subjective formulation of weights. An optimal allocation scheme that has higher annual comprehensive benefits can better serve regional water resources management. (2) A projection pursuit dynamic cluster approach can deliver results which are more objective and reliable than existing evaluation approaches for water resources allocation. (3) Grey correlation analysis and projection tracking dynamic clustering are basically consistent with the evaluation results for water resources allocation in the Kiz River Basin. This suggests that the projection pursuit dynamic cluster is suitable for the evaluation of water resources allocation schemes.</jats:p>",

The regional gas supply system is considered from the standpoint of system analysis and presented as a complex dynamic system consisting of several subsystems. The balance structure of gas consumption in the region for the ten-year period and the patterns of daily gas consumption in the region depending on the average daily outdoor temperature for the two-year period have been studied. It is discovered that the power economy, industry and agriculture account for the largest share in the total gas consumption. The values of correlation coefficients between the outdoor air temperature and gas flow rate according to the elements of the balance structure are calculated. For the daily values of gas consumption for the needs of the population and housing-and-communal services, the highest correlation coefficient between the studied characteristics <jats:underline>R </jats:underline>is noted = (–0,98‒(–0,96)). Analysis of the matching fields of daily gas consumption in the region to the daily average temperature over a given one-year timeframe made it possible to identified two key areas, viz.: the area of operation of the heating system and the area of positive temperatures (the cheating system is off). For each of the areas, the dependences of the daily gas flow rate on the temperature and the effect of temperature changes on the gas consumption alteration were determined. It was found out that the temperature range from 0 to 10 °C corresponds to the zone of uncertain state of the regional gas supply system, since two areas overlap in this zone, viz.: the area of operation of the heating system and the area of positive temperatures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, companies and SMEs (small and medium enterprises) are looking to be more competitive. To achieve this, they are adopting new business models and strategies that allow them to move towards sustainability. Strategies such as CSR (Corporate social responsibility) and supply chain management have become essential for ensuring a company’s permanence and financial consolidation. The literature has stated that theories on stakeholders and sustainability are fundamental pillars for the development and sustained growth of business. The purpose of this article is to examine the effects of CSR and SCMM (supply chain management) on innovation, image and reputation, and, in turn, their influences on profitability in SMEs. An additional purpose is to verify the bidirectional relationship that exists between CSR and SCM in SMEs. This research was based on a sample of 143 companies in the city of Guaymas Sonorain Mexico. For the analysis and validation of the results, we used the ordinal least squares method (OLS) through multiple linear regressions and SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) statistical technique based on the variance, through PLS (Partial Least Squares) (using SmartPLS version 3.2.6 Professional). The findings show that SMEs that develop social and sustainable practices increase their level of innovation, and improve their image, their reputation, and their financial profitability. The results also indicate that CSR and SCM have a strong interdependence. This work contributes mainly to the development of the literature on stakeholders and sustainability.</jats:p>"

However, the insufficient output power of TENG is a bottleneck for its practical applications. Here, we report an ultrahigh output power, a whirligig-inspired TENG (Wi-TENG) designed according to an antique whirligig toy that is capable of converting low-frequency pulling motion into a high-frequency rotation. It shows that the rotor in the Wi-TENG achieves a maximum speed of 11,250 rpm. Ultrahigh charge transfer quantity of ~310 μC and output power of 40.18 mW are obtained by per pulling of Wi-TENG. Moreover, a maximum short-circuit current of 317 μA and a constant open-circuit voltage peak value of 153 V can be generated by the Wi-TENG, which can rapidly charge a commercial capacitance (100 μF) to ~14 V within 10 s. After power management, this Wi-TENG is successfully demonstrated as a portable sustainable power source for driving a commercial blood glucose meter or a temperature-humidity sensor. This study presents the potential of Wi-TENG as a reliable portable instant power supply for personal health monitoring devices.  </jats:p>",

The characteristic finite element method is adopted to solve the discrete pollutant concentration equations, so the time-monotonicity of concentration is ensured in the convection-dominated flow field with various adsorption conditions. The second-order Runge–Kutta method is adopted to track the upstream concentration source points along the streamline, so the precision of the calculated pollutant concentration is improved even under the streamline sharp-bending condition. The flow roughness and pollutant degradation coefficient are formulated by elements according to the actual situation, so the model can quantitatively analyse the effect of various ecological restoration schemes on purification capacity in water areas. The adaptability and robustness of the model were verified by a typical engineering case, where the calculated results coincide with the measured data.</jats:p>",

Forming a multidisciplinary leadership team, we analyzed sources of waste focusing on our Department of Neurosurgery. We developed an 8-wk pilot project to recycle “blue wrap,” the number 5 plastic polypropylene material that is ubiquitously used in ORs across the country to wrap instrument pans and implant trays for sterilization. Blue wrap can be baled and sold to recyclers where the material is pelletized and transformed into plastic products. During the 39 d of the pilot, we collected 1247 pounds of blue wrap (32 lbs collected daily). The cost of the pilot was $14 987 that includes a new baler ($11 200) and 5 transport carts ($3697). The revenue received from baled blue wrap was 8 cents per pound. Cost avoidance yielded $31 680.00 in savings. Implementation of this pilot across our main hospital would yield $5000 in revenue annually and $174 240 in cost avoidance. This project can be replicated at other centers and not only reduces the environmental footprint, but also helps generate additional revenue by recycling a necessary packing material that would otherwise require payment for disposal.</jats:p>",

In this context, a key challenge facing multiple‐stakeholder collaborations in circular supply networks (CSNs) is the need to coordinate activities, as well as to monitor and benchmark sustainability performance. The limited formal analysis of CE production dynamics and performance indicators of activities in the CSN has contributed to these challenges. To address this we develop an economic model of material flow in a CSN that incorporates multiple stakeholder effects, and two novel performance indicators that: (i) estimate the joint effects of the speed of recycling, and the effectiveness of collection and conversion of recycled material on production; and (ii) a measure of the upper bound production possibilities for a given recyclable material cycling through a CSN. These indicators will be informative for monitoring, benchmarking and incentivizing performance across CSNs and informing public policy debates and strategies.</jats:p>",

This study focused on evaluating the impacts of cell configuration, current density, and cathode material on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation in greywater. The formation and/or cathodic removal of active chlorine, perchlorate, haloacetic acids, and trihalomethanes were assessed during EC treatment. DBP formation was proportional to current density in undivided EC cells. Sequential anodic-cathodic treatment in divided EC cells resulted in COD removal in the catholyte and anolyte. The anodic COD removal rate (using a mixed metal-oxide anode) was greater than the cathodic removal rate employing boron-doped diamond (BDD) or graphite cathodes, but anodic and cathodic COD removal was similar when a stainless-steel cathode was used. The overall energy demand required for 50% COD removal was 24% less in the divided cells using the graphite or BDD cathodes (13 W-h L−1) compared to undivided cells (20 W-h L−1). Perchlorate formation was observed in undivided experiments (&amp;gt;50 μg/L), but not detected in divided experiments. While haloacetic acids (HAAs) and trihalomethanes (THMs) were generated anodically; they were removed on the cathode surface in the divided cell. These results suggest that divided configurations provide potential to mitigate DBPs in water reuse applications.</jats:p>",

Two renewable energy resources were available: solar photovoltaic energy and biomass (sugarcane bagasse). The solution of a mathematical model based on mixed integer linear programming provided the optimal economic solution, constituted by the configuration of the system (equipment installed) and its operation strategy (how to operate each equipment, throughout one operational year). The objective function considered the minimisation of total annual costs, which encompassed fixed costs (equipment) and variable costs (maintenance and energy costs). A reference system was designed, where only conventional equipment was utilised (no cogeneration, no solar or biomass utilities available). The optimal economic solution included the utilisation of biomass to produce hot water and steam, with an annual cost that was 11% lower than the reference solution. Although the economic optimal solution did not install cogeneration modules, it took advantage of solar and biomass resources to achieve annual minimum cost.</jats:p>",

CBWM was strongly boosted in NZ around 2000 by the development of the Stream Health Monitoring and Assessment Kit (SHMAK) and the Wai Care community initiative. Reform of freshwater management in NZ may be one driver for renewed interest recently in CBWM. Because professionals perceive volunteer-monitoring data as unreliable, they currently give little support to volunteer monitoring. To address their concern, we compared CBWM with measurements by regional authorities (RAs) – the main water management agencies in NZ. Agreement was encouragingly close for a comprehensive range of variables, including the important state-of-environment (SoE) indicators: visual clarity, Escherichia coli and macroinvertebrates. Community volunteers need and want ongoing professional support and encouragement, and, fortunately, there are important benefits for water management agencies, including engagement of citizens in water management and use of volunteer data. Professional support for CBWM in NZ could include: advice and encouragement, training, database development and quality assurance. Current research and development is focused on improving resources and systems for volunteer monitoring, notably with upgrading of the SHMAK. We are enlisting volunteers, equipped with improved tools and support systems, to assess the benefits of riparian rehabilitation and the suitability of water for swimming.</jats:p>",

In all countries except Italy and Spain, the sum of the forest and agricultural residues available at less than 300 km from a co‐firing plant exceeds the assessed biomass demand. The total cost of transporting residues to these plants is reduced if agricultural residues can be used, as transport distances are shorter. The total volume of forest residues less than 300 km from a co‐firing plant corresponds to about half of the assessed biomass demand. Almost 70% of the total biomass demand for co‐firing is found in Germany and Poland.

This study was conducted across nine site‐years in northeastern and southern Wisconsin, with radish planted mid‐August following winter wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L.) harvest. The experimental design was a randomized complete block, split plot design, with cover crop as the whole plot factor and N rate as the split plot factor.

The effect of radish on in‐season plant available N (PAN) content differed across growing seasons, with radish both increasing and decreasing PAN. The ANOVA and regression analysis showed mostly neutral effects of radish on corn yield, although corn yield increases and decreases following radish occurred. This research supports the use of radish as a trap crop for fall N, as environmentally meaningful yields of N were contained in plant biomass, but also demonstrates that radish has no N fertilizer replacement value to the subsequent crop.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Planning water supply infrastructure includes identifying interventions that cost‐effectively secure an acceptably reliable water supply. Climate change is a source of uncertainty for water supply developments as its impact on source yields is uncertain. Adaptability to changing future conditions is increasingly viewed as a valuable design principle of strategic water planning. Because present decisions impact a system's ability to adapt to future needs, flexibility in activating, delaying, and replacing engineering projects should be considered in least‐cost water supply intervention scheduling. This is a principle of Real Options Analysis, which this paper applies to least‐cost capacity expansion scheduling via multistage stochastic mathematical programming. We apply the proposed model to a real‐world utility with many investment decision stages using a generalized scenario tree construction algorithm to efficiently approximate the probabilistic uncertainty. To evaluate the implementation of Real Options Analysis, the use of two metrics is proposed: the value of the stochastic solution and the expected value of perfect information that quantify the value of adopting adaptive and flexible plans, respectively. An application to London's water system demonstrates the generalized approach. The investment decisions results are a mixture of long‐term and contingency schemes that are optimally chosen considering different futures. The value of the stochastic solution shows that by considering uncertainty, adaptive investment decisions avoid £100 million net present value (NPV) cost, 15% of the total NPV. The expected value of perfect information demonstrates that optimal delay and early decisions have £50 million NPV, 6% of total NPV. Sensitivity of results to the characteristics of the scenario tree and uncertainty set is assessed.</jats:p>",

Surface water samples were collected along the course of the river in May and October 2012. The samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), bicarbonate, chloride, sulphate, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Surface water was generally alkaline (average pH 8.17) and water pH and total dissolved solids in May were higher than those in October. EC ranged from 0.24 to 2.15 mS cm−1. Sodium was identified as the dominant cation, sulphate was identified as the dominant anion in May for both samples of river water but, in October, the dominant anions are respectively sulphate, bicarbonate and chloride from the upper region to the lower region. The total dissolved solids, chloride and sodium were found to exceed the permissible limits for irrigation water in the lower region. According to the principal factor analysis results, among water quality parameters measured in this study, chloride is the best indicator for monitoring water quality. The results revealed a deteriorating water quality in the lower region of the river.</jats:p>",

Both cohorts were propensity-score matched by baseline variables. We calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of appendicitis in the study cohort compared to the controls by Cox proportional hazards regression. The study cohort had a raised overall incidence rates of appendicitis compared to the control cohort (12.8 vs. 8.7 per 10,000 person-years). After covariate adjustment, the risk of appendicitis was significantly increased in the study cohort (adjusted HR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.35, 1.58, p &lt; 0.001). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed consistent results that children with low piped water supply had a higher risk of appendicitis than those with high piped water supply. This study demonstrated that children with low piped water supply were at an increased risk of appendicitis. Enhancement of piped water availability in areas lacking adequate, secure, and sanitized water supply may protect children against appendicitis.</jats:p>"

Purpurin was used as complexing ligand and the Pb(II)-purpurin complexes were extracted and preconcentrated from the aqueous phase using a choline chloride/2-chlorophenol (at a 1:2 molar ratio) based DES as a water-miscible extraction solvent and tetrahydrofuran as an emulsifier solvent. Some analytical parameters affecting the extraction yield were investigated and optimized. Using a 20 mL aqueous sample, the limit of detection and preconcentration factor of the method were 5.93 μg L−1 and 20, respectively. The accuracy of the method was assessed through the analysis of certified reference surface water (SPS-SW2 Batch 127) and spiked water samples. The certified and obtained values were statistically in good agreement at 95% confidence level. The recovery values of spiked water samples were between 102% and 105%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply networks are exposed to instabilities and thus a high level of risk. To mitigate this risk, it is necessary to understand how instabilities are formed in supply networks. In this paper, we focus on instabilities in inventory dynamics that develop due to the topology of the supply network. To be able to capture these topology-induced instabilities, we use a method called generalized modeling, a minimally specified modeling approach adopted from ecology. This method maps the functional dependencies of production rates on the inventory levels of different parts and products, which are imposed by the network topology, to a set of elasticity parameters. We perform a bifurcation analysis to investigate how these elasticities affect the stability. First, we show that dyads and serial supply chains are immune to topology-induced instabilities. In contrast, in a simple triadic network, where a supplier acts as both a first and a second tier supplier, we can identify instabilities that emerge from saddle-node, Hopf, and global homoclinic bifurcations. These bifurcations lead to different types of dynamical behavior, including exponential convergence to and divergence from a steady state, temporary oscillations around a steady state, and co-existence of different types of dynamics, depending on initial conditions. Finally, we discuss managerial implications of the results.</jats:p>",

Amino acid limitation that inactivates mTORC1 promotes de-phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a key transcriptional regulator of lysosome biogenesis and autophagy that is deregulated in cancer and neurodegeneration. Beyond its cytoplasmic sequestration, how TFEB phosphorylation regulates its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, and whether TFEB can coordinate amino acid supply with glucose availability is poorly understood. Here we show that TFEB phosphorylation on S142 primes for GSK3β phosphorylation on S138, and that phosphorylation of both sites but not either alone activates a previously unrecognized nuclear export signal (NES). Importantly, GSK3β is inactivated by AKT in response to mTORC2 signaling triggered by glucose limitation. Remarkably therefore, the TFEB NES integrates carbon (glucose) and nitrogen (amino acid) availability by controlling TFEB flux through a nuclear import-export cycle.</jats:p>"

We analyze three models: no gift cards, manufacturer‐sponsored gift cards, and retailer‐sponsored gift cards. By comparing these three models, we show that offering retail‐sponsored gift cards is the optimal strategy in such a supply chain. We analyze the influences of product value and redemption rate on the optimal policy and the expected profits. We show that the retailer, two manufacturers, and consumers are better off in such an optimal strategy. Furthermore, we develop a cost‐sharing mechanism based on the result of retailer‐sponsored gift cards by taking reasonableness and fairness into consideration. Finally, we extend our study by considering changed wholesale prices and retailer prices and a pair of complements with gift cards in the models of manufacturer‐sponsored gift cards and retailer‐sponsored gift cards, and we obtain some useful insights.</jats:p>",

On the southern Pacific coasts of South America, however, comprehensive information about macrobenthic assemblages at these habitats is lacking. Here we provide an inter‐annual estimation of food supply at the southern limit of the Pacific temperate zone within a Site of Hemispheric Importance for the conservation of Arctic breeding shorebird populations during the nonbreeding season. Macrobenthic communities on Isla Grande of Chiloé are dominated by Polychaetes, Bivalves and Malacostraca. Average biomass (4.4–9.6 g ash‐free dry weight m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>) falls within the values reported for temperate intertidal areas located at around 40°S latitude. While total available biomass within each bay was similar during the three sampling years, the annual contribution of each class varied. The major contributor to zoobenthic biomass (Polychaetes) was indeed one of the main preys for the most abundant shorebird species at Chiloé. Arctic breeding migratory shorebird populations seem thus to encounter a predictable and abundant food supply at high southern latitudes on Isla Grande of Chiloé.</jats:p>",

Material and methods: 97 schoolers of the cities of Cocal do Sul and Morro da Fumaça were evaluated. Dental fluorosis was determined through Dean index. The annual averages of the fluoride concentrations in waters between the years of 2004 and 2015 were verified by reports supplied by the responsiblecompany. Results: The averages of the fluoride concentrations in the water supply in the cities of Cocal do Sul and Morro da Fumaça, during the analyzed period, were 0.86 and 0,85 ppm of fluoride, respectively, without statistically significant difference. The smaller concentration was found in 2006, in the city of Morro da Fumaça, with 0.64 ppm of F; the greatest concentration occurred in Cocal do Sul, in 2007, with 1.1 ppm of F. The prevalence of dental fluorosisin Cocal do Sul was 24.5% and in Morro da Fumaça was 14.6%, without statistically significant differences. All 12-year-old schoolers who had dental fluorosis were classified as light according to Dean index. Conclusion: Most of the 12-year-old schoolers did not show any fluorosis degree. The cases of dental fluorosis were classified as little severity and with low esthetic impairment. It can be concluded that the fluoride levels in water supply were within the adequate and safe limits with low risk of dental fluorosis.</jats:p>"

First, the indexes related to the supply chain risk have been determined by literature review; and then the indexes have been refined by consulting experts; finally, the six main indexes including supplier, manufacturer, customer, environment, distributor and information as well as 32 subsidiary indexes for supply chain risks have been selected. In order to assess the indexes, a fuzzy questionnaire has been developed and distributed to 15 managers and employees of Snowa as one of the Entekhab Industrial Group corporate brands, the main home appliance manufacturing company in Iran. Research population included managers and experts of the company and the analysis approaches included risk-assessment matrix and Shannon fuzzy entropy. Findings indicated that environment, manufacturer and supplier indexes with the weights of 0.105, 0.102 and 0.095, respectively were prioritized as the top three risk factors in product development. Furthermore, the subsidiary indexes of raw material alteration, delay in supply of the demand, work force, after-sale services, competitors and lack of political stability were among the top risk factors of new product development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rural electrification is a fundamental step towards achieving universal access to electricity by 2030. On-grid rural electrification remains a costly proposition, therefore the need to consider off-grid renewable energy solutions is inevitable. However, the critical issue pertaining to local power generation through renewable energy is the absence of area-specific production capacity and economic viability data for the different renewable energy technologies. This paper addresses this issue for Pakistan’s Balochistan province by assessing the area’s potential and economic feasibility of using solar PV for rural electrification. The results suggest that the Balochistan province has the best solar irradiance value in the world. Furthermore, optimal tilt angles calculated for respective regions can significantly increase solar energy yield. The economic feasibility study, carried out for solar PV systems, reveals that the electricity generated using solar PV costs Rs. 7.98 per kWh and is considerably cheaper than conventional electricity, which costs approximately Rs. 20.79 per kWh. Similarly, solar PV systems could mitigate 126,000 metric tons of CO2 annually if 100% of the unelectrified households adopted solar PV systems. Based on these research findings, this paper proposes a policy that would serve as a guideline for the government to extend solar PV-based off-grid rural electrification projects in Balochistan as well as on a national scale.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The efficacy of the principal–agent contract in supply-chain quality control depends not only on contract parameters but also such noncontract parameters as cost of a high-quality effort and the diagnostic error of the inspection policy. The noncontract parameters usually fluctuate and are unobservable during contract execution, which may hinder suppliers’ high-quality effort, or, in other words, result in a lower efficacy for the contract. This article proposes an ontology-based approach to facilitating a principal–agent contract by monitoring the contract’s loss of efficacy. The approach consists of ontology-based models and data-centric algorithms. The ontology-based models not only formally represent concepts and relations between concepts involved in predicting whether a contract is efficient, but also organise multichannel data such as news, marketplace reports and industry databases containing information of factors impacting the unobservable noncontract parameters’ fluctuations. Based on the ontology-based models and multichannel data, the data-centric algorithms are developed to predict whether a contract will lose efficacy. We evaluate our approach through case study, simulation and comparison against related approaches to supply-chain quality control. The case study proves that our approach is appropriate. In the simulation evaluation, a combination of our approach and principal–agent contract is more efficient than just a principal–agent contract. The comparison results against related approaches show that our approach is a novel, inexpensive and directly applicable tool for reducing both asymmetric information and moral hazard in supply-chain quality control. </jats:p>",

We find that other financial aid adjusts in ways that vary by institution: Students at schools that offer federal loans borrowed more if they just missed the Pell eligibility threshold, but at other schools, students were instead compensated with higher state grants. Focusing on the loan-offering schools, we find suggestive evidence that receiving a modest Pell Grant leads students to reduce labor supply and increase enrollment intensity. We also provide indirect evidence that students’ initial enrollment choices are influenced by an offer of Pell Grants versus loans. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Iodine is a beneficial element for humans but very lowly represented in our diet. Iodine‐enriched vegetables could boost the iodine content in the food chain. Despite being a beneficial element for plants, little is known about the effect of different iodine forms on plant growth. This work analyses the effect of uptake of mineral (KI) and organoiodine (5‐iodosalicylic acid, 5‐ISA; 3,5‐diiodosalicylic acid, 3,5‐di‐ISA; 2‐iodobenzoic acid, 2‐IBeA; 4‐iodobenzoic acid, 4‐IBeA) compounds on tomato plants at an early stage of vegetative growth. As many organoiodine compounds are derived from salicylic (SA) and benzoic acids (BeA), treatments with I, SA and BeA in various treatments were realized and the influence of tested compounds on plant growth was analyzed. Iodine content was measured, as well as expression of key genes involved in I and SA metabolism. Organoiodine compounds accumulated mainly in roots whereas iodine accumulated in the upper parts when given as KI. The shoot system had 5, 12 and 25 times higher iodine  content  after KI treatment than after 4‐IBeA, 5‐ISA and 2‐IBeA, or 3,5‐diISA treatments, respectively. A toxic effect on plants was observed only for 3,5‐diISA and 4‐IBeA. The expression levels  of  a gene related to iodine metabolism (<jats:italic>HMT</jats:italic>, halide ion methylotransferase), a gene responsible for SA methylation in leaves (<jats:italic>SAMT</jats:italic>) and a gene related to SA catabolism (<jats:italic>S3H</jats:italic>, salicylic acid 3‐hydroxylase) were modified differently depending on the iodine source. Overall, our data point out to a difference in plant uptake, transport of iodine in tomato plants based on the form of iodine compound.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reviews the state of the art in Productions and Operations Management (POM) academic research regarding outsourcing in supply chain contexts. We first acknowledge the “Theory of the Firm” (ToF), the venerable and vast body of thought regarding where the firm draws the boundary between what it performs in‐house and what it outsources. Despite the clear linkage between outsourcing and POM, the ToF literature is most closely associated with the fields of strategy and economics. This disconnect might in part be due to a difference in theoretical lenses and terminology, which we address for the POM audience by providing a ToF tutorial. Our review of publications by the POM community from 2000 to 2016 includes a framework that organizes the in‐scope papers and a structured summary of each work. We partition the research into empirical/conceptual and analytical sub‐literatures, each of which gets its own critical assessment and discussion of open opportunities. Along the way, we articulate the features of the POM lens that distinctively position POM researchers to contribute further to the ToF, a convergence which we hope to encourage through this study. A deeper conversation among strategy, economics, and POM would enrichen the rigor and the relevance of each field. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Carbon captured by marine living organisms is called “blue carbon”, and\nseagrass meadows are a dominant blue carbon sink. However, our knowledge of\nhow seagrass increases sedimentary organic carbon (OC) stocks is limited. We\ninvestigated two pathways of OC accumulation: trapping of organic matter in\nthe water column and the direct supply of belowground seagrass detritus. We\ndeveloped a new type of box corer to facilitate the retrieval of intact cores\nthat preserve the structures of both sediments (including coarse sediments\nand dead plant structures) and live seagrasses. We measured seagrass density,\ntotal OC mass (OCtotal) (live seagrass OC biomass\n(OCbio) + sedimentary OC mass (OCsed)), and the\nstable carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) of OCsed and its\npotential OC sources at Thalassia hemprichii dominated back-reef and\nEnhalus acoroides dominated estuarine sites in the tropical\nIndo-Pacific region. At points with vegetation, OCbio accounted\nfor 25 % and OCsed for 75 % of OCtotal; this\ncontribution of OCbio to OCtotal is higher than in\nglobally compiled data. Belowground detritus accounted for ∼ 90 %\nof the OC mass of dead plant structures (&gt; 2 mm in size)\n(OCdead). At the back-reef site, belowground seagrass biomass,\nOCdead, and δ13C of OCsed (δ13Csed) were positively correlated with OCsed,\nindicating that the direct supply of belowground seagrass detritus is a major\nmechanism of OCsed accumulation. At the estuarine site,\naboveground seagrass biomass was positively correlated with OCsed\nbut δ13Csed did not correlate with OCsed,\nindicating that trapping of suspended OC by seagrass leaves is a major\nmechanism of OCsed accumulation there. We inferred that the\nrelative importance of these two pathways may depend on the supply\n(productivity) of belowground biomass. Our results indicate that belowground\nbiomass productivity of seagrass meadows, in addition to their aboveground\nmorphological complexity, is an important factor controlling their OC stock.\nConsideration of this factor will improve global blue carbon estimates.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cruise industry has recorded rapid expansion during the last decades, and it has substantial contribution to local economies. In this paper, we introduce a cruise tourism supply chain system consisting of one supplier and two newsboy-type retailers. We investigate the optimal decisions in a decentralized system from a game theoretical perspective and find out the optimal ordering and pricing strategies of both retailers and the optimal wholesale prices of the supplier with the limited number of cruise tickets and try to find out how the total profits should be allocated by the two retailers in the alliance case. Our framework involves two operational strategies, including inconsistent wholesale prices in the benchmark case and consistent wholesale price in the alliance case in which the two retailers have a virtual alliance, combining to one retailer. A numerical example compares the performance of the supply chain members and the system in two cases and finds that it is better for the two retailers to have a virtual alliance, combining to one retailer when the total amount of cruise tickets ordered by the two retailers is constrained by the total number of cruise tickets for the supplier, but it is not good choice for the two retailers to combine to one retailer when the total number of cruise tickets for the supplier does not constrain the total amount of cruise tickets ordered by the two retailers. In addition, the performance of the system in the alliance case is as good as that in the benchmark case when the total amount of cruise tickets ordered by the two retailers is constrained by the total number of cruise tickets for the supplier. However, when the total number of cruise tickets for the supplier does not constrain the total amount of cruise tickets ordered by the two retailers, the performance of the system in the benchmark case is better than that in the alliance case.</jats:p>",

As of 2015, the WaterSense® program can claim credit for a total savings of 1.5 trillion gallons of water and $32.6 billion in consumer water and energy bills. Savings are tracked in the National Water Savings (NWS) model that combines innovative analyses with methodologies established in the energy sector. Merging life-cycle cost and national impact analysis models, the NWS model estimates savings from a bottom-up accounting method for individual products. The model extends those savings to the national level by employing parameters such as frequency of product use by number of people and building type, product lifetime, stock accounting, and market saturation. The NWS model tracks the water and consumer monetary savings of WaterSense-labeled products for residential and commercial water use both indoors and out.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Academics and practitioners have paid close attention to front-end planning research, especially in the construction industry. It is known with many acronyms including pre-project planning and front-end loading. Since 1994, Construction Industry Institute (CII) has set front-end planning as one of themain research topicareas in their knowledge structure. A lot of research related to front-end planning and project scope definition has been conductedsince then. However, there lacks a comprehensive review of the currentstudies on the topic. Thus, the objective of this research was to undertake a comprehensive literature review of papers related to front-end planning. Reviewing 83 selected papers, this research raises several important issues regarding front-end planning such as the position of front-end planning in project life cycle, the differentiation between front-end planning and project planning, the significance of front-end planning, the front-end planning organization management, the front-end planning phases, the challenges in front-end planning implementation, and the identification of research gaps in front-end planning. The findings of this research contribute to furtherunderstanding of front-end planning andwould be useful for practitioners and academics to conduct further empirical studies on the subject matter.</jats:p>"

Aim :  To present a surgical technique for reconstruction of the upper digestive tract after total esophagectomy and gastrectomy due to esophageal and gastric necrosis  Method: The transit was re-established by means of a pharyngo-ileo-colic interposition with microsurgical arterial and venous anastomosis for augmentation of blood supply. Colo-duodeno-anastomosis and ileo-transverse colic anastomosis were performed for complete digestive transit reconstruction.  Result: This procedure was applied in a case of 41 years male attempted suicide by ingesting alkali caustic liquid (concentrated sodium hydroxide). Total necrosis of the esophagus and stomach occurred, which required initially total esophago-gastrectomy, closure at the level of the crico-pharyngeal sphincter and jejunostomy for enteral feeding with a highly deteriorated quality of life . The procedure was performed later and there were no major early and late postoperative complications and normal nutritional conditions were re-stablished.  Conclusion: The procedure is feasible and must be managed by multidisciplinary team in order to re-establish a normal quality of life.</jats:p>"

Each treatment was allocated 4 replicates out of which one replicate was maintained for the replacement of the dead birds, if any, to maintain the required stocking density. The body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI) and performance index (PI) of poults was significantly higher in 1.0 ft2 floor space during 0–4 weeks and 4–10 weeks of age. Similarly, higher BWG, FI, and PI were observed at 26% dietary protein level. The interaction effect between stocking density and protein levels during 0–4 week resulted in significantly higher FI at 0.8 ft2 floor space with 26% protein level and 1.0 ft2 floor space with 24% as well as 26% protein level. The feed conversion ratio (FCR), mortality pattern, immune response and immune organ weights of poults did not reveal any significant treatment effect. The feed cost/bird increased linearly with increasing floor space, and feed cost/kg weight gain and feed cost/ kg meat increased linearly with increasing protein levels. However, profit potential per meter square decreased linearly with decreasing stocking density. The study concluded that increasing the stocking density and decreasing the dietary protein level decrease the performance of poults, but the profit potential per meter square increases with increasing stocking density. Thus, the study recommends either the floor space of 0.8 ft2/bird with 26% dietary protein level or the floor space of 1.0 sq2/bird with 24% dietary protein level for growing turkey poults.</jats:p>"

However, within this ‘sediment‐dominated’ research focus, the deglaciated source rockwalls are often portrayed in an oversimplified way. Here, we investigate 12 rockwall‐talus systems in three glaciated hanging valleys in the Swiss Alps and explore the role of source rockwalls on the spatial pattern of talus slopes and their paraglacial rockfall activity. Data from field‐based talus slope surveys, rockwall geotechnical studies, rock temperature monitoring, frost cracking modeling and GIS‐based topoclimatic analyses are evaluated by ergodic reasoning in a principal component analysis to identify patterns of rockwall‐talus systems with respect to their topoclimatic, rock mechanical and paraglacial controls. The results show that four main factors (frost cracking, permafrost probability, rockwall morphometry and mechanical preconditioning by rock mass strength and joint orientation) combine to dictate the paraglacial and spatial variability of sediment production, rockfall activity and block size. Our study demonstrates that more emphasis must be given to source rockwalls as their instability and weathering are directly linked to landform and material characteristics of talus deposits.</jats:p>",

Some methods to calculate the reasons for the river runoff decrease are urgently needed, and the degree to guide the river ecology restoration. Taking the Kuye River as an example, this study established a reference period (1960–1979) for a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, and simulated the runoff changes and distribution. Then, the degree of influence of weather, water and soil conservation, industrial and domestic water consumption, and coal mining on river runoff during a recent period (1999–2010) was quantified. Finally, recent changes in runoff and its distribution were simulated with a modified SWAT model. The results show that in comparison to the reference period, for the recent period 21,987 × 104 m3 per year of runoff from the Kuye River was attributable to weather, while 8,840 × 104 m3, 5,346 × 104 m3 and 13,788 × 104 m3 was attributable to soil and water conservation measures, industrial and domestic water consumption, and coal mining respectively. The distribution of the runoff in the recent period was similar to that in the reference period, although its value was only half of the latter. These results can serve as an important reference for the ecological restoration of the Kuye River basin.</jats:p>",

Here we use two systems analysis tools—Ecological Risk Assessment for Effects of Fishing (ERAEF) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)—over the historical development of the Australian Patagonian toothfish fishery at Heard and McDonald Islands since the start in 1997. We find that ecological risks have been systematically identified in the management process using ERAEF, and with time have been mitigated, resulting in a lower risk fishery from an ecological impact perspective. LCA inventory data from the industry shows that fuel use per kilo has increased over the history of the fishery. Our results suggest that LCA and ERAEF may provide contrasting and complementary perspectives on sustainability and reveal trade-offs when used in combination. Incorporation of LCA perspectives in assessing impacts of fishing may facilitate refinement of ecosystem-based fisheries management, such as improved integration of the different perspectives of supply chain stakeholders.</jats:p>",

Yet, the relationship between farm production diversity and household food consumption diversity remains complex and empirical evidence is, so far, mixed. The present article assesses this relationship using two districts—Kilosa and Chamwino—with contrasting agro-ecological and market contexts in rural Tanzania. These districts represent the majority of farming systems found in Tanzania as well as in several countries within the region. We used household data and employed descriptive as well as multivariate regression analyses. The results indicated a positive role of farm production diversity for food consumption diversity in the district with relatively harsh climatic and agro-ecological characteristics and poor access to markets. Furthermore, increased farm production diversity was generally associated with seasonal food consumption diversity. However, results suggested a lesser role of farm production diversity in the presence of better agro-ecological and market access characteristics. These findings imply that promoting farm production diversity should consider the existing agro-ecological and market characteristics. In addition, achieving increased food consumption diversity among rural households may require effective market related infrastructure and institutions.</jats:p>"

Due to the strategic importance of having a sustainable network, it is necessary to have an enhanced supply chain network risk management. In a supply chain network many firms depend directly or indirectly on a specific supplier. In this regard, unknown risks of network’s structure can endanger the whole supply chain network’s robustness. In spite of the importance of risk identification of supply chain network, firms are not willing to exchange the structural information of their network. Firms are concerned about risking their strategic positioning or established connections in the network. The paper proposes to combine secure multiparty computation cryptography methods with risk identification algorithms from social network analysis to address this challenge. The combination enables structural risk identification of supply chain networks without endangering firms’ competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a new water-age based method for optimal location and dosage of booster disinfection has been proposed, as well as an uncertainty analysis of chlorine residuals. Chlorine-age, a novel indicator of water quality, is firstly introduced based on water age. By minimizing the total chlorine-age of nodes in a water distribution network (WDN), a new model for optimal booster location is proposed. The chlorine-age based model is independent of chlorine-decay simulation, and therefore avoids the complexity of obtaining kinetic parameters and prevents misleading results caused by inaccurate simulation of chlorine residuals. The uncertainties of chlorine residuals increase along with the distance and time consumption for delivering water. In this study, chlorine-age is employed to measure the uncertainties of nodal residuals, and optimal chlorine dosage is calculated considering the uncertainties. The proposed method has been tested on an example network and a real-life network to illustrate its validity and applicability. The results have shown that the method is feasible and reliable in practical application.</jats:p>",

It is considered to be an important structure in water supply and drainage systems. However, its complex geometry makes it difficult to achieve an optimal hydraulic design, and only a few design equations and criteria are available. This study investigates the discharge capacity of a PKW and evaluates the characteristics of its discharge using various sources of experimental data from a database. First, previously proposed discharge capacity formulas are summarized and analyzed. Then, a new formula that integrates the existing test data with the results of dimensional analysis and multiparameter optimization is proposed. The weir characteristics are evaluated using the proposed formula and a mathematical model. The results show that both the proposed formula and numerical model are promising approaches to evaluate the discharge capacity of an A-type PKW and can guide its design.</jats:p>",

By enabling the integration of surplus production from intermittent renewables, energy storage units displace electricity production from different sources and potentially create environmental benefits. Nevertheless, batteries can also cause substantial environmental impacts during their manufacturing process and through the extraction of raw materials. A prospective consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) of lithium metal polymer and lithium‐ion stationary batteries is undertaken to quantify potential environmental benefits and drawbacks. Projections are integrated into the LCA model: Energy scenarios are used to obtain marginal electricity supply mixes, and projections about the battery performances and the recycling process are sourced from the literature. The roles of key parameters and methodological choices in the results are systematically investigated. The results demonstrate that the displacement of marginal electricity sources determines the environmental implications of using batteries. In the reference scenario representing current policy, the displaced electricity mix is dominated by natural gas combined cycle units. In this scenario, the use of batteries generates environmental benefits in 12 of the 16 impact categories assessed. Nevertheless, there is a significant reduction in achievable environmental benefits when batteries are integrated into the power supply system in a low‐carbon scenario because the marginal electricity production, displaced using batteries, already has a reduced environmental impact. The direct impacts of batteries mainly originate from upstream manufacturing processes, which consume electricity and mining activities related to the extraction of materials such as copper and bauxite.</jats:p>",

The power grid as the power supplier of cellular networks is also developing rapidly. In this paper, we design two levels of bilateral matching algorithm to solve the energy management of micro-grid connected cellular networks. There are multiple retailers (sellers) and clusters (buyers) in our system model, which determine the transaction price and trading energy respectively and have a certain influence on the balance of energy supply and demand. Retailers make more profits by adjusting the price of electricity in matching algorithm M-1, depending on the energy they capture and the level of storage. At the same time, clusters adjust the electricity consumption through matching algorithm M-2 and power allocation on the basis of ensuring the quality of users’ service. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by changing various parameters in the simulation.</jats:p>"

Reducing postharvest losses is a priority to reduce the loss of the dietary‐based phytonutrients and to improve the health of the consumers. Limited information is available in South Africa related to the postharvest and nutrition loss in the urban fresh produce market supply chain. In this study, we quantified the postharvest losses, changes in phytochemicals, and loss of minerals in lettuce at different points of Tshwane Fresh Produce Market supply chain. Lettuce supply to the Tshwane Fresh Produce Market from two different provinces, Gauteng and North West, were included in this study for comparison. Lettuce from the two provinces was collected from five different farms. The loss of fresh weight, changes in visual quality, phytonutrition properties, and economic loss of lettuce at the supply chain points: (a) transport; (b) storage; (c) and at the retail shelf was investigated. Five boxes of lettuce per supply chain point from Gauteng and North West provinces were randomly selected. The results indicated that the high temperature (25°C) and low <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RH</jats:styled-content> (40%) at the retail shelf affected the weight, overall quality, and phytonutrition properties of lettuce. Cumulative economic loss was higher at the retail shelf due to the inferior quality of lettuce. The study identified where major quality and phytonutrition losses occur during marketing. The study demonstrated to identify the where major food and nutritional loss losses occur during marketing. This information will significantly benefit food sustainability by introducing technologies to manage food and nutrition losses.</jats:p>",

The first approach is to engineer respiration chain branches of <jats:italic>B. licheniformis</jats:italic>, elimination of cytochrome <jats:italic>bd</jats:italic> oxidase branch reduced the maintenance coefficient, leading to a 19.27% increase of γ‐PGA yield. The second approach is to introduce Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHB) into recombinant <jats:italic>B. licheniformis</jats:italic>, led to a 13.32% increase of γ‐PGA yield.

Our study also confirmed that the respiratory nitrate reductase, NarGHIJ, is responsible for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite, and assimilatory nitrate reductase NasBC is for conversion of nitrite to ammonia. Both NarGHIJ and NasBC were positively regulated by the two‐component system ResD–ResE, and overexpression of NarG, NasC, and ResD also improved the ATP supply and the consequent γ‐PGA yield.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, activities undertaken to reduce environmental impacts – such as recycling and reusing – have been increasing in popularity. For manufacturing companies, designing and using a closed-loop supply chain can help meet social responsibility objectives and enhance competitiveness. A closed-loop supply chain requires the accurate prediction of not only demand but also returned products; however, in the literature, the quantity of returned products is assumed to be dependent on demand. Importantly, the quantity of returned products is influenced by past demand and use periods. Further, some returned products may be treated as end-of-life products, because of quality deterioration. The purpose of this study is to design a closed-loop supply chain model in the context of returned product quantities as affected by past demand, use period, and extra demand, in order to analyze system performance. Herein, the quantity of demand influences the quantity of returned products, and hence the quantity of reusable products. Moreover, the dynamics of returned products, demand, and reusable products will also significantly influence production planning. In this study, fluctuations in the quantity of returned products influence not only production planning but also future demand fluctuations. The results of numerical examples derived from using the model proposed in this study clarify that the quantities of reusable products and manufactured products will fluctuate depending on the return rate, given policies that prioritize the sale of reusable products. This finding suggests that manufacturers need to consider reducing their environmental impact as well as establishing production planning and inventory control policies that contain fluctuations in the quantities of reusable and manufactured products.</jats:p>",

This is especially true for river basins with high intraannual and interannual variability, such as monsoonal systems that need to buffer against seasonal droughts while also managing extreme floods. Moreover, the timing, intensity, duration, and frequency of these hydrologic extremes may evolve with deeply uncertain changes in socioeconomic and climatic pressures. This study contributes an innovative method for exploring how possible changes in the timing and magnitude of the monsoonal cycle impact the robustness of reservoir operating policies designed assuming stationary hydrologic and socioeconomic conditions. We illustrate this analysis on the Red River basin in Vietnam, where reservoirs and dams serve as important sources of hydropower production, multisectoral water supply, and flood protection for the capital city of Hanoi. Applying our scenario discovery approach, we find that reservoir operations designed assuming stationarity provide robust hydropower performance in the Red River but that increased mean streamflow, amplification of the within‐year monsoonal cycle, and increased interannual variability all threaten their ability to manage flood risk. Additionally, increased agricultural water demands can only be tolerated if they are accompanied by greater mean flow, exacerbating food‐flood trade‐offs in the basin. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the impacts of a wide range of deeply uncertain socioeconomic and hydrologic factors when evaluating system robustness in monsoonal river basins, considering in particular both lower‐order moments of annual streamflow and intraannual monsoonal behavior.</jats:p>",

The decentralized supply chain and centralized supply chain are divided by whether the supplier provides repurchase guarantees and whether the retailer offers revenue sharing. We develop a Stackelberg game model to analyze the influential mechanism among various actors and use the method of downside risk control to discuss the bank’s expected loss and the optimal loan pledge ratio. We carry out a simulation analysis, and the result is shown as follows: (i) either for decentralized or centralized supply chain, the retailer’s optimal order quantity and the optimal proportion that the number of goods pledged by the retailer’s twice ordering accounts for the number of first-ordering goods are all unique; (ii) the bank’s loan pledge ratio is a monotonically increasing function of disposal value of the unit remaining commodity; (iii) for centralized supply chain, the bank’s loan pledge ratio is the monotonically increasing function of repurchase ratio and wholesale price provided by the supplier, respectively; (iv) in the decentralized supply chain, the supplier’s return mainly comes from the wholesale revenue and is positively related to the wholesale volume and wholesale price; in the centralized supply chain, the supplier’s return is mainly from the retailer’s revenue sharing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>N</jats:italic>‐acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) is widely used as a nutraceutical for facilitating infant brain development, maintaining brain health, and enhancing immunity. Currently, NeuAc is mainly produced by extraction from egg yolk and milk, or via chemical synthesis. However, its low concentration in natural resources and its non‐ecofriendly chemical synthesis result in insufficient NeuAc production and environmental pollution, respectively. In this study, improved NeuAc production was attained via modular pathway engineering of the supply pathways of two key precursors—<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>‐acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)—and by balancing NeuAc biosynthesis and cell growth in engineered <jats:italic>Bacillus subtilis</jats:italic>. Specifically, we used a previously constructed GlcNAc‐producing <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic> as the initial host for NeuAc biosynthesis. First, we constructed a de novo NeuAc biosynthetic pathway utilizing glucose by coexpressing glucosamine‐6‐phosphate acetyl‐transferase (GNA1), <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>‐acetylglucosamine 2‐epimerase (AGE), and <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>‐acetylneuraminic acid synthase (NeuB), resulting in 0.33 g/l NeuAc production. Next, to balance the supply of the two key precursors for NeuAc biosynthesis, modular pathway engineering was performed. The optimal strategy for balancing the GlcNAc module and PEP supply module involved the use of an engineered, unique glucose and malate coutilization pathway in <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>, supplied with both glucose (for the GlcNAc moiety) and malate (for the PEP moiety) at high strength. This led to 1.65 g/L NeuAc production, representing a 5.0‐fold improvement over the existing methods. Furthermore, to enhance the NeuAc yield on cell, glucose and malate coutilization pathways were engineered to balance NeuAc biosynthesis and cell growth via the blocking of glycolysis, the introduction of the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, and the overexpression of the malic enzyme YtsJ. NeuAc titer reached 2.18 g/L, with 0.38 g/g dry cell weight NeuAc yield on cell, which represented a 1.32‐fold and 2.64‐fold improvement over the existing methods, respectively. The strategy of modular pathway engineering of key carbon precursor supply pathways via engineering of the unique glucose‐malate coutilization pathway in <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic> should be generically applicable for engineering of <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic> for the production of other important biomolecules. Our study also provides a good starting point for further metabolic engineering to achieve industrial production of NeuAc by a Generally Regarded As Safe bacterial strain.</jats:p>",

Immunolocalization of a tagged MtMOT1.2 indicates that it is associated to the plasma membrane and to intracellular membrane systems, where it would be transporting molybdate towards the cytosol, as indicated in yeast transport assays. Loss‐of‐function <jats:italic>mot1.2</jats:italic>‐<jats:italic>1</jats:italic> mutant showed reduced growth compared with wild‐type plants when nitrogen fixation was required but not when nitrogen was provided as nitrate. While no effect on molybdenum‐dependent nitrate reductase activity was observed, nitrogenase activity was severely affected, explaining the observed difference of growth depending on nitrogen source. This phenotype was the result of molybdate not reaching the nitrogen‐fixing nodules, since genetic complementation with a wild‐type <jats:italic>MtMOT1.2</jats:italic> gene or molybdate‐fortification of the nutrient solution, both restored wild‐type levels of growth and nitrogenase activity. These results support a model in which MtMOT1.2 would mediate molybdate delivery by the vasculature into the nodules.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper discusses the government reward-penalty mechanism (RPM) between two competing manufacturers and a recycler in closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) under asymmetric information. According to the dynamics game theory and principal-agent theory, three decision-making models are built: <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> decentralized dynamics game model without RPM, <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> decentralized dynamics game model with carbon emission RPM, and <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">3</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> decentralized dynamics game model with carbon emission RPM and recovery ratio RPM. The results show that <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> the carbon emission RPM increases product sale price, while it decreases the WEEE buy-back price and the WEEE recovery ratio, besides the profit of recycler. To some extent, it cannot motivate WEEE recycling. <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M5\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> Recovery ratio RPM improves the WEEE recovery ratio and lowers the product sale price; it also benefits manufacturer-1’s and recycler’s profits and consumers’ surplus. So it strongly proved effectiveness in guiding WEEE recycling. <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M6\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">3</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> In any case, the product sale price of manufacture-1 is lower than that of manufacturer-2. Similarly, the WEEE buy-back price and WEEE recovery ratio with H type are higher than those of L type, respectively. Apparently, it is suggested that the manufacturer participating in WEEE recycling and remanufacturing can gain competitive advantages; meanwhile, the recycler with high fixed cost has the scale advantages. <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M7\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">4</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> The competition can benefit improving WEEE recovery ratio. A numerical simulation is given to examine the theoretical results. According to the main conclusions, we propose that taking active part in recycling and remanufacturing WEEE and choosing the recycler with high fixed cost to cooperate are the wise choices for manufacturers. The recycler should expand fixed recovery cost investment, which will contribute to getting the scale effect; the government needs to balance the carbon emission RPM and recovery ratio RPM so as to cut down environmental pollution and guide the CLSC into WEEE recycling and remanufacturing. The most important carbon emission reward-penalty intensity should be set appropriately in case of discouraging members of CLSC recycling WEEE.</jats:p>",

Supplier sells fresh products through e-tailer in an online market, and the e-tailer offers a full-refund return policy to loss-averse consumers and exerts a fresh-keeping effort to keep the product at the optimum freshness level. By developing an analytical model, we derive the optimal price, quantity, and fresh-keeping effort jointly and verify that it is unique in the centralized setting. Based on the comparison, we demonstrate that the e-tailer’s profit is greater with fresh-keeping effort than without it; therefore, the e-tailer has an incentive to engage in fresh-keeping effort. We also show that the return rate is independent of the fresh-keeping effort and consumers’ loss aversion. In the decentralized setting, we first characterize the optimal wholesale price by the numerical study and then find that although the buyback contract still works, the revenue-sharing contract fails to achieve channel coordination under our model formulation. Furthermore, we develop a revenue- and cost-sharing contract that can coordinate the supply chain by designing a new contractual mechanism. Our numerical studies offer the Pareto improvement regions under the buyback and revenue- and cost-sharing contracts in which the supplier and e-tailer can earn more expected profits compared with being under wholesale price contract.</jats:p>",

This system can be regarded as a coupling dynamics of the forward supply chain of Stackelberg game model. Based on the analysis, some dynamic phenomena such as bifurcation and chaos were found. Numerical simulations and the maximum Lyapunov exponent were therefore utilized to provide experimental evidence for the complicated behaviors of the system evolution. The findings of the study revealed that the equilibrium of the system can lose stability via flip bifurcation or Neimark-Sacker bifurcation and that time-delayed feedback control is appropriate for stabilizing the chaotic behaviors of the system.</jats:p>",
