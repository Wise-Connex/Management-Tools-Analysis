      "abstract": "<jats:p>The conventional post‐war wisdom was that unemployment was a consequence of inadequate economic growth, and economic growth was to be secured by macro‐economic policy. Inflation, by contrast, was increasingly seen as a matter to be dealt with by microeconomic policy ‐ the panoply of controls and subsidies associated with the era of incomes policy … But the proper role of each is precisely the opposite of that assigned to it by the conventional post‐war wisdom. It is the conquest of inflation, and not the pursuit of growth and employment, which is or should be the objective of macro‐economic policy. And it is the creation of conditions conducive to growth and employment… which is or should be the objective of micro‐economic policy.—Nigel Lawson, Fifth Mais Lecture, 1984.</jats:p>",

Normally both flows are non-steady but, for the sake of simplicity, the base flow is here assumed to be steady whereas the yield of water from the single well is assumed to be a free function of time defined by the actual consumption which assumption leads to a non-steady flow towards the wells. A special result of the analysis is that it becomes possible to define the catchment area of the single well.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Using an econometric model of the sawtimber and pulpwood market in price region 1 (the northern part of Sweden), it is considered whether the subsidies paid to regeneration costs in this region since the end of the 1960's have had any measurable short-run effect on wood supply. Two interrelated markets are introduced, a sawtimber market and a pulpwood market. The sawtimber market is modelled as a competitive market, while the pulpwood market is treated as a monopsonistic market structure. The model shows a good fit and the subsidies seem to have had a significant negative effect on sawtimber supply and an insignificant negative effect on pulpwood supply. The paper ends with a discussion of possible reasons for this somewhat unexpected result. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Rapid industrialization and population growth in the north Mexican desert city of Ciudad Juarez are placing a serious strain on the city's municipal water resources. Water deliveries and service area have more than doubled over the past decade, and plans for additional expansion are presently being implemented. This expansion is already contributing to water table declines and salinity increases in the Mexican portion of the Heuco Bolson, the sole source of water for the city. Continued mining of the limited fresh water reserves should produce serious water supply problems in the near future. New estimates of future water consumption incorporated into a digital aquifer simulation model indicate that these problems may show up much sooner than was anticipated in previous investigations. The results of this study point to the need to accelerate the gathering of basic data on alternative water resources. The problems faced by Cd. Juarez are illustrative of the kinds of difficulties likely to confront other rapidly developing cities of the arid zone.</jats:p>",
