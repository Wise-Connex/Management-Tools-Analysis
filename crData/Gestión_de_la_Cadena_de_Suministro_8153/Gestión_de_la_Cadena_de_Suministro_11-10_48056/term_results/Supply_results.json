      "abstract": "<jats:p>This essay examines what is in a sense a failed project, and builds on that failure to hopefully stimulate fresh thinking on how we do supply chain management (SCM) research. The initial aim of this discussion forum was to encourage authors with manuscripts that were languishing in a “file drawer” to submit them once more. But the call for papers received one inquiry and no submissions. This seemingly empty file drawer led us in a very different direction, one of trying to understand why the SCM file drawer might be empty. This essay summarizes the assumptions that guided our process of discovery, what we actually did when confronted with no submissions, what we found via our additional data collection and then concludes with some suggestions for moving the field forward.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Successful implementation of food supply chains in improving the productivity and operational efficiency by some companies made many other firms and researchers courteous about this fast developing field. For successful strategies, organizations in agri-food business are aiming to bring all its stakeholders in close cooperation. The agri-food supply chain aims at optimal warehousing and location design, supply-demand synchronization, checking price variations and ultimately minimizing waste and improving productivity at every stage leveraging Information Technology (IT). This research reviews the supply chain status in agri-food sector, categorizes available literature, assesses the influential articles, and proposes the holistic framework in agri-food supply chain. From the literature review, it is observed that the research articles have addressed agri-food supply chain up to a certain point and confined to the apt ideas of supply projections, demand projections, supply-demand disparity, traceability, collaborations etc. There is a need for extensive research to reconsider warehouse and location design, supply-demand projections and gap analysis, transshipment strategies and traceability in an integrated manner. The present study proposes holistic framework addressing the issues of supply-demand synchronization, warehouse design, transportation optimization, traceability, vertical integration and farmer’s credit facility.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fit-for-purpose potable source substitution of appropriate water end uses with rainwater or recycled water is often essential to maintain water security in growing urban regions. This paper provides the results of a detailed supply-demand forecasting review of a unique tri-supply (i.e., potable, A+ recycled and rain water sources reticulated to household) urban water scheme located in Queensland, Australia. Despite the numerous benefits of this scheme, system efficiency (e.g., reduced demand levels, water treatment, low chemical and energy use) and economic viability (i.e., capital and operating costs per kL of supply) aspects need to be considered against derived potable water savings. The review underpinned the design of a framework to enhance the schemes supply-demand balance and reduce the unit cost of alternative source supplies. Detailed scenario and sensitivity analysis identified the possibility of a refined scheme design, whereby the A+ recycled water supply would be reticulated to the cold water input tap to the washing machine, and the rain tank that originally supplied this end use be removed from future constructed households. The refined scheme design enhances the present recycled plant utilisation rate and reduces the cost to home owners when building their dwelling due to the removed requirement to install a rain tank to indoor end uses; such actions reduce the overall unit cost of the scheme.</jats:p>"

The objective of this paper is to introduce and test the construct of LCCS competence of employees from purchasing and other participating functions. The conceptual framework is derived through expert interviews, workshops, and an extensive literature review. The LCCS competence construct is tested using data from more than 300 managers and employees from various functions involved in LCCS projects. The results support the construct's validity as well as its association with LCCS performance. The study implications and future research paths are discussed.</jats:p>",

The research findings indicate that domestic supplier integration in terms of joint product development and advanced production planning activities between buyers and suppliers currently takes place to a relatively low extent.

We conduct a dyadic, multiple‐informant based, longitudinal study of the development of two buyer–supplier relationships. We carry out a detailed examination of the effect of socialization on communication quality by interviewing personnel from both the buying and supplying companies and at different levels over three consecutive years beginning with the inception of a key supplier program initiated by our focal buying company. Our results show that, contrary to what has been suggested by other studies, socialization in buyer–supplier relationships does not invariably have a positive impact on communication quality. We offer two possible explanations for our findings. First, we argue that the atmosphere created by past conflicts can diminish the positive effect of socialization on communication quality. Second, when a relationship is in a declining life‐cycle phase, especially when one of the parties has strong doubts about the value of continued collaboration, socialization efforts may not contribute to improved communication performance. Hence, for socialization to have a positive effect on communication quality, socialization tactics must be tailored taking into account the history and current phase of the relationship.</jats:p>",

The effective modulation circuit is given in order to realize the many operation-modes of the plasma generator.

Therefore, it’s needed that manage the power of whole system with the integrated viewpoint to reduce power consumption and extend the system work time. After the analysis and research for power management technologies, one kind of a combination of hardware and software power management solution is proposed.

The data on the network consisting of voltages, currents, power factor and harmonic distortion were acquired by the Harmonitor. Analysis of these data shows that there is significantly high variation between the minimum and the maximum voltage and that the phase loads are unbalanced. There is low power factor and the total harmonic distortions (THD) on the phases and neutral are high. The causes of the poor quality of power supply were identified and recommendations proposed taking into cognizance the complexity and sensitivity of the equipment in the network.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Previous studies present conflicting evidence on the rationality and efficiency of weekly money supply forecasts. Many studies have found that these forecasts meet the criteria of the Rational Expectations Hypothesis of unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency. However, other research has found biasedness in the 1979-1982 period. We utilize a battery of tests to assess these criteria for money market survey data from September 1977 through October 1984. By breaking the available data set into six month subperiods we identify the 1980-1981 period as one of market turbulence producing biased and inefficient money supply forecasts. This evidence is supported by employing the Brown-Durbin-Evans cusum of squares statistic. A plot of his statistic indicates structural instability in the relationships tested in 1980. Factors which may have contributed to this turbulence in 1980 were the Federal Reserves shift from an interest rate target to an M1 target in late 1979, the Monetary Control Act of 1980, the imposition of credit controls in 1980, and the volatility in the velocity of M1 in 1980-1981. Importantly, even though the U.S. monetary environment remained turbulent over the 1979-1982 period, our results show the weekly forecasts of money market dealers reachieving statistical rationality after 1980.</jats:p>"

Through the analysis, great randomness existed in supply and demand of real estate in Xi’an.

Each firm is characterized by a production cost that is convex in the output produced, and firms act as profit maximizers. We consider a uniform price market design that uses supply function bidding: firms declare the amount they would supply at any positive price, and a single price is chosen to clear the market. We are interested in evaluating the impact of price-anticipating behavior both on the allocative efficiency of the market and on the prices seen at equilibrium. We show that by restricting the strategy space of the firms to parameterized supply functions, we can provide upper bounds on both the inflation of aggregate cost at the Nash equilibrium relative to the socially optimal level, as well as the markup of the Nash equilibrium price above the competitive level: as long as N &gt; 2 firms are competing, these quantities are both upper bounded by 1 + 1/(N − 2). This result holds even in the presence of asymmetric cost structure across firms. We also discuss several extensions, generalizations, and related issues. </jats:p>",

Terwiesch. 2002. Managing demand and sales dynamics in new product diffusion under supply constraint. Management Sci. 48(2) 187–206) show that it is never optimal to refuse to satisfy any customers when the firm has inventory of the product. On the other hand, in a very similar model, Kumar and Swaminathan (Kumar, S., J. M. Swaminathan. 2003. Diffusion of innovations under supply constraints. Oper. Res. 51(6) 866–879) show that production constraints may in fact lead a firm to reject customers' orders even when the firm has the inventory to satisfy them (to slow down new product diffusion). We provide a counterexample to the results of Ho et al. (2002) and show that in their and Kumar and Swaminathan's (2003) models, it may be optimal to deny customers a product in inventory. We provide a generalization of both models that includes the ability to dynamically price the product (and also allows capacity and production costs to vary over time). We show that the unintuitive but optimal behavior of denying customers products that are in inventory disappears when the firm can dynamically set prices. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Candace A.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under the rapid growth of world’s economy and population, the demand for water and energy has been increasing accordingly. Moreover, water and energy are interrelated and form a reinforcing feedback loop. Energy is used not only onsite of water supply systems, but also indirectly for producing materials used in the water systems. As a result, it is important to understand and evaluate the energy embodiment of water supply for sustainable water and energy management. This study uses the Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment software to estimate and compare the embodied energy of one China water supply system (System A) and one US water supply system (System B). It has been found that System B in the US has comparable direct operational energy consumption with System A in China; however, System B consumes much more indirect energy and constructional energy than System A. Possible reasons for the higher indirect energy use in System B might be more administrative and engineering (maintenance and repairing) services involved, lower transportation efficiency, more self water usage within the system and higher labor rates. To satisfy the water demand for the large population, China’s water supply systems have to reduce direct energy consumption during the operation phase by conducting energy budget and adopting energy efficient technologies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Material flow in production systems can be controlled by a purely push-pull (just-in-time), or by a hybrid push-pull control mechanism. One type of push-pull production control can be implemented by controlling only the last stage during part withdrawals to trigger the production at the first stage. While the final stage is operated according to a pull mechanism, intermediate stages are operated according to a push system of control in order to keep the work-in-process (WIP) at a constant level. Since the WIP levels are limited in hybrid systems, production output rate is very susceptible to equipment failures. In order to establish suitable WIP capacities between the stages of production, it is essential to analyze the production line using appropriate models and tools. This paper develops a discrete iterative model to study and analyze behavior of a push-pull system with unreliable equipment at any stage. The model is utilized to optimize WIP capacities at intermediate stages and number of kanbans at the last stage. Furthermore, an experimental design is set up to analyze effects of various maintenance policies, line design parameters, and operational factors on line performance measures by using simulation results from the model.</p>",

Different from conventional 6T SRAM design, the trip point voltage of proposed design changes according to bit-line voltage values. In this way, its read margin is 45% greater than conventional 6T SRAM. The proposed bit-cell exhibits wide hysteresis effect, making the design less vulnerable to process variation. Its hold margin is 30.2% greater than conventional 6T SRAM. The optimum-energy supply voltage of proposed array (256×16) is 400 mV. At the same time, the power consumption at 400 mV decreases to 16% compared to that at 1200 mV.</jats:p>"

One of the most challenging dynamics of the Horn River, British Columbia, Canada shale play has been the increasing number of fracture stimulations required per horizontal wellbore. Of critical importance is the massive volume of water required to supply the 24/7 fracturing operations. In an effort to eliminate the reliance on surface waters, Encana engaged in a novel approach to produce high volumes of sour waters from a relatively unknown under-pressurized saline aquifer. The challenge was designin7g an appropriate high volume lift system capable of producing and achieving volumes of up to 8,500 m3/d/wellbore while addressing unknown fluid inflows, fluid transmissibility &amp; re-charge, and reservoir fluid chemistry characteristics.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Electric submersible pumps (ESPs) have proved to be a successful and reliable artificial lift system for production of high volumes of fluid for many decades. This paper describes the steps undertaken by Encana in designing, piloting and successful field implementation of full scale high volume sour water lift ESP systems. These systems have demonstrated significant potential to alleviate the high costs, production withdrawal limitations and environmental impact of delivering large volumes of fracture supply waters in a remote Northerly region. Modifications to the wellbore completion architecture, equipment design and techniques to optimize pumping operations and water distribution from the field trials are presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Many strategies have been developed to manage supply chain operations effectively. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) system is one of the prevalent strategic tools of the supply side logistics based on the electronic data exchange and business process automation among the suppliers and customers to enhance the competitive advantage. VMI is widely used in different industries including automotive sector. The VMI concept is a continuous replenishment program where suppliers are given access to demand and inventory level of customers and they are fully responsible for managing and replenishing the customer’s stock. VMI’s extension on customer satisfaction cannot be perceived sufficiently by decision-makers who are responsible to develop and invest in the customer-supplier relationship. This paper presents a path model using the method of Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to give insight to decision-makers to understand effect of the VMI adoption on customer satisfaction. This paper investigates both determinants of relative factors of successful VMI adoption and the relationship in the supply chain with an empirical automotive industry case. The results show that the collaboration and coordination between customer and supplier and infrastructure of the information-sharing are the important dimensions to add value to the supply chain and to enhance customer satisfaction.</p>",

The oscillations in demand and inventory as orders pass through the system have been widely studied in literature. Studies have shown that supply networks can display some of the key characteristics of chaotic systems. Chaos theory is the study of complex, nonlinear, dynamic systems; therefore it can be useful for studying the dynamics of supply networks. In this paper the authors implemented a system dynamic approach and simulated a chaotic multi-level supply network. The authors analyzed the effects of decision parameters, delivery lead time and shipping lot-size on chaotic behavior of the whole supply network. The simulation revealed that an increment in lead times or shipping lot-size has a similar impact on chaotic behavior of the system and reduces the chance of chaotic behavior occurrence.</p>",

It will demonstrate how interpretive structural modeling (ISM) supports risk managers in identifying and understanding interdependencies among supply chain risks on different levels (e.g. 3PL, first‐tier supplier, focal company, etc.).

The input to the algorithm has to be well‐defined to give the user an exact understanding of all risks that have to be assessed, i.e. the better the input to ISM is prepared the better the outcome and representation will be.

Technological forces were found as an enabler for FSC geographical dispersion whereas the other three factors could be both barriers and enablers. The implications of these four influential factors drive FSC towards four key patterns of FSC geographical dispersion: local supply chain (SC), supply‐proximity SC, market‐proximity SC, and international SC.

The consideration of additional influential factors such as labour movement between developing countries, currency fluctuations and labour costs, would also enrich the framework as well as improve the quality and validity of the research findings. The different strategies employed by the case companies and their implications on FSC location decisions should also be further investigated along with cases outside Thailand, to provide a more comprehensive view of FSC geographical location decisions.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>This paper provides insights how FSC is geographically located in both supply‐side and demand‐side from a manufacturing firm's view.

Through a model built using extant theory and a survey of shippers and motor carriers, study results exemplify the potential for clarification that exists in this important area of research faces.

Consumers have the option of purchasing the product early, before its value has been learned, or delaying the purchase decision until a time at which valuation uncertainty has been resolved. Whereas individual consumer valuations are uncertain ex ante, the market size is uncertain to the firm. The firm may either commit to a single production run at a low unit cost prior to learning demand, or commit to a quick response strategy that allows additional production after learning additional demand information. We find that the value of quick response is generally lower with strategic (forward-looking) customers than with nonstrategic (myopic) customers in this setting. Indeed, it is possible for a quick response strategy to decrease the profit of the firm, though whether this occurs depends on various characteristics of the market; specifically, we identify conditions under which quick response increases profit (when prices are increasing, when dissatisfied consumers can return the product at a cost to the firm) and conditions under which quick response may decrease profit (when prices are constant or when consumer returns are not allowed). </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations and supply chain management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Trade credit is a well established promotional tool in the present competitive world and its impact on demand cannot be ignored. Businesses often use trade credit to increase their market share and, in turn, the profit. Undoubtedly, trade credit plays a great role in increasing the demand but it also involves a great risk of non-payment. In order to reduce the risk of non-payment, businessman at times use a partial trade credit policy in which they demand a certain percentage of the total amount from the customer at the time of purchase and offers the credit for the remaining amount. Furthermore, it is also observed that the demand of FMCG is highly price sensitive. In order to see the effect of credit and price together, on demand, the retailer’s demand is taken as a function of price and credit period. Moreover it is assumed that the supplier offers the full credit to the retailer but the retailer passes a partial credit to customers. The inventory model, determines the optimal replenishment time, credit period, and price for the retailer that maximizes profit. Numerical examples have been provided to support the model followed by the comprehensive sensitivity analysis.</p>",

The authors first analyze the effect of different pricing strategies on the retail price, wholesale price and profits. The cooperative strategy is also studied to see how it benefits both parties in the dual channel supply chain. Finally, through a numerical example, it is demonstrated that providing convenience of the direct channel is important for the manufacturer and service is a distinctive advantage for the retailer. Furthermore, the paper shows that if the service quality has a significant effect on the direct channel, then the manufacturer tends to abandon commitment of equal pricing strategy.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyzes the optimal procurement, processing, and production decisions of a meat-processing company (hereafter, a “packer”) in a beef supply chain. The packer processes fed cattle to produce two beef products, program (premium) boxed beef and commodity boxed beef, in fixed proportions, but with downward substitution of the premium product for the commodity product. The packer can source input (fed cattle) from a contract market, where long-term contracts are signed in advance of the required delivery time, and from a spot market on the spot day. Contract prices are taken to be of a general window form, linear in the spot price but capped by upper and lower limits on realized contract price. Our analysis provides managerial insights on the interaction of window contract terms with processing options. We show that the packer benefits from a low correlation between the spot price and product market uncertainties, and this is independent of the form of the window contract. Although the expected revenues from processing increase in spot price variability, the overall impact on profitability depends on the parameters of the window contract. Using a calibration based on the report by the GIPSA (Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration. 2007. GIPSA livestock and meat marketing study, vol. 3: Fed cattle and beef industries. Report, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC), this paper elucidates for the first time the value of long-term contracting as a complement to spot sourcing in the beef supply chain. Our comparative statics results provide some rules of thumb for the packer for the strategic management of the procurement portfolio. In particular, we show that higher variability (higher spot price variability, product market variability, and correlation) increases the profits of the packer, but decreases the reliance on the contract market relative to the spot market. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

The three-phase programmable power supply using DDS synthesizer can change the phase angle through changing triggering time of frequency update and adjusts amplitude through multiplier. It can generate three-phase signal voltage whose amplitude and phase angle can be adjusted by program. So it is suitable for the instrument for measuring the errors of transformer with its actual burden load. By using the instrument an environment of actual burden load is simulated completely.

According to an actual central air-conditioning system of residential buildings, we calculated the daily inlet water temperature of FCU and proposed the adjustment law for supply water temperature. The results show that the supply water temperature of cooling design day is 9.3°C, the daily supply water temperature of cooling season is higher than 7°C; the supply water temperature of heating design day is 36.4°C, the highest in heating season is 38.5°C, which is below the rated supply water temperature of heat pump unit, 45°C.</jats:p>"

However, these production-based accounts represent a single point in the value chain of fossil fuels, which may have been extracted elsewhere and may be used to provide goods or services to consumers elsewhere. We present a consistent set of carbon inventories that spans the full supply chain of global CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emissions, finding that 10.2 billion tons CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>or 37% of global emissions are from fossil fuels traded internationally and an additional 6.4 billion tons CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>or 23% of global emissions are embodied in traded goods. Our results reveal vulnerabilities and benefits related to current patterns of energy use that are relevant to climate and energy policy. In particular, if a consistent and unavoidable price were imposed on CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emissions somewhere along the supply chain, then all of the parties along the supply chain would seek to impose that price to generate revenue from taxes collected or permits sold. The geographical concentration of carbon-based fuels and relatively small number of parties involved in extracting and refining those fuels suggest that regulation at the wellhead, mine mouth, or refinery might minimize transaction costs as well as opportunities for leakage.</jats:p>",

Das Römische Recht beantwortet diese Frage positiv, weil immer der Schuldner in mora debitoris das Risiko trägt; fast alle modernen Kodifikationen hingegen befreien den Schuldner von seiner Haftung, wenn der Gegenstand, zu dessen Lieferung der Schuldner verpflichtet war, auch im Falle der rechtzeitigen Lieferung zerstört worden wäre. Der vorliegende Artikel versucht zu erklären, wie die römischrechtliche Regel verändert wurde und ob die Modifikation eine Verbesserung darstellt oder nicht. Im Rahmen der Konklusion wird auch die hierzu im DCFR vorgesehene Lösung kurz erörtert.</jats:p>",

A high-resolution, 3-dimensional coupled biophysical model is used to simulate ocean circulation and ecosystem variations at the shelfbreak front of the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). Favorable comparisons between satellite observations and model hindcast solutions from January 2004 to November 2007 indicate the model has intrinsic skills in resolving fundamental physical and biological dynamics at the MAB shelfbreak. Seasonal and interannual variability of ocean physical and biological states and their driving mechanisms are further analyzed. The domain-wide upper water column nutrient content is found to peak in late winter-early spring. Phytoplankton spring bloom starts 1–2 months later, followed by zooplankton bloom in early summer. Our analysis shows the variability of shelfbreak nutrient supply is controlled by local mixing that deepens the mixed layer and injects deep ocean nutrients into the upper water column and alongshore nutrient transport by the shelfbreak jet and associated currents. Nutrient vertical advection associated with the shelfbreak bottom boundary layer convergence is another significant contributor. Spring mean nutrient budget diagnostics along the Nantucket transect are compared between nutrient rich 2004 and nutrient poor 2007. Physical advection and diffusion play the major role in determining strong interannual variations in shelfbreak nutrient content. The biological (source minus sink) term is very similar between these two years.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The significant economic importance of the country’s automotive industry provided the context for this study. The success of the industry relies on the effectiveness and efficiency of the supply chain, which can be significantly affected by the strength of the supply chain relationships. The role of trust and information sharing in relation to two key theories was considered, namely: organisational information processing theory and game theory. Previous studies have recognised the importance of trust and information sharing in supply chain relationships and considered the effect of trust on information sharing, or the effect of information sharing on trust in a single direction. Thus, the potential cyclical relationship between the two factors has been largely ignored.Objectives: This paper explored the relationship between trust and information sharing in South African automotive supply chains, and establishes the importance of nurturing a cyclical relationship between these two factors. In addition, the role of information technology (IT) in supporting this relationship was considered. By improving both trust and information sharing, the performance and competitiveness of the supply chain can be improved.Method: An examination of the effects of a lack of trust in a supply chain relationship, and the consequential lack of information flow, was conducted by means of a case study of an Eastern Cape-based automotive supplier. A case study research method was followed for this study, which made use of multiple data collection methods, including document survey and participant observations. The case selected is an East London based subsidiary of a larger multinational automotive component supplier to both local and international automotive original equipment manufacturers.Results: The findings led to the conclusion that the way forward for competitive supply chains is to build trust in the supply chain in order to improve information flow, and vice versa. Information technology can be used to nurture this cyclical relationship between trust and information sharing.Conclusion: It is proposed that simultaneously improving information flow and trust in an interorganisational relationship leads to improved supply chain performance and competitiveness.</jats:p>"

However, the vendor is not able to realize supply chain coordination with only quantity discount contract if the buyer's holding cost is private information since the buyer may keep this information private for bargaining a higher price discount. Nevertheless, quantity discount contract is still beneficial to the vendor as compared to the case without quantity discount.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>In this paper, impacts of the unbalanced voltage supply conditions and inverter harmonics on accurate broken bar fault diagnosis in induction motors are investigated in detail. It is presented that amplitude of the side‐band components at frequencies <jats:italic>(</jats:italic>1 ± 2<jats:italic>ks)f<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic> as a well‐known index is not competent for accurate broken bar fault detection in induction motors in the presence of unbalanced voltage supply. Thus, the above mentioned frequency pattern is modified for precise broken bar fault recognition in induction motors under unbalanced voltage supply conditions. Amplitude of the side‐band components at frequencies [<jats:italic>k</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>(1 − <jats:italic>s</jats:italic>) ± <jats:italic>s</jats:italic>]<jats:italic>f<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic> is proposed as a proper index for precise broken bar fault identification in the aforementioned conditions. In order to evaluate proposed index competency, effects of the load variation and unbalanced supply deviation on the proposed index are analyzed. Furthermore, electromotive force of the healthy and faulty induction motors has been calculated, and side‐band components at frequencies <jats:italic>[k/p(</jats:italic>1 <jats:italic>− s)</jats:italic> ± <jats:italic>s]f<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic> are extracted from the electromotive force spectra which is nominated as a new technique for precise broken bar fault recognition in induction motors. Comparison of simulation and experimental results verifies the method's ability to detect broken bars with an unbalanced voltage supply and inverter harmonics.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sustainability and globally competitive forest product supply markets are two of the pressures that forest managers face today. Both require that managers have good metrics of the quantity, quality, and location of timber resources within their forests. The value of this information must be weighed against the cost of obtaining it and losses associated with not having access to it. A cost-plus-loss procedure for assessing the relative contributions to error in estimating stand-level value recovery and log product yields was developed and tested on two Douglas-fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) stands in Oregon. The sources of error were those associated with (i) market complexity, (ii) sampling intensity, (iii) stem quality assessment methods, and (iv) bucking optimization algorithms. Two performance measures were used as part of the assessment procedure: market fulfilment and the difference in total net value recovery between having complete and less than complete information. Average market fulfilment ranged between 60% and 100%. The difference in total net value recovery ranged from –21.2% to +0.8%. Stem quality assessment followed by bucking optimization algorithms and sampling intensity had the greatest effects on these performance measures. Market complexity had a negligible effect on these performance measures but affected net value recovery. </jats:p>",

A racetrack design was used to maximise the high frequency response, yielding high inductance density and low DC resistance. The magnetic core was subsequently closed using a magnetic thin film deposition over a dielectric deposited on the Cu coils. Homogeneous ferromagnetic alloy, Ni45Fe55 of uniform thickness over a high aspect-ratio 3D structure has been achieved. Ni45Fe55 was chosen for the fabrication of micromagnetic cores due to its relatively high saturation flux density (1.6 T), resistivity (48 mΩ cm) and anisotropy field (9.5 Oe).

This suite supports the effective management of human capital supply chains by addressing distinct features of human talent that cannot be handled via traditional supply chain management. OTM consists of novel solutions for (1) statistical forecasting of demand and human capital requirements, (2) risk-based stochastic human-talent capacity planning, (3) stochastic modeling and optimization (control) of human capital supply evolutionary dynamics over time, (4) optimal multiskill supply-demand matching, and (5) stochastic optimization of business decisions and investments to manage human capital shortages and overages. The OTM suite was developed and deployed as an important part of the human capital management and planning process within IBM, providing support for decision making to drive better business performance. This is achieved through important contributions in the areas of stochastic models and optimization (control), and the innovative application and integration of these models and methods in human capital management applications. </jats:p>",

As such, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Ecological Footprint (EF) and Biocapacity (BC) in a given watershed are important topics in the field of sustainability research based on remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques．This paper reports on a case study of the Jinghe River Watershed using improved EF methodology with the help of GIS and high resolution remote sensing data, to quantitatively estimate the relationship between EF demand and BC supply and analyze their spatial distribution patterns at multiple spatial scales for four periods (1986, 1995, 2000 and 2008). We predict the future BC both overall, and of six categories of biological productivity area for the next four decades using the Markov Chain Method．The results showed that the spatial distribution of EF demand and BC supply were significantly uneven in the region, in which the per-capita EF of all counties located in the watershed increased continually from 1986 to 2008, and the EF per person of counties in the middle and lower reaches area was markedly greater than that in the upper reaches over time. On the supply side, the per-capita BC of all counties decreased gradually from 1986 to 2008, and the per-capita BC of counties in the upper reaches area was greater than that in the middle and lower reaches during the period, causing the uneven spatial distribution of Ecological budget-the gap between supply and demand, showed that the Jinghe River Watershed on the whole has begun to be unsustainable since 2008, with each county exhibiting differential temporal patterns. The prediction results showed that the total BC will increase continually from 2020 to 2050, and the BC of six categories will reduce, indicating that unsustainability in the region will escalate. As a whole, The EF demand has exceeded the BC supply, and the gap was widening in the Jinghe Watershed. This paper provided an in-depth portrait of the spatiotemporal dynamics of EF and BC, as well as their interactions with humanity and ecosystems.</jats:p>"

The present study re-examined this premise using treatments where added ALA from linseed oil was matched with ALA plus SDA from echium oil. Lambs (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 6) were abomasally infused with saline (control (C), 25 ml), echium oil low (EL, 25 ml), echium oil high (EH, 50 ml), linseed oil low (LL, 25 ml) or linseed oil high (LH, 50 ml) for 4 weeks. The basal ration used was identical across all treatments. EPA (20 : 5<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>-3) in meat increased from 6·5 mg in the C lambs to 16·8, 17·7, 13·5 and 11·7 (<jats:sc>sem</jats:sc> 0·86) mg/100 g muscle in the EL, EH, LL and LH lambs, respectively. For muscle DPA (docosapentaenoic acid; 22 : 5<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>-3), the corresponding values were 14·3, 22·2, 18·6 18·2 and 19·4 (<jats:sc>sem</jats:sc> 0·57) mg/100 g muscle. The DHA (22 : 6<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>-3) content of meat was 5·8 mg/100 g in the C lambs and ranged from 4·53 to 5·46 (<jats:sc>sem</jats:sc> 0·27) mg/100 g muscle in the oil-infused groups.

We conclude that both oil types were effective in enhancing the EPA and DPA, but not DHA, content of meat. Furthermore, we conclude that, when balanced for precursor <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>-3 fatty acid supply, differences between linseed oil and echium oil in enriching meat with LC <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>-3 PUFA were of little, if any, nutritional significance.</jats:p>",

Here, we use genetic and genomic approaches in a “split-root” framework—in which physically isolated root systems of the same plant are challenged with different nitrogen (N) environments—to investigate how systemic signaling affects genome-wide reprogramming and root development. The integration of transcriptome and root phenotypes enables us to identify distinct mechanisms underlying “N economy” (i.e., N supply and demand) of plants as a system. Under nitrate-limited conditions, plant roots adopt an “active-foraging strategy”, characterized by lateral root outgrowth and a shared pattern of transcriptome reprogramming, in response to either local or distal nitrate deprivation. By contrast, in nitrate-replete conditions, plant roots adopt a “dormant strategy”, characterized by a repression of lateral root outgrowth and a shared pattern of transcriptome reprogramming, in response to either local or distal nitrate supply. Sentinel genes responding to systemic N signaling identified by genome-wide comparisons of heterogeneous vs. homogeneous split-root N treatments were used to probe systemic N responses in\n            <jats:italic>Arabidopsis</jats:italic>\n            mutants impaired in nitrate reduction and hormone synthesis and also in decapitated plants.

In order to characterize the resulting large collection of isolates, an automated low-cost typing method was developed. The multiplex capillary-based variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) (multiple-locus VNTR analysis [MLVA]) assay requiring only one PCR amplification per isolate ensures a high level of discrimination and reduces hands-on and time requirements. In less than 2 days and using one 4-capillary apparatus, 217 environmental isolates collected between 2000 and 2009 and 5 clinical isolates obtained during outbreaks in 2000 and 2006 in Rennes were analyzed, and 15 different genotypes were identified. A large cluster of isolates with closely related genotypes and representing 77% of the population was composed exclusively of environmental isolates extracted from hot water supply systems. It was not responsible for the known Rennes epidemic cases, although strains showing a similar MLVA profile have regularly been involved in European outbreaks. The clinical isolates in Rennes had the same genotype as isolates contaminating a mall's cooling tower. This study further demonstrates that unknown environmental or genetic factors contribute to the pathogenicity of some strains. This work illustrates the potential of the high-throughput MLVA typing method to investigate the origin of legionellosis cases by allowing the systematic typing of any new isolate and inclusion of data in shared databases.\n          </jats:p>",
