In most regional econometric models the labor market is primarily demand-oriented. It generally includes an employment sector where the employment relationships take the form of inverse production functions. A behavioral relationship for the regional unemployment rate is often a component of this sector, enabling the calculation, through an identity, of a regional labor force and the number of people unemployed. Direct consideration of supply characteristics of the labor market is either forgotten or included as an afterthought. The methods that other researchers have utilized in attempting to develop forecasts of labor supply are reviewed first. A detailed description of the components of the labor supply model as it has been incorporated into a regional econometric model of Tennessee follows.</jats:p>"

Cross‐sections from the tenuissimus, the biceps femoris, the lateral head (LG) and the medial head (MG) of the gastrocnemius and the soleus were cut in a cryostat. The sections were stained histochemically for the NADH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐diaphorase and alkaline (pH 9.4) actomyosin ATPase activity, which enables differentiation of different types of fibres. The endothelium of the capillaries was identified <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> staining for unspecific alkaline ATPase activity. The number of capillaries surrounding each individual muscle fibre had a positive correlation, first to the oxidative capacity and secondly to the average diameter of the fibres. The thin tenuissimus muscle did not differ in this respect from the thicker muscles. The highest proportion of SO fibres was found in the soleus and the MG muscles. FG fibres of two different types were dominating the fibre mass in the biceps femoris and the LG muscles, while the tenuissimus contained more FOG fibres than these muscles. In general the FG fibres had a larger diameter than the FOG and the SO fibres. The soleus and the MG muscles contained larger fibres than the other examined muscles.

The amount of exudation was correlated with a P‐induced decrease in phospholipid levels and associated changes in permeability properties of root membranes, rather than with changes in the root content of sugars and amino nitrogen.

We estimated the potential of such a system paced by the demand for red cells and predicted that the use of 20% of fresh whole blood and 80% concentrates would not increase the demand for albumin, the yield of which would suffice to cover three‐quarters of current needs in our country. The actual performance of a program using 85% of red cell concentrates in a university hospital with an exceptionally high incidence of major hemorrhage was analyzed in detail. The use of albumin per unit of transfused red cells rose by 9%. With a nationwide increase of this magnitude, 67% of the demand in our country could still be met and the estimated true need for albumin of 200 kg per million inhabitants and year would be fully covered. The yield of factor VIII is 200–300% of the demand. The determinants of the effects of such a system vary from country to country, but its fundamental potential is obviously considerable.</jats:p>",
