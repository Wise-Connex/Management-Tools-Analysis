The long durability of the construction “product” contributes to the volatility. The product specification process before the customer order arrives shows different degrees of specifications: engineer to order, modify to order, configure to order, select a variant. (The common make‐to‐stock in traditional manufacturing does not exist.) A construction company only executes a small part of the project by its own personnel and capacity. This is a way of risk spreading and risk mitigation and to compensate for an unstable market. If a construction company wants to establish a new concept, from “engineer to order” to e.g. “configure to order”, it must be engaged earlier in the business process and with other than usual customers, which might complicate the process.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>Experiences from Sweden and Swedish developments are the main source of information.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper introduces the articles that are a source of scientifically generated knowledge regarding various problems and opportunities associated with supply chain management in the project‐based construction industry.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Lean thinking is an approach that has been adopted in many different industrial settings as a means for improving supply chain performance.

A case study approach is used for illustrating the production and subsequent delivery and installation of plasterboards to a specific construction project.

In addition to sequential interdependence it describes and illustrates pooled interdependence based on joint resource utilisation, reciprocal interdependence among activities undertaken at the construction site, and interdependence owing to synchronisation of many supply chains in relation to each and every construction project. The combined effects of these interdependencies challenge traditional SCM recommendations, such as moving activities from the site to the factory.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The main theoretical argument put forward in this paper is that the application of SCM models developed for other industrial contexts such as the automotive industry, are problematic to use in the construction industry. This is because these models emphasise integration of activities that are subject mainly to sequential interdependencies while the pattern of interdependence is very different in construction. A main implication for practice is that focusing on better planning in order to deal with activities that are mainly subject to sequential interdependence, is insufficient. The reciprocal interdependencies in construction require more frequent and direct interaction among the involved actors to enable mutual adjustments among the firms whose activities and resource use need to be coordinated.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Unfortunately, strategic supply chain management (SSCM) and its general framework have seldom been addressed. SSCM refers to a situation in which its members always realize the whole direction and strategy when a supply chain carries out various functional activities to achieve a competitive advantage and long-term profit-making position among supply chains in the same industry. This study discusses how to develop not only a supply chain’s overall competitive strategic direction, but also the objective of the entire supply chain with those objectives of its members, thus optimizing the performance of the supply chain. Moreover, this study presents a general SSCM framework including three stages, namely strategy formulation, strategy implementation and strategy evaluation. Also discussed herein are the limitations of this study that could be addressed in future.</jats:p>",

Both risks and benefits of using a vendor in supply chain are identified for inclusion in the evaluation process. Since these factors can be objective and subjective, a hybrid approach that applies to both quantitative and qualitative factors is used in the development of the model. Taguchi loss functions are used to measure performance of each supplier candidate with respect to the risks and benefits. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the relative importance of these factors to the decision maker. The weighted loss scores are then calculated for each supplier by using the relative importance as the weights. The composite weighted loss scores are used for ranking of the suppliers. The supplier with the smallest loss score is recommended for selection.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Inclusion of both risk and benefit categories in the evaluation process provides a comprehensive decision tool.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The proposed model provides guidelines for supply chain managers to make an informed decision regarding supplier selection.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Combining Taguchi loss function and AHP provides a novel approach for ranking of potential suppliers for outsourcing purposes.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In this article, we build aggregate supply models for four roundwood products in a seven-state region of the US South directly from stand-level harvest choice models applied to detailed forest inventories. These models allow for a more precise accounting of the biological and economic underpinnings of supply and support forecasting of changes in forest inventories with a high degree of detail. Estimation results support use of the approach. The elasticities of softwood and hardwood sawtimber supply, 0.34 and 0.31, respectively, are consistent with the elasticities reported by previous studies. The elasticities of softwood and hardwood pulpwood supply (respectively, 0.062 and 0.025) are much lower than previous studies found for pulpwood supply, and cross-price elasticities indicate a dominant influence of sawtimber markets on pulpwood supply. Results generally indicate complementarity between sawtimber and pulpwood supply in the short run. This approach can provide a means of predicting the supply consequences of exogenous factors that could alter forest inventories, e.g., climate change and invasive species, and support regular updating of supply models as new inventory data are recorded.</jats:p>",

And we study the basic structure and the operating principles of ZVT-boost soft-switching PFC circuit and the implementing principle of soft switch. For the power requirements, the two-stage PFC circuit is used. The forward stage is a single-phase Boost Power Factor Correction circuit and the backward stage main circuit is a full-bridge converter with the phase-shifting control soft-switching technique.

Although travel agents and tour operators serve as crucial intermediaries between tourists and destinations, the ecotourism literature has largely ignored the ways in which retailers and suppliers of tourism experience approach and define ecotourism. Using quantitative data gathered from 300 travel agents and tour operators, this paper illustrates that the conceptualisation of ecotourism among agents and operators in Chiang Mai is expansive, flexible and, in some ways, internally contradictory.

The proposed converter is found capable of suppressing up to 27 harmonic currents in the ac mains. The power factor is also improved to near unity over a wide operating range of the SMPS.  The design and analysis of the proposed ac-dc converter is carried-out in detail. A laboratory prototype of the autoconnected transformer based 28-pulse ac-dc converter is developed, and various tests have been conducted on it to validate the simulated performance of the proposed converter. Several experimental results are also included to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed converter.</jats:p>",

If a leak exists in the liner, an anomaly in the measured potential is generated in the immediate vicinity of the leak through which electrical current is flowing. But the power supply current above the liner can affect the potential distribution. A current point source model for power supply current was set up in this paper. The potential equation induced by the point source was derived. The analysis of potential expression shows that: 1) the potential generated by the power supply current is proportional to the current size and the medium resistivity; 2) as the medium thickness increases, the potential reduces; 3) to reduce the influence of power supply current, the power supply electrode should be away from the detection area as far as possible.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a methodological review of OSCM empirical research in 2002–2007 is provided to highlight that OSCM empirical studies, unlike those in other business disciplines, have rarely used content analysis as a methodological tool. This paper then reviews the methodological strengths of content analysis, which lie primarily in its malleability, economy of data collection, repeatability, and unobtrusiveness. These strengths not only make content analysis a viable empirical method but also position it as a method that can be used in concert with other empirical methods in OSCM research, such as survey, case study, and secondary research methodologies. This paper also proposes a generic framework for a content analytic approach to measuring theoretical constructs, illustrates the application of the framework to a construct in the OSCM literature (buyer–supplier relationalism), and reports the satisfactory results of reliability and validity tests for the content analysis‐based measure of buyer–supplier relationalism. In addition, this paper proposes and demonstrates that the use of convergence study in tandem with content analysis can substantially reduce the content analysis efforts needed in measuring the construct of interest, thus improving the overall efficiency of the process of content analysis.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The retailer orders from the manufacturer (supplier) prior to the selling season and then sells to the market. We examine how a manufacturer can structure a weather-linked rebate to improve his expected profit. The proposed class of rebate contracts offers several advantages over many other contract structures, including no required verification of leftover inventory and/or markdown amounts, and no adverse effect on sales effort by the retailer. We provide a thorough analysis of the manufacturer's and retailer's decisions in this context. We show that the weather-linked rebate can take many different forms, and this flexibility allows the supplier to design contracts that are Pareto improving and/or limit his risk in offering the contract and the retailer's risk in accepting it. For weather rebates with certain characteristics, the manufacturer can fully hedge his risks of offering a weather rebate by paying a risk premium; we show how this can be accomplished. We also show that the basic structural results extend to settings in which the two parties would like to limit their risk. </jats:p>",

It was used a 5² fractionated factorial scheme with 13 combinations of nitrogen and potassium, which were distributed in a randomized block design, with four replications. The nitrogen × potassium interaction was significant for the number of tillers and leaves, for leaf area, for shoots and root section dry mass, for total length and surface and specific length and surface in the roots. Production of aerial part dry mass positively correlated with the number of tillers and leaves and grass leaf area. Nitrogen rates modulated the root system development, and the root specific length and surface decreased when high rates of nitrogen and potassium were supllied. Nitrogen and potassium influence Marandu palisadegrass morphogenic characteristics, which are determinant for grass dry matter production.</jats:p>",

This study includes taxonomy and fishery data obtained from field collections and from interviews with the fishermen, carried out in March and July of 2001. The systematic record and fishery data were obtained from the most common species of the ichthyofauna of the mid-Tocantins River. A critical examination of fish resources from this area allows us to conclude that the large commercial species have decreased in number and are qualitatively reduced in that area of Tocantins. This fact may be a result of breaking the main channel of Tocantins, first by the hydroelectric power dam of Tucurui, twenty years ago, followed by the formation of the hydroelectric reservoirs of Lageado, Peixe Angical and Serra da Mesa, that transformed the main channel of Tocantins into a successive cascade of reservoirs. Those events may perhaps modify the profile of the fish community in that area. The obtained data also permit an examination of fisheries in the area, providing an appraisal on forthcoming problems that will be faced by fishermen of Colônia de Pesca Z-35.</jats:p>",

In particular, the requirement of IF in river flow constraints the reservoir operation that focuses on water supply of municipal and irrigation use. This study focuses on evaluating the impact of IF on municipal and irrigation use from which the Waco reservoir is supplied. The exceedance frequencies of stream flow are performed based on three conditions: pre‐ or post‐dam construction condition and reservoir storage reallocation condition. The monthly IF percentage expressed as a percentage of naturalized flow is computed using naturalized flow and IF available in Texas Water Availability Model (WAM) and applied to generate the monthly IF for 1939–1997 hydrologic‐simulation periods. The effects of IF use are assessed on period and volume reliabilities for municipal and irrigation use. Sensitivity analysis was performed to provide the optimal amount and range of IF using two different kinds of constant and seasonal IF use percentage rate plans. These results in this study indicate that the presence of IF has not changed the exceedance frequencies of low flow but reduced exceedance frequencies of flood flows. Period and volume reliabilities for municipal and irrigation use have decreased by 2 or 4%. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Australia has experienced a growing rate of child disability, with the rate of 3.7 per cent in 1998 increasing to 4.3 per cent in 2003 for children aged under four years and from 9.5 per cent to 10 per cent for children aged five to 14 years in the same period. However, surprisingly no study has examined the economic effects of child disability in the Australian context. This paper attempts to quantify the link between a child's disability and the work behaviour of the female in the affected family. Our findings provide empirical justifications for the current policy linking the severity level of child disability to the assessment of eligibility for Carer Payment (Child). We also found that child disability has different impacts on the labour market activities of married women and non‐married women. It appears that child disability imposes a greater hardship on non‐married women than on married women in terms of work choice decision. Once non‐married women manage to enter the labour force, they may have to stay on to work as usual even if they have a disabled child, because they may not have other family members to turn to for help as married women do.</jats:p>",

While extant inquiry is informative, there is a lack of investigations that center on supply chain investment decisions when facing high levels of risk uncertainty. Given the potential dollar value involved in these decisions, an understanding of how these supply chain decisions are made is of significant theoretical and practical importance. Real options theory, with its focus on decision making under conditions of uncertainty, is an appealing theoretical lens for this endeavor. In essence, real options theory asserts that managerial decisions center on creating and then exercising or not exercising certain opportunities. To date, theorizing about and investigations of real options have used firms as their focus. Not yet examined are real options within supply chains that cross firm boundaries and drive much of the competitive activity in the modern economy. Accordingly, we extend real options theory to the supply chain context by examining how different types of options are approached relative to supply chain project investments. Specifically, we theorize how the options will be related to perceived value under conditions of high supply chain risk uncertainty. Overall, our investigation builds knowledge by extending real options theory to the supply chain context and by providing evidence suggesting some options operate differently in supply chains than they do in firms.</jats:p>",

Its original concept of a future power delivery system having different service levels to meet each customer or load requirement at the same time was proposed as Flexible, Reliable, and Intelligent Electrical eNergy Delivery System (FRIENDS). The effectiveness of the developed power system was measured during an actual field demonstration conducted in 2007 by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Sendai, Japan. Its effectiveness in feeding four classes of alternative current (AC) and one of direct current (DC) power while meeting various customer requirements was confirmed. Some sets of test data and an analysis using the data indicate that the developed system meets all the requirements for DG‐related plants and has additional benefits. The power system maintains voltage and frequency conditions without interruption in the every state, grid interconnection, islanding, and backup modes.

This method considers (1) contributing areas and travel times of groundwater flowpaths converging at individual supply wells, (2) the oxic and/or anoxic conditions encountered along each flowpath, and (3) the combined effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and contaminant‐ and oxic/anoxic‐specific biodegradation. Contributing areas and travel times were assessed using particle tracks generated from calibrated regional groundwater flow models. These results were then used to estimate VOC concentrations relative to an unspecified initial concentration (<jats:italic>C/C</jats:italic><jats:sub>0</jats:sub>) at individual public supply wells. The results show that the vulnerability of public supply wells to VOC contamination varies widely between different regional aquifers. Low‐recharge rates, long travel times, and the predominantly oxic conditions characteristic of Basin and Range aquifers in the western United States leads to lower vulnerability to VOCs, particularly to petroleum hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene. On the other hand, high recharge rates and short residence times characteristic of the glacial aquifers of the eastern United States leads to greater vulnerability to VOCs. These differences lead to distinct patterns of <jats:italic>C/C</jats:italic><jats:sub>0</jats:sub> values estimated for public supply wells characteristic of each aquifer, information that can be used by resource managers to develop monitoring plans based on relative vulnerability, to locate new public supply wells, or to make land‐use management decisions.</jats:p>",

A simulation scenario is designed by constructing a 3×3 table (= nine combinations) that contains a varying number of surgeons and medicine doctors allocated in the emergency ward. For each combination, 1,000 replications apply (=10 runs @ 100 replications). “Runs” are the cycles or how many times the simulation is executed, while “replications” refer to how many times a computer (automatically) repeats the simulation in a single execution. The simulation length of a single replication was set at 24 hours due to the fact that an emergency ward was always open. The selected feasible solution is the “best” combination of surgeons and medicine doctors that reduces the existing NVAT and TTS while ensuring that the resource utilisation is at a “reasonable” level (and did not exceed 100 per cent).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The simulation output indicates that the emergency ward may achieve considerable reduction in a patients' NVAT and total patients' time in the system by assigning three medicine doctors and three surgeons.

These models were applied to Brazil's oil chain, comprising 17 refineries and three main petrochemical plants, 16 groups of crude oils, 50 intermediate products, 10 final products, 13 terminals and a logistic network composed of 278 transportation arcs relative to the road, water, rail and pipeline modes. The time horizon analyzed covers 10 years. The results indicate significant financial differences between the three formulations, depending on the agent's risk profile.</jats:p>",

This response is mediated by systemic changes of the nutritional status and/or by local perception of specific signals. The effect of nitrate on Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root development represents a paradigm of these responses, and nitrate transporters are involved both in local and systemic control. Ammonium (NH4  +) represents an important nitrogen (N) source for plants, although toxicity symptoms are often associated with high NH4  + concentration when this is present as the only N source. The reason for these effects is still controversial, and mechanisms associating ammonium supply and plant developmental programs are completely unknown. We determined in Lotus japonicus the range of ammonium concentration that significantly inhibits the elongation of primary and lateral roots without affecting the biomass of the shoot. The comparison of the growth phenotypes in different N conditions indicated the specificity of the ammonium effect, suggesting that this was not mediated by assimilatory negative feedback mechanisms. In the range of inhibitory NH4  + conditions, only the LjAMT1;3 gene, among the members of the LjAMT1 family, showed a strong increased transcription that was reflected by an enlarged topology of expression. Remarkably, the short-root phenotype was phenocopied in transgenic lines by LjAMT1;3 overexpression independently of ammonium supply, and the same phenotype was not induced by another AMT1 member. These data describe a new plant mechanism to cope with environmental changes, giving preliminary information on putative actors involved in this specific ammonium-induced response.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In July 1896, the parliament of the sparsely populated colony of Western Australia voted to raise a loan of £2·5 million in London to construct a reliable water supply for its booming Coolgardie goldfield, a sum greater than the total cost of the colony's capital works in any previous year. The scheme, prepared by the colony's engineer-in-chief, Charles O'Connor, involved pumping water 565 km along the world's first steel pipeline, which required 77 000 t of steel plate. This paper argues that the scheme was not one of monumental extravagance as its opponents claimed, but was one that was designed using the latest hydraulic research and ultimately was the only one that could have provided the reliability required to sustain the goldfield past its early years. Logistical problems, both in materials supply and in the construction of the pipeline largely through uninhabited country, were huge by contemporary standards. Two important technical innovations, the locking bar pipe and the mechanical pipe caulking machine, helped keep the cost of the project close to budget. The lessons learnt from the long, but eventually successful, battle against corrosion and leakage benefited hydraulic engineers around the world. </jats:p>",

Although these zones have been demonstrated in many frequently ruptured tendons, the existence of a similar area in the often ruptured long head of biceps (LHB) tendon is largely unknown. Twenty cadaveric upper limb specimens were dissected after injection with either a radio‐opaque lead oxide/milk mixture or India ink, followed by histological sectioning of the tendons. The LHB tendon was consistently supplied via its osteotendinous and musculotendinous junctions by branches of the thoracoacromial and brachial arteries respectively. In two specimens, additional branches from the anterior circumflex humeral artery travelling in a mesotenon vascularized the midsection of tendon. These source arteries divided the LHB tendon into either two or three vascular territories, depending upon the presence of the mesotenon‐derived vascular supply. A zone of hypovascularity was consistently found in the region of the LHB tendon most frequently prone to rupture. This zone covered an area 1.2–3 cm from the tendon origin, extending from midway through the glenohumeral joint to the proximal inter‐tubercular groove. This hypovascular region occurred on the border of two adjacent vascular territories, where reduced caliber choke vessels provide limited arterial supply. While it is probable that the limited arterial supply contributes to the susceptibility of this area to rupture, similar to other tendons the true pathogenesis is likely to be a combination of both vascular and mechanical factors.

This study considers construction industry characteristics in applying the SCOR model to develop a dynamic cSCM model using computer simulation. Furthermore, this study developed a novel cSCM performance evaluation method using the SCOR method to evaluate cSCM performance and identify and solve cSCM problems. This study uses a bridge construction project as a case study, which determines the relationships among supply chain participants to enhance communication efficiency and identify problems related to materials management. The case study results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid modeling methodology helps construction supply chain participants identify their roles and communicate easily, helps project managers identify bottlenecks in a supply chain, and significantly improves cSCM performance. </jats:p>",

It involved a large clay core embankment dam on the Coliban river and aqueducts to serve the mining communities at Castlemaine and Sandhurst. In a new colony lacking hydrological records, estimation of the river flow and the flood characteristics presented a challenge to the designer Joseph Brady. The paper examines Brady's approach to estimating these hydrological parameters and the reaction of other engineers in the colony to the design. The scheme was modified during construction to increase the volume to be delivered, but the higher level of supply could not be realised. Also the climatic conditions in the colony produced occasional floods with a higher crest than Brady's estimate. Additional spillway capacity was provided during construction, but the peak volumes were such that the dam had to be held below full capacity level to prevent destruction through overtopping. Problems with the scheme brought about a programme of hydrological surveys of river catchments in the colony. Examination of 50 years of Coliban records shows the acumen of the original design engineer Joseph Brady. </jats:p>",

We use two natural disturbances, fire and grazing, to examine the response of bird and arthropod communities in grasslands of Serengeti, Tanzania. Both burning and grazing by migrant ungulates take place at the end of the rains in June–July. We documented the communities before disturbance, then 1, 4 and 20 weeks after disturbance on three replicate plots and compared them with three undisturbed plots. Birds were recorded by observation, arthropods from pitfall, tray trap and sweepnet samples. We expected that as the grass biomass was reduced by either disturbance, bird communities would change with concomitant change in arthropod food abundance. Alternatively, bird communities would change not with the absolute amount of food but with the greater accessibility of food as the grass structure changed from long to short grass. Results showed first that both bird species richness and abundance increased after both types of disturbance, but burnt sites showed a greater increase than that for grazed sites. Second, there was a change in bird species composition with disturbance. The functionally equivalent athi short‐toed lark (<jats:italic>Calandrella athensis</jats:italic>) was replaced by the red‐capped lark (<jats:italic>Calandrella cinerea</jats:italic>). Third, the abundance of most groups of arthropods was lower on disturbed sites than those on undisturbed sites, and the reduction of arthropod numbers was greatest on burnt sites. These results imply that bird abundance did not occur through an increase in arthropod abundance but rather through a change in the grass structure making food more accessible; and the higher predation could have caused the lower arthropod abundance. In addition, some bird species replaced others thus functionally compensating for their loss.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>PURPOSE: To evaluate the histopathology alterations of the intestinal mucosa of rabbits submitted to different times of mesenteric artery ischemia and reperfusion with and without celiac artery collateral circulation supply. METHODS: Two groups of eight male New Zealand white rabbits (weight 2.2-3.5 kg) were used in this study. In the Group 1 animals, the proximal mesenteric artery was occluded for 60 min with an atraumatic vascular clamp, followed by reperfusion for 60 min. In the Group 2 animals the small bowel and mesentery were cut 30cm and 60cm far from the gastroduodenal pyloric transition before the proximal mesenteric artery occlusion. Small bowel biopsies were obtained before ischemia (control), after 30 min and 60 min of mesenteric ischemia and at 30 and 60 min. of mesenteric artery reperfusion. RESULTS: In the Group I animals, the followings histopathology grade results were observed: t1, mean 0.4 + 0.29; t2, mean 1.9 ± 0.38; t3, 1.9 ± 0.33; t4, 1.2 ± 0.36 and t5, 1.2 ± 0.32. Differences between t0 and t2 and between t3 and t4 were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). Differences between t2 and t3 and t4 and t5 were not significant (p&gt;0.5). In the Group II animals, it was observed: t1, mean 1.6 ± 0.33; t2, 2.4 ± 0.36; t3, 3.0 ± 0.35; t4 3.4 ± 0.31; t5, 3 ± 031. Differences between t0 and t1, t1 and t2, and t2 and t3 were significant (p&lt;0.05). Differences between histopathology grades results of samples t1 to t5 in Group 1 and 2 were statistically significant (p&lt;0.5). CONCLUSION: Microscopic examination of the biopsies revealed significant evidence of worse small bowel wall ischemia-reperfusion lesions by exclusion of the celiac artery collateral circulation supply.</jats:p>",

Nitrogen source and availability was found to be one key factor for the volumetric productivity of plant cell cultures. Increased amounts of nitrate in the culture medium had a dramatic impact on protein yields, resulting in a 10–20‐fold increase in product accumulation through a combination of enhanced secretion and higher stability. The results were scalable from shake flasks to stirred‐tank bioreactors, where the maximum yield per cultivation volume was 8 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>over 7 days.

We investigated the hypothesis that ATP release is impaired in erythrocytes of humans with type 2 diabetes (DM2) and that this defect compromises the ability of these cells to stimulate dilation of resistance vessels. We also determined whether a general vasodilator, the prostacyclin analog iloprost (ILO), stimulates ATP release from healthy human (HH) and DM2 erythrocytes. Finally, we used a computational model to compare the effect on tissue O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>levels of increases in blood flow directed to areas of increased O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>demand (erythrocyte ATP release) with nondirected increases in flow (ILO). HH erythrocytes, but not DM2 cells, released increased amounts of ATP when exposed to reduced O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>tension (Po<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>&lt; 30 mmHg). In addition, isolated hamster skeletal muscle arterioles dilated in response to similar decreases in extraluminal O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>when perfused with HH erythrocytes, but not when perfused with DM2 erythrocytes. In contrast, both HH and DM2 erythrocytes released ATP in response to ILO. In the case of DM2 erythrocytes, amounts of ATP released correlated inversely with glycemic control. Modeling revealed that a functional regulatory system that directs blood flow to areas of need (low O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-induced ATP release) provides appropriate levels of tissue oxygenation and that this level of the matching of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>delivery with demand in skeletal muscle cannot be achieved with a general vasodilator. These results suggest that the inability of erythrocytes to release ATP in response to exposure to low-O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>tension could contribute to the peripheral vascular disease of DM2.</jats:p>",
