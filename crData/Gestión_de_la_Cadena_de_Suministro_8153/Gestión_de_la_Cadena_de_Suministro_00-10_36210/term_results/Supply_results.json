Over the longer term, major variations in growth rates have undoubtedly originated from the supply rather than the demand side. The aim of this chapter is to summarize what is known in general about variations in the rate of growth; and to argue that the kind of effects that supply‐side factors have is different from what is needed to explain the abrupt short‐term falls in output that occur in major recessions. The discussion thus touches on a large subject of which knowledge is incomplete, but since its relevance is indirect, discussion is brief and touches only on what is essential for the present purpose: Sect. 4.1 summarizes what is known about variations in growth rates; Sect. 4.2 first gives a general explanation––eclectic but not basically novel for the process of growth, and then goes on to offer explanations for some particular ways in which growth rates have varied since 1920; Sect. 4.3 summarizes conclusions. There are two short appendices: Appendix A4.l is a note on growth accounting and two other studies of growth; Appendix A4.2 gives estimates of the growth of output and exports of manufactures of six countries from 1870 to 1970.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Value‐added services expand manufacturing organizations’ ability to compete beyond traditional measures of manufacturing competitiveness such as cost, quality, flexibility, and delivery. This concept of expanding the roles of factories to include service has received considerable attention and wide acceptance among both researchers and practitioners. For example, recent empirical studies have demonstrated that manufacturing performance, particularly delivery performance can be enhanced through expanded service roles that focus on effective information flows within the company and to external customers. Despite such benefits, the scope of analysis has been limited to individual manufacturing organizations. Given the realities of global competition, practitioners require knowledge that extends beyond individual organizations. The domain of their problems includes the complexities of interactions with multiple stakeholders along global supply chains. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to extend the concept of the service factory to global supply chains. Specifically, the approach will be to provide a conceptualization of the role of service in global supply chain management that can be used as a starting point for discussion and further research in this area. We provide several propositions and conclude with implications for both researchers and practitioners.</jats:p>",

It develops and administers a large‐sample survey and uses factor analysis to develop measures for the importance of supplier‐selection criteria, supplier involvement, supplier performance, and manufacturing performance.

We reveal both arguments to be flawed and suggest that the party's advocation of large across-the-board tax cuts was the result of calculated and coordinated decisions by Washington elites within the party. We provide empirical and theoretical justification for a national elite-led explanation of this event. As a result, our study helps solidify contemporary scholarship that counteracts conventional wisdom in comparative politics and suggests that national American parties, at least when it comes to policy formation, can be relatively hierarchical institutions that shape as much as respond to mass and local behavior. </jats:p>",

Overall, the research discovers that local sourcing is low and local supply chains are dominated by small, low value-added suppliers providing basic parts and repair services. The region lacks high-technology, fast-growing first and second-tier suppliers. The research also shows that the problems facing the supply chain in the automotive cluster are different from the aerospace cluster and that supplier linkages within the aerospace cluster appear to be more beneficial for long-term regional development. Finally, policy recommendations to aid each cluster are highlighted. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the role of short food supply chains in rural development. By developing a theoretical perspective, it seeks to contribute to debates on the generalized theory of rural development. It argues that in order to more fully understand their role and potential we need to move beyond descriptions of product flows to examine how supply chains are built, shaped and reproduced over time and space. Consideration is given to the definition of short food supply chains, and a three level typology is presented. The paper examines the dimensions and evolution of short food supply chains, and identifies four types of evolution: temporal, spatial, demand and associational or institutional. Case studies from the impact research programme are positioned within this framework, and it is argued that we need conceptualizations that reflect the dynamic and evolutionary nature of supply chains and the businesses they involve. A case study of the Llyn Beef Producers Co‐operative in Wales is expanded to illustrate the evolution of supply chains and their role in rural development, both at the farm level and within the wider rural economy.</jats:p>",

These challenges typically involve projects that lead to small miscible injectant, or solvent, supply variations. For example, upgrades of the surface facilities can increase the solvent supply available to the PBMGP. Conversely, undertaking new EOR projects or supplying solvent to non-Prudhoe Bay projects will reduce the supply available to the PBMGP.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To accurately assess these projects, a new methodology was developed for forecasting enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This methodology provides increased ease of use and greater reliability in assessing small changes in solvent supply when compared with direct application of large-scale models.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Full-field modeling of miscible injectant (MI) allocation and enhanced oil recovery for the Prudhoe Bay WAG flood is currently performed with large scale-up models. While these models are excellent for evaluating large, full-field decisions related to miscible injection at Prudhoe Bay, they can yield ambiguous results when used to evaluate projects that cause small solvent supply perturbations. The difficulty in resolving the impacts of small incremental projects is a common weakness of large-scale reservoir models.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Through analysis of numerous Prudhoe Bay full-field simulations of large variations in the MI supply, it was found that a two-component analytical equation was excellent for fitting the character of the cumulative EOR impact. The logarithmic function represents the ultimate EOR impact of a change in MI supply, whereas the Weibull function represents the EOR oil rate acceleration (or deceleration) component. The optimum coefficients for the composite analytical equation were found through regression of large-scale simulation results.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper documents the methodology used to create the analytical equation as well as the equation's successful testing. The methodology could be applied to other large-scale models that suffer from an inability to accurately evaluate small incremental projects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The automotive industry in North America is experiencing a period of far‐reaching reorganization. Part of that change is in the automotive supply chain, including firms in the industry, such as Ford or General Motors, that assemble the vehicles and firms that are their suppliers. The particular emphasis in the research reported below is on the new relationships among these firms in the automotive supply chain. Some of the data come from in‐depth interviews with twenty‐six senior executives in North American automotive companies, from a survey of 175 firms in the North American automotive industry, and from sessions with an advisory board of representatives of leading industry companies. Additional data derive from historical accounts of the industry. This paper briefly summarizes the differentiation of the supply chain into four types of firms, and the reallocation of tasks within the supply chain. This has meant a transfer of responsibilities from the assemblers (such as Ford) to various kinds of suppliers, and a resultant shift in the system of responsibility and authority in the supply chain. The paper then explores in detail changes in the nature of relationships among firms in the supply chain from a type termed the market model to a type termed the commitment model. Additional topics include changes in the way relationships among firms are initiated and reasons for the new type of relationship. The changes are interpreted in terms of both firm‐level and industry level‐factors. The changes and their underlying causes allow certain predictions: the process of change to the new type of relationship will continue at least until 2005; and it is uncertain how far the new mode of relationship, the commitment model, will extend through the supply chain.</jats:p>",

We explore the economic transactions hazards associated with asking suppliers to invest in the specialized technologies required to improve environmental performance of products and management practices and the relational contracting mechanisms computer industry firms are using to protect themselves against these hazards. We also describe the importance the managers we interviewed attributed to various transactions hazards and their perceptions of how well their firms were coping with them. We conclude by discussing questions for future research. By using TCE to frame our analysis of how computer manufacturers are structuring their relationships with their suppliers in the environmental area, we hope to show how social science theory can be used to enrich and increase the practicality of the work done by engineers and others in the mainstream areas of the industrial ecology field.</jats:p>",

Information technology can be used to facilitate the exchange of order information between business functions and supply chain members. Two information technologies that are used for this information exchange are enterprise resource planning (ERP) and electronic commerce (e‐commerce). This article discusses the results of a survey of Midwestern manufacturers on their current and future use of and investment in information technology to support their supply chain activities. The results of the study show that there is a difference in the use of and investment in information technology between small/medium manufacturers and large manufacturers. Large manufacturers are placing more emphasis on supply chain technologies than small manufacturers. Manufacturers’ investment in information technologies for the supply chain were found to lag those for the manufacturing/operations function. The results also show that use of e‐commerce is greater than the use of ERP.</jats:p>",

The key determinant of service quality that both of these groups use in evaluating customer service is the communication of accurate and timely information. Service quality provided to student customers is primarily facilitated through the use of the Internet, while Spanish immersion school customers rely on telephone communication, e‐mail, and in‐person visits. Implications for this dual‐direction customer focus and the use of the Internet in the service transaction are presented.</jats:p>",

During the spring and early summer of 1993, 36 Friesland and 12 Finn Dorset ewes were offered continuous access to permanent pasture (Lolium perenne) and allocated to one of six concentrates (1·2 kg/day) formulated to be iso-energetic and to supply 149 (H), 126 (M) or 103 (L) g ERDP and 70 (A) or 45 (B) g DUP per kg dry matter (DM) in a 3<jats:bold>✕</jats:bold>2 factorial design. Herbage intake was estimated using the n-alkane technique and herbage samples obtained for analysis. Ewe milk yields, milk composition, live weights (LW) and condition scores (CS) were recorded weekly. The DM and nitrogen degradability characteristics of the grass samples and concentrates were determined using four Friesland wether lambs fitted with permanent rumen cannulae. Throughout the experiment the grass ERDP: FME ratio was lower than the optimum for maximal microbial protein synthesis. However, using a rumen solid phase outflow rate of 0·05 per h, estimated concentrate ERDP and DUP supplies were similar to those predicted. Increasing concentrate ERDP supply had no effect on herbage intake or LW and CS change but reduced milk fat concentration (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt; 0·05) and increased milk lactose concentration (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt; 0·05) and the yields of milk (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt; 0·01), protein (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt; 0·05) and lactose (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt; 0·01). There were no significant effects of concentrate DUP supply. In conclusion, it is suggested that concentrate ERDP increased microbial protein synthesis and metabolizable protein supply, a proportion of which may have been deaminated to provide precursors for milk lactose synthesis, such that the marginal response in milk protein yield was 0·210.</jats:p>",

Remaining low level failure modes in the die core included elevated standby current that in some cases could not be localized even with extensive chip de-processing. In addition an apparent functional failure upon post stress ATE test was isolated for certain part revisions. Routine separation of Vss/Vcc supply pin combinations from “all other pins” during HBM ESD test allowed identification of the several failures occurring in the die core. Failure analysis and corrective action is described. Additional diagnostic testing using separate polarity HBM pulses aided in tracing the conduction path causing the apparent functional failure and prompted investigation of HBM tester dynamic properties. It was determined that the magnitude of the “second” HBM pulse in certain testers was sufficient to cause a false powerup condition which results in apparent functional failure upon subsequent ATE test. In-situ monitoring of the Floating Power Bus response (in this case Vss) during application of HBM stress to the Input-pad to Vcc-pin combination revealed a transient caused by the “second” pulse that allowed such apparent failures to be invalidated. Further more, monitoring the in-situ floating Vss bus response to the HBM allowed conclusions to be drawn as to the utility of different power bus and Vss/Vcc supply clamp layouts, thereby allowing improvements to die layout to be implemented.</jats:p>",

In theory, such a reduction in <jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sub>R</jats:sub>:<jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sub>L</jats:sub> should compromise the trees’ ability to extract water from drying sand. Under equally high soil moisture, canopy stomatal conductance (<jats:italic>G</jats:italic><jats:sub>S</jats:sub>) of fertilized trees (F) was 50% that of irrigated/fertilized trees (IF), irrigated trees (I), and untreated control trees (C). As predicted from theory, F trees also decreased their stomatal sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit by 50%. The lower <jats:italic>G</jats:italic><jats:sub>S</jats:sub> in F was associated with 50% reduction in leaf‐specific hydraulic conductance (<jats:italic>K</jats:italic><jats:sub>L</jats:sub>) compared with other treatments. The lower <jats:italic>K</jats:italic><jats:sub>L</jats:sub> in F was in turn a result of a higher leaf area per sapwood area and a lower specific conductivity (conducting efficiency) of the plant and its root xylem. The root xylem of F trees was also 50% more resistant to cavitation than the other treatments. A transport model predicted that the lower <jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sub>R</jats:sub>:<jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sub>L</jats:sub> in IF trees resulted in a considerably restricted ability to extract water during drought.

In contrast, the lower <jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sub>R</jats:sub>:<jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sub>L</jats:sub> in F trees caused only a limited restriction in water extraction during drought owing to the more cavitation resistant root xylem in this treatment. In both fertilized treatments, approximate safety margins from predicted hydraulic failure were minimal suggesting increased vulnerability to drought‐induced dieback compared with non‐fertilized trees. However, IF trees are likely to be so affected even under a mild drought if irrigation is withheld.</jats:p>",

Aboveground biomass growth responses to the combined fertilizer and weed control treatments (FW) averaged ~2- and 2.8-fold for slash and loblolly pine, respectively. In the same treatment, annual needlefall (NF) production for slash pine approached a \"steady state\" of 6 Mg·ha<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at ages 8-14 years, while loblolly pine NF production peaked at 7 Mg·ha<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at age 10 years, and then declined 17% following curtailment of the fertilizer treatment. Periodic stemwood biomass increment (PAI) for the FW treatment for both species culminated at about 15 Mg·ha<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>·year<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at age 8 years and then declined rapidly (~275%) to &lt;4 Mg·ha<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>·year<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at 15 years; reductions for the untreated control were considerably slower. The progressive decline in PAI following peak leaf area development was closely associated with a decrease in stemwood production per unit leaf area (growth efficiency). A unit increase in leaf area index in the 7- to 9-year-old stands produced about 3.0 and 3.1 times more stemwood biomass per year than in the 14- to 16-year-old stands for loblolly and slash pine, respectively. </jats:p>",
