Using a spatial wood supply model developed at the University of New Brunswick, the paper quantifies and explains wood supply effects of harvest blocking, road cost and harvest adjacency delay. Eight spatial strategies test harvest scheduling based on geographic forest structure (distribution of stand developmental types and stages). Given a forest of mostly regenerating and mature developmental stages, wood supply reductions vary from 4.9% to 19.2% when compared to a convention aspatial assessment. The paper presents and explains reductions for all eight spatial strategies; but concludes that all are explained by the impacts that harvest blocking, road cost, or harvest adjacency delay have, singly, or in combination, on either mortality losses or the rate at which harvesting recycles forest area.

By distinguishing travel-time costs or distances it is shown that both supply and demand within local markets strongly influence admissions in a way which cannot be observed on aggregated levels: the tension between supply and demand is cushioned by a strong redistribution of patients.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> An experimental wearable air supply for pneumatic artificial hearts and ventricular assist devices has been built and tested. The unit eliminates the need for tethering to a large, stationery driver. The miniaturized air supply is designed for ambulatory patients with implanted pulsatile pneumatic total artificial hearts (TAH) or pneumatic left‐ventricular assist devices (LVAD), to permit mobility in clinical and home settings. The device has major short‐term utility as a supply for pneumatic TAH or VAD bridges in patients awaiting heart transplants. The system design for the wearable driver includes a novel, fast rotary compressor, driven by a brushless direct current (DC) motor to supply air to the ventricle through an electromagnetically actuated directional valve, all controlled by a microcomputer. Stroke volume from 0 to 200 cc; pulse rate from 60 to 160 bpm, and duty cycle from 33% to 50% are selected on a keyboard, and the selected or measured parameters can be shown on a liquid crystal display. For control of delivery from a single ventricular assist device, stroke volume is controlled by variation of compressor speed. In the wearable air supply for a TAH, a single compressor drives both ventricles alternately through a double‐acting directional valve. Air volume delivered to the left ventricle is adjusted by variation of compressor speed, and air volume to the right ventricle by variation of ejection time. The effect on blood flow rate of the lower impedance to the right ventricle is compensated by provision of a two‐stage compressor, in which a single stage drives the right ventricle, and both stages connected in parallel drive the left ventricle. The overall dimensions of the prototype air supply for driving either a TAH or LVAD are 4.5 by 7.8 by 4.5 inches, including an emergency battery with a duration of 15 to 30 min depending on load. The weight is presently 5.5 Ib, but this will be reduced in a production design and for a dedicated LVAD air supply. The size and weight of a separately worn, rechargeable battery pack depend on the load and desired duration of operation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>1. Responses to perivascular stimuli have been recorded with intracellular microelectrodes from the smooth muscle of isolated segments of the main caudal artery of rats at various times between 7 and 128 days after all four collector nerve trunks had been lesioned near the base of the tail at 21 days of age. 2. In proximal segments (&lt; 40 mm distal to the lesions), excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) and neurogenic alpha‐depolarizations (NADs) evoked by stimuli presented via a proximally located suction electrode were similar to those in the same segments of unoperated control animals of the same age. Supramaximal EJPs in these segments decreased in amplitude with age. 3. Stimuli just supramaximal for EJPs in innervated preparations failed to evoke responses in segments farther than 30‐40 mm distal to the lesions at any time after the nerves had been cut and 1 cm excised. Higher voltages evoked slow depolarizing potentials (SDPs) which were of longer time course than EJPs. Similar responses occurred in segments over 60 mm distal to the lesions at 20‐50 days after the nerves had been frozen, and in all segments sampled over 100 mm distal to nerve lesions. 4. Spontaneous transient depolarizations (STDs) were recorded at all depths of the media in denervated segments. These occurred at frequencies similar to those of spontaneous events (including attenuated spontaneous EJPs) in innervated segments. 5. The earliest signs of reinnervation (24‐42 days after freeze lesions) consisted of very small amplitude EJPs of normal time course which facilitated markedly during a short train of stimuli (5‐10 Hz); these were followed by NADs which were large relative to the amplitudes of the EJPs. Less commonly, small focal EJPs of brief time course (resembling spontaneous EJPs in superficial cells of innervated arteries) were evoked in very restricted regions of the vessel wall. 6. At later times (57‐128 days postoperative), six of eight segments located 40‐70 mm distal to freeze lesions showed EJPs of nearly control amplitude, but NADs that were larger than in equivalent segments from control animals. In the remaining two cases, reinnervation at this level was similar to that seen at the earliest postoperative times. High stimulus voltages prolonged the decay of EJPs in both control and reinnervated arteries. 7. Sensitivity to exogenous noradrenaline, assessed in terms of membrane depolarization, was increased in both denervated and reinnervated segments. 8. Catecholamine fluorescence disappeared from the arteries at a distance greater than 30‐40 mm distal to the site of the nerve lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sources of particulate organic carbon (POC) and trophic–dynamic relationships were studied in a reservoir with low sportfish populations. Fish community structure and POC input from tributaries, phytoplankton primary production, and vascular vegetation on mudflats were estimated. Gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) averaged 39.8% of the total fish biomass in 1988, and as much as 94% of the total forage fish biomass was too large to serve as prey for most predators. Phytoplankton primary productivity averaged 1182 mg C∙m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>∙d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>in 1987 and 1988, contributed 33.57 Gg POC∙yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>to the reservoir, and apparently was phosphate limited. POC inflow from tributaries contributed 60.00 Gg∙yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>with 79% of POC &lt;75 μm in size. Winter and spring stormflow was responsible for 92% of the total POC transported. Considering POC size fractions available to gizzard shad, POC input from tributaries, phytoplankton, and mudflats contributed 21, 54, and 25% of the total POC input, respectively. The trophic–dynamic analysis indicated that phytoplankton POC was adequate to support the reservoir fish community. A more efficient transfer of carbon in the food web might be accomplished by stocking with a smaller forage fish, such as threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense), which are not common in the reservoir.</jats:p>",
