      "abstract": "<jats:p> By using standpipes set 12 inches into the stream bottom the oxygen content and apparent velocity of the gravel water in the controlled-flow section of Nile Creek were observed. Values of dissolved oxygen content and velocity that just supply the full oxygen demand of salmon eggs were defined. The high mortalities of chum salmon eggs in the pre-eyed stage, that have been found in certain areas, may be explained on the basis that oxygen demands of 0.00013 to 0.0003 mg./egg/hr. at temperatures of 0.1° to 8.2 °C. were not being met, owing to very low oxygen content or very low apparent velocity of the water in the gravel. Values as low as 0.2 p.p.m. and 2 mm./hr. were recorded. A portable gravel-water sampler is described, which can be used (1) to obtain samples of subsurface water for the determination of dissolved oxygen; and (2) to calculate apparent velocity of gravel water from rate of dilution of an added dye. </jats:p>",

The reduction in degree of necrosis is related to a reduced content of nickel in the leaf blades, whilst that of chlorosis is related to the Ni/Fe ratio in the leaf blades—an internal antagonism being indicated in the latter case.</jats:p><jats:p>A reciprocal relationship exists between the nickel and iron contents of the leaf blades; the nickel content is materially reduced by high concentrations of iron in the nutrient solution, and the iron content by nickel, the former being the more pronounced effect.</jats:p><jats:p>Uptake of nickel increases with increasing pH for a constant iron level in the substrate, although the degree of necrotic symptoms is similar over pH range 4–7. Iron uptake is reduced by both nickel and increasing pH and results in chlorosis at pH values of 5·5 and above.</jats:p><jats:p>For a constant level of iron supply the phosphate content of the stem extracts is higher the greater the degree of nickel toxicity; the phosphorus status of the plant may be a factor in producing nickel toxicity but if so, it has to be considered in relation to other factors.</jats:p>",
