To support these applications, SDS allows users to specify the products, supply sources, terminals, markets, transport options, and time periods they want to consider for planning and then generates and solves a linear programming model of the specified supply and distribution system. SDS, which can represent supply, terminal operations, and primary and secondary distribution, is one of the few LP models that integrates functional areas in the oil industry. The system is flexible, accurate, and produces relevant reports. However, it was not adopted for routine planning largely because, due to economic conditions, very limited resources were available for implementation. To ensure that a system is used, developers and users must make substantial investments not only in developing it, but in establishing and maintaining a suitable environment for it. </jats:p>",

This process of development has not been detailed in the giraffe, a factor contributing to the difficulty in distinguishing the classification of these horns. In a chronological series of giraffe horns from prenatal and postnatal animals, we have observed unique morphologies that define their proper location on the skull, the blood supply to them, and the transitions involved in their histological development. While our observations have facilitated the classification of the giraffe horn, our interpretations were not always in accord with previous reports.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, the value increased significantly with exercise in feet with MAC but without PIVD (21.2 ¬± 3.5%, P &amp;lt; 0.01, n = 10) and in those of diabetic control subjects (14.9 ¬± 3.6%, P &amp;lt; 0.01), respectively.

The model runs on a microcomputer and was applied to Georgia as a case study. Data are entered in a spreadsheet template, and forecasts are made using a Pascal program. The model seems accurate, is easy to use, relies on easily obtainable forest survey data, and can provide projections for substate areas. Projections made for Georgia indicate that softwood supplies will decrease substantially in many important substrate areas given current growth and harvest levels, but hardwood supplies will increase.

The levels of Ca and P in the diets were set in relation to estimated requirements (R) as determined by the Technical Committee on Response to Nutrients (TCORN, 1990) and the four treatments were as follows: treatment A Ca and P = 1R; treatment B Ca = 2R P = 1R; treatment C Ca = 4R P = 1R; treatment D Ca = 4R P = 2R.</jats:p><jats:p>At about 50 kg live weight the lambs were slaughtered and their body composition was determined.</jats:p><jats:p>The composition of their gains was also determined using information obtained from a fifth group of lambs killed at the start of the trial. There were significant treatment effects in relation to body mineral composition with Ca and P levels being higher in lambs on treatments C and D compared with those on treatments A and B. Magnesium levels were also higher in lambs on treatment D. Lambs on treatments A and B grew at the same rate (0¬∑t25 kg/day) and retained Ca and P in relation to live-weight gain at rates close to those on which TCORN (1990) based their estimates of requirements. Lambs on treatments C and D, however, retained these minerals at somewhat higher rates though this improvement in mineralization was accompanied by a slight reduction in growth rate and in some lambs on these treatments there were health problems due to the formation of kidney stones.</jats:p><jats:p>The levels of Ca and P recommended by TCORN (1990) for lambs are adequate for normal growth and mineralization. Some improvement in mineralization may be achieved by feeding these minerals at above recommended levels but this improvement would appear to be at the expense of a reduction in growth rate and an increased risk of urolith formation.</jats:p>",

After a lag phase of 6 h TDC activity became detectable in isolated cotyledons and reached values of about 5 nkat ¬∑ g FW<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> following a 24 h incubation in double-distilled water. The TDC synthesis was suppressed to about 20% by supplying the incubation medium with 2 to 6% sucrose. Phytohormones were also involved in the regulation of TDC synthesis. A highly sensitive reaction was observed with a 50% suppression resulting from an external supply of 1 x 10<jats:sup>-8</jats:sup>\n                  <jats:sub>M</jats:sub> gibberellic acid (GA<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>). Abscisic acid (ABA) was much less effective, reaching a similar level of suppression only at an unphysiologically high concentration of about 6 x 10<jats:sup>-5</jats:sup>\n                  <jats:sub>M</jats:sub>. ABA, however, became one order of magnitude more effective when supplied together with sucrose. In contrast to GA<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and ABA, an exogenous supply of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) stimulated TDC synthesis significantly at a concentration of 1 x 10<jats:sup>-7</jats:sup>\n                  <jats:sub>M</jats:sub>. From these in vitro studies and earlier measurements of internal ABA concentrations as well as incorporation of [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]tryptophan into IAA. we hypothesize a regulatory effect of assimilate supply and phyto- hormones on TDC biosynthesis in developing embryos of walnut (Juglans regia L.). </jats:p>",

Coronary blood flow and cardiac output, using radioactive microspheres, and small vessel O2 saturations, using microspectrophotometry, were measured in hypertrophied and nonhypertrophied hearts. After 30 days, 33% myocardial hypertrophy was evident in the 1K,1C animals. Base-line blood pressure was significantly higher in the 1K,1C animals compared with sham controls and remained higher during isoproterenol infusion. Base-line heart rate was not different between animal groups, and heart rate increased in both groups during isoproterenol. Cardiac output was similar between sham and 1K,1C animals during base-line conditions (316 +/- 40 vs. 365 +/- 51 ml/min, respectively). After isoproterenol, cardiac output increased in the sham animals (494 +/- 119 ml/min) but not in the 1K,1C group (317 +/- 85 ml/min). Isoproterenol elevated MVO2 threefold in both the sham and 1K,1C animals. Coronary blood flow was significantly increased to similar levels in both animal groups. O2 extraction significantly increased during isoproterenol in both groups. Therefore, impaired cardiac function was evident during isoproterenol stress in the hypertrophied myocardium independent of myocardial O2 supply or consumption restrictions. </jats:p>",
