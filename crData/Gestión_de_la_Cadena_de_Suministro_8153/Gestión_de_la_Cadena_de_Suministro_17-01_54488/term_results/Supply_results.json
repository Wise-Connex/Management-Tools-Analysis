      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: There is a logistical gap in the first section of the apple supply chain that affects the temperature profiles of apples further downstream in the supply chain.Objectives: This article’s main objective is to confirm whether the logistics processes, in terms of the temperature profile of apples for the first 48 hours post-harvest, have an influence on the yield and/or quality of the fruit.Method: Observations were made and informal interviews were conducted on three different farms to ascertain their perspective of the first section of the supply chain. Temperature trials were conducted to analyse the temperature profile of two apple varieties, namely Golden Delicious and Granny Smith on three different farms. These trials were conducted by placing an iButton® device on the inside and outside of an apple to measure the temperature readings every minute for the first 48 hours after picking.Results: The research identified that it is not only at what time the apples are being harvested, but also at what time the apples are placed under cooling conditions to remove the field heat to obtain the recommended temperature profile within 48 hours. In addition, it was determined that effective and efficient picking at the right time (especially between 07:00 and 09:00) and the transportation of the apples directly, or as soon as possible after the apples came out of the orchard to the centralised cold storage facility, are key in ensuring the quality of the fruit and the temperature profile necessary for export.Conclusion: This article identifies the need to improve operational procedures along the cold chain. From this research, it is clear that there are problem areas that affect the temperature profile of apples. </jats:p>"

The objective of the model is to minimize total cost of the network. The model employs risk averseness of retailers to obtain more realistic model regarding uncertain demand. Using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to deal with this uncertainty makes the model to be robust. In this way, data-driven approach is used to avoid any distributional assumptions because realizations of uncertain parameters are the only information obtainable. This approach reformulates the initial uncertain model as a mixed integer linear programming problem. Numerical results show that the proposed model is efficient for robust SCND with respect to retailers risk averseness.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The importance of integrating and coordinating supply chain business partners have been appreciated in many industries. In the global manufacturing industry, supply chain business partners' information integration is technically a daunting task due to highly disconnected infrastructures and operations. Information, software applications, and services are loosely distributed among participant business partners with heterogeneous operating infrastructures. A secure, and flexible information exchange architecture that can interconnect distributed information and share that information across global service provision applications is, therefore, immensely advantageous. This chapter describes the main features of an ontology-based web service framework for integrating distributed business processes in a global supply chain. A Scalable Web Service Discovery Framework (SWSDF) for material procurement systems of a manufacturing supply chain is described. Description Logic (DL) is used to represent and explain SWSDF. The framework uses a hybrid knowledge-based system, which consists of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Rule-Based Reasoning (RBR). SWSDF includes: (1) a collection of web service descriptions in Ontology Web Language-Based Service (OWL-S), (2) service advertisement using complex concepts, and (3) a service concept similarity assessment algorithm. Finally, a business scenario is used to demonstrate functionalities of the described system.</jats:p>"

As its use is rising in several businesses, we have focused on SCM in retailing business. The concept of ethics has become more critical for companies. In this paper, ethics and sustainability in retailing are also examined. Sustainability has received more attention in retail management. Sustainability related issues have been discussed for many years and the term sustainability has received increased attention in research since the last two decade. This paper brings an overview of past and current sustainability research in retail applications for examining retailing and sustainability relevance. The paper considers role of retailers in supply chains through an extensive analysis of sustainability examinations in different research areas relevant to retail supply chains. Ultimately, the study is exampled from retailing businesses and it is concluded by further discussions.</jats:p>"

It discusses the influence of supply chains on the triple bottom line. Examples of major factors affecting environmental and social sustainability include travel distances, modes of transportation, vessels used, frequency of trips, packaging materials, efficiencies of manufacturing processes, efficiencies in power generation/distribution, treatments given to polluted air/water generated during various processing from industries, expected product lifetime, manufactured quality of items, management of items failed during warranty or transportation, and the management of disposal of items, among others. The chapter concludes with a future research agenda. </jats:p>"

Today's business environment compels firms to join forces in order to be competitive and sustainable. However, the success of the networks mainly depends on their network composition and how they are governed. In this chapter, the author proposes some strategies and the proper governance structure facilitating these strategies by taking the effects of severity of resource acquisition challenges and external legitimacy of whole network organization into consideration. The arguments are based on Resource Based Theory and Stakeholder theory. Moreover, the author of this chapter suggests a counter example for the claim propounded by Provan and Kenis (2007) that the evolution of network governance from more formalized one to the less formalized one is unlikely. From these respects, the chapter contributes to the literature since mentioned points have been rarely discussed.</jats:p>"

As a result, companies have started to embrace the concept of green supply chain which includes environmental issues rather than the concept of supply chain which is based on profitability. Green supply chain (GSC) has emerged as an important component of the environmental and supply chain strategies. In order to make a supply chain green, it is necessary to consider all activities in the supply chain such as raw material procurement, inbound logistics, transformation, outbound logistics, marketing, after-sales and appropriate product disposal. This paper aims to review different GSCM dimensions in the literature by explaining green supply chain concept and address the activities/practises that can be used to ensure these dimensions are green. </jats:p>"

Given that the net green outcome of a construction project is the sum total of the efforts undertaken at the various supply chain stages (from the initial design to the end-of-life demolition) by different stakeholders, the green supply chain management (GSCM) approach is seen as a way forward toward streamlining the fragmented efforts at greening the sector.

While there are developmental studies on warranty policies for brand new products and a few on secondhand products, there exist limited studies that evaluate the potential benefits of warranties on remanufactured products in a quantitative and comprehensive manner. In these studies, the profit improvements achieved by the offering of warranties for different policies determine the range of how much money can be invested in a warranty while still keeping it profitable overall. This paper considers how to predict the effect of offering non-renewable one-dimensional warranty policies to disassembled components and sensor embedded remanufactured products and how to assess the impact of sensor embedded products on warranty cost. </jats:p>"

In China healthcare industry, supply chain decisions are made based on experience, due to the environment complexities, such as changing policies and license delay. A flexible and dynamic big data driven analysis approach for supply chain decisions is urgently required. This report demonstrates a case study on CRT forecasting model of inventory data to predict the market demand based on pervious transaction data. First a basic statistic approach has been applied to represent the superficial patterns and suggest some decisions. After that a CRT model has been built based on the several independent variables. And there is also a comparison between CRT and CHAID models to choose a better one to further build an improved model. Finally some limitations and future work have been proposed. </jats:p>"

LSPs can share responsibility for managing global supply chain, keeping stores properly stocked, and delivering the perfect order every time. Carriers and logistics intermediary perform more roles than what people think they do, because network connection and the ambition to remain competitive make them to take up value-added services. SCI is a network of businesses and contractors that provide raw materials, transportation, manufacturing, distribution, warehousing, and retailing services. Through SCI, operating flexibility and tight inventory management lead to a lower cost structure, which results in higher profit margins.</jats:p>"

This chapter is reviews the previous literature on current practices and future direction of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), thus, it can increase practitioner's understanding of the importance and value of sustainable supply chain practices. A wide literature review is conducted to identify the relative important factors constitute of Sustainable Supply Chain Integration framework. Content analysis is introduced and applied for reviewing literature reviews of supply chain management, published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2014. A descriptive evaluation of the literature body is followed by a content analysis on the basis of a specific pattern of analytic categories derived from a typical research process. With best understanding the concept of SSCM and gap identification from literature review, this chapter can contribute to extended model of SSCM and enhance firm competitiveness. This understanding is vital due to the increase of economic importance of sustainable supply chains in addition to their role in enhancing competitive power of companies in international markets. </jats:p>"

One of this network type is the supply chain, where companies collaborate with one or more other companies depending on the sector they belong. A typical problem in this context is to evaluate the place of a new SME inside the network, i.e., the number of potential clients, suppliers and competitors that the SME would have.

Milan City was chosen as the case study, its DWS system being composed of more than 20 DWS units, widespread in the urban area. First, multivariate statistical techniques (factor analysis and cluster analysis) were applied to groundwater monitoring data, to identify specific contaminations of the captured groundwater and their spatial distribution. In detail, eight typical compositions of captured groundwater and their distribution in DWS units were identified, leading to the selection of different treatment processes to be adopted in DWS units. Then, process performances were experimentally evaluated on representative groundwater samples. Heterotrophic denitrification was tested at pilot-scale on groundwater contaminated by nitrate, identifying optimal operating and design parameters for complying with regulation limits. Granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption was tested at laboratory-scale for the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and pesticides, present in various ratios in groundwater samples: removal efficiencies were obtained and the occurrence of competition phenomena was highlighted. Air stripping was tested at pilot-scale for removing the most volatile VOCs (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene), highlighting its usefulness as pre-treatment before adsorption to increase GAC lifetime.</jats:p>",

The feasibility of reusing greywater for domestic activities in a rural area of Malawi, Africa, was evaluated from microbiological and public acceptance perspectives. Median Escherichia coli concentrations for eight domestic greywater sources (handwashing, laundry, runoff from a tap apron, bathing, cleaning a home/kitchen, cleaning a water collection container, washing plates and soaking vegetables) ranged from 100 to &amp;gt;20,000 colony forming units (cfu)/100 ml. Twenty-four of 47 greywater samples tested (51%) met the World Health Organization guideline for unrestricted use of greywater for irrigation. Pertinently, 80% (4/5) and 60% (3/5) of greywater samples from handwashing stations and bathing had E. coli less than the WHO guideline. Users reported greatest acceptance of reusing greywater for growing food and washing clothes, especially when the greywater source was bathing. Acceptance was closely tied to a household's economic standing, geographic location, and first-hand knowledge of reusing greywater. Greywater reuse practices in rural areas, especially targeting bathing water as suitable from bacteriological and user perception criteria, can help mitigate the impacts of water stress in sub-Saharan Africa.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is examining the existing application areas of MCDM techniques in green supply chain management (GSCM) literature. Three questions will be investigated in relation to this issue: 1) Which MCDM techniques were prevalently applied in GSCM literature? 2) Which MCDM techniques have been overlooked in GSCM literature? 3) What are the major application areas of MCDM techniques in GSCM practices? To this aim, literature is reviewed between the period of 2008 and the first half of 2016. In total, ninety eight journal articles were examined. Consequently, this paper represents a detailed picture of application areas of MCDM techniques in GSCM practices and can definitely give a blueprint to researches in solving multiple objective problems effectively in the area of GSCM. </jats:p>"

In this study, the authors used two extended strategies. First thorough review of literature was done considering articles from reputed journals. Second the factors identified from literature review was further refined through experts by forming a problem solving group consisting of seven experts from the manufacturing sector. These factors were used to develop the green supply chain management model using Interpretive structural modeling. Further MICMAC analysis was used to identify the driving and dependence power of the factors. The results of the analysis are very encouraging. Finally, the authors have presented the relationship management strategy for sustainable manufacturing practices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the current business environment firms have started conceding pressure from the government, international agencies and not-for-profit organizations to make their business activities more responsible towards environment as well as society. Their supply chain management has also imbibed environmental and social concern to its reincarnation as Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). This paper with help of integrative literature review, experience survey and case study method, develops a three dimensional SSCM framework and its performance metric for Indian IT product industry. This framework suggests Supply Chain (SC) actors on X-axis, Management/Economic (M) on Y-axis and Sustainability (S) on Z-axis. The three levels of Y progresses from operational to tactical and then strategic, whereas Z axis levels are innovation, environment and social. The framework identifies sub-dimensions of sustainability and their connectivity with supply chain process. This research also identifies and proposes the Management and Sustainability performance metric for suggested framework. This framework will help IT product companies to (re)design their SC and develop performance measures on identified metrics.</jats:p>",

Emerging from the capabilities construct are five core SCRES capabilities: the ability to anticipate, to adapt, to respond, to recover and to learn. Also, given the need to consolidate the various constructs of SCRES, the study identified 13 essential elements and 84 managerial practices that support firms to achieve the five capabilities, which are then linked to SCRES strategies and phases to establish the connections that provide an integrated view of the concept.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The explorative nature of this study and the role of the concept mapping framework, which does not empirically test the relationships in the model, are considered as limitations, to be addressed by the authors in future research.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The originality of this paper lies in the classification of different features of SCRES through a comprehensive concept mapping framework that establishes relationships and interactions between them.

In this chapter, we review recent research on three classes of decision models that are used in the logistics and sourcing functions of sustainable supply chains. Specifically, we examine and summarize recent developments in sustainable decision models for supplier selection, inventory lot-sizing, and last-mile delivery. Our review of the green and sustainable features found in these three models results in a single-source consolidation of models used in sustainable sourcing and logistics. This review may prove useful to researchers who focus on sustainable supply chain management and to practitioners who seek to expand their toolkit of models for the management and control of their supply chain. </jats:p>"

The marketing and organizational aspects, aiming at competitiveness, productivity and efficiency commonly call more directly the attention of entrepreneurs, managers and organizations in this area. However, to achieve these goals, several support systems are needed especially Information Systems. Treated as a problem of Information Technology (IT), these systems do not attract much attention of the supply chain managers. Usually, these systems need to collect information stored in various databases in different companies and formats and geographically scattered. To be successful, information systems need the support of efficient telecommunication systems that enable this collection of information with the agility needed in the modern world of business. This chapter highlights the telecommunications systems that support SCM, its features and limitations. It also shows the technological environment, innovations in telecommunications that are already available and future technologies that could directly impact this type of management. </jats:p>"

The management of these supply chains requires increased efforts by organizations that, on one hand, are increasingly pressured by customers in terms of service levels, on the other hand, must manage their suppliers from various locations and with different local requirements. In this context, an appropriate management of information flows is needed to create the adequate visibility level for managing supply chain risk. This chapter presents an overview on the concepts of risk management, visibility and information management in supply chains. This study proposes a conceptual framework for the selection of risk mitigation strategies in the supply chain and characterizes the external and internal information flows decision makers need to implement two categories of risk mitigation strategies: redundancy and flexibility.</jats:p>"

A discussion is conducted about the trade-off around the success and restrictions offered by the dominance of quantitative methods, especially when there is interest to study supply management and logistics. Quantitative methods are essential for any kind of management, but, as more dynamics in market competition produces more complex scenarios, qualitative answers are needed, along its approaches to formulate new questions that will help organizational decision-makers to apply knowledge for their planning activities. This chapter will explore three main points: 1) how the excessive concentration on quantitative methods can restrict managerial views; 2) how any organization can apply qualitative methods to enrich results observed from quantitative, resulting in better, more sustainable decisions; and 3) how qualitative and quantitative methods, associated, can implement this approach in real cases, with an overview of mixed scientific research methodologies. </jats:p>"

The chapter is structured as follows. First, the importance and the components of GSCM are discussed briefly. Next, the benefits of GSCM and the main pressures/drivers that force the business sector to migrate its traditional supply chain activities to be green are highlighted. Next, the key theme of this chapter, the barriers and challenges facing the global business sector for extending green supply chain practices are discussed. Then, the results of multiple interviews that were conducted in multinational Turkish and Egyptian companies operating in Egypt are revealed in order to explore the drivers, benefits and barriers of GSCM and to propose the strategies for overcoming the barriers toward green economy. Finally, the chapter concludes with discussion and recommendations. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this chapter a focus on practical organizational aspects is considered: how to understand the development of concrete, objective processes such as logistics and supply chain management for fashion production and commercialization, with the help of information and knowledge management (IKM). For this study, some restrictive fundamentals are applied. The basic methodological aspect is to consider a “collection” as a line of artifacts of clothing produced according fashion concepts and propositions, resulting in several tangible products – as the clothing itself, complementary accessories, usage-oriented implementations – and intangible factors – such as image, communication messages, brand, artistic and cultural propositions, among many others (Sauro, 2009; Godart et al., 2015). It is a remarkably complex result, resulting from an intense creative process that receives internal and external influences, regarding organizational boundaries, which has to be limited to a focus for a particular study, as it is considered for this chapter. It is important also to mention that “collection” as referred here, approaches mainly clothing, although the term is also related to several other artifacts and products, such as shoes, jewelry, particular accessories, etc.</jats:p>"

USCM (Lee, 2002; Fisher, 1997)develops a dot matrix classification of the supply chains considering several attributes (e.g., agility, cost, security, responsiveness) and argues that emergent economies industrial clusters, in the effort to keep attractiveness for technological frontier firms, need to adapt supply chain strategies according to USCM attributes. The paper takes a further step, discussing which transport modes are suitable to each supply chain classified at the USCM in PIM´s case. The research´s methods covered the use of PIM´s statistical official database (secondary data), interviews with the main logistical services providers of PIM and phone survey with a sample of firms (primary data). Findings confirm the theoretical argument that different supply chains will demand different transport modes running at the same time in the same industrial cluster (Oliveira, 2009). In the case of PIM, this implies investments on port and airport infrastructure and a strategic focus on air transport mode, due to (1) short life cycle of products, (2) distance from suppliers, (3) quick response to demand and (4) the fact that even PIM´s standard products use, in average, forty per cent of air transport at inbound logistics.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper will discuss the advantage of decision making supported by a digital system and will provide an overview of an empiric analysis researched on this topic. Decision making in organizations is a significant system implied task of managers and therefore a broad area in scientific research, not only in the disciplines management or business studies – even from technical to humanistic disciplines. Nowadays the trend of digitalization captures all areas of life especially in business, as well as the typical management task of decision making. Triggered by the digitalization trend business will move toward an autonomous decision making of machines or cyber systems. The important step toward autonomous decisions or decision support (cyber systems will prepare a decision, but finally executed by a human) will be the next development step for decision making. Designed algorithmic models for these decisions will use the content of classical decision models to reach maximum utility. Hence, a view on classical decision making will illuminate the basis for these models, from researchers like von Neumann/Morgenstern or Bernoulli. Furthermore, digitalization changes the process of decision making, especially focussing on the behavioral part of decisions, discussed from Simon, Selten or Tversky/Kahneman. Due to reason that today the human aspect of decision making is sustainable in organizations. The hypothesis that the digital set up for decision making in organizations will increase the efficiency of strategic decisions will be proofed by an empiric study. The research method for the empirical part of this paper is a questionnaire. It is online questionnaire which will be answered by professionals and scholars. As a typical example of a strategic decision, the author explains a business case in the supply chain function of organizations. A section of the well-known SCOR model will be tested on digitalization characteristics. The research findings of the questionnaire will illustrate that the digitalization of supply chain processes is in the scope of managers and consultants, to reach higher efficiency by increased turnover or by reducing costs. The result of this paper verifies an improved decision process by usage of digital features, but the capability of the entire digital possibilities is not fully achieved yet</jats:p>"

Big Data comes from a variety of sources, including tracking and sensor devices which are widely used in logistics and supply chain management, and relate to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Thus, this chapter reviews the literature on RFID adoption in supply chain/logistics management from 1995-2015. We identify current trends in the literature, drawing on the three levels of decision making, that is, strategic, tactical, and operational. We suggest that more research needs to be conducted with regards to the intangible benefits of RFID, the use of RFID big data for achieving higher performance, and to shift the focus from the ‘what' and the impacts on performance to the ‘how' and the ways RFID is adopted and assimilated in organizations and supply chains. Finally, the managerial implications of our review as well as the limitations and future research directions are outlined. </jats:p>"

The key to successful supply chain management also depends on supply flexibility; given that the smooth flow of materials and parts will define the whole manufacture operation.\n\nMethodology/Technique - Supply flexibility consists of two variables, namely, supplier flexibility and supply network flexibility.The research was conducted by taking samples from the garment industry in Indonesia.\n\nFindings - As a result of this research, it was found that supplier flexibility affects the supply chain performance, while supply network flexibility does not.\n\nNovelty - The study suggests that the Indonesian garment industry needs to strengthen the cooperation network with more suppliers so that the relationship can be more flexible to ensure the availability of high quality raw materials and parts at the appropriate prices to maintain the smooth operation of the company.\n\nType of Paper - Empirical\n\nKeywords: Supply Chain Performance; Supply Chain Management; Supply Flexibility; Supplier Flexibility; Supply Network Flexibility.\n\nJEL Classification: L11, R41.</jats:p>",

However, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) has also played an important role in the performance of these companies. Therefore, this chapter analyzes three latent variables in order to know the importance of ICT in both supply chain agility and the performance of human resources. Information was obtained from a questionnaire administered in the maquiladora industry in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. A structural equation model is generated to understand the relationships among latent variables, and three hypotheses are raised based on such interactions. Finally, results indicate that supply chain agility and the performance of human resources are directly linked to the use of information and communication technologies. </jats:p>"

Firms today are faced with very low commercial margins due to the instability of fuel prices and increased competition. In this economic operating scenario, only proper information management provides a real knowledge of the activities efficiency and allows the maintenance of the competitive advantage of economic organizations. Data flow diagrams are valuable tools for the identification and articulation of the organizational processes and the different information needs. In this sense, for their simplicity data flow diagrams are important management tools that can be used by managers to identify and optimize the developed processes and activities. This study sought to highlight, through the use of diagrams of data streams, the importance of this analysis in the study of how the company fits its activities and how should face frame through a perspective based on information. The schematic representation of these two analytical perspectives, the first based on an internal perspective and the other base on an outside perspective, shows the significant difference from the potential results to management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most U.S. presidents will pursue third-party conflict mediation sometime during their administration. However, the approach and level of commitment to those endeavors vary greatly across time and results are often minimally successful. This study explains this variation in terms of domestic political considerations, suggesting that the potential risks and payoffs in the domestic sphere primarily drive the supply of mediation, rather than conflict characteristics, “ripeness” for resolution, or the national interest. Presidents are shown to engage in mediation when they are relatively secure domestically, enjoying legislative success in Congress. The results are consistent with the notion that presidents prefer political cover when engaging in foreign policy. Thus, the argument informs the literature on mediator behavior by linking it with theories of foreign policy decision making and suggests that the political context in which mediation is offered will influence its prospects for success, often explaining why mediation efforts fall short. Moreover, given the trend toward divided government in the United States, the results presented here suggest that mediation will become less prevalent in U.S. foreign policy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction and research approach\n\nThe construction industry is known for its waste of money and materials, low innovative capacities, and low productivity (Cox and Thompson, 1997; Vrijhoef, 2011). One reason is that the relationships between client and contractors is often perceived as a problematic one (Tazelaar en Snijder, 2010; Vrijhoef, 2011). Since decades, attention has been paid to supply chain partnering (SCP) in the construction industry, as a promising strategy to decrease waste of time and money and increase quality and address the problematic relationships (Boukendour and Hughus, 2014; Bygballe et al., 2010; Eriksson, 2015; Hong et al., 2012; Vrijhoef, 2011).\n\n\nDespite the attention, it is hard to exactly pinpoint the concept of SCP. Many definitions, synonyms and related concepts circulate and it seems that SCP has increasingly become a buzz-word that represents ‘good practices’ in the construction sector. Nevertheless, applying SCP may involve ‘hard’ factors, such as early involvement of the contractor in the project, open book accounting, re-allocation of risks, and working with preferred partners. SCP may also involve ‘soft’ factors, such as increasing mutual trust between partners, increasing competences of conflict resolution or trying to establish more effective communication between partners. Some scholars argue that SCP should be considered as an emergent practice which can take on many different shapes (e.g. Bresnen, 2009; Hartmann and Bresnen, 2011; Marshall and Bresnen, 2013a; Marshall and Bresnen, 2013b). This study focuses on SCP as an emergent strategy. An emergent strategy, contrary to a deliberated strategy, is a strategy that arises in ongoing daily complex responsive processes between individuals. While a deliberated strategy looks forward and prescribes what people should do, an emergent strategy looks back and describes what people already do.\n\n\nStudies that dig deeper in those work floor practices and truly consider SCP in construction industry as an emergent practice is relatively scarce. It is said that current literature on this topic is stylized and too abstracted from daily work practice. Individual experiences are averaged away in an attempt to develop a general theory. There is too little insight in what people actually do in daily work practice and how they form a strategy such as SCP. Work floor experiences of SCP should be studied, because without the insight, it is difficult (if not impossible) to intervene in an efficient and effective way and to improve performances.\n\n\nTo study work floor experience of SCP, a specific part of the construction sector was chosen. After all, experiences in different fields may differ. This study focuses on Dutch housing associations. Dutch housing associations own a third of the total Dutch housing stock. Being one of the biggest clients, they dominate the sector. Due to several reasons, Dutch housing associations have to cut back expenditures. Supply chain partnering is one way to try to do this. Within the context of Dutch housing associations, we chose to study the work floor experiences of the project leaders, because project leaders are important in translating principles of SCP into daily work floor routines.\n\n\nThus, the problem is that not enough attention has been paid to what goes on at work floor level when project leaders try to apply principles of supply chain partnering. This insight is necessary, because supply chain partnering is formed by ongoing processes of interactions between professionals in daily work practice. Therefore, to improve performances and intervene effectively, insight in work floor practices should increase. This research aims to describe work floor experiences of professionals who work for Dutch housing association and who attempt to apply SCP. To reach this target the following question will be answered:\n\n\nWhat are work floor experiences of project leaders that work for Dutch housing associations who try to apply principles of SCP?\n\n\nJust one broad open research question was formulated, so that work floor experiences could be studied holistically. By not formulating specified sub-questions beforehand, the right circumstances were created for themes to emerge inductively. These themes are:\n\n\n• The importance of the intra-organizational supply chain in effective collaboration\n\n• Leadership.\n\n• Inconsistent use of values that are associated with the concept of SCP.\n\n• Power dynamics and ethics.\n\n\n\nThis study relies on the assumption that current literature about construction partnering is too abstracted from daily work life. In order to justify this assumption, a literature review was conducted.\n\n\nAnother assumption on which this research relies, is that all knowledge is socially constructed and that this knowledge can only be known from an individual subjective frame of reference. Therefore, every notion of reality that people have is non-objective and limited by the boundaries of language. That means that this research presents a researcher’s interpretation of a social construct, which is in this case work floor experiences of supply chain partnering.\n\n\nThis research consists of a literature review, three case studies, and an overarching study in which the insights that are gained in the three case studies are synthesized. Although the research approach in each case differs slightly, in each case study narrative techniques are used.\n\n\nThe main method to gather data was conducting open, semi-structured interviews in which the participants were asked for their experiences with SCP and the context that enabled or restrained them for applying SCP. The main method to analyze data in each case study was constructing a narrative about and with the participants in the case study. For each case study narratives were created and validated by presenting the narrative to the participants. The cases were brought together in two ways. On the one hand, predetermined dimensions were used to compare the data and on the other hand themes have emerged inductively. Not surprisingly, the results of both ways overlap and interrelate.\n\nResults\n\nThe first case study presents the results of a study in which a work floor professional together with a researcher tried to contribute to the implementation of SCP within renovation processes of a Dutch housing association. The managing director purchased and introduced BIM-software, and some project leaders began to organize ‘BIMsessions’. That means that the project leader invited internal as well as external supply chain partners, to a develop plan for a housing complex. It appeared to be difficult for the project leader to lead this conversation. There is a lot of discussion about many topics, structure lacks and discussions end without conclusions. Questions about the organization’s policy about for example sustainability remain unanswered, even when the project leader asks his colleagues within his own organization. Finally, the project leader and the co-makers managed to develop a plan for the housing complex. However, while a lot of time was spend on developing the plan, a misunderstanding with the internal client caused serious uncertainty whether this project could continue at all.\n\n\nThe second case study followed multiple project leaders in a Dutch housing association who try to apply SCP. The department had just been reorganized. Among other structural differences, a new department of Purchasing was founded. Some project leaders considered this new department as an extra chain in the supply chain. One of their tasks was to select contractors, which was something that the project leaders used to do themselves. The narrative tells that a duo started to develop their own selection procedure and selectively ‘forgot’ to involve the department of Purchasing. Also other intra-organizational dynamics are described, for example the relationship between project leaders and their team leaders was not always easy. It was found that key values of SCP as understood by the project leaders - such as sharing responsibilities and addressing feedback towards each other openly - are applied inconsistently.\n\n\nThe third case study evaluated a team of professionals from a Dutch housing association and a contractor who perceive themselves as a successful supply chain. The collaboration grew in an organic way, because the contractor was selected multiple times in multiple selection procedures. The perceived successes seem to be based on the repetition in their collaboration. Remarkable in this case was that the individual interviews show that some people of the client organization within the successful supply chain, were considered as not so successful after all. About these people it was said, for example, that they try to control the contractor too much. Those people were aware of their image, but a conversation about it never took place. Instead, as one of the contractors said, they try to work around those people. The narrative also describes that during this case study, within the client organization it was decided not to work with preferred partners. That means that in the future the contractor still has to go through selection procedures and that makes continuation of the success in the future insecure.\n\nConclusions\n\nBefore conclusions of the case studies are detailed, first the results of a literature study about the nature of qualitative construction partnering research are discussed. Current literature about construction partnering research is said to be too abstracted from daily work life. Reviewing the nature of qualitative construction partnering research identified the following gaps. 1) Literature underexposes processes of data analysis. 2) Reflection on the role of the researcher(s) in the research process is underexposed. 3) The individual level of analysis is underexposed. 4) The way in which the results are generalized remain somewhat opaque, especially reflections on internal generalization are underexposed. All identified gaps have in common specific time and place dependent details that may have influenced understanding of studied individuals are underexposed and that may explain a feeling that current literature is abstracted from individual work experiences.\n\nWhat are work floor experiences of project leaders who work for Dutch housing associations and who try to apply the principles of SCP?\n\nThe narratives describe that with or without a managerial intervention, some of the project leaders start experimenting with applying SCP. Individual initiatives have risen, albeit in a somewhat patchy and uncoordinated manner. The number and nature of supply chain partners is large, diverse, complex and dynamic. It appeared to be difficult to unify all the participants with different agendas and frames of reference. The cases address many issues in intra-organizational relations that hamper the collaboration with external partners. The work experiences also show that key values associated with SCP are applied only to some groups and individuals within the supply chain.\n\nSimilarities between the cases in terms of strength, scope, duration and depth\n\nThe cases were compared using four dimensions that were provided by Eriksson (2015). The dimensions are strength, scope, duration and depth of SCP. This resulted in multiple observations. None of the project leaders worked with preferred partners (by-passing expensive and time-consuming procurement and selection procedures) in any case, and there is no indication that this will change in the future. In all three cases, it was expected that applying SCP would reduce costs, but there was no agreement as to what those costs were specifically. In general, pricing and cost remained a complex topic, and all project leaders referred to different aspects of this topic. Formally, the duration of relationship with the contractors was one project only. Informally, the respondents acknowledged that they expected to cooperate again with most of the contractors in the future. One reason for this could be the limited size of the regional market. The maintenance phase was not involved in the collaboration in any of the cases. The contractor’s timing of involvement varied between projects. However, in all cases, the outlines of the project, such as approximate budget and main technical interventions, were predetermined, and difficult and time consuming to change. Implementation of SCP (especially when applied for the first time in a project setting) was not perceived as something that necessarily leads to shorter duration of (parts of) the project. In all three cases, the managing directors of the departments of renovation supported SCP. However, the managers’ actual involvement in daily work practice was limited. Moreover, the support did not lead to changes in the formal strategy for the other departments in the organization outside the department of renovation and maintenance.\n\n\nAs described in the introduction of this thesis, this research deliberately started with one broad open research question for themes to emerge inductively. These four themes are: 1) the importance of the intra-organizational supply chain in effective collaboration. 2) Leadership. 3) Inconsistent use of key values that are associated with the concept of SCP. 4) Power dynamics and ethics. The four themes are elaborated below.\n\nThe importance of the intra-organizational supply chain in effective collaboration\n\nAll three cases show the importance of the intra-organizational supply chain on relationships with external partners. All three cases show examples of project leaders who try to collaborate with contractors, but were hindered by intra-organizational issues. For example, the first case study shows that a serious misunderstanding with the internal client caused uncertainty of the progress of a project in which a time was invested by the contractor. In the second case study, the newly founded department of purchasing was perceived by some project leaders as an extra chain in the supply chain, which makes processes of selecting partners more complex instead of lean. The third case study shows that continuation of the success was insecure, because within the client organization it was decided not to start working with preferred partners. Based on these examples, it was concluded that different types of non-functional intraorganizational dynamics slowed down the collaboration processes with the external partners, or made continuation of perceived good practices insecure.\n\nLeadership\n\nFrom the perspective of the project leaders, it seems that their managers’ focus is not on facilitating daily work practice of SCP, neither on designing and communicating a deliberate SCP-strategy. It seems that some project leaders feel victims of contextual vagaries, not always able to get a grip on managing the supply chain effectively. Interventions that were undertaken by project leaders and their managers, are patchy, contradictory, and/or unfinished. Many individual initiatives have arisen, but continuation of good practices appeared uncertain. In all three cases, the project leaders’ managers (in different hierarchical levels) initiated and/or supported the implementation of SCP. For example, BIM-software was purchased, a presentation was organized, or the project leaders are supported with words. And in each case a procurement policy still prevailed and management’s expectations of what project leaders should do or aim for were not clear. The social relation between the project leaders and their managers appeared to be problematic in many individual cases. Especially the project leaders in the first and second case experience that the managers have too little insight and ear for what the project leaders do and the problems they encounter in daily work life. When those project leaders try to discuss their experiences, they often feel unheard and misunderstood.\n\nInconsistent use of key values that are associated with the concept of SCP\n\nThe cases show that certain values were associated with applying SCP. In the first case trust and trustworthiness are discussed. In the second case values such as ‘sharing responsibilities’, ‘pro-activity’, and ‘you must give each other open and honest feedback’ were discussed. In the third case, among other things, informal evaluations and expressing appreciation from the client’s project leader towards the building site workers were mentioned as important values. The exact formulation of these key values always differs slightly, but there is no reason to assume that the mentioned key values differ significantly from what has often been mentioned in literature about construction SCP. It could be argued that these key values are similar to general ideas of professional behavior and should therefore be applied in non-SCP-situations as well. But that debate falls outside the scope of this study.\n\n\nNew insight that this study provides is that the key values that are associated with SCP were applied to limited parts of the supply chain only and applied inconsistently. For example, the internal client was not involved in the application of SCP at all, and therefore the values of SCP were not applied to this party. Another example, in the third case study, people who were perceived as ‘not that far in their thinking’, were not provided with a short informal evaluation, although that was mentioned as a factor of success. Especially the intra-organizational supply chain seems to be treated differently than the inter-organizational supply chain.\n\n\nThis dynamic of shifting application of values and the actions that provokes, seems not to be a matter of bad intentions. There is no reason to question individual intentions. Rather, possible reasons could be that project leaders are not always (fully) aware of the extent of the supply chain they are working with, or they feel unable to apply the key values, or they do not believe in a positive result of doing so, or they fear the consequences.\n\nPower dynamics and ethics\n\nWhatever the reason for the shifting application of key values of SCP is, the participants together have created situations that provoke ethical questions. Related to this discussion, is the discussion about power dynamics. In this study power is not seen as something that one possesses, rather it is something one gains through interactions. A constant power shift is ubiquitous in all normal daily social interactions. The cases show that in normal daily work life, people constantly negotiate, construct, conduct process of trial-and-error, and in those processes, they may gain or lose power. Power arises in normal social interactions at work floor and power dynamics can be visible or hidden. An example of a form of visible power is when the client’s project manager claims that contractors are not allowed to make money on smart purchasing of materials. He proposes a system involving a risk buffer, something which the contractor’s head of the regional branch agreed to, although he does not think this is fair. An example of hidden form of power is when a purchaser might have formal power over project leaders in terms of selection of contractors, but the project leader might gain back his power by selectively ‘forgetting’ to involve the purchaser in a selection procedure, and so on. It is well possible that an internal client, who appeared to be not engaged and informed about the change of the department of renovations and maintenance towards SCP, does not even realize the power he may have on the process. That means that certain people unexpectedly and unconsciously may appear to have a great power in the process of collaboration.\n\n\nIt seems that, although perhaps unintendedly and unconsciously, supply chain partnering is used strategically to gain power. The word ‘SCP’ (or one of its synonyms) can be used as an argument to easily convince somebody else to do something that one would otherwise not do. After all, SCP is a buzz-word that seems to represent ‘good practices’ in the sector, rather than it is a deliberated strategy. Key values that are associated with SCP are hard to not agree with. By strategically referring to key values of SCP power can be gained. Perhaps the clearest example of such an issue is shown in especially the first and third case studies. A possible interpretation of the case studies is that applying SCP leaded to a situation in which the contractors still go through time consuming and expensive selection procedures, are involved in earlier phases of the process (thus provide extra work), still have limited influence in the technical interventions, have more responsibilities, and are supposed to (gradually) save 20% of the costs (although it is undefined how this cost-reduction is calculated). It is highly questionable whether this is fair and whether all the effort that was put in applying SCP will solve the problems that people expect. This also feeds the impression that despite the attention, engagement, and effort put into applying the principles of SCP, intraand inter-organizational collaborations have not improved fundamentally.\n\nReflection on research, academic and practical implications\n\nBefore implications and recommendations of this study are discussed, the study should be reflected and limitations should be acknowledged. The first point of reflection concerns finding the right position of the researcher in the field. Whatever position the researcher has in the field, the most important aspects are awareness of that role in the field, and awareness that the researcher is just as well part of the ongoing complex responsive processes. Another methodological quest was what it means to analyze at an individual level of analysis. Throughout this study, it was experienced that abstracting from direct experiences happens gradually. Based on this research an ideal level of abstraction cannot be determined, but also at this point the researcher has to be aware and make conscious decisions (and be transparent) at all times. Another point of attention is about objectivity and neutrality of the researcher. Instead of pretending to be objective and neutral, I think it is better to acknowledge that no person is capable of being objective and neutral. Therefore, although this may be difficult, the researcher has to be as transparent as possible about it. Then the reader has more opportunities to value the research in an honest way.\n\n\nAcademic recommendations concern development of theory as well as methodology. A first academic recommendation is to keep considering work floor experiences of implementing SCP – or the introduction of any other phenomenon, such as Total Cost of Ownership, or circular building. Research that is abstracted from ongoing daily work practice, may easily overlook relatively small, unexpected, but influential factors. A second academic recommendation, is to study ethics in relationships at work floors. This research provides reasons to think that some groups are treated with different values than others, and the question is whether this is justified. Also, it was observed that participants together create situations that provoke ethical questions, while there is no reason to question individual intentions. A third academic recommendation concerns the low diversity among the project leaders. Most project leaders in this study are white male with a technical or business Bachelor-degree. Only one of the studied project leaders was female. We think this represents the diversity within the total population. The relation to low diversity and performance in this sector should be studied.\n\n\nMethodological recommendations concern qualitative construction partnering research and are directly based on the four methodological gaps that are identified in the literature review, and is four-folded: 1) more attention should be paid and/or transparency should be increased about the process of data analysis. 2) the researcher should reflect more on his/her role in the research process is underexposed. 3) more analysis at individual level is necessary. 4) There should be more attention and transparency about the way in which the results are generalized.\n\n\nPractitioners in housing associations – and other parties in other supply chains – can use the findings in multiple ways. The description of work floor experiences may provoke many ideas for practical interventions, but the results of this study can never be an argument to intervene in other situations. Professionals who are inspired by this research are recommended to, before coming to action, evaluate their own situation thoroughly. The conclusions can be a point of attention within that evaluation, but professionals may also be inspired by the methodologies that were used in this study to evaluate work floor practices. Important tools in evaluating one’s own situation is conducting interviews and observations from different perspectives in different hierarchical levels within parties in the supply chain. This may be done in a formal and informal way and it might be more a matter of attitude than action. After all, a professional is part of ongoing conversation with all kinds of people daily. Therefore, there are plenty of opportunities to conduct interviews and observe the situation situations with an evaluative eye. A second recommendation is that, if practitioners decide to intervene, they should focus on the effects of the intervention, at least as much as the intervention itself. The action does not stop when the intervention is done, rather the action begins after intervening. Again, this is a matter of attitude, rather than a matter of action. A third recommendation is to explore the role as managers and leaders. The study shows project leaders feel that their managers not always take the lead, and project leaders themselves seem not always able to take the lead either. There is a lot of management literature about the seemingly paradox of managing unmanageable processes, that can help in exploring this role. Whatever the outcome of the self-exploration process will be, the cases show that many project leaders feel unheard and misunderstood by their managers. This dynamic is relatively easy to overcome, and that takes effort from both the manager and the project leader. Simple conversation rules, such as non-violent communication principles, may help in increasing mutual understanding and increasing competences of listening. Fourthly, we observe that some parts of the supply chain are thought of (and treated) with different values than other parts. To change this, self-awareness of use of such key values and answering the question whether this is justified should be answered individually. All practical recommendations have in common that they require a high level of self-reflective competences, and therefore it is recommended to keep increasing self-reflective competences. Again, this is a matter of attitude, rather than undertaking extra actions. There are different ways to achieve this. People can start by considering their daily communication as if it were interviews or observations and start acting like reflective practitioners. This action will likely also increase skills of listening. Further, one can ask help of a coach. Or one can consider meditating. Becoming and being reflective is an ongoing process.\n\n\n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In March 2000 a fire broke out at the Royal Philips Electronics plant, damaging its supply of semiconductor chips. Nokia Corporation and Ericsson LM relied on these chips to produce their cell phones; together they received 40 percent of the plant's chip production. Both companies were about to release new cell phone designs that required the chips. At Nokia, word of the setback spread quickly up the chain of command. Nokia's team, which had a crisis plan in place, sprang into action. With an aggressive, multipronged strategy, Nokia avoided any cell phone production loss. In contrast, the low-level technician who received the information at Ericsson did not notify his supervisors about the fire until early April and had to scramble to locate new sources for the chips. This search delayed production and proved a fatal blow to Ericsson's independent production of mobile phones. Nokia's handling of its supply chain disruption provides a dramatic example of how a company's strategic risk management can alleviate financial disaster and lay the groundwork for success in the future. Perturbations in supply chain management are inevitable, and grow harder and harder to assess as the marketplace becomes more globalized.</jats:p><jats:p>Students will learn the following concepts:</jats:p>",

The greatest critical success factor of SCM is partnership. Without cooperation between companies, SCM performance is limited. Does this imply, therefore, that companies within the supply chain can achieve mutual transactions equally? If the power between companies is unequal, how does this affect their partnership? The focus of this study is to assess whether power types enhance SCM performance through partnerships. We categorize power types as mediated and non-mediated. Mediated power is categorized based on coercion, reward, and legitimate, while non-mediated power is categorized based on information, expert, and reference. Therefore, this study examines how power types form a causal partnership relationship within the supply chain, and performs an empirical investigation on how the partnerships influence SCM performance.</jats:p>"

Oil and gas companies are building more digitally integrated supply chains and are seeing significant results.\nWhen a damaged gasket can cost US$1M/day and create a major safety hazard, even early stage implementation of digital technologies can generate significant improvements. A liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant was curious about what they could achieve through better data integration and alignment. Visualising activity plans and digitally integrating equipment strategies through bill of materials improved the plant’s supply responsiveness, increasing both asset availability and production output by 2%.\nCreatively leveraging automation across the supply chain is helping companies become more connected. Starting with advanced analytics, the building blocks for end-to-end solutions are being built. In the near future, predictive part failures data will automatically load into work management processes, maintenance plans will immediately update and the right parts automatically ordered at the right time. Some companies are experimenting with this ‘virtual handshake’ across departments and systems, creating a smarter, faster and more reliable operation. Using both analytics and improved collaboration, one LNG operation has seen a 40% reduction in duplicate parts, a 30% reduction in inventory and an 8% reduction in overall maintenance cost.\nThrough curiosity, creativity and collaboration across a digitally integrated supply chain, industry organisations can reduce controllable operational cost, making them more reliable and competitive.\n</jats:p>"

These factors and others forced petroleum companies for a greater need in strategic planning and optimisation in order to make decisions that satisfy conflicting multi-objective situation, goals of maximising expected profit while simultaneously minimising risk. The main purpose of this paper is the design and development of a simulation model for a petroleum supply chain to be used as a planning and decision making tool while considering factors such as oil flow rate, quality of crude oil, distillation time and separators failure rate. The simulation model is then designed and implemented to measure the performance of the petroleum supply chain proposed. ARENA software is used to build the proposed models and the results of experiments are analysed using SPSS software.</jats:p>"

This means that it is financial deepening that leads to growth and not growth leading financial deepening. Among other things, the study recommended that policy efforts should be geared towards removing obstacles that undermine the growth of credit to the private sector, and must restore investors’ confidence in the stock market operations.</jats:p>"

The article aims to analyse and systematize the main stages of the formation of the system of customs institutions in Ukraine that implement customs control.\nMethod (methodology). To achieve this goal, the following tasks are defined: to characterize the legal and regulatory aspects of the formation of the customs authorities in Ukraine; to analyse the organizational provision of customs control during 1991-2016; to determine the fiscal effects of the formation of the customs authorities of Ukraine. The functioning of the system of state financial control in the customs sphere has become the object of the research. The organizational and applied aspects of the formation of institutions that carry out customs control in Ukraine have become the subject of the study.\nResults. The administrative and organizational structure of the customs authorities of Ukraine does not remain stable. It is in constant dynamics under the influence of political, economic and social changes, increase of subjects of foreign economic activity and their activity in foreign markets, growth of indicators of cargo and livestock flows through the customs border the state and in general the development of the Ukrainian economy and its integration into the world economy. The results of the survey will be useful to the state authorities in developing management decisions on optimizing the bodies that carry out customs control in Ukraine.</jats:p>"

Our findings argue the pertinence of a Hybrid Supply Chain model combining elements of the Lean, Agile and Leagile paradigms upstream and the Project Management paradigm downstream in the case of a Wind Turbine Manufacturer. We also find that, depending on the complexity of the market and supply diversity, multiple decoupling points emerge. Through the present Wind Energy Supply Chain case, we find that for effective management of a global supply chain characterized by a high number of references and multiple technologies, it is necessary to mix different manufacturing paradigms in order to provide a quick, agile and competitive response to the customer. </jats:p>"

Office Supply Incorporated (OSI) is a company in crisis, with challenges in its cost structure and poor IT performance. Outsourcing to Technology Infrastructure Solutions is an opportunity to both reduce costs and complexity for the firm, but students first must consider whether outsourcing is a good strategic fit for OSI. Detailed spreadsheet templates are given that are based on a real outsourcing client engagement for a major infrastructure outsourcing company. The spreadsheets are complex but have been simplified so that they automatically calculate when populated, allowing the students to quickly move to answering the management challenge: how should TIS price and structure the outsourcing deal? Answering this question provides deep insights into the business case for IT outsourcing and how outsourcers financially engineer a deal structure to ensure a win-win outcome for both the client and outsource service provider.</jats:p><jats:p>Students will: Understand the strategic context of IT outsourcing and when it will benefit a firm; Understand IT infrastructure outsourcing and management issues such as personnel reductions and organizational change; Learn which outsourcing pricing model is the best fit for a project; Create a rigorous cost-benefit financial analysis and ROI model for IT infrastructure outsourcing; Analyze the model and learn how to financially engineer the deal to be a win-win for the outsourcer and client.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper presents the main features of camping tourism in Croatia through the stages of its development, as well as its significance in recent Croatian tourism supply. The goal of the research is to contribute to the development of the campsites' typology in contemporary tourism supply of Croatian coastal tourism destinations, based on differences in the capacity of campings, location factors, spatial impacts and the consequences, characteristics of supply in campings as well as motivations, attitudes and habits of camping tourists in each of the types of campsites. Krk, the largest settlement on the island of Krk, was chosen as a representative case study. Krk is a tourism destination with traditionally developed camping tourism. Campsites, as a type of accommodation capacities that occupy the largest areas in the town, have had a significant impact on its spatial and economic development, primarily through changing the usage and the value of land, socioeconomic and socio-cultural transformation of the local population, changes in the structure of tourism supply and environmental implications. In the example of the town of Krk, three types of campsites are identified: a) traditional camping, b) exclusive camping, and c) small family run camping. This typology can be applied on a wider scale Croatian level. In addition to literature overview, quantitative tourism statistic data interpretation and continuous field research, direct questionnaire survey in July 2016 was conducted. A\n\nnonprobabilistic occasional sample included a total of 127 camping tourists in Camping Ježevac (example of a traditional camping), Camping Resort Krk (example of an exclusive camping) and Camping Bor (example of a small family run camping). In order to identify differences in the motivation, attitudes and habits of respondents in different types of campings, the results of the survey are processed using standard descriptive statistics methods.</jats:p>"

The greatest critical success factor of SCM is partnership. Without cooperation between companies, SCM performance is limited. Does this imply, therefore, that companies within the supply chain can achieve mutual transactions equally? If the power between companies is unequal, how does this affect their partnership? The focus of this study is to assess whether power types enhance SCM performance through partnerships. We categorize power types as mediated and non-mediated. Mediated power is categorized based on coercion, reward, and legitimate, while non-mediated power is categorized based on information, expert, and reference. Therefore, this study examines how power types form a causal partnership relationship within the supply chain, and performs an empirical investigation on how the partnerships influence SCM performance.</jats:p>"

Permainan yang menarik dan disukai biasanya hampir mendekati dunia nyata manusia. Umumnya pada game yang ada, tidak memiliki distribusi makanan, sehingga menjadikan game kurang manusiawi. Pada model lain pasukan yang kembali dari perang, membutuhkan waktu agar pulih, namun ketika kondisi dimana pemain ingin kembali berperang, energi pasukan belum sepenuhnya pulih, karena itu dibutuhkan suatu metode agar pasokan makanan bisa tepat sasaran. Percobaan ini menggunakan metode Hierarchical Finite State Machine untuk mendesain perilaku agen game RTS dan mengacu pada skema supply chain management agar perilaku agen dalam mendistribusikan makanan mendekati dunia nyata. Penempatan lokasi koordinat agen dirancang mengacu pada skema supply chain dengan pendekatan gravity location model agar menghasilkan posisi koordinat yang optimal sehingga waktu dan biaya dalam distribusi makanan bisa diminimalkan.

The objective is to give insights into methodological issues related to maturity models, namely the research objectives; the research methods used to develop, validate and test them; the scope; and the main characteristics associated with their design. The literature review was performed based on journal articles and conference papers from 2000 to 2015 using the SCOPUS, Emerald Insight, EBSCO and Web of Science databases. Most of the analysed papers have as main objective the development of maturity models and their validation. The case study is the methodology that is most widely used by researchers to develop and validate maturity models. From the sustainability perspective, the scope of the analysed maturity models is the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) and environmental dimension, focusing on a specific process (eco-design and new product development) and without a broad SC perspective. The dominant characteristics associated with the design of the maturity models are the maturity grids and a continuous representation. In addition, results do not allow identifying a trend for a specific number of maturity levels. The comprehensive review, analysis, and synthesis of the maturity model literature represent an important contribution to the organization of this research area, making possible to clarify some confusion that exists about concepts, approaches and components of maturity models in sustainability. Various aspects associated with the maturity models (i.e., research objectives, research methods, scope and characteristics of the design of models) are explored to contribute to the evolution and significance of this multidimensional area.</jats:p>"

Within a challenging global arena, relationship value is believed to result in business retention. It is therefore critical to have a better understanding of this value to ensure business sustainability within supply chains. Literature suggests that relationship value drivers comprise three dimensions, namely a core offering, sourcing process and customer operations.Research purpose: The contribution of the research reported on in this paper is an enhanced conceptual understanding of relationship value and its salient drivers within the South African automotive supply chains.Motivation for the study: Literature invites more research on relationship value and its drivers. Therefore, the research reported on tested the antecedents of relationship value.Research design, approach and method: Relationship value drivers were tested through empirical research within the South African automotive supply chains by means of a path analysis. The research utilised a closed-ended questionnaire, and targeted managers among Tier 1 buyers and asked them about the relationship value traits of their best Tier 2 suppliers.Main findings: It was found that personal interaction, which forms part of the sourcing process, is viewed as the strongest antecedent of relationship value within the South African automotive supply chains, followed by product quality and delivery.Practical/managerial implications: It is suggested that superior supply chain practices within the South African automotive industry might secure business retention. Automotive component suppliers are therefore advised to implement relationship value strategies to promote higher value through personal interaction.</jats:p>"

The buildup of international reserves has accelerated during the episode of higher oil price. The associated increase in government spending has limited contribution to capacity building and pronounced inflationary pressures, which accelerated at the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980, and eased at the end of the war in 1988. Accommodating monetary stance has proven to be an important determinant of inflation, both in the long and in the short-runs. In the long-run, depreciation of the rial increases the cost of intermediate goods, increasing inflationary pressures with limited significant effect on output. In contrast, depreciation could boost competitiveness of non-energy exports, in support of higher demand and output growth in the short-run. For policy implications, priorities going forward should be in place to direct both public and private resources toward relaxing binding capacity constraints, capitalizing on oil resources in Iran and the prospects of the positive implications of lifting sanctions in the context of the recent nuclear agreement between Iran and the G5+1 countries.</jats:p>",

The government has encouraged industry, society, and non-government organizations to work together to achieve this objective. The government has provided incentives through several energy programmes such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, green technology, and green building. One key area that has been targeted is logistics and supply chain, which has been contributing to high carbon emissions in manufacturing industries. Scholars and practitioners have only recently begun to pay attention to creating a low carbon supply chain. Furthermore, Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have faced several challenges in adopting low carbon activities. SMEs are unable to take the advantage of energy initiatives because of a lack of knowledge, a shortage of funds, and inadequate facilities. Almost 90% of firms are in the service industry working with large manufacturing firms and some SMEs working in manufacturing industry are working closely with their supply chain networks; achieving low carbon targets is hampered by the readiness of the manufacturing itself. This chapter discusses the challenges and future agenda of creating low carbon supply chains in manufacturing in Malaysia. Possible solutions are provided at the end of the chapter. </jats:p>"

The high financial and resource investments needed to train health workers make it important to find ways to increase the number of students entering initial health professional training (sometimes referred to as pre-licensure training) and reduce the number of pre-graduation drop-outs. Ways to achieve this include interventions to increase the capacity of health professional training institutions; reduce the loss of students (and increase the likelihood that students will graduate); or increase the recruitment of students from other countries into health professional training institutions. Minority academic advisory programmes that include academic, personal, financial and vocational advising, skills building, mentorships, supplementary training, and annual evaluations are an approach to achieving this amongst students from minority groups.</jats:p>"

Such programmes have had a history of problems integrating supply chain and engineering information, which has contributed to cost and schedule impact. Through BAE Systems Naval Ships Product Lifecycle Management approach, a Data Quality and Governance framework has been implemented to reduce such issues through information cataloguing and data quality measurement. Mapping product data processes allows the elimination of disparate data sources and directs users to a single point of truth that serves the needs of all stakeholders. In addition, cross functional working groups are being used to develop new data exchange practices that maintain data integrity. Ultimately this will ensure that arriving supplier equipment will be correctly identified for planned installation and supplier data is tracked and stored consistently. This paper will describe this novel approach and the challenges experienced implementing it on a major shipbuilding programme.</jats:p>"

Strenuous efforts are being made to bring down costs, reduce complexity and expedite the completion of major capital projects.\nYet with the commodity price looking likely to be subdued for some time, serious questions persist. How can we sustain activity in Australia, secure the investment needed to continue exploration and appraisal drilling, for the next wave of projects?\nIn looking for answers to these challenges, collaboration is a theme that comes up time and time again. But what does it actually mean? What does it look like in practice? Who does it well and how? And which companies are reaping the rewards of great collaboration?\nTo fill this knowledge gap we are launching a survey which will look at many aspects of collaboration in the Australia and compare this with the results of similar surveys conducted in the UK. We will be looking to survey both operators and service companies working in the Australia and find out:\n\nWhat does collaboration mean?\nWhat constitutes effective collaboration?\nHow do companies view themselves and each other as collaborators?\nHow does collaboration in Australia compare with companies in the North Sea?\n\nWe hope a better understanding of collaboration could help companies in Australia continue to improve productivity and efficiency, adopt new ways of working, and truly make the most of Australia’s abundant resources.\n</jats:p>"

The aim of our research is in identification of the ways of venous outflow from corpus callosum and in clarification of the principle of structural organization of its hemomicrocirculatory channel.\n\nMaterials and methods. In the work are used the median total preparations of the corpus callosum (together with septum pellucidum and cerebral fornix formations) of 10 men 36–60 years old. Histological paraffin sections, colored by hematoxylin and eosin and according to Van-gieson were made of these preparations, and the methods of plastination of the corpus callosum tissues in epoxy resin with further creation of polished sections of different width and serial fine sections of blocs, for which coloration served the 1 % solution of blue methene for 1% borax solution, were also used.\n\nResults. It was established, that the arterial microvessels, starting from vascular plexus that covers the upper surface of corpus callosum, penetrate it as arterioles along interfunicular connective tissue septs that divide its commissural funicles between them. The arterioles are prolonged directly in venous microvessels that can be related to gathering venules. These direct microvascular communications, coming through the thickness of corpus callosum, can be named perforating arteriolovenular anastomoses. The aforesaid collector venules, localized in the lowest sections of interfunicular interlayers, are the direct inflows of venous channel of septum pellucidum. In general system of blood supply of corpus callosum the main arteries on the one side and the veins of septum pellucidum – on the other, are not accompanied by the vessels of opposite type.\n\nConclusions. The blood microcirculatory channel of corpus callosum is the complexly branched in its thickness net of resistive, metabolic and capacitive microvessels, placed on the running way between arterial channel of soft cerebral tunic that covers the upper surface of corpus callosum and collector veins of septum pellucidum, situated below it. The direct shunting tracts between them are perforating arteriolovenular anastomoses.</jats:p>",

Each power supply is modeled using differential equations and only differs in the values of its parasitic resistances. This is done in a MATLAB/Simulink environment. A fuzzy logic controller accepts the power supply usage and the power supply’s input voltage perturbation as its inputs while the probability of the corresponding power supply turning ON is its output. The power supplies are connected in parallel configuration and tested under various conditions of static and dynamic current sharing load, voltage input perturbations and on the total number of active power supplies in a given parallel configuration. The number of power supplies n in the parallel configuration is changed by adding or removing a power supply. This addition or removal is termed as scalability. As a result, the fuzzy logic controller was able to guarantee that all power supplies in the scalable n-parallel configuration have equal usage while sharing the load current equally under a regulated output voltage.</jats:p>"

The main objective\n   of this paper is to establish whether it is still reasonable to consider\n   PIIGS as a group apart. Our methodological strategy is based on the Okun Law\n   (OL) which is incorporated in a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR)\n   model with Blanchard-Quah (BQ) restrictions. We address two drawbacks that\n   usually present in the OL: the interdependency problem and the\n   non-stationarity problem. By using a non-parametric representation of OL, we\n   identify the heterogeneity between countries. We build stable VAR models for\n   each of the economies and use the BQ SVAR impulses to analyse the importance\n   of contemporary and long-run effects of supply and demand shocks. The main\n   conclusion of this paper is that it does not make any sense today to\n   identify PIIGS as a separate group. Additionally, a country that stands out\n   from our analysis is France. The question can thus be posed that if ?PIIGS?\n   signifies ?countries with poor economic performances? then should not France\n   also belong to this group?</jats:p>"

The critical success factors (CSFs) of each of these destinations may differ, making the management process more complex.Research purpose: The purpose of this research was to identify the CSFs for business tourism destinations in South Africa from a supply viewpoint.Motivation for the study: Because of the importance of CSFs, many previous studies have attempted to identify such factors within the tourism industry, but few concentrated on business tourism, especially in South Africa, leaving a gap in terms of knowledge. By means of identifying and understanding what these factors are for South Africa, the country could further develop its tourism sector, which could result in its being more competitive as a destination.Research design, approach and method: To achieve this goal, a qualitative research approach was followed by interviewing seven key business tourism coordinators in South Africa, to determine the key success factors of the business. The data gathered were transcribed and analysed using Creswell’s six steps in data analysis and interpretation.Main findings: Finances, human resources, product and customer-related aspects were identified as the CSFs for business tourism in South Africa.Practical/managerial implications: Educating the market and marketing value add-ons were identified as important for enhancing and making business tourism in South Africa more competitive.Contribution/value-add: The results could guide managers in the implementation of effective key success factors in an effort to mitigate management problems in a very competitive sector.</jats:p>"

The relationship between these parties put contractor as the chain in this relationship, known as construction supply chain (CSC).  In CSC there are  possibilities of risks that can increase the project cost, thus impact on the declining of the contractor’s profit. These source from three flows of supply chain system, that is flow of informations, flow of material and flow of funds. This  research  aims to analysis the supply chain risks on building construction project in Bali that affect on the declining of contractor’s profit.  Data was collected using a questionnaire survey. The respondents were selected  based on purposive sampling method, covers the experst on building construction projects. The method of analisys covers risk assement and linear regression analysis. The risk assement analysis shows that there are 26 major risks (6 risk in flow of information, 16 risks in flow of material and 4 risks in flow of fund). The regression analysis suggests that risks sourced from flow of informations is the most significant  factor that increase the projects cost, therefore mitigating focused on the flow of information with develop project’s administration as shop drawing, work permits, material’s approval, completeness of contract and daily coordination.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>World markets are highly interlinked and local economies extensively rely on global supply and value chains. Consequently, local production disruptions, for instance caused by extreme weather events, are likely to induce indirect losses along supply chains with potentially global repercussions. These complex loss dynamics represent a challenge for comprehensive disaster risk assessments. Here, we introduce the numerical agent-based model acclimate designed to analyze the cascading of economic losses in the global supply network. Using national sectors as agents, we apply the model to study the global propagation of losses induced by stylized disasters. We find that indirect losses can become comparable in size to direct ones, but can be efficiently mitigated by warehousing and idle capacities. Consequently, a comprehensive risk assessment cannot focus solely on first-tier suppliers, but has to take the whole supply chain into account. To render the supply network climate-proof, national adaptation policies have to be complemented by international adaptation efforts. In that regard, our model can be employed to assess reasonable leverage points and to identify dynamic bottlenecks inaccessible to static analyses.</p>"

Ceci étant dit, les charges publiques liées à l’approvisionnement en blé sont caractérisées par une considérable profusion de termes, difficilement explicable expliquée a priori. Se fondant sur un croisement de sources littéraires et épigraphiques, cet article se donne pour but de mettre en lumière les différents schémas facteurs expliquant cette variabilité terminologique, en se concentrant sur l’orient méditerranéen. Il révèle, entre autres, que cette variabilité résulte dans une large mesure du haut degré d’institutionnalisation du secteur de l’approvisionnement en grains.</jats:p>"

The models are classified into three categories of classification: network design, inventory models, and optimization of a pharmaceutical supply chain. A taxonomy for each category is shown describing the principal features of each echelon included in the review; this taxonomy allows the readers to identify easily a paper based on the actors of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The search process included research articles published in the databases between 1984 and November 2016. In total 46 studies were included. In the review process we found that in the three fields the most common source of uncertainty used is the demand in the 56% of the cases. Within the review process we can conclude that most of the articles in the literature are focused on the optimization of the pharmaceutical supply chain and inventory models but the field on supply chain network design is not deeply studied.</jats:p>"

For most companies around the world, resources have been reduced, inventory drained, technology spending curtailed, and core processes scaled back in order to adjust to the current reality of reduced demand. So, this paper mainly concentrates on giving some tips based on recession recovery strategies. Firstly, this paper discussed the supply chain management trends in and up to 2015, then general concept of recession and the relation between recession and supply chain management system, then some fatal mistakes of recession recovery according to the supply chain experts and recession and recovery related literature reviews are summarized to identify ultimately the recession recovery strategies for the manufacturer. The paper ended with some supply chain management related predictions, tips for reducing supply chain barriers. Moreover, a brief section of this paper also here highlights the supply-chain infrastructure helpful for recession recovery that is one of the important factors for the reason of cost-reduction, resource planning and maintenance etc. in today's supply chain management and related environment. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this article is to explore the role of multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) in sustainable supply chains. I argue that MSIs are needed to help establish and institutionalize the natural and social thresholds in which a sustainable supply chain must operate. While a multitude of MSIs relevant to supply chains already exist, they do not yet adequately address sustainability thresholds. Building on theory and literature, I elaborate on four interrelated roles for MSIs in this area: (1) providing learning platforms, (2) developing standards, (3) developing enforcement mechanisms, and (4) issuing labels and certifications. All four roles emphasize the need for supply chains to operate within the thresholds set by nature and society. Staying within thresholds is what distinguishes between sustainable and unsustainable supply chains. The four roles form part of a broader conceptual framework outlining a way forward for MSIs in sustainable supply chains. Different MSIs could address one or more of these roles. I argue that all MSIs must be developed with special attention to their input and output legitimacy. Stakeholders from both within and beyond the supply chain must be involved in developing and implementing a MSI for it to be viewed as legitimate. I note that the conceptual framework presented here is a starting point. It would benefit from further testing and refinement. For example, future work could add further specificity to the four roles I discuss. Future research could also focus on integrating economic thresholds for sustainable supply chains into the framework.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although several studies have explored the relationship between the operation and performance of a supply chain (SC), a general SC model cannot deliver the expected financial results at a company-wide level. In this paper, we argue that this cannot guarantee the maximization of a firm’s overall value because short-term financial performance metrics do not reflect the risk to businesses and the invested capital. Owing to the varying natures of risk and the capital invested, firms with multiple divisions should assess each division separately, and the results can be compared for decisions concerning the allocation of the firm’s capital and resources to maximize the overall value of its businesses. We propose a linkage model to consider operational activities and financial performance simultaneously in a firm’s supply chain model. To exhibit the superiority of the proposed model that connects SC operation and financial indicators, we first compare the differences between models for maximizing profit and enterprise-wise economic value added (EVA) as objective functions. To examine uncertainty in the operational and financial parameters of the SC, the results of sensitivity analyses are then reported. Experimental results showed that our model, using the EVA approach, is more effective and superior in terms of maximizing the firm’s overall value from the long-term perspective while satisfying the target values for financial ratios set by the firm’s executives and shareholders for all periods, unlike the results of the general model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Electricity consumption will comprise an increasing share of global energy demand during the next two decades. In recent years, the increasing prices of fossil fuels and concerns about the environmental consequences of greenhouse gas emissions have renewed the interest in the development of alternative energy resources. In particular, the Fukushima Daiichi accident was a turning point in the call for alternative energy sources. Renewable energy is now considered a more desirable source of fuel than nuclear power due to the absence o frisk and disasters. Considering that the major component of greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide, there is a global concern about reducing carbon emissions. In this regard, different policies could be applied to reducing carbon emissions, such as enhancing renewable energy deployment and encouraging technological innovations. Two main solutions may be implemented to reduce CO2 emissions and overcome the problem of climate change: replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources as much as possible and enhancing energy efficiency. In this paper, we discuss alternative technologies for enhancing renewable energy deployment and energy use efficiency. JEL Classification: D61, D62, H23, N50, O13, Q52, Q55</jats:p>"

In this work, adsorption of bromate by natural chitosan and its chemically modified polymers has been investigated. Bromate adsorption was found between 22.73 mg/g and 43.48 mg/g. Adsorbents were analysed by Fourier transform infrared-ATR spectroscopy. It is suggested that chemical adsorption is the main bromate adsorption mechanism. By fitting theoretical results to experimental data, it is shown that the Langmuir adsorption model and the second-order kinetic model are more applicable to explain the adsorption process. Furthermore, increased bromate adsorption is found at high temperature and at low pH, while coexisting ions have little influence at low concentrations.</jats:p>",

Despite its continued growth and importance to the economy, the food processing industry in the country remains vulnerable to these problems, which threaten its viability.Motivation for the study: The aim of this study was to investigate supply chain management problems in the food processing industry and their influence on business performance. The study was motivated by the need to use supply chain management practices as a tool to improve business performance in the food processing industry.Research design, approach and method: A questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 303 supply chain professionals working in the food processing industry in Gauteng Province. The collected data were analysed by using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, Pearson correlations and regression analysis.Main findings: Supply chain management problems were identified in seven areas, namely human resource management, technology, facilities, supplier relationship management, customer relationship management, regulatory factors and logistics and transportation. Except for regulatory factors, all supply chain management problems negatively predicted business performance.Contribution or value-add: Practically, the study enables supply chain professionals in the food processing industry to understand the sources of problems and use this information to develop solutions for the improvement of business performance. Theoretically, the study endorses the view that part of the key to resolving business performance complications in the food processing industry involves streamlining supply chain management by resolving its identifiable problems.</jats:p>"

Aspecte mai puțin abordate în aceste studii sunt ocurența și disponibilitatea materiilor prime. În cazul specific al Văii Dunării inferioare, ocurența și disponibilitatea silicolitelor utilizate în siturile paleolitice din această zonă au fost abordate prin investigații de teren (periegheze de o zi concentrate în jurul siturilor) și analiza morfometrică a probelor colectate. Perieghezele au confirmat existența silicolitelor în diverse depozite aluviale de pe Valea Dunării : în pietrișurile terasei inferioare la Grojdibodu și Gura Padinii (județul Olt, la sud de Vădastra) ; în pietrișurile luncii la Poiana şi pietrișurile Formațiunii de Frătești la Ciuperceni (județul Teleorman) ; în pietrișurile Formațiunii de Frătești la Ghizdaru, Bălănoaia, Băneasa, Pietrele (județul Giurgiu) ; în pietrișurile terasei joase la vest şi est de Giurgiu ; în pietrișurile terasei superioare la Căscioarele (județul Călărași). Analiza morfometrică (dimensiuni, formă, sfericitate, grad de rotunjire) a probelor colectate a evidențiat faptul că silicolitele au diferite aspecte morfologice : claste foarte rotunjite de dimensiuni medii (6– 8 cm lungime) transportate de către ape pe distanțe lungi (mai ales la Grojdibodu, Poiana, dar şi la Ciuperceni) ; claste subangulare şi subrotunjite de dimensiuni medii (între 6 și 16 cm) ce atestă transportul pe distanțe scurte (mai ales la Ciuperceni, Căscioarele, dar şi în zona Giurgiu) ; claste subangulare, subrotunjite şi rotunjite de dimensiuni medii și mari (de la 6 la peste 20 cm) ce sugerează transportul pe distanțe mai mari (în depozitele Formațiunii de Frătești din zona Giurgiu). Aceste silicolite au fost transportate pe distanțe mai mici şi mai mari din Podişul Prebalcanic de către râurile balcanice şi depozitate în sudul României sub formă de conuri aluviale (Formațiunea de Frătești), ulterior reciclate şi redepozitate în terasele Dunării. Examinarea probelor din situri arheologice a dovedit că aceste surse aluviale cu silicolite au fost utilizate pentru cioplirea uneltelor necesare oamenilor din Paleoliticul superior.</jats:p>"

With Brexit on the horizon, companies can no longer rely on a low labour cost workforce to maintain low production costs. Industry 4.0 is seen as a technology driven paradigm that aims to significantly improve productivity and performance of a company whilst ensuring better demand/supply chain connectivity. However, there is evidence to suggest that the UK food industry has not yet embraced this new manufacturing paradigm. Through an exploratory survey of 36 food companies (8 large and 28 small) this paper discusses the key issues around whether these companies are prepared for the implementation of I.E 4.0. The discussion provided along with the primary survey data suggests that the larger food companies are starting to focus on I.E 4.0. However, greater awareness of the methods of implementation is needed if companies are able to embed such systems.</jats:p>"

So industries should green their supply chains to optimize economic and environmental concerns, but because of uncertainty in the real world like inconsistency of world economy, the process of greening supply chains can be more complex. To optimize total costs and the unfavourable sides of supply chains simultaneously in an uncertain situation, this paper presents a multi-objective mixed integer programming with fuzzy random variables (FRVs) and by using fuzzy theory and fuzzy random chance-constrained programming (FRCCP), the proposed model is converted to deterministic model. This paper can be also suitable for decision making with optimistic, pessimistic and realistic notion. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the model.</jats:p>",

It is a known fact that the changes in the money supply are considerable extent determinative in interest rate and inflation rate such as orientations of macro economics variables. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between money supply, interest rate and inflation rate in Turkey after the 2008 Financial Crisis. In accordance with this purpose, 2008:1- 2015:12 period money supply, interest rate and inflation rate monthly data are used. Commonly in applied studies, the relationship between these variables is analysed with Cholesky Decomposition Method of Variance based Vector Autoregression Model (VAR). But this method is affected by ordering of the variables according to endogeneity-exogeneity approach, when ordering of the variables were changed, the results are changed and therefore policy proposals are changed. In analysis of the study, both Cholesky and Pesaran and Shin’s proposal method is used. According to Cholesky Variance Decomposition result at the end of the a month, when all changes in inflation is explained by inflation, this rate is 85% according to Generalized Decomposition Method of Variance result.</jats:p>"

Two main electricity companies in Malaysia were selected as the case companies for this research. The proposed knowledge audit framework aims to present a holistic way of assessing and analyzing the current knowledge environment of the electricity supply industry in Malaysia. The outcomes of the knowledge audit exercise could be used in developing a knowledge strategy that is aligned with the business strategies of the electricity companies.  </jats:p>"

Limited research has, however, been done regarding this integration in terms of reverse logistics.Purpose: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the perspectives of retailers regarding supply chain integration in the context of product returns for consumer electronics.Method: A generic qualitative research strategy was used for this purpose. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with managerial staff involved with the product returns process at large retailers.Findings: The main findings indicate that the retailers made efforts to increase internal integration relating to improving information availability, aligning cross functional processes and improving inter-firm relationships. External integration efforts attempted to improve the intra-firm flow of information, reduce the number products returned to suppliers, expedite the returns process in specific instances and align processes. A narrow supplier-orientated span of integration was identified in this context, with integration efforts mainly targeting the start of the returns process to reduce return volumes. The study identified benefits attributed to both internal and external integration and barriers to internal and external integration relating to transactional relationships and suppliers who are incapable of integration.Contribution: Academically, this study expands the literature on supply chain integration in an unexplored context. For managers, this study identifies various reverse logistics integration barriers and details what practices and strategies improve the probability of successful integration efforts.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>So far, a vast amount of studies on sustainability in supply chain management have been conducted by academics over the last decade. Nevertheless, socially related aspects are still neglected in the related discussion. The primary motivation of the present literature review has arisen from this shortcoming, thus the key purpose of this study is to enrich the discussion by providing a state-of-the-art, focusing exclusively on social issues in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) by considering the textile/apparel sector as the field of application. The authors conduct a literature review, including content analysis which covers 45 articles published in English peer-reviewed journals, and proposes a comprehensive map which integrates the latest findings on socially related practices in the textile/apparel industry with the dominant conceptualization in order to reveal potential research areas in the field. The results show an ongoing lack of investigation regarding the social dimension of the triple bottom line in SSCM. Findings indicate that a company’s internal orientation is the main assisting factor in sustainable supply chain management practices. Further, supplier collaboration and assessment can be interpreted as an offer for suppliers deriving from stakeholders and a focal company’s management of social risk. Nevertheless, suppliers do also face or even create huge barriers in improving their social performance. This calls for more empirical research and qualitative or quantitative survey methods, especially at the supplier level located in developing countries.</jats:p>"

In particular, the variability of the demand for each type of product at each customer zone has been estimated. As starting point, this paper considers an established supply chain for which the main problem is to determine the decisions regarding expansion of distribution centers. The problem is solved by using a mixed-integer linear programming model, which optimizes the different demand scenarios. The proposed methodology uses a scheme of optimization based on the generation of multiple demand scenarios of the supply network. The model is based on a real case taken from a multinational food company, which supplies to the Colombian and some international markets. The obtained results were compared with the equivalent present costs minimization scheme of the supply network, and showed the importance and efficiency of the proposed approach as an alternative for the supply chain design with stochastic parameters.</jats:p>"

Proposed system consists of PV generator and invertor, pump station and water reservoir. System is sized in such a manner that every his part is sized separately and after this integrated into a whole. This integration is desirable for several reasons, where the most important is the achievement of the objectives of sustainable living in urban areas i.e. achieving of sustainable urban water supply system. The biggest technological challenge associated with the use of solar, wind and other intermittent renewable energy sources RES is the realization of economically and environmentally friendly electric energy storage (EES). The paper elaborates the use of water reservoires in UWSS as EES. The proposed solution is still more expensive than the traditional and is economically acceptable today in the cases of isolated urban water system and special situations. Wider application will depend on the future trends of energy prices, construction costs of PV generators and needs for CO2 reduction by urban water infrastructure.</jats:p>"

This paper adapts the understanding of the different stages and argues the need to develop a critical consciousness for halal integrity within the food chain to address the needs of the ever-growing Muslim consumers’ market.

In order to ensure that food production is embracive of the religious needs of the global Muslim customer market, this paper utilises the farm to fork and global supply chain models to foster a critical awareness of halal needs. Halal integrity should be clearly presenting the details of the halal status of the product and assuring that the requirements for halal as stated are met. Halal integrity not only deals with permitted and prohibited foods, but that the halal status of the food products (i.e. from raw materials until it reaches the consumers) should not be breached (i.e. no cross-contamination with haram products/methods and no ill intents). A formal definition of halal integrity has been proposed.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The SWOT analyses serve as a guideline as the analysis done may be outdated as the environments are constantly changing.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This research although academic is meant to have a real value in improving the integrity of the halal food supply chain, providing value to the food industry, to countries that are concerned about this supply chain and to Muslim consumers.

A highest yield of 18.34% was achieved from the Kesar variety and the pectin was characterised using ATR-IR spectroscopy, TGA and <sup>13</sup>C solid-state NMR spectroscopy to confirm the structure. The degree of esterification (DE) of the pectin was analysed with both titrimetry and <sup>13</sup>C solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and a high DE (&gt;70%) was observed for all three varieties (Keitt, Sindhri and Kesar). This is the first report on acid-free subcritical water extraction of pectin from mango peel, which provides a green route for the valorisation of mango peel waste and contributes to a source of biobased materials and chemicals for a sustainable 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Especially in the food sector, fraud and counterfeiting are affecting the trust of consumers, who are more and more oriented to chose products basing on quality and traceability attributes rather than the price. Recently, the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard was introduced to provide specifications for the representation of product traceability information. The collection and analysis of such information allows supply chains to be monitored and controlled through virtualization. Several applications of EPCIS were presented in literature, even if most of them are mainly focused on enabling technologies, with less emphasis on assessing how the available information can be used for a control at a higher level. This chapter review the relevant literature available on this topic, and present an architecture allowing the traceability of information about products throughout the entire supply chain by exploiting both the EPCIS standard and a NoSQL database. An application showing the potentiality of the proposed system in a case study is also reported. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The removal efficiency of particulate matter from a sedimentation basin with an inclined plate settler in drinking water treatment facilities is sometimes reduced by density flow caused by temperature increases in the raw water. In this study, the structure of the density flow and its prevention are investigated by means of three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results of CFD show that upward velocity is uniform and normal operations are performed before the increase in inlet water temperatures. After the onset of a temperature increase in the raw water, the upward flow velocity on the inclined plate settler increases, especially in the upstream zone of the plate. This velocity increment has a strong correlation with increase in turbidity as a result of the overflow of particulate matter. The effects of the installation of baffle plates on the inclined plate settler to reduce turbidity were explored. The CFD results using baffle plates show a significant decrease in upward velocity on the inclined plate settler. This suggests that baffle plates are effective in suppressing the overflow of particulate matter. To verify the prediction by CFD, baffle plates were installed in a drinking water treatment facility. The results show that the turbidity of treated water was reduced by the proposed procedure.</jats:p>",

We then examined the relationship between increasing intensive care beds and these characteristics, controlling for other factors. The study included 4,457 hospitals and 55,865 hospital-years. Overall, the majority of intensive care bed growth occurred in teaching hospitals (net, +13,471 beds; 72.1% of total growth), hospitals with 250 or more beds (net, +18,327 beds; 91.8% of total growth), and hospitals in the highest quartile of occupancy (net, +10,157 beds; 54.0% of total growth). In a longitudinal multivariable model, larger hospital size, teaching status, and high intensive care occupancy were associated with subsequent-year growth. Furthermore, the effects of hospital size and teaching status were modified by occupancy: the greatest odds of increasing ICU beds were in hospitals with 500 or more beds in the highest quartile of occupancy (adjusted odds ratio, 18.9; 95% CI, 14.0–25.5; <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) and large teaching hospitals in the highest quartile of occupancy (adjusted odds ratio, 7.3; 95% CI, 5.3–9.9; <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01).</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Increasingly, intensive care bed expansion in the United States is occurring in larger hospitals and teaching centers, particularly following a year with high ICU occupancy.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

The aim is to present the most important technologies – Social, Mobile, Analytics (based on Big Data) and Cloud Computing – as the main enablers for reaching competitive advantages by supply chain strategy. Analysis are based on literature and market studies reviews supported by author’s empirical research results on supply chain manager’s perception on future supply chain development. During the analysis conducted in the paper the definitions of supply chain strategy and supply chain business model was introduced. Further the next phase of supply chain evolution was identified and the base for this new phase – the internet platform based on cloud computing – introduced. This solution, together with the rest SMAC technologies, creates new approach on how flows within supply chains are managed. Due to new potential created by SMAC and ubiquitous uncertainty managers should revise the ability to create multimodal supply chain strategy. That strategy is supported by customised supply chain business models able to meet events in the unpredictable environmental framework. The base for multimodal supply chain strategy development is market segmentation where the differentiator is described by value perceived by particular customer.</jats:p>"

The supply with sufficient energetic substrates to all brain cells, which are very densely packed, in particular in the human brain, is a huge logistic challenge. The most important energy substrate for our brain is glucose, which reaches the brain via the blood circulation. Glucose is not only utilized by nerve cells directly, but to a large extent also taken up by glial cells, which then either store glucose after conversion to glycogen as energy reserve, or transfer it as lactate to nerve cells. Lactate in nerve cells can then be converted to pyruvate, which is efficiently utilized together with oxygen for the formation of chemical energy in form of ATP. The intermediate metabolic product lactate hence plays an important role as energetic substrate, which is exchanged between cells both under aerobic and non-aerobic conditions. Transport of lactate across the cell membrane is carried out in co-transport with protons (H+), which are crucial regulators of various metabolic processes and membrane transporters. In addition, the lactate carriers form a functional network with carbonic anhydrases, enzymes, which not only catalyze the equilibrium between carbon dioxide, hydrogen carbonate (bicarbonate) and protons, but also facilitate lactate transport. In this article, we focus on physiological processes of the energy metabolism in glial cells as well as on the transfer of energetic substrates to nerve cells, processes, which themselves are critically modulated by pH and its regulation in glial cells.</jats:p>",

A multiple case study approach is used to explore this research question. Four case firms are selected for this study. The analyses have identified several major risks and influencing factors that hinder the application of the PBL model to Taiwan's heavy vehicle supply chains. However, with PBL's strength to bring sustainability benefits, an extended assessment analysis of the risks and influencing factors is conducted, and the counter-risk strategies are explored. This study has shown there is a high opportunity for PBL development in Taiwan if the obstacles can be dealt collaboratively in the heavy vehicle supply chains. The research findings provide valuable insights into Taiwan's heavy vehicle supply chains and similar emerging Asian economies relying mainly on international heavy vehicle suppliers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) issued a Gas Statement of Opportunities in March 2016, which reports that gas supply to the domestic and liquefied natural gas markets in eastern Australia will be largely satisfied by proved and probable reserves until 2026 and by the addition of contingent resources until 2030. However, in parallel, there are widely reported concerns by energy consumers of insufficient gas supplies to meet demand by the early 2020s and a lack of new gas supplies to replace existing expiring contracts. Gas shortages have already contributed to black outs and load shedding events in South Australia.\nThis paper reviews the eastern Australian gas supply position at a basin level. The AEMO basin level supply forecasts are reviewed and adjusted to generate forward profiles, which are consistent with reported reserves levels, production histories and depletion behaviour of typical gas fields.\nThe revised supply forecast is compared with the AEMO’s demand profiles, and the likely commercial behaviour of key participants in the market is considered to build a picture of the domestic gas supply-demand balance through the 2020s.\nThis analysis provides a transparent link from market outcomes back to the underlying reserves classifications to guide interpretation of supply-demand forecasts, and highlights the critical role of key suppliers in the eastern Australian gas market in the coming decade.\n</jats:p>"

In this research, we compared results from M5P, M5Rules and REPTree to the results from multilayer perceptron, one type of artificial neural network. Six input variables, i.e. turbidity, alkalinity, pH, conductivity, color and suspended solids relating to reaction of coagulation were used. The data in this research had been collected from Bangkhen Branch Office of Metropolitan Waterworks Authority, Thailand from 1 January 2006 &amp;ndash; 31 July 2015. Our experimental results showed that the M5Rules method yielded the highest accuracy to predict Alum dosage comparing to other methods run in this study. For M5P and M5Rules, building model by using smoothing procedure and unpruned technique appears to give out the best model to predict with the highest accuracy.</jats:p>"

This paper studies the sustainability optimization of enterprise logistics network from a strategic perspective and proposes a multiobjective sustainable logistics optimization model considering three dimensions of sustainability: economy, environment, and society. In this model, the environment factor was measured with a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method based on Chinese Life Cycle Database (CLCD), while for social factors, Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (GRI) are utilized to quantify the social performance. Moreover, the model was solved with an adapted version of the <jats:italic>ε</jats:italic>‐constraint method named augment constraint algorithm (AUGMENCON) through GAMS software. The numerical experiment results of a computer manufacturer supply chain show that the proposed model is able to integrate all dimensions of sustainability and simultaneously prove the capability of AUGMENCON in providing a set of trade‐off solutions for the decision makers to make different decisions under different environment and social requirements.</jats:p>",

In Ektu, mothers often transmitted HIV infection to infants during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding due to inadequate resources to invest in prevention efforts. The existing procedure to diagnose infants with HIV required collecting dried blood samples at more than two hundred healthcare facilities around the country and transporting them to a central laboratory in the capital for testing. This process was characterized by significant delays due to long transportation times, batching of samples in transportation and processing in the lab, and concomitant congestion in the lab. This delay resulted in loss to follow-up, that is, lost patients due to mothers not collecting their infants' results. A new point-of-care device was about to be introduced, which would obviate the need for this centralized processing and the resulting diagnostic delay. The key decision under consideration is where to place the devices to maximize their effectiveness.</jats:p><jats:p>Understand the importance of making public health decisions based on a data-driven, logical framework   Uncover the link between operational performance of the healthcare system and health outcomes at the population level   Appreciate the relevance of operational decisions in enhancing or diminishing the effectiveness of a medical technology   Use process analysis concepts to characterize various components of delays</jats:p>",

The price elasticity of supply (PELS) reported in the literature varies greatly, indicating that conclusions regarding price signaling in the timber market are mixed. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the key factors associated with the heterogeneity of PELS of primary timber product supply by examining data from numerous studies conducted around the world. Twelve “moderator” variables were examined to explore differences in PELS. Moderators with significant impacts on variation of PELS included forest products, geographic regions, econometric models, and data type. Furthermore, two-level categorical variables contained within the econometric models including standing stock were found to have significant influence on the heterogeneity of PELS. Variation in PELS also depended on whether or not the supply models accounted for price inflation, and the time period when the study was conducted. These findings may improve the understanding of the dynamics of price signaling in timber markets, and further improve the efficiency of timber supply and forecasting models for market participants and policy makers.</jats:p>"

The constant imprecise fuzzy demands of the goods are made to the retailers by the customers. These goods are produced (along with defectiveness, which decreases due to learning effects) from the raw materials in the producer's production center with a constant production rate (to be determined). Producer stores these raw materials in a warehouse by purchasing these from a supplier and the suppliers collect these raw materials from open markets at a constant collection rate (to be determined). The whole system is considered in a finite time horizon with fuzzy demand for finished products and fuzzy inventory costs. Here shortages are allowed and fully backlogged. The fuzzy chance constraints on the available space of the producer and transportation costs for both producer, retailers are defuzzified using necessity approach. Results indicate the efficiency of proposed approach in performance measurement. This paper attempts to provide the reader a complete picture of supply chain management through a systematic literature review. </jats:p>"

Environmental management is a systematic strategy that companies can apply to find the different ways for saving water, energy, and materials, and for reducing the negative environmental impacts. Environmental management aims to prevent pollution, preserve natural resources, and reduce environmental risks toward creating an environmentally-friendly image with different stakeholders. Effective waste management method reduces the consumption of natural resources and lowers the ultimate needs for waste disposal.

This paper presents a case study of a Tier 1 supplier in the automotive industry, identifying the critical building blocks for successful implementation and integration of a PLM system in to their manufacturing operations.

This study evaluated variation in photosynthetic parameters at various growth stages in 43 wheat genotypes (parents of the existing doubled-haploid mapping populations) under optimal and low (one-quarter of the optimal) N supply. For relative chlorophyll content, the genotype × N treatment interaction was significant at tillering, booting, pre-anthesis and anthesis. Genotypes with small differences in relative chlorophyll content between the two N supplies were CD87 at tillering and pre-anthesis, and Batavia at anthesis. Potential photochemical activity (Fv/Fm) was measured at tillering and anthesis. The genotype × N treatment interaction was significant in both growth stages. Based on net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and intrinsic water usez efficiency, there was variable potential of the genotypes to cope with low N supply; significant differences were found among genotypes at ambient CO2 and between N treatments at elevated CO2 concentration (2000 µmol mol–1) for all three parameters. Based on all studied parameters, a dissimilarity matrix was constructed, separating the 43 genotypes into four groups. Group 2 comprised 15 of the genotypes (Batavia, Beaver, Calingiri, CD87, Frame, Krichauff, Neepawa, Soissons, Spear, Stiletto, WAWHT2036, WAWHT2074, Westonia, Wilgoyne, Yitpi), characterised by small differences in relative chlorophyll content and Fv/Fm caused by different N supply at tillering and anthesis. These genotypes therefore appear to have relative tolerance to low N supply and a potential to be used in discerning the molecular basis of tolerance to low N supply.</jats:p>"

It is argued that relationship based supply chain produces financially tangible results in many areas of supply chain. The concept is based on transaction cost theory arguing that the final price is determined in the market by total cost. A collaborative relationship fosters trust that leads to lowering transaction cost and speed up time to market which creates “serial equity” rather than “spot equity”. Recent research on collaboration and supply chain performance seems to suggest tangible financial gains. Yet, no theoretical framework has been developed and empirical evidences have been lacking to support such hypothesis. A clearly defined theoretical framework and supportive empirical evidence between these two constructs are needed for future research in this area. This article attempts to articulate the theoretical foundation of collaborative relationship in supply chain and survey empirical results on financial gains reported in various research studies.</jats:p>",

Literature suggests that the successful partnerships may be initiated at the beginning of selection process; however, there is a dearth of research on how to manage tourism partnerships effectively. This paper suggests the evaluation criteria proposed to assist tourism firms to effectively make a decision on selecting partners to start working with. In developing criteria, the authors first reviewed the available criteria in the other contexts, then conducted qualitative research using buyer and supplier firms in Thailand by in-depth interviewing with ten experts to refine and to verify these criteria proposed. After statistical verification, the results indicated that the proposed criteria consist of five main categories: performances, profiles, risk factors, product's characteristics and compatibilities. This study contributes the useful knowledge on how to select partners and manage partnerships effectively in tourism supply chain.</p>",

The demand uncertainty level is parameterized through a mean‐preserving spread, and the manufacturer's and the retailer's equilibrium decisions are solved accordingly. We consider the case of an exogenous retail price as well as the case of an endogenous retail price, and we find in both cases that the manufacturer's and the retailer's expected profits in equilibrium are not necessarily monotone decreasing in the uncertainty level. Thus, we find that, even if the cost of reducing demand uncertainty is zero, uncertainty reduction can hurt rather than benefit either or both members of the supply chain. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Smouldering fires in peatland are different from the flames in wildland fires. Smouldering peat fire is slow, low-temperature and more persistent, releasing large amounts of smoke into the atmosphere. In this work, we experimentally and computationally investigate the vertical downward spread of smouldering fire in a column of 30cm-tall moss peat under variable moisture content (MC) and bulk density. The measured downward spread rate decreases with depth and wet bulk density, and is ~1cmh−1 equivalent to a carbon emission flux of 200 tonnesday−1ha−1. We observe that downward spread increases as MC increases substantially at least inside the range from 10 to 70%, which is not intuitive and goes against the trend observed for the horizontal spread in the same peat. We also conduct one-dimensional computational simulations to successfully reproduce the experimental observations. The analysis shows that the spread rate increases with MC and decreases with density because smouldering spread is controlled by the oxygen supply. The volume of the porous peat expands when absorbing water, which reduces the density of organic matter and decreases the heat release rate. This shows that the widely assumed conclusion that the spread rate of wildfire decreases with MC is not universal when applied to smouldering fires.</jats:p>"

Using an approach augmented for multiple input applications, the likelihood of excess production and the relative importance of price changes in different markets are estimated for Icelandic dairy farms. The results indicate that the average farm plans to exceed its quota, and price changes in the surplus milk market are approximately three times more effective in generating supply response than price changes in the quota milk market.</jats:p>",

This examination is based on the literature to connect eco-certification with transparency and to portray traceability schemes for sustainability issues in food supply chains, followed by information technology-based systems and applications supporting traceability. The third section presents the eco-certification decisions at the supply chain level in four subsections. It first builds a theoretical framework regarding the downstream firms' sustainability-related decisions by offering conceptual definitions. Next the farm business decision logic is given, followed by the discrete choice model. The specialization of the model is presented in the third subsection, followed by the results, discussions, and implications for practitioners. Some conclusions and implications for future research are offered in the last section. </jats:p>"

This chapter attempts to fill the current gap in research. This chapter discusses capabilities of the IoT-based supply chain applications.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nEffective management of fertiliser nitrogen (N) inputs by farmers will generally have beneficial productivity, economic and environmental consequences. The reality is that farmers may be unsure of plant-available N levels in cropping soils at sowing and make decisions about how much fertiliser N to apply with limited information about existing soil N supply. NBudget is a Microsoft (Armonk, NY, USA) Excel-based decision support tool developed primarily to assist farmers and/or advisors in Australia’s northern grains region manage N. NBudget estimates plant-available (nitrate) N at sowing; it also estimates sowing soil water, grain yields, fertiliser N requirements for cereals and oilseed crops and N2 fixation by legumes. NBudget does not rely on soil testing for nitrate-N, organic carbon or soil water content. Rather, the tool relies on precrop (fallow) rainfall data plus basic descriptions of soil texture and fertility, tillage practice and information about paddock use in the previous 2 years. Use is made of rule-of-thumb values and stand-alone or linked algorithms describing, among other things, rates of mineralisation of background soil organic N and fresh residue N. Winter and summer versions of NBudget cover the 10 major crops of the region: bread wheat, durum, barley, canola, chickpea and faba bean in the winter crop version; sorghum, sunflower, soybean and mung bean in the summer crop version. Validating the winter crop version of NBudget estimates of sowing soil nitrate-N against three independent datasets (n=65) indicated generally close agreement between measured and predicted values (y=0.91x+16.8; r2=0.78). A limitation of the tool is that it does not account for losses of N from waterlogged or flooded soils. Although NBudget also predicts grain yields and fertiliser N requirements for the coming season, potential users may simply factor predicted soil N supply into their fertiliser decisions, rather than rely on the output of the tool. Decisions about fertiliser N inputs are often complex and are based on several criteria, including attitudes to risk, history of fertiliser use and costs. The usefulness and likely longevity of NBudget would be enhanced by transforming the current Excel-based tool, currently available on request from the author, to a stand-alone app or web-based tool.\n</jats:p>"

Based on projections for future prices and demand, Request for quotes are constructed and quotes are accepted that optimize the level of inventory each day, while minimizing total cost. The problem is modeled as a Markov decision process, which allows for the computation of the utility of actions to be based on the utilities of consequential future states. Dynamic programming is then used to determine the optimal quote requests and accepts at each state in Markov Decision Process. A mathematical algorithm for purchasing can also be developed which is suitable for manufacturing companies to solve the supply chain management problems.</jats:p>",

As manufacturing is nowadays distributed to several sites, where each site manufactures the intermediate product to assemble the final product. Methodology- Producers, therefore require to transport these products between these sites as well as distribute the final products to faraway customers. Therefore, production and transportation planning need to be coordinated. Manufacturing requires the planning of unmovable resources (machines) with fixed sequences of production routing steps, however transportation requires the planning of moveable resources (Vehicles). Findings- Each transport request is different from another with different origin and destination. Hence, it is needed to find the routing (route from origin to destination) of each transport request dynamically. Practical Implications- This paper is dedicated to present a route finding tool called Path Finder in order to provide the shortest route by distance or time or both for transportation planning.</jats:p>"

Attention has been directed to developing such forms of food supply by adapting information connectivity. A case study of a local food network in Norway indicates that local food supply paradoxically attempts to mimic the dominant industrialised modes of food production. It is suggested that the fact that local food supply is “personal” and associated with close proximity makes it more closely resemble service supply chains. Applying contingency theory, a conceptual model is developed that indicates how the local food supply must take into consideration the degree to which customer value is associated with tailoring food supply. The high need for tailored local food production implies that information connectivity should support mutual adaptation while, in cases of less need for tailoring information, connectivity should seek automation. Local food production is always a hybrid of these approaches. </jats:p>"

Supply chain agility plays a prominent role to enhance the level of firm’s performance. Moreover, information technology (IT) plays a foundational role in supply chain management practices. Hence, this study proposes the relationship between IT integration as the competency of IT and firm’s market performance both directly and through mediating role of supply chain agility. \n\nBackground: \tMany studies have been done to date on the impact of supply chain agility on overall firm’s performance. However, the effect of an agile supply chain on firm’s market performance per se needs to be studied. Furthermore, there is a gap in the literature about the effect of IT competency such as IT integration on firm’s market performance both directly and through mediating role of supply chain agility. \n\nRecommendation for Researchers: \tThe first direction this study gives to researchers is to consider the different factors which have significant effect on the agility of supply chain, particularly the IT related ones. The second direction is about the study on the effect of IT competencies and supply chain agility on each category of firm’s performance separately instead of considering it as a one construct.\n\nImpact on Society: Although this is a conceptual study, it can highlight the importance of IT competency not only in our daily life, but also in our businesses and industries.\n\nFuture Research: This study only proposes some relationships based on theory and literature. Future researchers can test these proposed relationships in different contexts and compare the results. Furthermore, this study proposes the relationships for large manufacturing sector in developing countries. The model could be tested for SMEs as well. In addition, the proposed theoretical model in this study might be tested in both developing as well as developed countries to compare the results which will be contributed to the body of knowledge.</jats:p>"

Specifically the concept of “cost” became a contested entity. The government mobilised it in a conventional way to represent the resourcing of the water supply. Countering this, domestic water users associated “cost” with a direct impact on their own resources and lives. Thus, an entity usually associated with the economic realm was embroiled in political processes, with much of what they were supposed to represent becoming invisible. Thus the authors observed accounting concepts being mobilised to support the gaining of a specific political ends, the implementation of domestic billing, rather than as part of the means to implement a sustainable water supply within Ireland.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>This research has some limitations, one being the authors draw on secondary data.

The present chapter is an attempt to distil what is known about the likely effects of climate change on water availability to agriculture for food security and nutrition in coming decades. Apart from few exceptions, the likely impacts of climate change on agriculture water resources in the future are not understood in any great depth. There are many uncertainties as to how changes in various environmental parameters will interact with the availability of water and further agriculture production. The future consequences of water resources on agriculture are discussed and summarized. Possible mitigation and adaptations to changing water availability for agriculture are also discusses.</jats:p>"

This paper highlights the problem from the perspective of dynamic and discrete networks. A topological structure model with the characteristics of dynamic and discreteness is used to describe the structure of military supply chain networks (MSCNs). In order to provide a platform for evaluating the effectiveness, simulation algorithms based on topological structure models for MSCNs are presented. Considering military and economic factors, evaluation metrics including supply capability and supply efficiency are proposed. By applying the model and algorithms to a POL supply network in a theater, we obtain the values of supply capability and efficiency metrics in a dynamic environment. We also identify an optimal solution from multiple feasible solutions to help decision-makers to make scientific and rational decisions by using exploratory analysis method. The results show that new evaluation metrics can capture important effectiveness requirements for military supply networks positively. We also find the proposed method in this paper can solve the problem of evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic and discrete network effectiveness evaluation in a feasible and effective manner.</jats:p>"

The present article reports on an in-depth qualitative study of garment supply chains that examined the boundary work of Indian sourcing agents aimed at dismantling or bridging the boundaries that affect the interaction between western buyers and local suppliers, in order to facilitate development and implementation of meaningful working conditions or social relations at work. We identify four types of boundary work that sourcing agents used to manage combinations of accommodative and non-accommodative buyers and suppliers in order to work through boundaries created by buyers’ liability of foreignness: reinforcing, flexing (type 1 and 2) and restoring. We also found four essential conditions for a sourcing agent to become an effective boundary spanner in practice: acquiring knowledge about the relevant fields and actors, gaining legitimacy in the relevant fields and in the opinion of the parties involved, effectively translating the expectations of each party to the other, and benefiting from satisfying incentives. We contribute to the literature on governance for working conditions in global supply chains, boundary theory and liability of foreignness. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The study focused on the factors affecting the supply of affordable residential housing units in Kenyan urban areas in the case of Nairobi city and its environs.Methodology: A descriptive survey research design was used. The target population comprised of all the real estate agents, valuers and property managers with headquarters in Nairobi totaling 90. A sample of 40% or 36 firms was taken and a random stratified sampling technique was used to select the sample units. The study used primary data collected through using questionnaires as well as secondary data as a source of literature review. The data collected was analyzed by use of descriptive statistics. In particular, frequency tables and proportions or percentages were used. In addition factor analysis was used to supplement the descriptive statistics.Results: Findings from factor analysis indicated that the factors affecting the supply of affordable residential housing in Nairobi could be reduced to a three factor model. Findings from the study indicated that upon calculation of the rotated factor loadings, the Eigen Values of the three factors were still greater than 1 and the three factors still explained 75.51% of the total variance. The Unrotated factor loadings gave a clear picture of the importance of the variables to the factors. It seemed from the study that Factor1 was mostly defined by ‘legal’ variable, factor2 by ‘cost’ variable, and factor3 by ‘financial’, ‘socioeconomic’ and ‘infrastructural’ variables.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended that to address cost related constraints to the supply of affordable housing in Nairobi, the architectural community should engage in research on cheap building products. The government through the central government and through the newly created counties should make infrastructural investment a priority. The legal framework relating to housing needed to be overhauled by the introduction of a new act on housing. It was the responsibility of the government in collaboration with the private sector to ensure that the high level of unemployment was addressed, that the inflation rate was lowered to an acceptable level and that the economic growth was enhanced. It was important to increase the access of mortgages and housing finance products to both the banked and the unbanked. The factors affecting the demand of affordable residential housing in Nairobi and other urban areas would form an area of further study.  In addition, the determinants of the prices of residential and non-residential houses in Nairobi would form an interesting study.</jats:p>"

In this sense, some conceptual clarifications become necessary and are presented in this chapter. The term information unit / business unit, although widespread in management literature, is not defined by consensus. Guinchat and Menou (1994, p.337) use the term to refer to sectors of businesses whose mission is “to identify, as accurately as possible, information that may be useful to decision-makers (top, coordination and operational) in support decision-making.” Logistics and Distribution cannot manage without information on applications / products by and for customers, and their relationship with information management, in Information Science.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sediment entering lateral intakes depends on the flow pattern at the intake entrance. Using a structure in front of the intake entrance can change this pattern and as a result the entering sediment. One of the effective method to change the pattern and manage sediment entering a lateral intake is to use a skimming wall. The removal of sediments from the intake entrance using a skimming wall led to reduction of sediment volume at the intake. To guide flow into the diversion canal and increase skimming wall performance a spur dike was utilized at the opposite side of the intake channel. In this study, the effect of the skimming wall's angle with the bank, a combination of spur dike and skimming wall and discharge changes on controlling sediments entering the intake, intake ratio and bed topography were investigated experimentally. The effect of a skimming wall with three angles (10°, 14°, and 18°) and a combination of skimming wall and spur dike on opposite sides of the intake were investigated. Conducting dimensional analysis, non-dimensional ratios were extracted and test variables were specified. Results showed that in the case of having a skimming wall combined with a spur dike, the amount of sediment entering the intake decreased by 81%, 78.5% and 76% on average for walls with angles of 10°, 14° and 18° respectively. Combining a skimming wall and spur dike has a higher effect on reducing sediments entering the intake compared with a skimming wall alone by about 15%.</jats:p>",

Three types of criteria are introduced in the paper: garbage collection time, length of route allocation, and utilization of resources. A two-stage method of optimization of taskroutes is proposed. It generates tasks at the first stage and assigns vehicles to the tasks at the second stage. At municipal companies that are responsible for garbage, collection tasks are not pre-defined, and consequently tasks must be designated before the workday. The proposed method is based on genetic algorithm, which is used for the purpose of optimization of the assignment problem. The obtained by the algorithm optimal assignment is compared with assignments obtained in the random way. Criteria of evaluation of efficiency of the obtained route of different mutually conflicting dimensions were introduced, such as is task realization time, distances travelled on particular routes, and number of vehicles involved in garbage collection. Efficiency of the obtained assignment appeared to be sufficiently good.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, supply chain networks can span the whole world, and any disruption of these networks may cause economic losses, decreases in sales and unsustainable supplies. Resilience, the ability of the system to withstand disruption and return to a normal state quickly, has become a new challenge during the supply chain network design. This paper defines a new resilience measure as the ratio of the integral of the normalized system performance within its maximum allowable recovery time after the disruption to the integral of the performance in the normal state. Using the maximum allowable recovery time of the system as the time interval under consideration, this measure allows the resilience of different systems to be compared on the same relative scale, and be used under both scenarios that the system can or cannot restore in the given time. Two specific resilience measures, the resilience based on the amount of product delivered and the resilience based on the average delivery distance, are provided for supply chain networks. To estimate the resilience of a given supply chain network, a resilience simulation method is proposed based on the Monte Carlo method. A four-layered hierarchial mobile phone supply chain network is used to illustrate the resilience quantification process and show how network structure affects the resilience of supply chain networks.</jats:p>"

Existing empirical research focus has largely been on examining the impact of SC integration (SCI) on business performance while other issues such as barriers and enablers of SCI have mostly been conceptual. This study was thus set to examine the manner in which firms pursue integration; and how resources, competences, experience, and industry-type influence this course. Using questionnaires, data were collected from 117 service and manufacturing firms operating in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The contribution of this study lies in its ability to critically examine how SCI is pursued and providing validations to the root barriers/enablers of SCI from a contextual standpoint. The findings of the study do not only fill the void in literature but also offer invaluable directions to practitioners and researchers.</p>",

To support the best national defense, we must ensure that our warfighters receive the supply support they need in a timely and efficient manner. Supporting this effort requires a near-real-time system that measures and reports on supply chain strategic performance characteristics such as CWT. Data integrity is an integral part of the process, as is reaching common agreement on appropriate data sources, algorithms to calculate metrics, and the design of a visual dashboard that supports leadership decisions and performance evaluation, with drill-down capability for lower level decision making.</jats:p>",

The energy that is usually merely dissipated by valves can instead be converted and used to partially supply the pumping stations. Pumps used as turbines (PAT) can be used in order to both reduce pressure and recover energy, with proven economic benefits. The direct coupling of the PAT shaft with the pump shaft in a PAT-pump turbocharger (P&amp;P plant) allows us to transfer energy from the pressure control system to the pumping system without any electrical device. Based on experimental PAT and pump performance curves, P&amp;P equations are given and P&amp;P working conditions are simulated with reference to the operating conditions of a real water supply network. The annual energy saving demonstrates the economic relevance of the P&amp;P plant.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper deals with the design of a control scheme for improving the air supply subsystem of a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) with maximum power of 65 kW. The control scheme is evaluated in a plant simulator which incorporates the balance of plant (BOP) components and is built in the aspenONE® platform. The aspenONE® libraries and tools allows introducing the compressor map and sizing the heat exchangers used to conduct the reactants temperature to the operating value. The PEMFC model and an adaptive controller were programmed to create customized libraries used in the simulator. The structure of the plant control is as follows: the stoichiometric oxygen excess ratio is regulated by manipulating the compressor power, the equilibrium of the anode-cathode pressures is achieved by tracking the anode pressure with hydrogen flow manipulation; the oxygen and hydrogen temperatures are regulated in the heat exchangers, and the gas humidity control is obtained with a simplified model of the humidifier. The control scheme performance is evaluated for load changes, perturbations and parametric variations, introducing a growing current profile covering a large span of power, and a current profile derived from a standard driving speed cycle. The impact of the control scheme is advantageous, since the control objectives are accomplished and the PEMFC tolerates reasonably membrane damage that can produce active surface reduction. The simulation analysis aids to identify the safe Voltage-Current region, where the compressor works with mechanical stability.</jats:p>"

The rise of climate change and global terrorism, however, has brought nations together to seek for collaborative solutions. Coopetition is a strategy needed for business executives and managers engaging in strategic planning and operations of their international businesses in the 21st century. In this paper, we propose a two-stage process of coopetition consisting of sustainable supply chains and international soft landings. We illustrate how the two-stage process is used to develop a “Flying High, Landing Soft” platform of wetland entrepreneurship to address the growing global problem of wetland losses. The platform allows students to participate in exploring and developing businesses to maintain a healthy wetland and have positive impact on public health. </jats:p>"

Even more, to ensure sustainability of online product sale, retailers have to go a step further and understand not only consumers' intentions to purchase online but also factors driving product re-purchase. To date, a number of factors driving consumers' e-commerce purchase and re-purchase have been examined. Most recently, the concept of swift guanxi has been studied.

Dengan penggantian alat bantu tersebut, maka efisiensi dan produktivitas perusahaan mengalami peningkatan, dimana semua input yang terkait dengan pengiriman part mengalami penurunan.</jats:p>"

In order to assess and hedge the risk, the EVs charging load model and the Power Supply Company purchase’ portfolio optimisation model are proposed. A linear programming problem for the Power Supply Company purchase’ portfolio optimisation with conditional value at risk (CVaR) have been formulated, and it contains load uncertainty caused by EVs load, price fluctuation, and the expected cost of errors. This study analyses optimal portfolio allocations to different markets, efficient frontier of CVaR, and the influence of different EVs market penetration levels on the portfolio strategy. The analysis results show that risk of the market increases as the EVs market penetration level increases. Power Supply Company may hedge risk through adjusting the optimal portfolio allocation to different electricity markets.</jats:p>",

This creates structural organizational opportunities for Global Supply Chain Centers, organized as a corporate functional unit for an organization, a shared service center or a Business Process Organization that manages supply chain intermediation. The opportunities of such units are unravelled, the major of which: closing bulk contracts at a large discount price, especially for commodities; closing contracts with suppliers to assure supply availability and quality; economies of scale; complex product over lifetime advantages. These are possible for a large corporation or a Business Process Organization.

Findings show that the rigour and discipline of integrated lean six sigma creates a perfect match for the gap of heavily regulated industries such as food industries where defects can have significant environmental consequences also the future research directions have been suggested for the future researchers.

We believe a market-driven approach will overcome the current challenges around gas price volatility and supply constraints by further developing the missing links that will enable genuine connectedness, greater flexibility and operating synergies across a national gas transportation grid – one that can deliver gas where it is needed most and at the right price.\nLooking at mature gas trading environments like the USA provides some aspirational direction in terms of the fluidity of the gas trading environment, where pricing is more dynamic. However, the past and present development opportunities within our own backyard also provide valuable insight. Building the Eastern Gas Pipeline transformed the east coast gas market by introducing a competitive alternative for gas transportation into Sydney and upstream competition between basins. A similar market-led opportunity exists today to build infrastructure connecting Northern Territory gas producers to east coast markets – introducing a competitive alternative for gas transportation and upstream competition between the Beetaloo/McArthur basins and the Surat/Bowen basins. Winning the right to build the Northern Gas Pipeline was an important first step in Jemena realising this vision.\nCurrent regulatory discussions would not be relevant if the industry can shape its own market. Jemena’s northern Australia growth strategy could be the catalyst to resolving these challenges and avoiding further gas constraints or Australian Competition and Consumer Commission interventions seeking to address theoretical issues, rather than solving actual market challenges.\n</jats:p>"

Recent utilization of big data and related techniques in predictive maintenance greatly improves the transparency for system health condition and boosts the speed and accuracy in the maintenance decision making. In this chapter, a Maintenance Policies Management framework under Big Data Platform is designed and the process of maintenance decision support system is simulated for a sensor-monitored semiconductor manufacturing plant.

A simple interface is developed that can be used to increase the ease of communication and provide an interactive approach to the decision-making process. The model contains three echelons: farmers, processors and retailers. The main results show that under normal circumstances, the behavior of the system reaches equilibrium after a few oscillations. However, these oscillations can be smoothed out if the adjustment time of the order placement is increased. Under an extreme event that reduces the demand for milk, behavior changes and the system remains in dis-equilibrium for the entire simulation. Once again, adjustment times remain the leverages that can influence and mitigate those negative effects. Finally, a more robust and collaborative decision-making process among the actors of the chain could be beneficial for all not only under normal circumstances, but also in the presence of extreme uncertainty. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We introduce a mathematical model on the dynamics of demand and supply incorporating collectability and saturation factors. Our analysis shows that when the fluctuation of the determinants of demand and supply is strong enough, there is chaos in the demand-supply dynamics. Our numerical simulation shows that such a chaos is not an attractor (i.e. dynamics is not approaching the chaos), instead a periodic attractor (of period-3 under the Poincaré period map) exists near the chaos, and coexists with another periodic attractor (of period-1 under the Poincaré period map) near the market equilibrium. Outside the basins of attraction of the two periodic attractors, the dynamics approaches infinity indicating market irrational exuberance or flash crash. The period-3 attractor represents the product’s market cycle of growth and recession, while period-1 attractor near the market equilibrium represents the regular fluctuation of the product’s market. Thus our model captures more market phenomena besides Marshall’s market equilibrium. When the fluctuation of the determinants of demand and supply is strong enough, a three leaf danger zone exists where the basins of attraction of all attractors intertwine and fractal basin boundaries are formed. Small perturbations in the danger zone can lead to very different attractors. That is, small perturbations in the danger zone can cause the market to experience oscillation near market equilibrium, large growth and recession cycle, and irrational exuberance or flash crash. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Gas and power networks are tightly coupled and interact with each other due to physically interconnected facilities. In an integrated gas and power network, a contingency observed in one system may cause iterative cascading failures, resulting in network wide disruptions. Therefore, understanding the impacts of the interactions in both systems is crucial for governments, system operators, regulators and operational planners, particularly, to ensure security of supply for the overall energy system. Although simulation has been widely used in the assessment of gas systems as well as power systems, there is a significant gap in simulation models that are able to address the coupling of both systems. In this paper, a simulation framework that models and simulates the gas and power network in an integrated manner is proposed. The framework consists of a transient model for the gas system and a steady state model for the power system based on AC-Optimal Power Flow. The gas and power system model are coupled through an interface which uses the coupling equations to establish the data exchange and coordination between the individual models. The bidirectional interlink between both systems considered in this studies are the fuel gas offtake of gas fired power plants for power generation and the power supply to liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and electric drivers installed in gas compressor stations and underground gas storage facilities. The simulation framework is implemented into an innovative simulation tool named SAInt (Scenario Analysis Interface for Energy Systems) and the capabilities of the tool are demonstrated by performing a contingency analysis for a real world example. Results indicate how a disruption triggered in one system propagates to the other system and affects the operation of critical facilities. In addition, the studies show the importance of using transient gas models for security of supply studies instead of successions of steady state models, where the time evolution of the line pack is not captured correctly.</jats:p>"

Rather, inhibition of ATP synthesis caused massive spontaneous vesicle exocytosis, followed by arrested endocytosis, accounting for the disappearance of evoked postsynaptic currents. In contrast to its weak effects on basal transmission, inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation alone depressed recovery from vesicle depletion. Local astrocytic lactate shuttling was not required. Instead, either ambient monocarboxylates or neuronal glycolysis was sufficient to supply requisite substrate. In summary, basal transmission can be sustained by glycolysis, but strong presynaptic demands are met preferentially by oxidative phosphorylation, which can be maintained by bulk but not local monocarboxylates or by neuronal glycolysis.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</jats:bold>Neuronal energy levels are critical for proper CNS function, but the relative roles for the two main sources of ATP production, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, in fueling presynaptic function in unclear. Either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation can fuel low-frequency synaptic function and inhibiting both underlies loss of synaptic transmission via massive vesicle release and subsequent failure to endocytose lost vesicles. Oxidative phosphorylation, fueled by either glycolysis or endogenously released monocarboxylates, can fuel more metabolically demanding tasks such as vesicle recovery after depletion. Our work demonstrates the flexible nature of fueling presynaptic function to maintain synaptic function.</jats:p>",

Ancient literature and archaeology reveal hermetic sealing, burning sulfur, desiccant dusts, and toxic botanicals as early control methods. Whereas traditional nonchemical methods were subsequently replaced by synthetic chemicals, other traditional methods were improved and integrated with key modern pesticides. Modern stored-product integrated pest management (IPM) makes decisions using knowledge of population dynamics and threshold insect densities. IPM programs are now being fine-tuned to meet regulatory and market standards. Better sampling methods and insights from life histories and ecological studies have been used to optimize the timing of pest management. Over the past 100 years, research on stored-product insects has shifted from being largely concentrated within 10 countries to being distributed across 65 countries. Although the components of IPM programs have been well researched, more research is needed on how these components can be combined to improve effectiveness and assure the security of postharvest food as the human population increases. </jats:p>",

A rank‐ordered logit model was used to assess the effects of price‐ and quantity‐based contract mechanisms, risk preferences, and farm characteristics on ranking of contract preferences. Our empirical results show that, under price‐based contract, farmers are likely to prefer contract that set fixed price when a contract was offered over short term, however, over the long term, farmers prefer a contract item that set formula with a floor price. Under quantity‐based design mechanism, our model results illustrate that contract items that limit biomass quantity delivery requirement become less preferable even if farmers are allowed to negotiate on delivery price. In addition, farmer's risk perception factors toward engaging in marketing organization and vertically coordinated supply chains play a significant role in ranking contract preferences.

The equations of state are introduced. The two-stage criterion lets us use the result data generated by the simulator of the production system as the initial data for further processing; however, the main goal remains to minimise the time of the course of production.

Based on carbon emission volume, carbon trading process is divided into three periods: carbon quota sales, carbon quota purchases and excessive emission penalty. Usually, inadequate carbon emission quotas will lead to a higher total economic cost in carbon trading process. In this study, a load curtailment mechanism is proposed to avoid higher carbon trading cost or excessive carbon emissions. Photovoltaic (PV) power supply is taken into account in the scheduling model. Carbon trading costs and compensation costs caused by cutting load are considered in the objective function. Fuzzy variables are constructed to solve the uncertainty of PV output and load according to fuzzy theory and applied to fuzzy chance constraints. Nested particle swarm algorithm is employed to reach the desired generation schedule. Case study verifies the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed model and algorithm.</jats:p>",

Demand chain management as a new business model requires investing in consumer insights and closer relationships in the supply chain to conduct predictive analysis of retail intelligent solutions. In this regard new kinds of methodologies are required to be discussed. However, at the execution level the limitations in terms of scalability, data integration and knowledge based decision support to providers or suppliers in terms of strategy building and in providing deductive inference capabilities are to be addressed. Therefore, it is required to describe how predictive analytics helps in constructing the knowledge base to conduct verification and validation in terms of semantic predictive analytic for the domain of demand chain management.</jats:p>",

Compared to other battery technologies, e.g., lithium-ion batteries, metal–air batteries offer the possibility to physically stop the battery operation by stopping its air supply, thus offering an additional protection against severe battery damage in the case of, e.g., an accidental short circuit. This method may also reduce the electrical hazard in a larger battery system since, by stopping the air supply, the voltage can be brought to zero while maintaining the energy capacity of the battery. Measurements of overdischarge currents and current cut-off by suffocation have been performed to assess the safety of this type of Zn–air battery. The time to get to zero battery voltage is shown to mainly be determined by the volume of air trapped in the cell.</jats:p>"

The proposal considers an emerging cellular network architecture employing two types of coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission techniques for serving the subscribers. Under the proposed framework, each base station (BS) is powered by an individual PV solar energy module having an independent storage device. BSs are also connected to the conventional grid supply for meeting additional energy demand. We also propose a dynamic inter-BS solar energy sharing policy through a transmission line for further greening the proposed network by minimizing the consumption from the grid supply. An extensive simulation-based study in the downlink of a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) cellular system is carried out for evaluating the energy efficiency performance of the proposed framework. System performance is also investigated for identifying the impact of various system parameters including storage factor, storage capacity, solar generation capacity, transmission line loss, and different CoMP techniques.</jats:p>"

The manufacturer purchases raw materials from suppliers, who hold private information regarding the green degree—that is, the unit emission rates—of their raw materials. An appropriate strategy must be adopted by the manufacturer for the contract design, including a series of payments and the order quantities; the suppliers are subsequently invited to bid for the contracts. The basic model is formulated to assist the manufacturer in designing a reasonable contract for a single supplier. The characteristics of the optimal order quantity and payoff functions of both the manufacturer and supplier are analyzed. A competitive procurement scenario with multiple suppliers is also discussed. With respect to the diversity of auctions, three different auction types are analyzed, including a green degree auction, a price auction with emissions targets, and a performance‐based auction. In addition, an efficient emissions trading policy is established to guide manufacturers regarding how to balance their emission allowances based on the optimal order quantities. Our approach provides an effective decision support system for both the manufacturer and suppliers.</jats:p>",

Due to sectoral interdependencies, major interruptions cause cascading effects in the economy. This paper investigates the economic effects of major power supply disruptions taking such interdependencies into account. We apply a dynamic inoperability input-output model (DIIM) to 101 sectors, including households, of the Scottish economy in 2009 to explore the direct, indirect, and induced effects of supply interruptions. We estimate the societal cost of energy not supplied (SCENS) due to an interruption. The results show that the most economically affected industries, following an outage, are different from the most inoperable ones. The results also indicate that SCENS varies with the duration of a power cut, ranging from ਴,300/MWh for a one-minute outage to \\xA38,100/MWh for a three-hour (and higher) interruption. The results can be used to design policies for contingencies and preventive investments in the power sector. </jats:p>",

These manufacturing and service processes including supply chain became more and more complex. The supply chain includes in many cases consignment stores. The design and operation of these complex supply chain processes can be described as NP-hard optimization problems. These problems can be solved using sophisticated models and methods based on metaheuristic algorithms. This research proposes an integrated supply model based on consignment stores. After a careful literature review, this paper introduces a mathematical model to formulate the problem of consignment-store-based supply chain optimization. The integrated model includes facility location and assignment problems to be solved. Next, an enhanced black hole algorithm dealing with multiobjective supply chain model is presented. The sensitivity analysis of the heuristic black hole optimization method is also described to check the efficiency of new operators to increase the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical results with different datasets demonstrate how the proposed model supports the efficiency, flexibility, and reliability of the consignment-store-based supply chain.</jats:p>"

In response to pressing need, we have attempted to develop a theoretical framework which can help disaster relief workers to improve their coordination using valuable information derived using comprehensive crowdsourcing framework. In this study we have used two-prong research strategies. First we have conducted extensive review of articles published in reputable journals, magazines and blogs by eminent practitioners and policy makers followed by case studies: stampede in Godavari River at Rajahmundry (2015), earthquake in Nepal (2015), flood in Uttarakhand (2013). Finally we have concluded our research findings with further research directions. </jats:p>"

Firstly, for the multiple production lead times which existed in the supply chain, a corresponding inventory state model and a supply chain cost model were constructed based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control system. Then, by considering the actual inventory level, the lead-time compression cost, and the stock-out cost, a cost optimization strategy was proposed. Furthermore, a fuzzy robust control strategy was proposed to realize the flexible switching among the models. Finally, the simulation results show that the total cost of the supply chain could be reduced effectively by the cost optimization strategy, and the stable operation of the supply chain could be realized by the proposed fuzzy robust control strategy.</jats:p>"

The upstream supplier sells a product to the manufacturer, who faces a quality and price sensitive demand. The supplier has a chance to invest in both cost reduction and quality improvement of its product. We derive the optimal investment and pricing decisions for the supply chain members. We do so in both the centralized and the decentralized supply chains. We show that the optimal investment and pricing decisions in the decentralized supply chain may deviate from that in the centralized supply chain. We develop a mechanism to coordinate the decentralized supply chain. The developed mechanism contains four policies: wholesale price, sharing of revenue, sharing of cost reduction investment cost, and sharing of quality improvement investment cost. We also show that the developed coordination mechanism can lead to Pareto improvement.</jats:p>",

An automatic control system with the function of field and remote control is carried out to achieve the precise supply of the fuel. The transfer function which describes the dynamic characteristic of the fuel supply system is given and the dynamic matrix control algorithm is employed to realize the high-quality control of fuel flow-rate. The experimental results show that the response time of flow-rate is about 12 s, almost no overshoot, and control accuracy within 1%. Therefore, the designed fuel supply system can meet the requirements of the high-temperature combustion system, and the designed control system has good control performance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the scale of blood usage worldwide, blood remains a scarce and precious resource. As with any perishable product, careful management of inventories to minimize wastage is crucial. However, due to the nature of the supply of blood, wastage is not only an economic issue as every unit wasted, squanders the time and effort of the human donor. Blood inventory management is therefore a trade‐off, ensuring 100% availability of all blood products at all times whilst minimizing wastage. Hospitals are at the front line of blood use and are the location where much blood is wasted. Inventory management practices in hospital transfusion laboratories are critical. Much of the extant literature in this area posits that good management of hospital blood inventories is due to sophisticated inventory models and algorithms. However, recent research has found that good management practices are much more important. The drivers for low wastage and good inventory management practice can be described using six key themes. Blood supply chain management is much more than managing wastage in hospitals. Proper management of the supply chain as a whole can lead to significant reductions in blood wastage. Recent research has found that methods commonly used in commercial supply chain management can lead to efficiencies in the blood supply chain context. An example of this is stock sharing or lateral transhipment of blood units close to expiry between hospitals, reducing wastage across the supply chain.</jats:p>",

The source water was pretreated by flocculation and/or adsorption prior to the UF process to alleviate permeate flux decline and improve NOM removal efficiency. The performance of a commercial polyethersulfone (PES) UF membrane was compared to evaluate that of the CNT membrane. The CNT membrane outperformed the PES-UF membrane. The permeate flux, total organic carbon and humic acid (HA) removal rate of the CNT membrane was observed to be 230 LMH/bar, 60%, and 80% when 30 mg/L poly aluminium chloride (PACI) flocculation was applied. This highlights that the permeate flux was three times higher with slightly higher rejection efficiency than the PES-UF membrane. In particular, severe permeate flux decline was completely overcome by the CNT membrane with 30 mg/L PACI coagulation. For powder activated carbon (PAC) adsorption, even though there was a severe permeate flux decline in the CNT membrane, almost complete HA removal (98%) was achieved when 0.5 g/L PAC adsorption was coupled. Based on the superior performance of the CNT membrane with pretreatment, the CNT membrane is suggested to be a robust system for a high concentration of organic matter pond water treatment without membrane flux decline.</jats:p>",

New estimates have been provided of the volume of production of these gold coins at Mints of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, and Minas Gerais. Comparing the values of this coinage with remittances to Lisbon, the first half of the eighteenth century reveals a more stable conjuncture than the second half. This latter period shows fluctuations that were expressed in the faster growth of the supply, despite the fall that took place in the production-coinage of gold. Our conclusions question the historiographical theses about the shortage of currency in Brazil throughout the Eighteenth Century. The growth of the economy from the last quarter of the Century onwards implied an increase in the demand for money, which may explain the increase in the supply of national gold coins.</jats:p>"

For buyer, the backorder rate is considered as variable. There are two investments to reduce setup cost and to improve quality of products. The model assumes lead time‐dependent backorder rate, where the lead time is stochastic in nature. By using the trade‐credit policy, the model gives how the credit‐period would be determined to achieve the win‐win outcome. An iterative algorithm is designed to obtain the global optimum results. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the model.</jats:p>",

In the new situation, to research the pricing strategies of supply chain, a three-stage supply chain with one manufacturer, one retailer, and one Data Company was chosen. Meanwhile, considering the manufacturer contained the internal and external BDI, four benefit models about BDI investment were proposed and analyzed in both decentralized and centralized supply chain using Stackelberg game. Meanwhile, the optimal retail price and benefits in the four models were compared. Findings are as follows. (1) The industry cost improvement coefficient, the internal BDI investment cost of the manufacturer, and the added cost of the Data Company on using Big Data technology have different relationships with the optimal prices of supply chain members in different models. (2) In the retailer-dominated supply chain model, the optimal benefits of the retailer and the manufacturer are the same, and the optimal benefits of the Data Company are biggest in all the members.</jats:p>"

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) points that Turkey has early-adopted the implementation recommending further discussions for a reconsideration of the target capital adequacy ratio. The banks have already found it difficult to follow up high capital adequacy especially while financing energy projects, as the Turkish Banking system is preparing for the requirements of Basel III framework. Under the new regulation, the ICAAP is expected to decrease the capital adequacy of banks in Turkey.

One way to solve this problem is to introduce an information platform into the supply chain, which this essay focuses on. Firstly, a review of existing research findings concerning the agro-product competitiveness, agro-product supply chain (ASC) and information platform was given. Secondly, we constructed a mathematical model to analyze the impact of information platform on the bullwhip effect in ASC. Thirdly, another mathematical model was constructed to help compare and analyze the impact of information platform on information acquisition of members in ASC. The research results show that the implantation of information platform can mitigate the bullwhip effect in ASC, and members can determine order amount or production more close to the actual market demand. And also the information platform can reduce the time for members in ASC to get information from other members. Besides, information platform can help ASC to alleviate information asymmetry among upstream and downstream members. Furthermore, researches about the operating mechanism and pattern, technical feature and running structure of the information platform, along with their impacts on agro-product supply chain and the competitiveness of agricultural products need to be advanced.</jats:p>",

This paper describes one of such traditional ‘Farmers Managed Irrigation System' (FMIS) practice, Kuhl, it's an open channel irrigation system to capture and transfer fresh snowmelt water from the glaciers to the agricultural fields in the valley. The characteristic of the local water management institution (structure, participation, process and governance) has been studied to understand their performance and success in managing water rights over the centuries. Lastly, the paper discusses the relevance of traditional water management against the backdrop of climate change, present status and issues related to the continuance of the Kuhl system and recommendations thereof. </jats:p>"

The manufacturer considers to make R&amp;D investment to improve the product quality and reduce the production cost. We first investigate and derive the optimal investment strategy and pricing decisions by establishing a three-stage game model. We show that the optimal investment strategy and pricing decisions in the decentralized model may deviate from those in the centralized model. We then propose a mechanism to coordinate the decentralized supply chain, by introducing a profit sharing policy, a production cost sharing policy, and an investment cost sharing policy.

NP and OP were detected in all samples. It is worth mentioning that the levels of NP and OP in July in waters ranged from 1,740 to 16,200 ng L−1, and from 1,265 to 15,700 ng L−1, respectively; in sediments, they ranged from 28 to 92 ng g−1 dw and from 2.7 to 42 ng g−1 dw, respectively. According to aquatic risk assessment based on hazard quotient (HQ), NP and OP posed a high potential ecological risk (HQ &amp;gt; 1) to relevant aquatic organisms (excluding the alga, Selenastrum capricornutum), indicating that aquatic organisms, in particular crustaceans, have been significantly affected by NP and OP. Although the risk of NP for humans in water was regarded as endurable according to tolerable daily intake, it was higher than the drinking water safety limit (0.5 μg L−1). The results indicated that the heavy contamination caused by NP and OP and their adverse effect on local aquatic organisms in the PRE deserved to arouse wide concern.</jats:p>",

It is necessary to develop some effective methods to remove NDMA from drinking water. A reductive process has been investigated as an alternative treatment method for NDMA removal from water. In this manuscript, zero-valent iron nanoparticles (ZVINPs) were synthesized, and then supported on mesoporous silica materials with high surface area (MCM-41) to prepare a stable ZVINP/MCM-41 nanocomposite. X-ray diffraction measurements showed the stabilization of the ZVINPs upon their support on MCM-41, which enhanced their activity. The ZVINP/MCM-41 nanocomposite was used for the catalytic reduction of NDMA in the model solution, and the results showed the dependency of the removal process on the ZVINP/MCM-41 mass, time of removal, and solution pH. The mechanism of NDMA reduction by ZVINP/MCM-41 was studied, and the results showed the conversion of NDMA to unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, dimethylamine (DMA) and NH4+. The product analysis found that in the process of removal, adsorption and reduction existed at the same time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is considered an indispensable tool for interchanging data and transactions between auto parts and vehicle companies. Since the decade of 80, the EDI was adopted by automobile industry and this process was led by vehicles manufacturers that had determined the adoption of this system for their supcliers. This research carried through an exploratory survey, to analyze how the implantation and use of the EDI, in the automobile industry, has been occurred, under the point of view of small and average companies of the sector, having observed positive and negative aspects associated to the implantation through five theoretical models that deal with the EDI and the Interorganizational Systems (IOS). Regarding to the stage of implementation of the EDI (model of Lummus &amp;amp; Duclus) it was observed that the companies are in the period of transaction, with low level of integration with internal systems. The amplitude of partners (model of Tuunainem) with that the companies carry through EDI are small, and the type of appropriation (model of Subramani) is exploitation. The analysis of the interorganizacionais relations (model of Bensaou and Venkatraman) disclosed that much few areas use this technology, and that the vehicle manufacturer use the coercitive power in the implantation process. Although this, the interviewed ones consider that exists reliable in the relation b its companies and vehicle manufacturer. Based on this survey, we verified that the characteristics and benefits gotten with the use of systems EDI for the studied companies of auto parts are very small, compared with the models.</jats:p>"

This chapter proposed a MCDM performance appraisement module (module constituted by mixing the segregated chain of green-lean-agile logistic activities and corresponding their interrelated metrics) conjunctive with Fuzzy Performance Index model in purpose to estimation the overall performance of individual firm. Furthermore, a centroid method coupled with fuzzy number set is proposed for classifying ill and strong G-L-A metrics of firm, so that managers could escalate their firms performance in case of non desirable performance.

As plastics are everywhere to make life possible for a faster and convenient pace of society, bottled water has become one of the most disposable products to be consumed and disposed of, on a regular basis, both at and away from home. These eventually translate to consumer wastes causing a profound impact to the environment. The more bottles mean more greenhouse gases from production, transportation, waste bottles management, including fresh water supply. These adverse impacts are compounding a framework to justify as to how producer and consumer apply, individually and within the whole product life cycle, to sustainable consumption and production practice (SCP). </jats:p>"

The tunnel, shafts and pipe are designed to withstand ground motions with a 10,000 year return period and continue to deliver water. Non-linear time history analysis of the soils predicts approximately 6m of lateral movement for the design seismic event. Soil-structure interaction analyses indicated conventional design was ineffective for both the shaft and the 60m free-standing steel water pipe within one shaft. A unique hybrid inelastic design was used to enable the steel pipe to realize very high inelastic strains and the concrete shaft to yield to accommodate the soil induced demand. The design required special grades of high ductility steel and innovative details to de-couple the concrete shaft from concrete shoring walls to limit demands on the shaft.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

A strategy based on improving freight flow and density, and tightening terminal capacity is finally producing results for many LTL's, at the same time other LTL's are investing on expanding terminal network's while making bigger gains in the revenue. The availability of big data has revolutionised the way the LTL industry operates. The data assists in planning, efficient routing, safety control, fuel conservation, driving habits, etc. Analysts believe that big data still has a bigger role to play and it will have significant impact on the LTL industry in the coming days. This chapter discusses the challenges and opportunities for LTL carriers as it arises due to the emergence of big data. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Common duckweeds – Lemna – are free-floating aquatic macrophytes belonging to Lemnaceae family. They occur universally, in tropical and temperate zones and are enabled to grow in stagnant, slow-flowing, nutrient-enriched waters. They have an ability to grow over a wide range of temperatures (6 – 33 0C) and pH (optimum 5.5 – 7.5). Lemna species also manifest a characteristic macrophyte community in association with plants functioning as a dominant primary producer. Asexual mode of reproduction is exclusive and therefore, all resources are directed towards vegetative growth. Structure wise they show leaflets (frond) and root-like diffuse form. This simple morphological and physiological form offers special scientific and engineering properties – reflected in easy handling and manipulation under laboratory conditions. As a result they are regarded as a model plant system for a number of chemical and biogeochemical studies. Climate change affects plant growth and physiology. For example, increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) or increase in ultraviolet (UV) radiation (due to the thinning of the ozone layer) can have pronounced effects on the growth and development of plants. In many instances the decrease in growth rate can create disturbances in photosynthetic processes. In the recent past there has been a surge in the interest in looking for alternative remediation technologies to meet formidable demands of polluting materials and situations. One such approach is phytoremediation – the use of plants and associated microbes for environmental cleanup. Cardinal points in favour of such an approach are – cost-effectiveness, natural energy-driven and minimal capital and running costs. Potency of Lemna spp. as a phytoremediation agent as well as its limitations haven dealt with in details in literature. Moreover, Lemna spp. are accepted and highly standardized as test organisms in aquatic ecotoxicology. The authors have shown earlier that Lemna spp. can play a vital role in combating pollution burden in a glaring local situation of river pollution. However, the recent trend in research indicates that Lemna spp (duckweeds at large) can play a critical and sensitive role in being an indicator of overt and subtle climate change. The following is an attempt to take a review of such recent trends. </jats:p>"

Samples were collected from Raw Water Pumping Station at the Water Treatment Station Feira Nova in the city of Feira Nova (Pernambuco, Brazil), from January 2011 to December 2013. The concentration of metals in water (aluminum, antimony, barium, lead, copper, chromium, cadmium, iron, manganese) was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy in the laboratory. For the identification and counting of cyanobacteria, an inverted optical microscope and Sedgewick‐Rafter counting chambers were used. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for recognition of cluster patterns between the studied points. There were variations in abiotic and biotic components in the different years of study. The metals iron, aluminum, barium and manganese had the greatest influence on the temporal dynamics of cyanobacteria in the reservoir.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Congenital systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries or major aortopulmonary collaterals are associated with cyanotic congenital heart disease with decreased pulmonary blood flow. Though it is usually associated with congenital heart diseases, there is an increased incidence of isolated acquired aortopulmonary collaterals in premature infants with chronic lung disease. Interestingly, isolated congenital aortopulmonary collaterals can occur without any lung disease, which may cause congestive heart failure and require closure. We present a neonate with an echocardiogram that showed only left-sided heart dilation. Further workup with a CT angiogram demonstrated an anomalous systemic artery from the descending thoracic aorta supplying the left lower lobe. He eventually developed heart failure symptoms and was taken to the catheterization laboratory for closure of the collateral. However, with the collateral being the only source of blood flow to the entire left lower lobe, he required surgical unifocalization. Isolated aortopulmonary collaterals without any other congenital heart disease or lung disease are rare. Our patient is the first reported case to have an isolated aortopulmonary collateral being the sole pulmonary blood supply to an entire lung segment. Due to its rarity, there is still much to learn about the origin and development of these collaterals that possibly developed prenatally.</jats:p>"

This ecosystem is 70 Km long, and is a major regional source of urban and agricultural water supply, mainly for the municipality of Rio Grande, with ca. 250 thousand citizens. This study aims to diagnose their water quality by measuring benthic invertebrates (Shannon-Wiener diversity index, richness and abundance), use of a BMWP biotic index, physical and chemical evaluation, and applying a trophic state index. The BMWP index showed predominance of taxa indicating altered conditions and polluted waters (Sarcodina and Hydracarina). The abiotic variables indicated eutrophicated waters, chlorophyll values characteristic of eutrophic environments (&gt;2.9 µg. L–1), low N:P rates in sediment and water, with nitrogen limitation during most periods studied. The results of trophic state indexes indicated mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions, reaching hipereutrophic periods. The highest TSI were in Piratini river, in April 2009 and February 2011, coinciding with rice crop leaching. These results regarding nutrient concentration, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry and biotic index support the need to evaluate the occupation of the surroundings of this water supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim/Purpose\t: An important objective of any firm is escalation of its performance and the achievement of competitive advantages. Supply chain agility plays a prominent role to enhance the level of firm’s performance. Moreover, information technology (IT) plays a foundational role in supply chain management practices. Hence, this study proposes the relationship between IT integration as the competency of IT and firm’s market performance both directly and through mediating role of supply chain agility. \n\nBackground:\tMany studies have been done to date on the impact of supply chain agility on overall firm’s performance. However, the effect of an agile supply chain on firm’s market performance per se needs to be studied. Furthermore, there is a gap in the literature about the effect of IT competency such as IT integration on firm’s market performance both directly and through mediating role of supply chain agility. \n\nRecommendation for Researchers: \tThe first direction this study gives to researchers is to consider the different factors which have significant effect on the agility of supply chain, particularly the IT related ones. The second direction is about the study on the effect of IT competencies and supply chain agility on each category of firm’s performance separately instead of considering it as a one construct.\n\nImpact on Society\t: Although this is a conceptual study, it can highlight the importance of IT competency not only in our daily life, but also in our businesses and industries.\n\nFuture Research:\tThis study only proposes some relationships based on theory and literature. Future researchers can test these proposed relationships in different contexts and compare the results. Furthermore, this study proposes the relationships for large manufacturing sector in developing countries. The model could be tested for SMEs as well. In addition, the proposed theoretical model in this study might be tested in both developing as well as developed countries to compare the results which will be contributed to the body of knowledge.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Conventional damage prediction methods for lifeline structures are primarily based on peak ground motion measurements. However, line structures such as lifelines suffer damage that is mainly induced by the strain of the ground and therefore are likely to be vulnerable to sharp spatial changes in the ground motion. In this study, we propose a measure for evaluating the damage incurred by underground water supply pipelines based on the spatial gradient of the peak ground velocity (PGV), in an attempt to quantify the effects of the geospatial variabilities in the ground motion on pipeline damage. We investigated the spatial distribution of the damage caused to water pipelines during the Niigata‐ken Chuetsu earthquake on October 10, 2004 (Japan Meteorological Agency magnitude (M<jats:sub>JMA</jats:sub>) of 6.8) and the Kobe earthquake on January 17, 1995 (M<jats:sub>JMA</jats:sub>7.3) and compared the surveyed damage with the PGV distribution as well as with the gradients of the PGV calculated around the damage areas. For the Kobe earthquake, we used the PGV distribution obtained by the strong‐motion simulation performed by Matsushima and Kawase <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#eqe2869-bib-0001\"/>. In case of the Chuetsu earthquake, we estimated the ground motion using a broadband‐frequency‐based strong‐ground‐motion simulation method based on a multiasperity source model. In both cases, we calculated the gradients of the PGV along the geographical coordinates, with the amplitude of the PGV gradient vector being employed as the damage estimator. Our results show that the distribution of damage to underground water supply pipelines exhibits a greater correlation with the gradients of the PGV than with the PGV itself. Thus, the gradient of the PGV is a useful index for preparing initial‐screening hazard maps of underground facilities. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In this prospective 10-year longitudinal study we enrolled all blood donation services and hospitals of the federal state Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. &lt;b&gt;Methods and Results:&lt;/b&gt; From 2005 to 2015 (time period with major demographic effects), whole blood donation numbers declined by 18%. In male donors this paralleled the demographic change, while donation rates of females declined 12.4% more than expected from demography. In parallel, red cell transfusion rates/1,000 population decreased from 2005 to 2015 from 56 to 51 (-8.4%), primarily due to less transfusions in patients &gt;60 years. However, the transfusion demand declined much less than blood donation numbers: -13.5% versus -18%, and the population &gt;65 years (highest transfusion demand) will further increase. The key question is whether the decline in transfusion demand observed over the previous years will further continue, hereby compensating for reduced blood donation numbers due to the demographic change. The population structure of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania reflects all Eastern German federal states, while the Western German federal states will reach similar ratios of age groups 18-64 years / ≥65 years about 10 years later. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/b&gt;Regular monitoring of age- and sex-specific donation and transfusion data is urgently required to allow transfusion services strategic planning for securing future blood supply.</jats:p>"

When a supply chain faces considerable loss following a disruption, supply chain members are motivated toward investing in manners that reduce their disruption probability. In improving supply chain reliability, the cost‐sharing mechanism must be set appropriately to realize the efficiency of the disruption prevention investment. In a supply chain where the focal manufacturing company has its own subsidiary supplier and an outsourcing supplier, we analyze different forms of cost‐sharing mechanisms when both suppliers confront disruption risks. Through the cost‐sharing mechanisms presented in this study, supply chain members can improve their reliability via disruption prevention investments without considerably increasing the total supply chain cost. We present two concepts, the cost‐sharing structure and the cost‐sharing ratio, in this study. As the two key components of cost‐sharing mechanism, these two elements constitute a practicable cost allocation mechanism to facilitate disruption prevention.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In absence of joint global climate action, several jurisdictions unilaterally restrict their domestic demand for fossil fuels. Another policy option for fossil fuel producing countries, not much analysed, is to reduce own supply of fossil fuels. We explore analytically and numerically how domestic demand and supply side policies affect global emissions, contingent on market behaviour. Next, in the case of Norway, we find the cost-effective combination of the two types of policies.Our numerical results indicate that given a care for global emissions, and a desire for domestic action, about 2/3 of the emission reductions should come through supply side measures. </jats:p>",

Successful cold chain management is essential for pharmaceutical companies, transportation providers and health care practitioners. With growing population and their demand; especially in retail and pharmaceutical sectors drives Indian cold chain market and it has huge potential to grow in the near future. India's greatest need is for an effective and economically viable cold chain solution that will integrate the supply chains for all commodities from the production centers to the consumption centers; thereby reducing physical waste and loss of value of perishable commodities. This article highlights the importance of cold chain concepts with Indian business scenario. Strategic planning of cold supply chain and their real value towards good manufacturing practices are critically highlighted. </jats:p>"

This development already caused significant changes in many markets and businesses but has not yet been holistically established in the field of supply chain management of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper aims to evolve a strategy to integrate the main idea of the sharing economy and its platform-based business model into the supply chain management of SMEs. Therefore, the requirements of SMEs among their supply chains are classified and the idea of the sharing economy is implemented and evaluated. This research presents the applicability and contribution of the principals of the Sharing Economy to the sector of supply chain management in SMEs. This will empower SMEs to improve their current market value.</jats:p>"

Generic waste that is burgeoning is a deterrent to the practice of sustainability that aligns water, energy, infrastructure, health, food, and lifestyle (Sachs, 2007). This chapter delineates the gap between globalization at the macro-level and global citizenry at the grassroots-base and posits a value bridge assessed by appropriate thresholds of water - energy - waste. The emergent need to strengthen climate resilience and to usher into the sustainable pathway of climate-proofed development needs tuning of processes, lifestyle, hazardous substances and consumption. Climate change manifests as an over-arching risk that is strewn with unpredictability, multiple dimensions, uncertainties, spikes, imbalances leading to inequity.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, a systematic methodology is applied first to determine the relationship between the system output and input parameters and second to identify the assigned input sensors whose readings need to be improved in a prioritized manner based on the strength of those input-output relationships. The two main criteria used to prioritize these sensors are the decrease in production costs and the decrease in production costs’ volatility obtained when the selected sensor’s precision is improved. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we first apply it to a simplified version of the real supply network model where the results can be readily validated with the simulated data. Next, we apply and test the proposed approach in the real supply network model with historical data.</jats:p>"

The typical structure and operation modes are designed based on the requirements of shore supply systems. A multi‐objective regulation strategy is devised for energy management system. The strategy aims to reduce power fluctuation and to implement the microgrid self‐supply at ports. A parallel optimisation model is built to solve the regulation problem. A study case of four different ship‐berthing scenarios is utilised to validate the effectiveness of the designed microgrid and its regulation strategy.</jats:p>",

We investigate two scenarios: the “make‐to‐order” scenario, in which the manufacturer schedules production based on the realized demand, and the “make‐to‐stock” scenario, in which the manufacturer schedules production before the demand is known. For each scenario, we find that it is possible for the retailer to share his forecast without incentives when the collection efficiency of the manufacturer is high. When the efficiency is moderate, information sharing can be realized by a bargaining mechanism, and when the efficiency is low, non‐information sharing is a unique equilibrium. Moreover, the possibility of information sharing in the make‐to‐stock scenario is higher than that in the make‐to‐order scenario. In addition, we analyze the impact of demand forecasts’ characteristics on the value of information sharing in both scenarios.</jats:p>",

Regarding the lighting system, it achieves the perfect balance between beautiful city ambience and preserving the darkness that makes cities more livable. As a smart city component, a public lighting system offers much more than light itself. Integration of other use cases has given a new dimension to the public lighting system in visual and functional terms. All those features that could be integrated into the public lighting infrastructure require additional power supply. This paper deals with possibilities of providing electricity to other power use cases integrated into the system of public lighting. Simulation results in DIALux showed that it is possible to save energy by a transition to LED lighting technology and establishment of a smart lighting management system using a dynamic operational profile proposed in the paper. By means of that, it is possible to reduce energy consumption in the public lighting system by at least 50 % up to 80 %, which could be enough for power use cases integrated into the public lighting infrastructure</jats:p>"

The differential approach to the theory of the multiproduct firm is employed to examine <jats:italic>ex ante</jats:italic> decisions about feed grain demand and livestock supply. The estimation results suggest that livestock producers have little flexibility in adjusting the demand for corn in response to an increase in corn prices. The substitutable relationship between corn and distillers’ grains contributes to alleviating pressures on feed costs in response to high corn prices. In addition, the estimation results highlight that the composition of livestock supply can be altered by changes in livestock prices. On the basis of the estimated elasticities, the decompositions of profit‐maximizing input demand are conducted to examine the effects of changes in corn prices on feed grain demand and livestock supply. The decomposition results reveal that an increase in corn prices reduces corn demand but raises the demand for distillers’ grains mainly due to the substitution effects of corn price changes. The decomposition results also show that an increase in the price of corn reduces cattle supply but raises the supply of chicken and pork due to the output relationships in supply.</jats:p>",

These intermediaries play key roles that determine the ways in which farm households participate in and the benefits they derive from new retail-led market opportunities associated with the supermarket sector's shift from FFV procurement through wholesale markets towards more direct contracting with farm communities. This paper provides a comprehensive description of 198 FFV supply chain intermediaries working with Walmart China in 2014, including their historical background, infrastructure investments, downstream marketing and upstream sourcing. We find that these actors play an increasingly critical role in the organization of land, labor and production through contracts. Our study provides critical insights for understanding both the trends in vertical coordination of China's developing agricultural sector and the pace of the country's agricultural modernization. Walmart is a leading international supermarket chain with a growing presence in China, and evidence suggests that their supply chain strategies are similar to other large supermarkets in the region. Results are also relevant to understanding current challenges in China related to food safety and quality, a top priority in recent years.</jats:p>",

In-depth interviews were conducted across the entire supply chain from cotton farmers to a retailer. McDonough and Braungart’s triple top line model was applied for identifying the three pillars of sustainability, that is, economy, equity, and ecology, and how these pillars influenced and impacted each other. Across the supply chain economic factors were the drivers for adoption of sustainable practices, and the ecology dimension was the weakest pillar. This suggested leveraging economic support within the supply chain would ultimately influence the sustainability of the supply chain as a whole. To develop a sustainable apparel supply chain in South Africa, it is recommended the economic challenges be identified and addressed to free up savings that can be invested in sustainable practices and to improve collaboration across the supply chain to add value to sustainable practices. </jats:p>",

It identifies key interrelated processes, practices, and factors that underpin integrated resource management (IRM) and their attendant benefits. Applying the E4 framework concerned with energy, economy, environment, and equity to identify the main threats to these systems, the chapter evaluates their institutional, political, economic, cultural and behavioral components, and characterizes the forces that drive each of them at different governance scales. The chapter is guided by political economy, economic, and sociological theories that suggest that institutional structures affect economic factors and processes (i.e. production, distribution, and consumption processes). A case study of energy, water, and food (EWF) conflicting sectoral imperatives in Delaware is discussed in detail to better understand how these policy and institutional processes occur, which forms they take, and in which ways they define the quality and quantity of EWF resource systems in the State. In order to verify these parameters, the analysis considered the advantages of a sectorally balanced, E4 framework, in particular to evaluate the valency and magnitude of cross-sectoral connections, balance competing needs, and identify policy options that address various trade-offs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The need to integrate environmental and social aspects into the supply chain has created a debate amongst academicians and researchers on two topics: sustainability and the supply chain. A large number of journals and special volumes are publishing research that carries out a case study or survey, develops a mathematical model or builds a conceptual model/framework on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). However, classified analysis of articles that develop a framework on SSCM has not been carried out by any researcher. The study thus aims to review SSCM framework articles to identify the major contributions and gaps. A total of 92 framework articles on SSCM from the sample of 349 over a period of 19 years (1998–2016) are structurally analyzed to meet the objectives. The selected literature is categorized by novel or adapted framework, source of framework, framework verification, method used for framework verification and identifying the constructs/elements that build the structural framework. Analyzing the literature sample using these categories reveals that framework development in the context of SSCM is still an area with ample future opportunities. The findings of the study are especially interesting for academicians and practitioners to investigate the critical gaps in the field of sustainable supply chain management frameworks (SSCMFs).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, a major trend is going to redesign a production system by controlling or making variable the production rate within some fixed interval to maintain the optimal level. This strategy is more effective when the holding cost is time‐dependent as it is interrelated with holding duration of products and rate of production. An effort is made to make a supply chain model (SCM) to show the joint effect of variable production rate and time‐varying holding cost for specific type of complementary products, where those products are made by two different manufacturers and a common retailer makes them bundle and sells bundles to end customers. Demand of each product is specified by stochastic reservation prices with a known potential market size. Those players of the SCM are considered with unequal power. Stackelberg game approach is employed to obtain global optimum solution of the model. An illustrative numerical example, graphical representation, and managerial insights are given to illustrate the model. Results prove that variable production rate and time‐dependent holding cost save more than existing literature.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In continental Portugal, the publicly financed supply of gastroenterology exams was limited since the end of the last century, restricted to a fixed set of private providers that was hired by the Portuguese state. This way of contracting created market entry barriers and is inefficient, since prices are administratively set. Besides, it produced access inequalities, because of the way that the supply was geographically distributed. This paper applies the Extended Kernel Density 4-Step Floating Catchment Area (EKD4SFCA) method to identify priority districts for the promotion of new supply by the state, in order to choose the appropriate way of contracting new private supply, as determined by current law, and to reduce access inequalities. The applied method enables the identification of the Portuguese regions with strong competition between health care providers and where patients’ access to publicly financed gastroenterology exams is relatively low. In these regions, the state should promote public bids to stimulate new supply, exploring thereby the potential for setting lower prices and reducing access inequalities.</jats:p>"

To evaluate the relationship, Pearson correlation test was used and to test the hypotheses, structural equations method is applied. The results show that internal knowledge transfer and external knowledge transfer have positive and significant impact on supply chain flexibility but the complexity of product has no impact on supply chain flexibility. This study showed that the effect of external knowledge transfer was higher than the impact of internal transfer. Finally, it is proposed that companies should provide the conditions in which the employees can increase supply chain flexibility outside the discussion sessions on proposes, new products ideas with other internal and external sectors, brain storming sessions formation with the presence of external organizational experts and take good strategies to manage the effect of products complexity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Production‐Distribution Problem (PDP) in Supply Chain Management (SCM) is an important tactical decision. One of the challenges in this decision is the size and complexity of supply chain system (SCS). On the other side, a tactical operation is a mid‐term plan for 6–12 months; therefore, it includes different types of uncertainties, which is the second challenge. In the literature, the uncertain parameters were modeled as stochastic or fuzzy. However, there are a few studies in the literature that handle stochastic and fuzzy uncertainties simultaneously in PDP. In this paper, the modeling and solution approaches of PDP which contain stochastic and fuzzy uncertainties simultaneously are investigated for a SCS that includes multiple suppliers, multiple products, multiple plants, multiple warehouses, multiple retailers, multiple transport paths, and multiple time periods, which, to the best of the author’s knowledge, is not handled in the literature. The PDP contains deterministic, fuzzy, fuzzy random, and random fuzzy parameters. To the best of the author’s knowledge, there is no study in the literature which considers all of them simultaneously in PDP. An analytic solution approach has been developed by using possibilistic programming and chance‐constrained programming approaches. The proposed modeling and solution approaches are implemented in a numerical example. The solution has shown that the proposed approaches successfully handled uncertainties and produce robust solutions for PDP.</jats:p>",

Leveraging technology for crop forecasting, inter-State river water disputes and measures needed to resolve them in the light of international experience are other areas of focus. In fine, the chapter calls for a comprehensive water policy that will not only recognize water as a national resource but also help bridge all differences for making world a worthy place to live in.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The study of institutions and economic history was much influenced by Ronald Coase and Douglass North, in particular with Douglas North’s notion of government as an endogenous outcome of institution competition. Although Max Weber articulated a concept of government as a monopoly of violence in 1919, much subsequent modeling work on governments was built around the banditry notion of governments of Mancur Olson (1993, “Democracy, Dictatorship and Development.” <jats:italic>The American Political Science Review</jats:italic> 87(3) (September): 567–576). Examples are Usher (1989, “The Dynastic Cycle and the Stationary State.” <jats:italic>American Economic Review</jats:italic> 79: 1031–1044), Moselle and Polak (2001, “A Model of a Predatory State.” <jats:italic>Journal of Law, Economics &amp; Organization</jats:italic> 17(N1)), and the like. A good summary is found in Dixit (2004, <jats:italic>Lawlessness and Economics: Alternative Modes of Governance</jats:italic>. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press). We called this collectively a Weberian/Olsonian view of governments. Building on the notion that a State is a monopoly of violence, these models are in line with the banditry idea of Olson, which, among many country historical studies, he used the Chinese example that governments are essentially stationary/roving bandits. Taking Olson’s ideas as a lead, this paper uses the counter-example of Feng Yu-hsiang (馮玉祥 1882–1948) (Feng), a Chinese “warlord”, to present an alternative analytical framework in terms of a supply-demand model for the emergence of governments. The level of generalization for a framework of such societal order is necessarily heuristic, and can be compared to such economic simplification of social reality by Hayek, Schumpeter and North. However, it should help constellate facts that can be gathered to evaluate refutable hypotheses that are of interest to political theorists and historians. The model formulated for this paper is not intended to justify violence, which the authors deplore, but is recognized as merely a statement about realpolitik.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The cost of energy has increased significantly for the industrial enterprises over the recent years, due to an increase in the electricity tariffs and the changes in the rules of the electricity market. Tariffs for electricity sold to consumers, differentiated according to various parameters, one of which is the voltage range. The higher the voltage range, the lower the tariffs, and thus, the consumer pays less for the supplied energy. Currently only for big consumers made energy supply “direct input” through the construction of an overhead line (OL) with a nominal voltage of 110 kV or 220 kV. However, it is advisable to consider the issue of power supply efficiency of big and medium-sized industrial enterprises based on the “direct input”. The questions of voltage level study based on empirical formulas are considered in the article, expressing the dependence of the voltage from the transmission distance and the amount of transmitted power. It was proven that these formulas give a large spread, so intermediate voltage classes 35 kV and 110 kV, which compared with the traditional option of power supply on the basis of the cable line 10 kV, have been selected. Based on the technical and economic calculations it has been proved the value of the transmit power and length of the line at which the power supply of industrial enterprise on the basis of “ direct input” with a nominal voltage of 110 kV becomes effective.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Micro resistance welding is one of the most effective ways to obtain permanent joints of metal parts. The quality of welded joints strongly depends on the characteristics of the power supply of welding equipment. The power supplies for micro resistance welding based on Energy Storage topology have a softer impact on the network than the ones based on Direct Energy topology. The use of supercapacitors for Energy Storage type power supplies makes it possible to reduce the dimensions of welding equipment and to improve its technical parameters. However, the feature of the supercapacitors is low value of the nominal voltage, which usually does not exceed 3 V. To provide higher voltage, the modules of supercapacitors connected in series are designed. In order to extend the life time of such modules, a voltage balancing system is required.\nA circuit for balancing the  voltage of a modular supercapacitor energy storage of a power supply for micro resistance welding is proposed. The fragments of calculation of control units of a supercapacitor module cell are given. The simulation of the balancing circuit operation is carried out and time charts of the supercapacitor charge process are obtained. The operability and effectiveness of the proposed solution is confirmed. The advantage of the proposed circuit is the possibility of obtaining the high efficiency because of returning the excessive energy of the module cell back into the power supply.</jats:p>"

This study was a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with a two (concentrate level) × two (yeast supplement) factorial treatment arrangement, with four periods (6 week/period) and a 3-week interval between each period. Cows were offered grass silage-based diets consisting of two levels of concentrate (300 and 600 g/kg), with or without supplement of 0.5 g/day of an active dry yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain) with a specification of 2 × 1010 cfu/g. Feed dry matter intake, milk yield, milk composition, bodyweight and body condition score were similar between yeast treatments at both concentrate levels. Nutrient digestibility was not affected by yeast supplementation. Energy intake and faecal, urinary, CH4 and milk energy outputs were also not affected by yeast supplementation. Yeast supplementation had no effects on energy partitioning but tended to increase heat production and decreased energy retention. Yeast supplementation at two levels of concentrate had no effect on total CH4 emissions, but tended to increase CH4 per unit of feed intake and CH4 energy output per unit of gross energy intake. There were no effects of yeast supplementation on CH4 per unit of milk yield. Yeast supplementation had no effect on any variable of nitrogen intake, output or utilisation. Overall, the dietary addition of an active dried yeast product at two concentrate feeding levels had no effects on feed intake, milk production, milk composition, nutrient digestibility, or nitrogen utilisation efficiency and only tended to increase heat production, CH4 per unit of feed intake and CH4 energy output per unit of gross energy intake in lactating dairy cows.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background/Aims: (-)-Hydroxycitric acid (HCA) had been shown to suppress fat accumulation in animals and humans, while the underlying biochemical mechanism is not fully understood, especially little information is available on whether (-)-HCA regulates energy metabolism and consequently affects fat deposition. Methods: Hepatocytes were cultured for 24 h and then exposed to (-)-HCA (0, 1, 10, 50 µM), enzyme protein content was determined by ELISA; lipid metabolism gene mRNA levels were detected by RT-PCR. Results: (-)-HCA significantly decreased the number and total area of lipid droplets. ATP-citrate lyase, fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c mRNA level were significantly decreased after (-)-HCA treatment, whereas peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α mRNA level was significantly increased. (-)-HCA significantly decreased ATP-citrate lyase activity and acetyl-CoA content in cytosol, but significantly increased glucose consumption and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. (-)-HCA promoted the activity/content of glucokinase, phosphofructokinase-1, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, NADH dehydrogenase and ATP synthase remarkably. Conclusions: (-)-HCA decreased lipid droplets accumulation by reducing acetyl-CoA supply, which mainly achieved via inhibition of ATP-citrate lyase, and accelerating energy metabolism in chicken hepatocytes. These results proposed a biochemical mechanism of fat reduction by (-)-HCA in broiler chickens in term of energy metabolism.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change is having a significant impact on water resources globally; more so in developing countries due to lower resilience and weakened coping mechanisms. Water resource and supply management systems need to be adaptive to the uncertainty and unpredictability posed by this challenge. The current water crisis is mainly that of governance within the water sector. On this premise, this chapter seeks to explore the adaptiveness of water management institutions and systems to climate change impacts, with a focus on Kenya's case. Kenya continues to face numerous challenges relating to water supply, which are further exacerbated by climate change. Prior to the development of key legislative and institutional frameworks, through adoption of the Water Act 2002, the water sector grappled with gross mismanagement, manifested via inefficiency in water service provision and resource degradation. Deploying the conceptual model of adaptive (co)-management institutional prescription of polycentric governance, experimentation, public participation, and management of bioregional scale, this chapter stands to contribute novel insights into designing sustainable, adaptive water governance regimes. </jats:p>"

Wineries in these emerging regions face different vertical coordination challenges than in well‐established regions, which may affect procurement choices. Results corroborate prior findings that quality considerations and the need to safeguard investments in specialized assets, respectively, increase usage of more formal coordination mechanisms like written contracts and vertical integration or ownership. Consistent with prior findings of studies of wineries in established wine regions, we find that perceived difficulty in measuring grape quality attributes leads to tighter coordination; a point previously undocumented for emerging regions.

India needs more energy to propel its economic growth, whereas Bangladesh is worried about downstream impact. The concerns of Bangladesh are based on the experience of severe water shortage and other impacts of Farakka Barrage and Teesta Barrage and also Himalayan Component of the Interlinking of River Project. Over the years some progress was made at bilateral level. But the major problem remains unaddressed i.e. without reconciling the issues of indigenous people a big dam cannot be constructed. This paper highlighted the existing scenario of Bangladesh and the indigenous people of Manipur in India in one hand and ecological, socio-economic concern in other hand i.e. obligation not to cause significant harm. There is no straight way answers available to be choose between a ‘Yes' or ‘No'; neither depends on the issues of ‘might' over ‘right' or ‘development' over ‘destruction', but on the circumstances to come.</jats:p>"

The present study characterizes the water sources available around Pallikaranai Marsh. Groundwater was found to be the main source of water in the study area, extracted through domestic wells as well as commercially through a large number of agricultural wells. Direct surface water extraction from wetlands by private tankers was also observed in some areas. Acute water shortage and inefficient water supply by the government has led to thriving of tanker market in this area. Shrinking of the marsh and surrounding water bodies owing to construction, dumping of waste and encroachment accompanied by over-extraction of groundwater is driving this area towards extreme water crisis especially in event of climate change. Conservation of wetlands and evolving norms for sustainable water extraction of groundwater especially by commercial entities is recommended. </jats:p>"

Nevertheless, besides the first attempts to study TV broadcasters and streaming providers as release windows, academic research in marketing has concentrated primarily on the initial theat-rical release. This article examines factors influencing supply and demand during the sequential release process of the motion picture industry. The authors build a modelling framework to ana-lyze the drivers resulting in comprehensive supply and strong demand in major exhibition win-dows (i.e., during the home video, video-on-demand, and free-to-air TV exhibition). They esti-mate the conceptual model of regressions using market data from Germany, including all 5 200 theater-released motion pictures between 2005 and 2014. The authors expand the existing suc-cess-breeds-success theory and use a winner-takesall theory to explain market supply and de-mand in sequential distribution. The results reveal a limited set of influencing factors (e.g., word-of-mouth communication or certain genres) that increase the probability of comprehensive exhibition and strong demand. Other influencing factors depend on the exhibition window (e.g., age ratings). The results add to existing theories of sequential distribution and can help research-ers and managers improve movie-specific exhibition strategies.</jats:p>"

The authors conducted a qualitative research using exploratory case studies in two large Brazilian companies and two major suppliers. Top supply chain executives of these companies were interviewed. We found differences in how these companies invest in IT to govern their supply chain. In the first case, we identified a more relational type of governance that was mainly based on the company's relationship with its suppliers which was driven by the desire to achieve a greater market share. Here IT investments were used to improve sales and enable operations planning projects where all systems were being integrated. In the second case, we identified transactional governance as the predominant form. This reflects the presence of a great number of suppliers, low partnership and low supply on time delivery rate. Thus, investments on e-procurement and ERP are being made to achieve more relational governance through integration with their suppliers. </jats:p>"

This chapter provides useful insights to develop this framework through the lens of the recent Volkswagen emission scandal. A sizable dataset of #volkswagescandal tweets (8,274) was extracted as the research sample. Research findings based upon this sample include the following: Consumer sentiments are overall negative toward the scandal; some clustered groups are identified; male users expressed more interest on social media in the topic than female users; the popularity of tweets was closely related with the timing of news coverage, which indicates the traditional media is still playing a critical role in public opinion formation.

This paper explores the roles, practices, and behaviour of local supply chain stakeholders who mainly consist of rural women entrepreneurs that engage in Shea nut picking and Shea butter processing. Also, the research examines the local buying agents (LBA) who serve as the middlemen between the rural women and the exporters of Shea butter. This study deploys qualitative research design, guided by the Role theory. The study reveals that the rural women and the local buying agents are the key stakeholders who participate in the agricultural supply chain. Granting the fundamental principle of the sustainable supply chain, the findings indicate that the present active engagement and practices of these local stakeholders do not align with the principles of the sustainable supply chain. The study also exposes that factors such as gender disparity, weak access to financial support, and information asymmetry are major contributors to the present roles, practices, and behaviour of the local actors. The current study, therefore, put forward several recommendations to the Nigerian Government to encourage the construction of sustainable engagement and sustainable supply chain in the rural supply chain network.</jats:p>"

Effects of reduced AAM intake on nutrient supply were evaluated. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Nutrient intake was calculated in 20 adult PKU patients based on a structured food record and complemented by laboratory assessment of nutritional status. Patients were classified into 2 groups, (A) regular AAM intake, or (B) AAM intake below calculated requirements. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Group B consumed a higher proportion of natural protein (60 ± 23 vs. 33 ± 12%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002); however, the total protein intake was below the recommended amounts in 60% of patients in group B versus 7% in group A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). Fat intake was higher in group B (39 ± 9% of energy vs. 31 ± 6%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03), mainly from saturated fats. Selenium, folate, and vitamin B12 intake was below the recommended intake in group B. However, serum concentrations of these analytes remained within the normal range in both groups, although vitamin B12 levels were lower in group B. Plasma tyrosine correlated with AAM intake, and hydroxyproline correlated with the amount of natural protein consumed. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Relaxed AAM intake resulted in insufficient nutrient supply, despite a compensatory increase in consumption of natural protein.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most important and visible indicators of global climate change is the recession of glaciers in many parts of the world. The findings of the IPCC Assessment Report (2007) suggest that there has been a significant decline in mountain glaciers and snow cover, which has contributed to the increased sea levels and water flow changes in river basins. In the latter half of 20th century, an increase in the rate of retreat has been observed in Himalayan Glaciers since advent of industrialization. The paper attempts to present a critical review and understanding of the recent changes in retreat of selected Himalayan glaciers from potential climate change. The study explores scientific evidence and analysis of observed data from a large and a small glacier in the Indian Himalaya. This will help in understanding the vulnerability of retreat of the glaciers based on their size. The larger glaciers are unlikely to disappear in the near future, due to its large mass balance and large response time due to climatic changes. Future adaptation needs, research and action for downstream communities, ecosystems and impacts on power sector are discussed. </jats:p>"

Firstly, we use differential equation to model the evolution of store‐assistance service level and depict the effect of store‐assistance service level on the return rate. By applying two‐stage game, both optimal pricing and store‐assistance service strategies are obtained based on the presented optimal control model. Subsequently, the committed dynamic consignment price contract is designed to coordinate and improve the performance of supply chain. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the impacts of the effectiveness of store‐assistance service level and decay rate on the feasible region of corresponding contract.</jats:p>",

The agile handling of ships and cargoes is a key factor for the competitiveness of a port, and the information management is ever more a strategic issue within this scope. Nevertheless, the different features of the various means of transport, the multiple players involved in port intermodality and logistics, as well as the cultural, technological and procedures simplification asymmetries of both the authorities representing the public interest inside the port and the private parties involved in the port business offer difficulties to the development of an agile and electronic integrated relational model. The “Single Window” philosophy implemented for the management of port information has been achieving very positive results, as far as maritime transport concerns (a sector with very specific characteristics), being absolutely imperative to apply this philosophy to all the means of transport and port logistics. The agility of information in intermodality is still an incipient reality, and the present project takes a careful look at this problematic. Our case-study is Port of Sines and we will make an analysis of the present situation and present a possible development to new conceptual developments in this area. </jats:p>"

Optimizing supply chain performance is a primary concern of manufacturing and logistics organizations. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is helping organizations to build automated and interconnected smart environment by object identification and tracking, motivating the first step towards an IoT-enabled world. This chapter attempts to understand extant literature studying applications of RFID in implementing the IoT in supply chain management. We categorize extant literature, firstly, based on research methodology and secondly, based on supply chain processes. We find that presently academic activity is around conceptualizing the usability of RFID in the IoT with limited analytical and empirical evidence. Supply chain processes such as demand planning, procurement, retail shelf space management and product returns are prospective areas for interesting future research.</jats:p>"

Drawing upon resource-based view theory, the authors test a theoretical model that integrates IT capability, supply chain capability and organizational agility. The authors propose that IT capability enables the development of a higher level of supply chain capability which is embedded within inter-firm processes and in turn enhances agility. Structural equation modeling is employed to test their theoretical conceptualization of 310 Australian fast-growth small-to-medium enterprises across different industrial sectors. The results show that IT capability does contribute to firm agility through enhancing inter-firm supply chain processes. This research highlights the role of IT-enabled intermediated processes and the ways in which IT is used by firms to enhance core business processes. </jats:p>"

In additional, regarding the measures against the supply‐demand imbalance and frequency problems, it is necessary to consider not only introducing further distributed generation sources but also new approaches such as utilization of storage batteries or load side control seen in demand response. Against this backdrop, in Japan, an analytical model for supply‐demand control/frequency regulation simulation has been developed, which, named AGC30, can work on MATLAB/Simulink. It is possible to simulate the supply and demand balance control considering both economic dispatching control and load frequency control. In this research, with the purpose of contribution to the development of supply‐demand control technology that responds to the future large structural change of electric power system, as the introduction and diffusion of renewable energy power generation and smart grid technology, as a common foundation for the supply‐demand / frequency control of electric power system, it is aimed to construct a standard model for computer simulation that can be implemented efficiently.</jats:p>",

Unlike many papers that assume the all‐or‐nothing supply disruption pattern, in this paper, only the regional disruptions belong to the all‐or‐nothing disruption category, while for the local disruptions all disruption levels can be considered. Two biobjective decision‐making models, stochastic, based on the wait‐and‐see approach, and deterministic, based on the expected value approach, are proposed and compared to optimize the trade‐off between expected cost and expected service. The main findings indicate that the stochastic programming wait‐and‐see approach with its ability to handle uncertainty by probabilistic scenarios of disruption events and the much simpler expected value problem, in which the random parameters are replaced by their expected values, lead to similar expected performance of a supply chain under multilevel disruptions. However, the stochastic approach, which accounts for all potential disruption scenarios, leads to a more diversified supply portfolio that will hedge against a variety of scenarios.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Indigenous yellow cattle (Bos indicus) and Asiatic swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) are important livestock species in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Laos). Data from 2011 estimated there was a national herd of 1 586 200 cattle and 774 200 buffalo, with average numbers of 5.3 cattle and 3.4 buffalo per farm household, indicating that the majority of farm households with large ruminants were smallholders, retaining large ruminants as a storage of wealth, for sale as meat, and as a source of manure fertiliser. Increasing demand for red meat in both domestic and neighbouring markets, driven by rapidly growing economies and urbanisation, offers opportunities for Lao smallholders to gain more income from their livestock. However, improving cattle and buffalo production and a more sustainable supply of safe beef and buffalo meat, requires that numerous production, health and welfare constraints be addressed, including: prevalence of important infectious and parasitic diseases, nutritional deficits particularly in the dry season, undeveloped trading, meat processing and marketing systems, limited veterinary and extension service capacity, adverse impacts from climate change and cultural practices specific to buffalo husbandry, plus policy developments that recognise and adapt to changes in land use. Improvements in large ruminant health, processing and marketing are of particular importance as these will enable poor smallholder farmers to participate in emerging beef markets and expand other agricultural enterprises, improving rural livelihoods, with potential reductions in rural poverty and increased food security. This paper identifies the strategic interventions that may increase the supply of cattle and buffalo and improve rural livelihoods in Laos and the Greater Mekong Subregion.</jats:p>"

The apparent poor quality of school science education along with insufficient numbers of well‐qualified teachers have been linked to skills shortages by government and other agencies since at least the time of the Second World War. There is, however, an alternative account that challenges the received view of a skills deficit and questions the evidence for sustained and long‐term shortages across the sector. This paper provides an historical account of some of the main events that have characterised debates over the supply and demand of science and engineering professionals in the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content> and the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">USA</jats:styled-content> and the implications that this has had for science education policy. Starting from the end of the Second World War, the paper looks at the key challenges to the evidence that underpins the shortage debate and considers the consequences that more than seven decades of crisis accounts have had on the recruitment and retention of highly skilled scientists and engineers. The paper shows that while the shortage debate has a long history, it is one that is characterised by poor quality data as well as methodological and conceptual challenges. It argues that there is no consensus view about the existence of a skills deficit and that while there may have been short‐lived shortfalls in specialist areas, there is little evidence in support of widespread and far reaching shortages as the rhetoric often claims.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Information technology has become one of the great advantages of modern enterprises, especially assisting in the optimization, information management and value creation. Among the reasons that prompted this change is the use of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), mainly adopted by large enterprises, since its adoption involves high investment and complexity for implementation, hindering its spread among smaller companies. Several studies have discussed the benefits generated by the adoption of ERP systems in enterprises as well as costs involved in the deployment process. The focus of this research is to present and discuss, through a conceptual approach, these different views on the costs and benefits of these systems, focusing on the different ways of generating value systems that provide information to businesses through ERP. The results showed that the discussion about the value of ERP for companies not yet consolidated and with increasing importance of information systems, ERP was regarded as a strategic tool in the search for greater competitiveness, transcending its value and importance for companies of their internal processes for a relationship of greater importance in business strategy. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Green supply chain management is defined as the process of using environmentally friendly inputs and transforming these inputs into outputs that can be reclaimed and re-used at the end of their life cycle thus, creating a sustainable supply chain. GSCM is one of the recent innovations for the enhancement of capabilities of Supply Chain Management. The purpose of this paper is to carry out a theoretical review of Green supply chain management (GSCM). The assessment involved 144 research articles published in 48 selected journals between 1998 and 2013. The methodology of empirical research involved selection and classification of 144 research articles in GSCM. A systematic classification and a critical analysis is carried out so as to identify research gaps in content of GSCM, as well as to recommend directions for future research. It is concluded from the analysis of the results that research in GSCM is increasing at a faster rate than ever; with theory building more in focus than verification. Furthermore, a new taxonomy was proposed on the basis of content and research methodology utilised. Based on this taxonomy, significant trends were observed and some unique inferences were drawn, apart from identifying the directions for future research. There have been a couple of literature reviews in GSCM but none of them focused exclusively on research methodology in GSCM. Also the sample size with respect to the number of papers (144 papers), as well as number of journals (48 journals), is larger than ever considered for literature review in GSCM. The papers spans a longer time period of 16 years (1998-2013).</jats:p>"

In our models, the market demand is assumed to be affected by the goodwill, reference price, and the advertising investment, in which the advertising investment can promote the construction of goodwill and such goodwill can further enhance the reference price. The results show that the participating members in the supply chain should invest more in advertisement to improve the goodwill and the relative reference price reflected in the minds of consumers. A far-sighted manufacturer will invest more in the advertisement and charge a higher wholesale price regardless of the behavior choice of the retailer. However, such kind of ignorance leads to different results on the retail pricing strategies of the retailer. The numerical analyses are given in the end to verify the effectiveness of the conclusions which provide the theoretical support to the dynamic supply chain coordination in practice.</jats:p>"

They significantly modify stream flow both in quantity and timing as annual basin run-off is enhanced or decreased in years of negative or positive glacier mass balance respectively. Although glacial advances and retreats are a part of its natural cyclic phenomenon, the rate of de-glaciations has accelerated in recent times due to climatic changes and global warming caused by anthropogenic activities. Some of the important glaciers of Himalayas are receding at an alarming rate, which could have dire consequences on river hydrology of the main rivers of this region namely, Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra, initially causing floods and the paradoxically, scarcity of water later. This chapter is an attempt to summarize some of the studies on Himalayan glacier retreats and also to assess its impact on the availability of freshwater in the sub-continent. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The generation of public value by public organizations for citizens, in diverse social and economical topics, has been an object of analysis and strong debates in social sciences and administration and management sciences. New paradigms arisen recently, looking to satisfy economical and social agents' needs, but they hardly combat the lack of efficiency and mainly efficacy perception people have on public initiatives. The concept of public value can be defined as something that improves the life conditions for a community and whose benefits are appreciated by that community. Defining what is valuable for society, and considering this definition to establish the goals and the extent of a public initiative, is one of the toughest challenges in public administration. The results for a specific public initiative must the needs and expectations of society and, at the same time, observe the laws and regulations, and follow the experts' advice. The outcomes and expected value are conditioned by the capability to access information and by the way this information is transmitted to stakeholders. In this article, we propose a questionnaire to identify and map key stakeholders for a specific public initiative, in order to identify and understand the potential interested individuals and groups. This helps public officers to identify the best way to share information with those interested, and to evaluate the generation of public value. By using this questionnaire we were able to identify the key stakeholders for an exports encouragement program in a medium-size city in Brazil, whose vision must be considered to create public value for this public program.</jats:p>"

In the beer industry, recycling bottles can reduce manufacturing cost and the industry’s carbon footprint. This paper presents a model for a collection‐distribution center location and allocation problem in a closed‐loop supply chain for the beer industry under a fuzzy random environment, in which the objectives are to minimize total costs and transportation pollution. Both random and fuzzy uncertainties, for which return rate and disposal rate are considered fuzzy random variables, are jointly handled in this paper to ensure a more practical problem solution. A heuristic algorithm based on priority‐based global‐local‐neighbor particle swarm optimization (pb‐glnPSO) is applied to ensure reliable solutions for this NP‐hard problem. A beer company case study is given to illustrate the application of the proposed model and to demonstrate the priority‐based global‐local‐neighbor particle swarm optimization.</jats:p>",

The chapter proposes a structural equation model that integrates three latent variables. The two independent latent variables concern preproduction green attributes and process green attributes, and they are associated with a dependent latent variable: marketing indexes. Thus, three hypotheses are proposed to relate these latent variables. To validate such hypotheses, a survey is administered to 253 middle and senior managers from the manufacturing industry of Ciudad Juárez. Similarly, a descriptive analysis of the sample and the items is carried out. Results show direct and positive effects among the analyzed variables. However, the highest impact is caused by preproduction green attributes over production process green attributes. </jats:p>"

In air-quality experiments, we found that the air change rate (ACR) in shops can be reduced significantly, while still maintaining acceptable air quality. Dilution curves of typical odour-intensive retail goods were measured, which show that ACRs can be reduced down to 1.75 h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> without impacting odour perception significantly. Then, the standard ventilation systems were replaced by air–water systems, namely active chilled beams, which allow for a combined supply of fresh air and heat removal via the water circuit. To realize low ACRs in the shops, experimental studies for developing high-induction active chilled beam systems are presented. Finally, CFD simulations were conducted in a generic shop. Aspects like room air flow, odour propagation and thermal comfort were investigated. The cold water supply was assumed to be generated in a renewable way, leading to high cold water supply temperatures. Feasible ventilation configurations with ACRs as low as 1.1 h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> have been identified without deteriorating either air quality or thermal comfort. Primary energy consumption was assessed according to German standards and was reduced by up to 67% with the presented approach. </jats:p>",

However, there has been no examination of the effectiveness of this strategy. </jats:p><jats:p> Objective: The present study investigated the association between dementia and the discharge destination of patients in psychiatric hospitals. </jats:p><jats:p> Methods: Data from the National Patient Survey, which is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of inpatient care, were used. The 96,420 patients with dementia or other mental illness who were discharged from psychiatric hospitals in September of every 3 years from 1996 to 2014 were included in analyses. </jats:p><jats:p> Results: Of the 96,420 discharged patients, 13,823 had dementia as the primary disease. Of the 13,823 dementia patients, 3,865 (28.0%) were discharged to home, 3,870 (28.0%) were admitted to a facility or other care settings, 3,574 (25.9%) were admitted to another hospital, and 2,514 (18.2%) died. Patients were more likely to die in psychiatric hospital if their primary disease was dementia, and they had resided in a region that provided fewer home visits for psychiatric nursing care or had available a larger number of psychiatric hospital beds per capita. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusion: Psychiatric inpatient care may be ineffective as a treatment for the challenging behaviors of dementia. A community mental health system for behavior management should be constructed in parallel with a reduction in the number of hospital beds allotted for psychiatric care. </jats:p>",

The accuracy of numerical simulation using the CFD approach could be significantly affected by configurations of the inlet boundary conditions, turbulence model, etc. The core of this study was to assess whether conclusions achieved in simulation of airflow on usual surfaces in buildings like in commercial offices could be applicable to aircraft cabins. Comparative studies involving turbulence models or air supply opening models in aircraft cabin environment are still absent in the literature. Therefore, in this study, two turbulence models (the renormalization group (RNG) k-ɛ model and Reynolds-stress model) and three types of air supply opening models (simple open model, basic model and momentum model) were applied to simulate the airflow and contaminant concentration fields in a mockup seven-row cabin section. Our simulation results were compared with the experimental data. Six indexes based on different criteria were used to quantitatively evaluate the agreement between measurements and modelled results given by turbulence models and air supply opening models. The results show that the RNG k-ɛ and RSM turbulence models have similar accuracy in airflow and contaminant fields in the mockup cabin, and the momentum model has the best accuracy among the three air supply opening models for the aircraft cabin environment. </jats:p>",

However, many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) still are resource-constrained, lacking adequate information and facing problems to establish and manage relationships to operate in a sustainable way in international markets. Despite receiving some support from governments and from other institutional entities, these difficulties faced by SMEs call for a stronger support, which can be played by industrial enterprises associations (IEAs). This chapter brings the perspective of five different companies that are associated with IEAs. The main objective is to have their opinion about the role of IEAs as information managers and promoters of collaborations, mainly for internationalization processes. Another objective is to understand the acceptance by these companies regarding the use of collaborative platforms, managed by IEAs, for supporting their information and collaboration management activities.</jats:p>"

The aim of the exposition is to provide greater understanding for those responsible of the supply chain, and focus efforts on clear objectives. These clear objectives should help those responsible for the supply chain achieve a better performance within organizations. The information analyzed was obtained from a questionnaire provided to 284 managers in companies located in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The results were used to generate a structural equation model in order to learn the relationships between variables. We have postulated six hypotheses regarding the direct, indirect and total effects. The results indicate that there is no direct relationship between ICT integration and SC performance, but an indirect relationship through mediating variables as SC Integration and Flexibility exists. </jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to minimize the total cost for cultivation and harvesting, infrastructure, the storage process, bioethanol production, and transportation. Strategic decisions, including the number and location of intermodal facilities and biorefineries, and tactical decisions, such as the amount of biomass shipped, processed, and converted into bioethanol, were validated by using North Dakota as a case study. It was found that the multimodal transport scenario was more cost effective than a single mode of transport (truck) and resulted in a lower cost for bioethanol. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to demonstrate the impact of key factors in the decision to use multimodal transport in a switchgrass-based bioethanol supply chain and on the cost of bioethanol. </jats:p>",

Coding theories that describe neural electrical activity by the roles of action potential timing or frequency have been thoroughly studied. However, an alternative method to study coding questions is the energy method, which is more global and economical. In this study, we clearly defined and calculated neural energy supply and consumption based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model, during firing action potentials and subthreshold activities using ion-counting and power-integral model. Furthermore, we analyzed energy properties of each ion channel and found that, under the two circumstances, power synchronization of ion channels and energy utilization ratio have significant differences. This is particularly true of the energy utilization ratio, which can rise to above 100% during subthreshold activity, revealing an overdraft property of energy use. These findings demonstrate the distinct status of the energy properties during neuronal firings and subthreshold activities. Meanwhile, after introducing a synapse energy model, this research can be generalized to energy calculation of a neural network. This is potentially important for understanding the relationship between dynamical network activities and cognitive behaviors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article considers the key issue in optimizing the activities of the enterprise, which is the construction of its production program taking into account the most rational use of enterprise resources. This causes a number of significant changes in the field of logistics of production for the successful development of the enterprise, which will largely depend not only on the marketing strategy, but also on the purchase of products it needs. It is shown that there is a need to implement new approaches to the organization and management of processes of material support of production, provided that the timely provision of production with material resources depends on the size and completeness of production stocks in warehouses, and the creation of such stocks allows the release of materials in accordance with the requirements of the technological process. It is shown that when managing production or inventories there are two main questions: when to replenish the stock and what should be its optimal size, given that stocks require certain costs for their storage until they are sold. At the same time, the company's losses increase primarily due to the fact that part of working capital is invested in inventories. It is proved that in each case it is important to build a mathematical model describing the studied system, and on its basis to find the optimal ratio between costs and benefits of the selected level of stocks and determine what stocks for each group of goods or raw materials are sufficient. The methods used to ensure the necessary conditions for effective management of material flows are presented: deterministic calculation methods (used in the calculation of secondary demand for materials according to the known primary); analytical methods (calculation is based on the product specification); synthetic methods (provides for calculations for each group of parts based on the degree of their applicability at individual levels of the hierarchy); stochastic calculation methods (allow to establish the expected need on the basis of numerical data that characterize its changes over a period of time); approximation methods, exponential smoothing method and regression analysis. The problem is considered when the consumption of raw materials in the main production is a random variable with some intensity, provided that raw materials are systematically supplied to cover costs. It is assumed that the value of the optimal value, which determines the absence of shortage and balance of raw materials, and the total consumption of raw materials is equal to the volume of its supply - has a gamma distribution with parameters of the supply of raw materials in conventional units of cost and intensity of raw materials. hour in conventional units of value. The flow of events with a constant intensity of raw material costs in conventional units of cost per hour is considered, and the random variable is the time required for the occurrence of a given number of events (volume of raw material supply). A period of time has been found, given a specific volume of supply and a given intensity, when there will be no shortage of raw materials in production.</jats:p>"

In urban residential areas, excess off-street parking can coexist with on-street parking congestion because of restrictions in parking access, nonmarket pricing, and other factors. This paper examines the potential for shared parking to address such an imbalance in parking supply by using a case study of the West End, a high-density residential neighborhood in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The West End’s residential parking permit (RPP) program has faced parking shortages and congestion, with on-street parking consistently reaching 90% occupancy. At the same time, off-street residential parking facilities in the neighborhood have occupancy rates consistently less than 50%. This analysis uses the inventory and occupancy data for off- and on-street parking stalls to investigate the impacts of making off-street stalls available to RPP users in a shared-parking program. Results showed that on-street parking congestion could be greatly reduced by introducing a relatively small number of off-street stalls from select residential buildings to the RPP program. Methods to unlock currently underutilized off-street parking supply are also discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Indus Plains of Pakistan are situated in arid to semi-arid climate where monsoon rains are erratic and mostly fall in the months of July and August. These rains are not only insufficient to grow even a single crop without artificial irrigation but also cause flood havoc very frequently that is associated with the climate change. The Indus river transports water for agriculture, industry and domestic usage within the basin and downstream. The Indus Basin is among the few basins severely affected by global warming and resulting climate change. The alteration in temporal and spatial patterns of rainfall has resulted in unexpected drought and floods. About 70 to 80% of total river flows occur in summer season due to snow melt and monsoonal rainfalls. Lack of storage reservoirs has decreased the ability to regulate flood water as well as its potential use during the drought season along with cheap hydro-electricity generation. The sedimentation in the system has limited the storage capacity of the existing three reservoirs by 28%. Consequently carry over capacity of these storage structures is only 30 days compared to 120 to 220 days in India and 900 days in Colorado Basin. Pakistan is facing shortage of good quality water due to competition among agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, this scenario will continue rather will further aggravate in future. According to the climate change scenario, the warming is reflected in the river-flow data of Pakistan, especially during the past 2-3 decades. To bridge the gap between fresh water availability and demand, ground water is being pumped to meet the irrigation requirements of crops. The pumped ground water (70-80%) is brackish and could become a sustainability issue in the long run. The prolonged agricultural uses of such water will deteriorate soils, crops and human living environments. Water quality parameters usually considered include electrical conductivity (EC) for total soluble salts, and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and residual sodium carbonate (RSC) reflect the sodicity hazards. In order to limit or even to eliminate adverse effects of such waters, certain treatment and/or management options are considered as important pre-requisites. For bringing down high concentration of total soluble salts, dilution with good quality water is the doable practice. To decrease high SAR of irrigation water, a source of calcium is needed, dilution (with good quality water) will decrease SAR by the square root times of the dilution factor, while use of acids will be cost-intensive rather may adversely impact the soil health. For high RSC, dilution with low CO32-+HCO3- water will serve the purpose, addition of Ca-salts will raise Ca2++Mg2+ to bring a decrease in water RSC, while acids will neutralize CO32-+HCO3- to lower water RSC. Gypsum is the most economical and safe amendment while acids could also decrease RSC but at higher relative cost. City wastewater and seed priming in aerated gypsum solution is also presented. Such practices at small and/or large scale surely will help a lot to sustain the food security and the environment in the days to come where climate change has to be experienced round the world. Therefore, a well-coordinated program is necessary to create awareness among different sections of the society including the policy makers, general public, organizations, industrialists and farmers. </jats:p>"

The Russian market development of intermodal transport occurs with low speed. It should be noted that low competitiveness of container transport prevents the development of intermodal delivery method within Russia. In addition, this factor stops implementing national transit potential of transport corridors passing through the territory of the country. To date the delivery chains formation is perceived as a secondary process, which provides the scope for production sector and delivers the finished product to the consumer. However, it is the intensive development of intermodal technologies that remains an economic security guarantee and a reserve for increasing the product competitiveness opposed to the rate of finished products production. As a result, the method development of intermodal supply chains formation at large industrial enterprises appears very important. The paper deals with a model and algorithm of forming a system of intermodal cargo delivery chains of the metallurgical enterprises. We performed calculation of the potential economic benefits from their introduction.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change and wastewater control are one of the foremost demanding situations for Indian cities. Urbanization and unparalleled growth of cities across India continue to create immense pressure on land and water resources. This uncontrolled growth continues to produce growing volumes of wastewater. Climate change, impacts inclusive of, intense storm events in summer time or extended moist periods in wintry weather are quite visible in India. In urban and peri-urban areas, wastewater use for agriculture is an emerging precedence. Due to susceptible enforcement of regulatory, most of the wastewater generated is permitted off untreated/ partially treated. While many previous studies have checked out the global modifications and associated impacts of climatic variations on water resources, few have targeted at the evaluation of the particular effects and adaptation priorities for water systems in towns. Proper reuse of wastewater for irrigation will significantly lessen the shortage, offer a sustainable water source, improving farming productiveness, lessen pollution, generate livelihood potential for low earnings city households along with contributing to their each day food needs. There are tradeoffs which need to understand which includes problems to individual's health, and surroundings. Through suitable treatment methods, water users' cooperatives, policy shift and the introduction of market based approaches, treated wastewater use in agriculture can be enhanced and all associated risks can also be curtailed. This chapter focuses on use of treated urban wastewater and its management for agriculture in selected Indian cities. </jats:p>"

This paper presents a System Dynamic Model for simulating the interaction between demand and supply of railway express freight system in China. The model consists of three submodels including economic environment, demand, supply, and investment, and its validity is verified by running in Vensim DDS software using historical data. In the simulation of period 2000–2025, the three variables are taken as control variables including growth rate of the national economy, railway express freight rate, and investment in fixed railway assets. Three scenarios for each control variable are simulated, and their effects are analyzed to provide beneficial reference for regulating the demand‐supply gap of railway express freight. The simulation demonstrated that raising freight rate, adding investment in fixed railway assets, and decelerating economic growth rate are all effective ways to shrink the demand‐supply gap of railway express freight. The model can be used to forecast the transport demand of railway express freight and test the outcomes of demand‐supply regulating measures.</jats:p>",

In China, dental education reform has been underway with a view to providing an inclusive basic medical service package to the whole country by 2020. It is also estimated that the number of Korean dental medicine students in China would be fewer. And most of them desire to get a job in China after acquiring the Chinese license, suggesting little prospect of a massive inflow into Korea in the near future. In Japan, students are required to complete a clinical training program for over 1 year after receiving licenses to become an independent practitioner. But they can apply for the Korean preliminary examination without this post-graduation process. For this reason, the quality issue in license effectiveness review has been seriously discussed. It is deemed desirable to limit the Korean accreditation to Japanese graduates from the dental schools certified by the Japanese dental accreditation body.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The hospitality industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. The growth of this industry has been accompanied by issues of sustainability development. Employees expect firms to have the ability to address their negative impacts on the environment and society. However, firms are generally unable to reach such expectations due to an inability to acquire feedback from employees, which leads to employee dissatisfaction. In addition, there has been a lack in the theoretical linkage between employee engagement and sustainability development. Thus, this study determines the critical factors of employee engagement based on big data (using social media and quantitative and qualitative data) and integrates such data by using decision-making tests and laboratory evaluation methods to identify these interrelationships. The findings reveal that sustainability development can be enhanced through aggressive employee engagement, which also can generate a positive influence on economic performance. A detailed discussion is also presented. </jats:p>"

By introducing a second‐order stochastic dominance (SSD) constraint, we can describe the preference consistency of the risk taker while minimizing the expected cost of company. To solve this problem, we convert it into a one‐stage stochastic model equivalently; then we use sample average approximation (SAA) method to approximate the expected values of the underlying random functions. A smoothing approach is proposed with which we can get the global solution and avoid introducing new variables and constraints. Meanwhile, we investigate the convergence of an optimal value from solving the transformed model and show that, with probability approaching one at exponential rate, the optimal value converges to its counterpart as the sample size increases. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and analysis.</jats:p>",

These dams with proper retrofitting exercises could be a potential hydropower cum direct water supply reservoir operation. The change in operation does not only berth well with current trend of dual or multipurpose functions of the reservoir scheme but also in light of emerging role of hydropower as a mature and steady source of renewable energy. These dams were assessed for retrofitting with turbine to generate hydroelectricity and at the same time, to supply raw water to both water supply schemes. Despite the advantages of this dual function of the existing reservoirs schemes, this study however concludes infeasible tasks as only less than 1 MW of firm power can be harnessed. To reconfigure these existing infrastructures for purpose other than for the single purpose of water supply requires optimum storage capacity and hydraulic head, the two most important variables, in essence, especially for viable hydropower generation. In addition, the height of the dam dictates critically the magnitude of effective head but unfortunately unavailable readily for most of the existing dams evaluated in this Study. They are less than 60 m in height in general. The design philosophy for the reservoir schemes at their preliminary conceptualization also does not support future multipurpose components of the reservoir operation. However a positive development of these potential schemes could be beneficial to supply power to the local community in the surrounding areas in additional to plant consumption.</jats:p>"

We consider a two-level household appliance supply chain system consisting of a manufacturer with an Internet channel and a retailer with a traditional channel and an Internet channel. Each channel’s price-setting follows the bounded rational decision process in order to obtain the optimal profit or more market share. Considering that the price competition often leads to the demand and order fluctuation, we also investigate the bullwhip effect of the multichannel supply chains on the basis of the order-up-to-inventory policy. From the numerical simulation, we find a system in a chaotic state will suffer larger bullwhip effect than a stable system, and the manufacturer’s Internet channel is helpful to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Our results provide some useful managerial inspirations for the household manufacturer and retailers. Firstly, each channel should make their retail price with a suitable price adjustment speed in the stable region, and each time pricing cannot exceed the domain of attraction. Secondly, the manufacturer can adopt a more radical pricing strategy in their Internet channel to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Thirdly, the price adjustment should be reviewed and be appropriately reduced if the price adjustment is too large.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the increasing awareness of global warming and environmental protection, many practitioners and researchers have paid much attention to the low‐carbon supply chain management in recent years. Green supplier selection is one of the most critical activities in the low‐carbon supply chain management, so it is important to establish the comprehensive criteria and develop a method for green supplier selection in low‐carbon supply chain. The paper proposes a fuzz‐grey multicriteria decision making approach to deal with these problems. First, the paper establishes 4 main criteria and 22 subcriteria for green supplier selection. Then, a method integrating fuzzy set theory and grey relational analysis is proposed. It uses the membership function of normal distribution to compare each supplier and uses grey relation analysis to calculate the weight of each criterion and improves fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The proposed method can make the localization of individual green supplier more objectively and more accurately in the same trade. Finally, a case study in the steel industry is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</jats:p>",

Namely, a literature review selected of 188 articles, published between January 1994 and November 2016, helps identify the most influential success factors. The qualitative data analysis pertains to fifteen such successes, identified in the literature review and through our collaboration with other academic researchers and industrial specialists. Notably, the study’s qualitative data analysis, interpretive structural modeling (ISM), unconceals the mutual impact among the most prominent SSCM success factors. The economic benefits and environmental awareness of suppliers are recognized as the most significant success factors, which could allow business enterprises and other organizations to implement a SSCM framework, with intentionality and the sustainability in their business.

The adoption of management practices based on accurate market and organization information are key factors for the definition of strategies for the sustainable development. The ability to see important issues in the chain of value is crucial to identify the most important factors for success, to anticipate the competition and to have pro-active management instead of reacting to market pressures (Thomas, Krishnamoorthy, Singh &amp; Venkateswaran, 2015). In this context, considering the consequences of information systems on company results and their contribution for social and economic development, the authors have carried out research in the fashion accessories industry so as to enlarge knowledge on the subject. Here the industry is characterized in Limeira, São Paulo, Brazil, referring to the contribution of this sector in the economy. Then, the relevance of the information systems integration in the production in the value chain and the challenges and problems needed to be overcome by small companies is analyzed using a focus group technique with SMEs directors and managers. Finally, the main results are discussed, summarized and directions for further research are formulated. This study aimed to analyze the purpose of Sindijóias, industry union, to the creation of an intelligence center to support the competitiveness of the accessory jewelry companies. It also provides a knowledge proposal and possible solutions for companies and a contribution of academic value due to the lack of research in the area. </jats:p>"

Although Otto Warburg first described aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells &gt;90 years ago, the primary purpose of this metabolic switch remains controversial. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway requires glucose and glutamine for de novo synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, a sugar-nucleotide that inhibits receptor endocytosis and signaling by promoting N-acetylglucosamine branching of Asn (N)-linked glycans. Here, we report that aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis co-operatively reduce UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis and N-glycan branching in mouse T cell blasts by starving the hexosamine pathway of glucose and glutamine. This drives growth and pro-inflammatory TH17 over anti-inflammatory-induced T regulatory (iTreg) differentiation, the latter by promoting endocytic loss of IL-2 receptor-α (CD25). Thus, a primary function of aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis is to co-operatively limit metabolite supply to N-glycan biosynthesis, an activity with widespread implications for autoimmunity and cancer.</jats:p>"

In this model, the collection point coverage rate is introduced to adjust the e-waste recycling rate dynamically. Aiming at a recycling mode dominated by the third party of the closed-loop supply chain, the article mainly discusses the impact on the sales rate and market share of the recycling model by third-party enterprises and compares the total revenue of all supply chains.

For three different cooperative abatement situations, we considered the supplier driven model, the manufacturer driven model, and the equilibrium game model. We investigated the influence of mixed carbon policy with constraint of reduction targets on supply chain price, productivity, profits, carbon emissions reduction rate, and so on. The results showed that (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><mml:mrow><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>) high-strength carbon policies do not necessarily encourage enterprises to effectively reduce emissions, and increasing market acceptance of low carbon products or raising the price of carbon quota can promote the benign reduction; (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"><mml:mrow><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>) perfect competitive carbon market has a higher carbon reduction efficiency than oligarch carbon market, but their optimal level of cooperation is the same and the realized reduction rate is in line with the intensity of carbon policy; (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M5\"><mml:mrow><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>) the policy sensitivity of the carbon trading mechanism is stronger than the carbon tax; “paid quota mechanism” can subsidize the cost of abatement and improve reduction initiative.

Here, we present GrowScreen-PaGe, a non-invasive, high-throughput phenotyping system (4 plants min–1) based on flat germination paper. GrowScreen-PaGe allows the acquisition of time series of the developing root systems of 500 plants, thereby enabling to quantify short-term variations in root system. The choice of germination paper was found to be crucial and paper ☓ root interaction should be considered when comparing data from different studies on germination paper. The system is suitable for phenotyping dicot and monocot plant species. The potential of the system for high-throughput phenotyping was shown by investigating phenotypic diversity of root traits in a collection of 180 rapeseed accessions and of 52 barley genotypes grown under control and nutrient-starved conditions. Most traits showed a large variation linked to both genotype and treatment. In general, root length traits contributed more than shape and branching related traits in separating the genotypes. Overall, results showed that GrowScreen-PaGe will be a powerful resource to investigate root systems and root plasticity of large sets of plants and to explore the molecular and genetic root traits of various species including for crop improvement programs.</jats:p>"

However, due to its characteristics such as seasonality, low density, and high cost, the biomass supply chain needs further optimization to become more competitive in the current energetic market. In this sense and taking into consideration the fact that the transportation is the process that accounts for the higher parcel in the biomass supply chain costs, this work proposes a multilayer model predictive control based strategy to improve the performance of this process at the operational level. The proposed strategy aims to improve the overall supply chain performance by forecasting the system evolution using behavioural dynamic models. In this way, it is possible to react beforehand and avoid expensive impacts in the tasks execution. The methodology is composed of two interconnected levels that closely monitor the system state update, in the operational level, and delineate a new routing and scheduling plan in case of an expected deviation from the original one. By applying this approach to an experimental case study, the concept of the proposed methodology was proven. This novel strategy enables the online scheduling of the supply chain transport operation using a predictive approach.</jats:p>"

This paper develops an evaluation model for parking policies using system dynamics. A quantitative study is conducted to examine the effects of parking charge and supply policy on traffic speed. The model, which is composed of three interrelated subsystems, first summarizes the travel cost of each travel mode and then calibrates the travel choice model through the travel mode subsystem. Finally, the subsystem that evaluates the state of traffic forecasts future car speed based on bureau of public roads (BPR) function and generates new travel cost until the entire model reaches a steady state. The accuracy of the model is verified in Hangzhou Wulin business district. The related error of predicted speed is only 2.2%. The results indicate that the regular pattern of traffic speed and parking charge can be illustrated using the proposed model based on system dynamics, and the model infers that reducing the parking supply in core area will increase its congestion level and, under certain parking supply conditions, there exists an interval of possible pricing at which the service reaches a level that is fairly stable.</jats:p>"

The formation was deposited along a proximal-distal gradient on this ramp affected by synsedimentary fault movements. A sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical study was conducted to decipher the distribution patterns of sedimentary parameters along such a depth increase over the ramp. It comes out that smectite distribution unexpectedly mimics the lateral depth evolution despite the good floatability of the mineral. It is also observed that the Argiles de Châtillon could accumulate noticeable amounts of organic matter in spite of paleoenvironmental conditions that were not specifically prone to organic matter preservation and burial (sedimentation rate, mineral particle grain size, productivity, oxygenation level…). Conversely, reactive iron, when being present in limited abundance, must have allowed sulfide ions to react with organic molecules instead of forming iron sulfides, which fostered organic matter preservation and accumulation. This protecting role of organic sulfide incorporation (additional to other favorable factors) cannot exist if reactive iron is relatively abundant. Lastly, our results (still fragmentary) suggest that smectite minerals could carry reactive iron, which would have occasionally hampered organic-matter preservation.</jats:p>"

Deep basins along the continental shelf harbour high abundance of diapausing C. finmarchicus during the summer and fall. In Wilkinson Basin in the western Gulf of Maine, C. finmarchicus has persisted in large concentrations despite recent significant warming that could potentially threaten the existence of the population in this region. Identifying the major source of diapausing individuals is critical to the understanding of mechanisms that allow population persistence. In this study, Lagrangian tracking experiments using an individual-based copepod life cycle model and simulation of environmental conditions during an exceptionally warm year (2012) suggest that coastal waters are the major upstream source for individuals entering dormancy in Wilkinson Basin over summertime, although pathways and distribution patterns vary with the release timing of particles. Both model results and observation data support the Coastal Amplification of Supply and Transport (CAST) hypothesis as an explanation for the persistence of C. finmarchicus population in the western Gulf of Maine. The mechanism involves the coastal amplification of supply (spring reproduction/summer growth in the food-rich coastal region) and transport to the receiving Wilkinson Basin that is capable of harbouring the diapausing stock.</jats:p>",

This emerging need to quantify environmental impacts from agricultural production creates an opportunity for collaboration with the scientific community. Without such collaboration, sustainability efforts risk failure by adopting unrealistic goals or misguided approaches. This commentary explores the role of science in Field to Market, a nonprofit organization developing a sustainability program for US commodity crops, and highlights opportunities to address emerging science challenges. We evaluate changes over the past 35 years in key environmental impacts of crop production used to inform land managers as well as companies that are committed to improvements. Achieving improvements will only be possible if three key gaps are addressed regarding available simulation models and data, scale of implementation and uncertainty, and effectiveness of conservation practices. Filling these gaps presents an opportunity for dialogue between scientists, farmers, and private‐sector stakeholders to advance scientific knowledge and promote the common objective of sustainable agriculture.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Meanwhile, the suppliers face yield uncertainty and the manufacturers face uncertain production costs that are private information. While the suppliers compete on price, the manufacturers compete on quantity. We build a stylized multistage game theoretic model to analyze the issue of vertical cost-information sharing (VCIS) within the supply chain by considering key parameters, including the level of yield uncertainty, two manufacturers’ cost correlation, the correlated coefficient of suppliers’ yield processes, and the number of suppliers. We study the suppliers’ optimal wholesale price and the manufacturers’ optimal order quantities under different VCIS strategies. Finally, through numerical analyses, we examine how key parameters affect the value of VCIS to each supplier and each manufacturer, respectively. We found that the manufacturers are willing to share cost information with suppliers only when the two manufacturers’ cost correlation is less than a threshold. While a high correlated coefficient of suppliers’ yield processes and a large number of suppliers promote complete information sharing, a high level of yield uncertainty hinders complete information sharing. All these findings have important implications to industry practices.</jats:p>"

Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the models and to provide managerial insights for decision makers. The results show that it would be beneficial for the whole supply chain when the warranty services are introduced into the market, and the firm which provides the warranty service has the advantage in holding more dominant position.</jats:p>"

The Sustainable Development Goal 6 (i.e. ‘ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’) addresses the issues relating to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene. It is unclear which Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) promotional approach is the most effective for sanitation and hygiene behaviour change, and other outcomes leading to behaviour change (e.g. learning outcomes) or longer term outcomes that follow from behaviour change (e.g. mortality, morbidity).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>OBJECTIVES</jats:title><jats:p>The overall goal of this systematic review is to show which promotional approaches are effective in changing handwashing and sanitation behaviour, and which implementation factors affect the success or failure of such interventions. This goal is achieved by answering two different review questions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Question 1</jats:bold>: What is the effectiveness of different approaches for promoting handwashing and sanitation behaviour change, in communities in low‐ and middle‐income countries?</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Question 2</jats:bold>: What factors influence the implementation of approaches to promote handwashing and sanitation behaviour change, in communities in low‐ and middle‐income countries?</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>SEARCH METHODS</jats:title><jats:p>A comprehensive search was conducted to identify both published and unpublished studies. Using a sensitive search strategy, we searched the following databases from 1980 to March 2016: Medline (PubMed), Cochrane CENTRAL Issue 2, Applied Social Sciences index and abstracts (ASSIA, ProQuest), Global Health (CABI), EMBASE (OVID), PsycInfo (EBSCOHost), ERIC (EBSCOHost), Global Index Medicus, 3ie Impact Evaluation Database, International bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS, ProQuest), Sociological abstracts (ProQuest) and Social Sciences citation index (SSCI, Web of Science). To find unpublished material and relevant programme documents, we contacted various research groups and organizations and/or checked the relevant websites.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>SELECTION CRITERIA</jats:title><jats:p>Participants included both children and adults from low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), as defined by the World Bank, at the time the intervention was implemented. Studies performed at an individual, household, school or community level were included, whereas studies conducted in institutional settings (e.g. hospitals) were excluded. The following promotional approaches or elements to promote handwashing, latrine use, safe faeces disposal, and to discourage open defecation (primary outcomes), were included: community‐based approaches, social marketing approaches, sanitation and hygiene messaging and elements of psychosocial theory. Secondary outcomes of interest were behavioural factors (knowledge, skills, attitude, norms, self‐regulation) and health outcomes (morbidity, mortality).</jats:p><jats:p>For<jats:styled-content>Question 1 (effectiveness of promotional approaches)</jats:styled-content>, we included impact evaluations using an experimental, quasi‐experimental design and observational analytical studies. To answer<jats:styled-content>Question 2 (implementation aspects)</jats:styled-content>, all qualitative study designs addressing factors influencing implementation of the promotional approaches were considered for inclusion. This included, for example, grounded theory, case studies, phenomenological studies, ethnographic research, action research and thematic approaches to qualitative data analysis.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS</jats:title><jats:p>Study selection and data extraction (including risk of bias assessment) were performed independently by two reviewers, using EPPI‐Reviewer software. Study authors of all included papers were contacted by email (in July 2016) to ask for any relevant information, related to the population, intervention or outcomes, that was missing or not reported in the paper. Any disagreements between the two data extractors were resolved through discussion, or by consulting another review co‐author. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to assess the overall quality/certainty of evidence from quantitative studies included in this review. The qualitative studies were assessed using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Program) checklist. Evidence relating to Question 1 (effectiveness of promotional approaches) was synthesized in a quantitative way (meta‐analysis), where possible.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title><jats:p>Forty‐two quantitative studies and 28 qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. The quantitative studies were conducted in LMICs worldwide, with the majority of the studies in South Asia and Sub‐Saharan Africa. Most quantitative studies (69%) were performed in a rural setting and only 14% of the studies took place in an urban setting (with an additional 10% in an “informal‐rural setting”). The effect of a promotional approach versus not using a promotional approach on sanitation and handwashing behaviour change, behavioural factors (knowledge, skills, attitude, norms and self‐regulation) and health‐related outcomes (morbidity and mortality), was studied in 34 different studies. In addition, 7 studies compared specific promotional approaches versus other promotional approaches, and one study compared two different communication strategies. All studies showed substantial variability in programme content, study types, outcome types, methods of outcome measurement and timing of measurement.</jats:p><jats:p>Risk of bias assessments of included studies were influenced by unclear reporting or lack of reporting of key methodological aspects of the study design and process. Five percent of the experimental studies (n=2) had a high risk of selection bias, 40% had a high risk of detection bias (n=17), 28% had a high risk of attrition bias (n=12) and 48% had a high risk of reporting bias (n=20). Most quasi‐experimental and observational studies had bias in the selection of participants, some were at high risk of confounding, methods of outcome assessment were not comparable across intervention groups, and outcome assessors were aware of the interventions that the groups received. For the body of evidence, in most assessments, the certainty of evidence was considered as ‘low’ and in some cases ‘moderate’ or ‘very low’. For the qualitative studies, an overall CASP score was given to the studies, and only 21% of the studies had a score less than 8/10. In studies with a lower score the relationship between researcher and participants was not adequately considered or ethical issues were not explicitly reported.</jats:p><jats:p>We categorised the studies into 4 categories of promotional approaches or elements:</jats:p><jats:p>(1)<jats:bold>community‐based approaches</jats:bold>, a promotional approach where there is typically community involvement and engagement, and shared decision‐making is part of the approach. All but one study in this category implemented a sanitation intervention, in some cases combined with a handwashing with soap and/or water supply/water quality component.</jats:p><jats:p>(2)<jats:bold>social marketing approaches</jats:bold>, a promotional approach combining enterprise approaches with demand stimulation, and assuming that people both want and are able to change their behaviour. All but two studies in this category implemented a handwashing with soap intervention, in some cases combined with a sanitation and/or water supply/water quality component.</jats:p><jats:p>(3)<jats:bold>sanitation and hygiene messaging</jats:bold>, is a predominantly directive educational approach, consisting mainly of one‐way communication, designed to help individuals and communities improve their health, by increasing their knowledge and/or skills. All but one study in this category implemented a handwashing with soap intervention, in some cases combined with a sanitation and/or water supply/water quality component.</jats:p><jats:p>(4)<jats:bold>elements of psychosocial theory</jats:bold>, which are derived from a formal psychosocial theory and form the basis of the intervention. All but one study in this category implemented a handwashing‐only intervention, and one study implemented a combined handwashing and sanitation intervention.</jats:p><jats:p>The most consistent results were obtained within the category of<jats:bold>community‐based approaches</jats:bold>, where at least a sanitation component was part of the programme. Working in a community‐based way may be effective in terms of handwashing with soap, and sanitation outcomes (latrine use, safe faeces disposal, and open defecation). Limited positive results on the knowledge of key handwashing times were found. Influencing factors that could play a specific role in the implementation of community‐based interventions are: a facilitator (e.g. health promoter, community leader) that is part of and representative of the community, the attitude of the implementer/facilitator, providing enough information, and creating a culture of cooperation. In addition, the gender of the facilitator seems to play an important role, since women prefer to discuss private issues with somebody of the same sex.</jats:p><jats:p>The use of<jats:bold>social marketing approaches</jats:bold>seems to be less uniformly applicable, and mainly show an effect on sanitation outcomes when interventions have a combined handwashing and sanitation component. A specific barrier that could play a role in the implementation of social marketing interventions was the use of sanitation loans (slow and expensive process, not reaching the poor and people with lack of financial knowledge). Additional income generation would be an important facilitator for this type of approach.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Sanitation and hygiene messaging</jats:bold>, with a focus on handwashing with soap, seem to have an effect on handwashing programmes immediately after the intervention has ended. However, these effects are not sustainable in the long term. This type of promotional approach may make little or no difference to sanitation outcomes. With this approach it seems key that messages are delivered using active teaching methods and that messaging is innovative and culturally sensitive. In case of school level interventions with children, the duration of the intervention and involving the children's parents seem to be positive influencing factors.</jats:p><jats:p>Using<jats:bold>elements of psychosocial theory</jats:bold>in a small‐scale handwashing promotion intervention, or adding theory‐based elements such as infrastructure promotion or public commitment to an existing promotional approach, seems promising for handwashing with soap.</jats:p><jats:p>Finally, the methods used for communicating the content of a certain promotional approach, also play a role, and use of interpersonal communication was shown to be effective in certain circumstances.</jats:p><jats:p>We only found a limited number of studies that incorporated a range of incentives (from soap bars to food or subsidies) into the promotional approach. One study reported promising results when using subsidies as part of the community‐based approach, but more research on the use of subsidies and incentives would be valuable.</jats:p><jats:p>None of the promotional approaches described in the review showed consistent effects on behavioural factors such as knowledge, skills and attitude. Also no consistent effects on health were demonstrated.</jats:p><jats:p>Facilitators which were relevant across different promotional approaches were: length of the approach, visit frequency, using short communication messages, availability of training materials, funding/resources and partnerships, kindness and respect of the implementer, accessibility of the implementer, and the implementer's authority/status; as well as, on the side of the recipient, awareness about costs and benefits, social capital, access to infrastructure and availability of space, and others showing the behaviour.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS</jats:title><jats:p><jats:bold>Implications for policy and practice.</jats:bold>Based on our findings, promotional approaches aimed at handwashing and sanitation behaviour change can be effective in terms of handwashing with soap, latrine use, safe faeces disposal and open defecation. Findings from experimental, quasi‐experimental design and observational analytical studies show that a combination of different promotional elements is probably the most effective strategy. The recognition of different barriers and facilitators that influence the implementation of these promotional approaches may have a triggering effect on its effectiveness.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Implications for research</jats:bold>. An important implication of our work is that there is an urgent need to use a more uniform method of outcome measurement (type of outcomes, way of assessment, timing of assessment). This will facilitate making conclusions on the effects of promotional approaches in the future. In addition, it is important to further assess barriers and facilitators, identified in this review, alongside quantitative analyses of promotional approaches.</jats:p></jats:sec></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper studies the budget-constrained newsvendor problem under risk aversion with financing service and builds a two-stage supply chain decision model on the order quantity and wholesale price. The budget-constrained retailer as a newsvendor faces a nonnegative random demand and the financial institution provides the loan service for the retailer who is risk-averse. This paper first explores the impact of risk aversion on the decisions in financial supply chain. Different from the existing research, we analyze how the financing service of bank loan impacts the risk-averse newsvendor’s decision and how the risk-averse behavior of the retailer influences the optimal strategies in supply chain with CVaR risk measure criterion. It is found that the order quantity decreases in the degree of risk aversion. The optimal order quantity is decreasing in initial budget, wholesale price, and interest rate. It is worth noting that the financing service can improve the profit of the supply chain system when the retailer has a low initial wealth. Finally, to compare with the existing results the theoretical analysis and numerical examples are also illustrated.</jats:p>"

Drug Pooling System is proposed and applied in a few pilot cities to resolve these problems. From the perspective of supply chain, this study analyzes the process of setting important parameters and sets out the tasks of involved parties in a pooling system according to the issues identified in the pilot run. The approach is based on big data analysis and simulation using system dynamic theory and modeling of Vensim software to optimize system performance. This study proposes a theoretical framework to resolve problems and attempts to provide a valuable reference for future application of pooling systems.</jats:p>"

Semantic annotation of IoT devices is the foundation of IoT semantics. However, the large amount of devices has led to the inadequacy of the manual semantic annotation and stressed the urgency into the research of automatic semantic annotation. To overcome these limitations, a device-oriented automatic semantic annotation method is proposed to annotate IoT devices’ information. The processes and corresponding algorithms of the automatic semantic annotation method are presented in detail, including the information extraction, text classification, property information division, semantic label selection, and information integration. Experiments show that our method is effective for the automatic semantic annotation to IoT devices’ information. In addition, compared to a typical rule-based method, the comparison experiment demonstrates that our approach outperforms this baseline method with respect to the precision and <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>-measure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, a new combination scheme has been proposed for detecting Parkinson’s disease (PD) from electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recorded from normal subjects and PD patients. The scheme is based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT), sample entropy (SampEn), and the three-way decision model in analysis of EEG signal. The EEG signal is noisy and nonstationary, and, as a consequence, it becomes difficult to distinguish it visually. However, the scheme is a well-established methodology in analysis of EEG signal in three stages. In the first stage, the DWT was applied to acquire the split frequency information; here, we use three-level DWT to decompose EEG signal into approximation and detail coefficients; in this stage, we aim to remove the useless and noise information and acquire the effective information. In the second stage, as the SampEn has advantage in analyzing the EEG signal, we use the approximation coefficient to compute the SampEn values. Finally, we detect the PD patients using three-way decision based on optimal center constructive covering algorithm (O_CCA) with the accuracy about 92.86%. Without DWT as preprocessing step, the detection rate reduces to 88.10%. Overall, the combination scheme we proposed is suitable and efficient in analyzing the EEG signal with higher accuracy.</jats:p>"
