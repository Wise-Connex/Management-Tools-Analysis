Ignoring the hotly debated and important ethical issues, this note explores the potential consequences of this breakthrough for vertical co‐ordination in meat supply chains. By reducing the biological variation inherent in animal production, cloning technology could allow the final quality of meat products to be linked more closely to managerial ability. It may result in closer contractual relationships between farmers, processors and retailers. This would bring with it, however, the problems of asset specificity and increased risks of opportunism for farmers if they invest in livestock with a specific genetic code for a single buyer.

These principles include: the maintenance of all ecosystems in the managed forest, rhe emulation of natural disturbance patterns on rhe landscape and the insurance that structure and function of forested ecosystems are conserved. Forest management has an impact on woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), although the presence of wolves (Canis lupus) and moose (Alces alces) in the same northern ecosystems also affects the caribou-forestry interacrion. Specific management for caribou as a featured species has been proposed, based on managing large landscape blocks. Ecosystem management would also produce habitat in a manner that might accomplish the goal of conserving woodland caribou as well as maintaining other important ecosystem functions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The dynamic computer model of oxidative phosphorylation developed previously and successfully tested for large-scale changes in fluxes and metabolite concentrations was used to study the question of how the rate of ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation is adjusted to meet the energy demand during muscle contraction, which causes a great increase in ATP consumption in relation to the resting state. The changes in the respiration rate and ATP/ADP ratio after the onset of maximal work measured experimentally were compared with simulated changes in the respiration rate and ATP/ADP in several different cases, assuming direct activation of different steps by an external effector. On the basis of the computer simulations performed, it was possible to conclude which enzymes/metabolic blocks should be directly activated to cause the experimentally observable changes in fluxes and metabolite concentrations. The theoretical results obtained suggest that the parallel direct activation of actinomyosin-ATP-ase and oxidative phosphorylation by an external effector (for example calcium ions) is the main mechanism responsible for fitting of ATP production to ATP consumption, while the negative feedback via an increase in ADP concentration (decrease in ATP/ADP), which indirectly activates the ATP supply, plays only a minor role. Additionally, the conclusion is drawn that most of the oxidative phosphorylation steps should be directly activated in order to explain the observed changes in the respiration rate and ATP/ADP ratio (and also in other parameters) during muscle contraction. It is suggested that there should exist a universal external activator/regulatory mechanism which causes a parallel stimulation of different enzymes/processes. A possible nature of such an activator is shortly discussed.</jats:p>",

Generally\n      lack of technological innovation in pulses, except in mungbean, has\n      reduced their production and they are pushed to low intensive areas\n      which are marginal for cereal and cash crop production. Pulses did not\n      benefit from the investment in irrigation infrastructure. Increase in\n      wage rates has further affected the mungbean and lentil production. On\n      the demand side, contrary to normal belief, pulses have high own-price\n      demand and income elasticities. Thus decline in pulses consumption is\n      not caused by their being regarded as inferior goods, rather it can be\n      attributed to disproportionate increase in pulses price, as laxity in\n      pulses research left their production behind demand. The high-yielding,\n      short-duration, and pest-resistant pulses varieties with synchronised\n      maturity can revive their production trend as well as improve the\n      dietary pattern, especially of the poor.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Woodland caribou habitat management in northwestern Ontario is a complex spatial problem. The Strategic Forest Management Model (SFMM), a linear programming PC-based planning tool being developed in Ontario, was used to examine the impacts of alternative management strategies on caribou habitat. The management alternatives investigated included the cessation of timber management and maximising the present value of wood production without any explicit concern (in the model) for caribou. Three major findings are worth noting: 1) trying to maintain prime caribou habitat within active Forest Management Units will come at a cost to wood supply but the cost will depend on the absolute amount of area affected and the spatial configuration of that land in relation to mills. The cost of maintaining caribou habitat in one management unit at a level about 25 000 hectares is roughly $324 000 per year (about 3 cents for each Ontario resident). The imposition of an even-flow constraint on wood production is in fact potentially more costly; 2) Given the region is heavily dominated by spruce aged 90 years and over, forest succession and fire disturbance will likely cause large declines in prime caribou habitat in the near to medium term (20 to 40 years) even if no timber harvesting occurs; 3) The complexities of the trade-offs in this resource management problem highlight the limitations of any single modelling tool to satisfactorily address all issues. Planners need to take advantage of a wide range of analytical techniques to quantify the issues and formulate integrated policies.</jats:p>"

Since the incising drainage network flushes all or a portion of the products of hillslope erosion to a range front where fan deposition takes place, a conservation of solid sediment volume allows the fan area and progradation distance to be calculated. These parameters are related primarily to the discharge of sediment from the catchment and to local tectonic subsidence.</jats:p><jats:p>A survey of modern alluvial fans in a wide range of climatic and tectonic settings shows that the effects of climate and bedrock lithology cannot be discriminated in the scatter of data of catchment area vs. fan area. However, by focusing on over 100 fans in the arid and semiarid zone of SW USA, the impact of tectonic subsidence rate is unambiguous. Although further quantitative data on local tectonic subsidence rates are urgently required, our preliminary analysis suggests considerable potential for reconstructing palaeocatchments where basin tectonic subsidence rates can be estimated. The progradation distances of fans from the northern and southern margins of the Middle Devonian Hornelen Basin of Norway, and the western and north‐eastern margins of the Mio‐Pliocene Ridge Basin, California, allow catchment sizes and denudation rates to be approximated. Although unique solution sets are not possible, an iteration of parameter values allows plausible parameter combinations to be calculated which shed light on the tectonic and sedimentary history of the proximal basin and upland source regions. Model results suggest significant asymmetry in basin subsidence rates, catchment slopes and transport mechanics between the two margins.</jats:p>",

The implementation of these policies was mainly based on public land ownership as a fundamental principle. This paper evaluates the process of recent urban land development policy and focuses on the effectiveness of the policy in terms of land supply. It includes a discussion on the issue of public land ownership, an investigation of post‐revolutionary urban land policies in Iran, a discussion on the evaluation of urban land development policy in terms of land supply, and finally, presents an argument on the relationship between public land ownership and urban development. The paper argues that alongside the primary advantages of public land ownership, such as urban growth control, preventing land speculation and providing land for various social needs, the land policy has succeeded to some extent in meeting residential land demand in the study period. However, in terms of the effectiveness of the land supply policies, the paper raises some concerns such as the centralized nature of the land development process, land wastage and isolation from the general process of planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rate of sediment supply from erosional catchment to depositional basin depends primarily upon climate, relief, catchment slope and lithology. It varies in both time and space. Spatial changes in erosion rates due to variations in lithology are illustrated by contrasting rates of drainage divide migration away from faults of known ages. Time variations in relative sediment supply are extremely complex and vary widely according to the direction and magnitude of climate change. In many parts of the Great Basin and south‐western USA, glacial maximum climates were characterized by higher effective moisture and the altitudinal downward spread of woods and forests. Sparse data from alluvial fans indicate reduced sediment supply, despite the increased runoff evident from higher lake levels. The situation in Mediterranean areas is less clear, with rival climatic scenarios for vegetation ecotypes predicting contrasting runoff. In order to test these latter we run Cumulative Seasonal Erosion Potential [CSEP] experiments for present‐day and a variety of full‐glacial Mediterranean candidate climates. The results indicate the likelihood of enhanced sediment supply and runoff compared to the present day during full‐glacial times for a cool wet winter climate and a reduction in sediment supply and runoff for a full‐glacial cool dry winter climate. We then explore the consequences of such phase differences in sediment supply, and sea and lake levels for the stratigraphy of sedimentary basins. Highstands and lowstands of sea or lake may be accompanied by greater or lesser sediment and water supply, as determined by the regional climate and the direction of climatic change. Thus marine lowstands are not necessarily periods of great transfer of coarse clastic sediments to shelves and deep water basinal environments. Unsteady sediment supply has greatest implications for alluvial systems, in particular the effect that changing relative supplies of water and sediment have upon river and fan channel incision.</jats:p>",

Primary care physicians often see patients who have some form of mental illness, which they are not always trained to recognize and treat. The data on the supply of several specialists—psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and clinical social workers—indicate that the distribution of mental health professionals varies widely by state.

The basic question we ask here is: does the threat of assigning employees to a punitive task allow one to attain higher effort levels than termination threats? The answer critically depends on whether employers are able or not to commit themselves not to fire. We show that in the no‐commitment case the only relevant incentive device is termination threats. In contrast, when employers commit themselves not to fire, by threatening punitive task reassignments there obtain effort levels that are not implementable by termination. The implementation results are then applied to the study of incentive problems arising when investment infirm‐specific human capital is unverifiable.</jats:p>",

In particular, this study raises the question, can institutional designs in a regional integration area increase the responsiveness of trade authorities to protectionist demands? Contrary to some previous research, the analysis shows that the answer is affirmative. As illustrated by the European Union (EU) experience, the supply of trade protection in the context of regional integration crucially depends on the design and evolution of institutions adopted by the trade bloc. Moreover, the dynamic process of regional integration entails a redefinition of rules which inevitably attracts lobbying activities (in particular from those with protectionist interests). In consequence, in the absence of a strong political commitment, the danger exists that the design of new institutions will be captured by protectionist forces.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Diets rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are well known to suppress hepatic lipogenic enzymes compared to fat‐free diets or diets rich in saturated fatty acids. However, the mechanism underlying suppression of lipogenic enzymes is not quite clear. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether lipid peroxidation products are involved in suppression of lipogenic enzymes. Therefore, an experiment with growing male rats assigned to six groups over a period of 40 d was carried out. Rats received semisynthetic diets containing 9.5% coconut oil and 0.5% fresh soybean oil (coconut oil diet, peroxide value 5.1 meq O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/kg oil), 10% fresh soybean oil (fresh soybean oil diet, peroxide value 0.5 meq O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/kg oil), or 10% thermally treated soybean oil (oxidized soybean oil diet, peroxide value 74 meq O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/kg oil). To modify the antioxidant state of the rats, we varied the vitamin E supply (11 and 511 mg α‐tocopherol equivalents per kg of diet) according to a bi‐factorial design. Food intake and body weight gain were not influenced by dietary fat and vitamin E supply. Activities of hepatic lipogenic enzymes were markedly influenced by the dietary fat. Feeding either fresh or oxidized soybean oil diets markedly reduced activities of fatty acid synthase, (FAS), acetyl CoA‐carboxylase, (AcCX), glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase, (G6PDH), 6‐phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and ATP citrate lyase (ACL) relative to feeding the coconut oil diet. Moreover, feeding oxidized soybean oil slightly, but significantly, lowered activities of FAS, AcCX, and ACL compared to feeding fresh soybean oil. Activities of hepatic lipogenic enzymes were reflected by concentrations of triglycerides in liver and plasma. Rats fed the coconut oil diet had markedly higher triglyceride concentrations in liver and plasma than rats consuming fresh or oxidized soybean oil diets, and rats fed oxidized soybean oil had lower concentrations than rats fed fresh soybean oil. The vitamin E supply of the rats markedly influenced concentrations of thiobarbituric acid‐reactive substances in liver, but it did not influence activities of hepatic lipogenic enzymes. Because the vitamin E supply had no effect, and ingestion of an oxidized oil had only a minor effect, on activities of hepatic lipogenic enzymes, it is strongly suggested that neither exogenous nor endogenous lipid peroxidation products play a significant role in the suppression of hepatic lipogenic enzymes by diets rich in PUFA. Therefore, we assumed that dietary PUFA themselves are involved in regulatio of hepatic lipogenic enzymes. Nevertheless, the study shows that ingestion of oxidized oils, regardless of the vitamin E supply, also affects hepatic lipogenesis, and hence influences triglyceride levels in liver and plasma.</jats:p>",

Despite an unambiguously negative impact on expected profits of equally likely premiums and discounts, supply response to the introduction of such a system is shown to depend on the level of seasonal variability faced by the farmer. In particular, farmers in regions which are more seasonally unreliable are likely to feature a negative supply response, whereas those in regions which are more seasonally reliable are likely to feature a positive supply response. Consequently, it is suggested that, overall, protein payments for wheat may have encouraged a shift of wheat‐growing activity away from more seasonally unreliable areas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reconstructions of grain‐size trends in alluvial deposits can be used to understand the dominant controls on stratal architecture in a foreland basin. Different initial values of sediment supply, tectonic subsidence and base‐level rise are investigated to constrain their influence on stratal geometry using the observed grain‐size trends as a proxy of the goodness of fit of the numerical results to the observed data. Detailed measurements of grain‐size trends, palaeocurrent indicators, facies and thickness trends, channel geometries and palynological analyses were compiled for the middle Campanian Castlegate Sandstone of the Book Cliffs and its conglomerate units in the Gunnison and Wasatch plateaus of central Utah. They define the initial conditions for a numerical study of the interactions between large‐scale foreland basin and small‐scale sediment transport processes. From previous studies, the proximal foreland deposits are interpreted as recording a middle Campanian thrusting event along the Sevier orogenic belt, while the stratal architecture in the Book Cliffs region is interpreted to be controlled by eustatic fluctuation with local tectonic influence. Model results of stratal geometry, using a subsidence curve with a maximum rate of ≈45 m Myr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for the northern Wasatch Plateau region predict the observed grain‐size trends through the northern Book Cliffs. A subsidence curve with a maximum rate of ≈30 m Myr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the Gunnison–Wasatch Plateaus best reproduces the observed grain‐size trends in the southern transect through the southern Wasatch Plateau. Eustasy is commonly cited as controlling Castlegate deposition east of the Book Cliffs region. A eustatic rise of 45 m Myr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> produces grain‐size patterns that are similar to the observed, but a rate of eustatic rise based on Haq <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rates of accommodation and sediment supply are the principal controls on stacking patterns in siliciclastic basin fills. Stratigraphic inversion is aimed at reconstruction of these controls from the detrital record. Efforts to ‘explain’ siliciclastic basin fills have been focused on analysis and numerical modelling of sequence geometry in response to changes in accommodation, whereas comparatively few studies have attempted to address the role of sediment supply. The compositional and textural properties of siliciclastic basin fills are linked with the evolution of drainage basins through the principle of climatic–physiographic control of sediment production and supply. Application of this principle leads to a method of compositional analysis for distinguishing sequences controlled by high‐frequency changes in the rate of accommodation from sequences controlled by high‐frequency variations in the rate of sediment supply (order of 10 kyr). This method does not require detailed time control. Changes in rate and type of sediment supplied to depositional systems in response to environmental perturbations in drainage basins are explored in greater detail by means of a numerical model of sediment production under various scenarios of climatic and tectonic forcing. Simulation experiments suggest that drainage basins respond differently to high‐frequency tectonic and climatic perturbations. Synthetic time series of cyclically forced sediment production display different types of asymmetric variations in grain size, accumulation rate and residence time of sediments in response to tectonic and climatic forcing. The results also highlight the role of vegetation as the principal modulator of climate forcing, and show that the nonlinear response to climate change may frustrate any attempts at providing broad generalizations of the system's responses. The modelling results confirm the usefulness of a combined analysis of sediment composition and sequence geometry, and the mathematically rich behaviour of the system suggests that further development of this approach is likely to increase our ability to reconstruct forcing mechanisms and initial boundary conditions from the detrital record.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>IN BRIEF</jats:title><jats:p>In business today, companies cannot ignore environmental issues. Increasing government regulation and stronger public mandates for environmental accountability have brought these issues into the executive suite, and onto strategic planning agendas. At the same time, companies are integrating their supply chain processes to lower costs and better serve customers. These two trends are not independent; companies must involve suppliers and purchasers to meet and even exceed the environmental expectations of their customers and their governments. Based on case studies of five companies in the furniture industry, a number of supply chain environmentally‐friendly practices (EFP) are identified. Using accepted qualitative research methods for case‐based research, several primary areas for change to increase purchasing's impact on environmental results are identified: 1. Materials used in product design for the environment 2. Product design processes 3. Supplier process improvement 4. Supplier evaluation 5. Inbound logistics processes</jats:p><jats:p>The experiences of these companies illustrate the types of environmentally‐friendly practices used in each of these five areas, and “rules of thumb” which purchasing and supply chain managers can apply. Two additional themes which emerge from this research are the importance of management's commitment to supply chain EFP, and the need to move beyond environmental compliance to achieve a proactive environmentally‐friendly supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We investigate statistical properties of cold O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> beams (COBs) streaming tailward at the velocity nearly equal to the major H<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> component, which were observed by Geotail/low‐energy particle (LEP) instrument in the tail lobe/mantle regions at geocentric distance between 8 and 210 <jats:italic>R<jats:sub>E</jats:sub></jats:italic> (Earth radii) during the solar‐minimum period (October 1993 to March 1995). The average O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> density is ∼1.3×10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>, which corresponds to ∼1.2 % of the proton component. Properties of the flow velocity show that it is not the weakening of the magnetospheric convection but the large parallel velocity which enables the O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ions to remain still in the distant lobe/mantle regions. The occurrence frequency of COBs suggests that O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ions tend to exist in the mantle‐like region rather than tenuous “pure lobe” and that their existence has a clear correlation with the geomagnetic activity. On the basis of the EMF <jats:italic>B<jats:sub>y</jats:sub></jats:italic> dependence of the double‐peaked COB distribution along dawn‐dusk direction, it is shown that COBs exist mostly on <jats:italic>loaded</jats:italic> quadrants in the north–south and dawn‐dusk asymmetry of sheath plasma entry caused by the IMF <jats:italic>B<jats:sub>y</jats:sub></jats:italic> effect on the dayside reconnection process. The concentration on the <jats:italic>loaded</jats:italic> quadrants can be seen even in geomagnetic storms. It suggests that frequent COB occurrence at active times is mainly due to the southward orientation of IMF rather than the increase of dynamic pressure itself during the geomagnetic storms. That is, the statistics show that COBs are abundant at geomagnetically active times on <jats:italic>loaded</jats:italic> quadrants resulting from the dayside reconnection process, where the ions of solar wind origin bear the major component, and their field‐aligned velocity is larger than usual. These COBs should originate in the dayside magnetosphere and/or the polar cap regions. From the COB energy of several keV, which is rather higher than that of cusp/cleft ion outflows, the necessity of extra energization(s) to elevate parallel velocity is suggested. Clear IMF <jats:italic>B<jats:sub>y</jats:sub></jats:italic> dependence, on one hand, provides other possibilities of the COB's source such as the energetic UFI beams and the equatorially trapped ions. The requirements for each candidate so as to be a main contributor to COBs are also discussed.</jats:p>",
