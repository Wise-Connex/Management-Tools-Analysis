      "abstract": "<jats:p>Emerging markets present intriguing growth opportunities, but they are often extremely risky for foreign entrants. Given this riskiness, companies entering emerging markets may establish strategic footholds—small positions that they can later choose to expand (referred to as an <jats:italic>attack</jats:italic>) or abandon (referred to as a <jats:italic>withdrawal</jats:italic>)—rather than making costly large‐scale entries. While scholars have begun to examine the competitive dynamics surrounding footholds, the influence of the supply chain has not been considered. This is surprising given that supply chains are key to the daunting task of meeting emerging market demands. To build on extant research, we theorize about how environmental uncertainty (e.g., stemming from factors such as poor infrastructure and political unrest), foothold portability (i.e., how easily the foothold resources can be redeployed in the firm's supply chain), and supply chain knowledge influence (or should influence) firms’ decisions about footholds. This represents a needed step forward in understanding the central role of supply chains in foothold maneuvers in emerging markets. In taking this step, we posit that firms must consider both competitive dynamics and their supply chains or they risk over/under estimating the viability and value of their footholds.</jats:p>",

For this end, a literature review was carried out in 120 Brazilian academic journals in which 124 papers were identified, from 2008 until 2013. When considering the Triple Bottom Line approach, the results show that sustainability research in Brazil is focusing on the environmental dimension and SCM research is focusing on the economic dimension. Additional inputs are provided by integrating the governance dimension in the analysis to underline which actions and policies are discussed in Brazil at a corporate level. To support the results a consultation of experts in the field of sustainability in Brazil was fulfilled, and three case examples are presented to explain some of the research results. The findings on publications in Brazil contrast with international studies, particularly on the topic of social performance and management in supply chains. One of the main conclusions is that there are large opportunities to increase publications about sustainability and SCM in the country and that Brazil presents some specificities in the field that researchers and managers shall consider.</jats:p>"

The water balance covers those parts of a WDS within the responsibility of the water utility. Water losses occurring ‘before’ a customer meter are at the expense of the utility, while water lost or wasted ‘after’ the meter is paid for by the customer. This applies to systems where customer metering is in place and/or consumption is charged according to the consumed volumes. However, many WDS in the world lack customer meters, are operated intermittently and apply flat-rate tariffs. In intermittent supplies, a considerable amount of water is lost or wasted within the private properties. The flat-rate tariff might not cover this amount or part of the amount. Thus, actual consumption and wastage should be separately quantified with respect to the utility's water reduction measures. Accepting the described conditions, the authors have developed an adaption of the IWA water balance and the methods to establish the balance. In this paper the application of the developed approach in an initially unmetered WDS with intermittent water supply in the city of Tiruvannamalai, India, is presented.</jats:p>",

However, the focus on a single level of analysis in existing research has limited our ability to better understand the complex mechanics linking supplier‐induced disruptions and their consequences. Recognizing this need to bridge different levels of analysis, our study builds on event system theory and presents an in‐depth qualitative investigation of 60 response processes following supplier‐induced disruptions in Western–Chinese buyer–supplier relationships. Using fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis (fs<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">QCA</jats:styled-content>), we explore how cognitive, behavioral, and structural factors across the individual and organizational levels of analysis combine in complex ways to give rise to either dysfunctional conflict or constructive interaction in the aftermath of supplier‐induced disruptions. Because little is known about the cognitive underpinnings of responses to supply chain disruptions, we investigate the specific role of managerial cognition. To do so, we employ a cognitive‐linguistic approach, which maintains that subtle differences in language reflect differences in cognition, for the textual analysis of our 101 interviews across 20 companies. The configurational fs<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">QCA</jats:styled-content> across the individual and organizational level identifies two archetypes associated with dysfunctional conflict and three archetypes associated with constructive interaction. These findings are the foundation of a middle‐range theory for responses to supplier‐induced disruptions that bridges different levels of analysis and accounts for the role of managerial cognition.</jats:p>",

The fundamental likelihood to optimization in this industry requires dexterous flows of quasi-real-time information, as well as reliable product availability. In this context, this study analyzes the challenges of bullwhip effect on the perspective of ingenious optimization strategies, and further contemplates to establish the engineering patterns of interrelationships on the magnitude of pooling the resources to advance supply chain capabilities. The suppression of bullwhip effect on underlying optimization strategies is sought to elevate accelerated responsiveness, improve network demand visibility and reduce volatility in frequencies to inventory replenishment. A rigorous and disciplined quantitative approach afforded the tentatively development of pattern of interrelated supply chain dimensions. The factor analysis method was used on 448 responses and insightful findings were produced from the compelling purposive sampling technique. The findings indicate that the magnitude of better ameliorating bullwhip effect, the value of competitive economic information and strength of selected optimization strategies depend on the model of unified engineering patterns.

While such failures can be a motivation for organizational learning, little is known about the extent to which recalls can be a source of learning experience. Using econometric modeling, we investigate to what extent firms learn from conformance quality failures using a panel sample of U.S. food product recalls conducted by 125 publically traded firms between 2004 and 2013. We differentiate between direct (i.e., internal locus of failure) and indirect (i.e., supplier locus of failure and industry recalls) sources of experience and examine the main and interaction effects on the likelihood of future recalls. The results indicate that experience derived from internal and supplier failures reduces the potential for future recalls, while industry recalls have no significant main effect. We also find evidence of substitution effects between internal and supplier failures, suggesting that there are diminishing learning effects at higher levels of both of these types of failures. This finding suggests that the variety and volume of information as well as uncertainty regarding outcomes can overwhelm firm information processing capabilities at higher levels of these failure types and that additional resources should be allocated to encourage adequate learning. Finally, internal failures and industry recalls act as learning complements, which may indicate that internal quality failures become more relevant when industry peers also experience quality failures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Complexity has been one of the focal points of attention in the supply chain management domain, as it deteriorates the performance of the supply chain and makes controlling it problematic. The complexity of supply chains has been significantly increased over the past couple of decades. Meanwhile, Additive Manufacturing (AM) not only revolutionizes the way that the products are made, but also brings a paradigm shift to the whole production system. The influence of AM extends to product design and supply chain as well. The unique capabilities of AM suggest that this manufacturing method can significantly affect the supply chain complexity. More product complexity and demand heterogeneity, faster production cycles, higher levels of automation and shorter supply paths are among the features of additive manufacturing that can directly influence the supply chain complexity. Comparison of additive manufacturing supply chain complexity to its traditional counterpart requires a profound comprehension of the transformative effects of AM on the supply chain. This paper first extracts the possible effects of AM on the supply chain and then tries to connect these effects to the drivers of complexity under three main categories of 1) market, 2) manufacturing technology, and 3) supply, planning and infrastructure. Possible impacts of additive manufacturing adoption on the supply chain complexity have been studied using information theoretic measures. An Agent-based Simulation (ABS) model has been developed to study and compare two different supply chain configurations. The findings of this study suggest that the adoption of AM can decrease the supply chain complexity, particularly when product customization is considered.</jats:p>",

This communication describes the current knowledge about the history of the process of drying in various hydrological basins as well as the works in the endorheic lake close to the village of L'Estany, located in the district of the Moianès (Catalonia), in the northeast of Spain. The drying began in the 16th century with drainage channels driven by the Monastery of Santa Maria de L'Estany, and culminated in the 18th century with the construction, using the dry stone technique, of a 425 m long, 2.14 m high and 1.20 m wide drainage mine that diverted water to the basin of the Llobregat River. Now the mine and the canals are conserved for use in times of rain as well as a touristic objective that complements the cultural and religious concerns of the Monastery of Santa Maria with its magnificent Romanesque cloister.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many high-speed, rotating machines across a wide range of industrial applications depend on fluid film bearings to provide both static support of the rotor and to introduce stabilizing damping forces into the system through a developed hydrodynamic film wedge. Reduced oil supply flow rate to the bearings can cause cavitation, or a lack of a fully developed film layer, at the leading edge of the bearing pads. Reducing oil flow has the well-documented effects of higher bearing operating temperatures and decreased power losses due to shear forces. While machine efficiency may be improved with reduced lubricant flow, little experimental data on its effects on system stability and performance can be found in the literature. This study looks at overall system performance of a test rig operating under reduced oil supply flow rates by observing steady-state bearing performance indicators and baseline vibrational response of the shaft. The test rig used in this study was designed to be dynamically similar to a high-speed industrial compressor. It consists of a 1.55 m long, flexible rotor supported by two tilting pad bearings with a nominal diameter of 70 mm and a span of 1.2 m. The first bending mode is located at approximately 5,000 rpm. The tiling-pad bearings consist of five pads in a vintage, flooded bearing housing with a length to diameter ratio of 0.75, preload of 0.3, and a load-between-pad configuration. Tests were conducted over a number of operating speeds, ranging from 8,000 to 12,000 rpm, and bearing loads, while systematically reducing the oil supply flow rates provided to the bearings under each condition. For nearly all operating conditions, a low amplitude, broadband subsynchronous vibration pattern was observed in the frequency domain from approximately 0–75 Hz. When the test rig was operated at running speeds above its first bending mode, a distinctive subsynchronous peak emerged from the broadband pattern at approximately half of the running speed and at the first bending mode of the shaft. This vibration signature is often considered a classic sign of rotordynamic instability attributed to oil whip and shaft whirl phenomena. For low and moderate load conditions, the amplitude of this 0.5x subsynchronous peak increased with decreasing oil supply flow rate at all operating speeds. Under the high load condition, the subsynchronous peak was largely attenuated. A discussion on the possible sources of this subsynchronous vibration including self-excited instability and pad flutter forced vibration is provided with supporting evidence from thermoelastohydrodynamic (TEHD) bearing modeling results. Implications of reduced oil supply flow rate on system stability and operational limits are also discussed.</jats:p>",

We explore the impact of misplaced inventory on a two-level supply chain, which consists of a risk-neutral supplier and a risk-averse retailer. The supplier decides the wholesale price to maximize her profit, whereas the retailer decides the order quantity to maximize his utility. Under the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) criterion, we formulate the problem as a Stackelberg game model and obtain the equilibrium solutions in three cases: (i) information asymmetry about inventory errors exists; (ii) the retailer shares information about inventory errors with the supplier; and (iii) in order to reduce misplaced inventory, the supply chain deploys Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. The benefits of information sharing and RFID implementation are explored. A revenue and cost sharing contract is proposed to coordinate the supply chain and to allocate the cost savings from RFID implementation among supply chain participants. Finally, we provide managerial insights for risk-averse decision makers that are considering investing in the RFID technology.</jats:p>"

Complex product development still lack on the ‘better, faster and cheaper’ paradigm for efficient communication and information exchange flow process. This paper aims at understanding how the critical interdependent techniques are managed in the sub-supply network of a complex sector such as Business Aviation Industry. Thus, the aim is to envisage the best practice approach for technical communication networks among these systems-design teams and also how the bottlenecks existing could be effectively and efficiently addressed to enhance collaborative industrial supply-chain management network competitive advantage.This paper employing social network theory propose information flow process toward enhancing an industrial sustainable competitive advantage. From a methodological point of view, the research is based on a single case study, a questionnaire was used to collect data for the level of communication network from Business Aviation supply chain network.The outcome of the research highlights how communication in the sub-supply network significantly influences the attention the teams pay to the organization of the critical interdependent techniques. Moreover this research identifies an effective and efficient communication is sees as the driver for effective organization management, which need enhancement for industrial competitive advantage. Finally, the research carried-out undoubtedly gives a considerable contribution in understanding critical and complex issues in the relationships in sub-supplying in Business Aviation Industry.The outcome could be further developed by extending the interviews to the businesses involved in the sub-supply chain.</jats:p>"

The initial data for modeling of solar thermal systems functioning are dissimilar. Parameters of system’s equipment are constant. Solar radiation amount and water consumption are variable data. The more close initial data to reality, the more definite simulated result is. The main problem is in unpredictability of water consumption by the reason of daily regime and requirement of each user. In this way user is the most instable element of the system. In this study the input data for mathematical modeling of solar thermal systems was analyzed. The climatic databases and standard specifications of hot water demand were also analyzed. The operability estimation method for solar thermal systems with variable input data was offered.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2005, 49 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) were incinerated in conventional incineration plants (CWI-plants) in Europe. There are, however, alternatives to treating solid waste in CWI-plants. By treating the solid waste in a mechanical-biological treatment plant (MBT-plant) or in a mechanical treatment plant (MT-plant) the solid waste can be sorted into fractions of combustible matter, inert matter and metals. The sorted combustible matter (refuse-derived fuel, RDF) can be used for co-incineration in e.g. cement kilns. This study comprises an environmental economic evaluation of treatment of solid waste in a CWI-plant or treatment in a MBT-plant or a MT-plant, followed by incineration of produced RDF at a regional cement industry. The evaluation was made with an evaluation method, in which criteria were quantified or valuated. The aim of this study was to identify the economic and environmental effects of a regional treatment of solid waste. The study shows that a treatment of solid waste in a MT-plant is the best scenario from an environmental economical point of view, while a treatment and incineration in a CWI-plant is the worst scenario. The study clearly shows that KSRR and the environment has a lot to gain if the treatment of solid waste in the future is changed from treatment and incineration in a CWI-plant to a treatment in a MT-plant, where produced RDF is incinerated at the regional cement industry. It also shows that treatment in a MBT-plant or a MT-plant follows the waste hierarchy to a better extent, compared to treatment and incineration in a CWI-plant.</jats:p>"

It estimated response coefficients from semi-annual time-series data for the period 1986-2011. Using three criteria, it chose the rational expectation hypothesis supply response model (Model I) with the separated price expectation formation hypothesis according to the information set at time (t-1) to estimate the supply response model for maize. Farmers used the available information set to form their expected price. Estimated parameters’ results in Model I indicate that the farmers' supply had a positive response to the expected price of maize, but was negative to that of cassava. This means that maize and cassava are close substitutes in the supply response models. Maize production also positively responds to the amount of fertilizer per hectare, maize area, one-period lagged investment, irrigation, trend variable, and agricultural extension policy. Recommended policies include: enhancement of the judicious use of fertilizers and possible establishment of local factories; increase in maize area by changing the crop structure and multiple cropping with long-term industrial trees like perennials and fruit trees; improvement of the irrigation system in two deltas and in high production regions; increase in government support to farmers; increase in government spending on research and development of new maize varieties; and improvement of the extension system to provide farmers the needed market and technological information.</jats:p>",

The main park of boiler rooms is equipped with the aged machinery that by some features does not meet the standards of environmental friendliness, safety and efficiency. The article presents the main indicators of boiler rooms of a new type. The comparative analysis of the characteristics of the new and former boiler rooms as of an energy complex is suggested. The conformity of the proposed indicators to the guidelines of the energy strategy of the Russian Federation and subsequent innovations is determined. One of the conclusions of the authors is that in addition to replacing the equipment, it is necessary to conduct decentralization of the station’s heat supply system.

To map the relation between TE and involved parameters, artificial intelligence (AI) methods including artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector machine (SVM) were utilized. Results of experiments indicated that the range of TE varies between 30 and 98%; hence, this structure can be recommended to control sediment transport in watershed management plans. Experimental results showed that by increasing the longitudinal slope of streams, TE decreases. This finding was observed for Vf/Vs parameter, as well. By increasing the mean diameter grain size (D50) and specific gravity of sediments (Gs), TE increases. Results of all applied AI models demonstrated that all of them have suitable performance; however, the minimum data dispersivity was observed in SVM outcomes. It is notable that the best performance of transfer, membership and kernel functions were related to tansig, gaussmf and radial basis function (RBF) for ANN, SVM and ANFIS, respectively.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this article aims to analyze the hypothesis that a high level of taxation and public spending deters productive behavior and reduces economic growth during recessions. In other words, an easy taxation and low unproductive public spending are desirable for both, the enterprising investor and the consumer. Using the example of Romanian fiscal policy, on one side, we validated within a Vector Error Correction framework that an increase in government revenues harms consumption, investment and the level of employment, in conjunction with a procyclical behavior of fiscal authorities. On the other side, our results showed some positive effects of an increased government expenditures on consumption and employment, which can be explained by the accelerate deterioration of primary balance deficit and the Central Bank’s low interest rate. Moreover, even though the initial positive response of investment to a government spending shock is positive, this is ephemeral and nonsignificant. Our findings highlight that, in order to reach growth on the long-run in times of crisis, the Romanian economy should adopt the fiscal policy and measures suggested by the Supply-side Economics.</jats:p>",

This multifunctional vision has brought about the approach “sustainable packaging logistics” (SPL), which refers to the integration of packaging design, logistics management and new product development. The main aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to characterise the main aspects associated with SPL as a preliminary step towards constructing a conceptual model that can be validated in a quantitative way. Secondly, to carry out an exploratory study in the Spanish toy manufacturing sector in order to identify whether SPL deployment promotes changes and innovations in packaging that can lead to improved sustainability. The literature review was conducted via content analysis, and the methodology used to carry out empirical analysis was an electronic questionnaire dealing with aspects of SPL. The number of toy manufacturers participating in the study was 70. The results analysis indicates that further development of the main aspects of SPL actively contributes to better sustainable performance in almost all items considered in the study. The SPL approach is considered particularly innovative, because there is a scarcity of literature that deals jointly with packaging, logistics and sustainability from an empirical standpoint, rather than just the analysis of case studies.</jats:p>"

This is mainly related to the diversity of actors in the supply chain industry and competition in a global market that include environmental aspects. Therefore, industry cluster analysis from perspective of the supply chain of palm oil processing industry to be interesting. This study uses a qualitative exploratory approach, and primary data obtained by in-depth interviews of actors in the supply chain of palm oil processing industry in North Sumatra province in 2013 up to 2015. The analysis showed that smallholder plantations have a considerable contribution in supplying raw materials Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB) for palm oil processing industry, hence the existence of smallholder plantations can not be excluded in the development of downstream palm oil industry. Furthermore, the results of this study also indicate that they need to encourage the establishment of governance structures industry palm oil supply chain, improvement strategies, distribution, and justice so that the distribution of benefits for the actors in the supply chain can be awakened. In this regard, efforts to promote sustainable plantation industry business is still very necessary, especially to preserve biodiversity and benefit all actors in the supply chain of palm oil industry.</jats:p>"

Computer-based content analysis is used for this research: Leximancer is applied for text analysis, while dictionary-based text mining program DICTION and SPSS are used for rhetorical analysis. Overall, contents similar to the literature on environmental, social, and economic aspects of the triple bottom line (TBL) are observed, however, topics such as regulation, green incentives, and international standards are not readily observed. Furthmore, ethical issues, sustainable production, quality, and customer roles are emphasized in texts analyzed. The CEO letter analysis indicates that listed firms show relatively low realism and high commonality, while North American firms exhibit relatively high commonality, and Europe firms show relatively high realism. The results will serve as a baseline for providing academia guidelines in SSCM research, and provide an opportunity for businesses to complement their sustainability strategies and executions.</jats:p>"

Hazardous pollutants that leak from gas stations, landfills, and industrial facilities may eventually reach the underneath shallow groundwater aquifers, posing risks to human health and the environment. Cleaning contaminated groundwater sources has always been a challenge to the local authorities. This is even more challenging when dealing with difficult pollutants such as methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) due its high solubility in water, poor biodegradability, and poor adsorption onto solids. This study aims to assess the efficiency of a pilot groundwater remediation system to treat a shallow aquifer contaminated with MTBE. The in-house designed and fabricated pilot system combines the technology of circulation wells and UV-based advanced oxidation technology for the breakdown and removal of MTBE from water. An ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) process was used in this study to remove MTBE from water. The concentration of MTBE was reduced from approximately 1,400 μg/L to as low as 34 μg/L within 30 minutes, with a treatment efficiency of about 98%. The study also assesses the effects of the UV intensity and the treatment time needed to remove the target pollutant.</jats:p>",

Managing cyanobacterial blooms particularly at small drinking water treatment plants is challenging. Because large amount of cyanobacteria may cause clogging in the treatment process and various cyanotoxins are hard to remove, while they may cause severe health problems. There is lack of instructions of what cyanobacteria/toxin amount should trigger what kind of actions for drink-ing water management except for Microcystins. This demands a Cyanobacteria Management Tool (CMT) to help regula-tors/operators to improve cyanobacteria/cyanotoxin monitoring in surface waters for drinking water supply. This project proposes a CMT tool, including selecting proper indicators for quick cyanobacteria monitoring and verifying quick analysis methods for cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin. This tool is suggested for raw water management regarding cyano-bacteria monitoring in lakes, especially in boreal forest climate. In addition, it applies to regions that apply international WHO standards for water management. In Swedish context, drinking water producers which use raw water from lakes that experience cyanobacterial blooms, need to create a monitoring routine for cyanobacteria/cyanotoxin and to monitor beyond such as Anatoxins, Cylindrospermopsins and Saxitoxins. Using the proposed CMT tool will increase water safety at surface water treatment plants substantially by introducing three alerting points for actions. CMT design for each local condition should integrate adaptive monitoring program.</jats:p>"

The production of desalinated water has a greater unit-volumetric cost than the treatment of surface water due to high production energy costs. This paper presents the holistic approach adopted by Seqwater to find a solution for supply contingency while undertaking necessary upgrades and maintenance at the Mudgeeraba WTP. Through a process of network modelling, system risk mapping and financial analysis, it was demonstrated that operating the GCDP for 18 days would provide the best value solution due to the operating costs being offset by bulk supply network operational efficiency improvements.</jats:p>",

In this supply chain, carbon abatement investment becomes one of key factors of cutting costs and improving profits, which is reducing production costs in the components and products—the investment from players in supply chain. On the basis of optimality theory, the centralized and decentralized models are respectively established to investigate the optimal decisions and profits. Further, setting the players’ profits of the decentralized scenario as the disagreement points, we propose a bargaining-coordination contract through revenue-cost sharing to enhance the performance. Finally, by theoretical comparison and numerical analysis, the results show that: (i) The optimal profits of players and supply chain improve as technological spillovers and environmental awareness increase, and the profits of them in the bargaining-coordination contract are higher than that in the decentralized scenario; (ii) Technological spillovers between the players amplify the impact of “free-ride” behavior, in which the supplier always incentives the manufacturer to improve carbon emission intensity, but the cooperation will achieves and the profits will improve only when technological spillovers and environmental awareness are great; (iii) The contract can effectively achieve coordinated supply chain, and improve carbon abatement investment.</jats:p>"

In this context, the following order fulfillment options available to retailers are considered: store‐facing distribution centers (DCs), dedicated order fulfillment facilities (DTC), retail stores, and direct‐fill by vendors. A framework for the online order fulfillment process is developed to evaluate these options using operational and financial measures collected from a large U.S. retailer. The study presents managerial insights regarding each fulfillment option and identifies operational and cost thresholds where a particular fulfillment option would be preferred. The results show that due to better order fulfillment efficiency, distribution facilities (DC and DTC) out‐perform fulfillment from stores and vendors. However, retailers can leverage their network of stores to overcome the shortfall in store‐based fulfillment costs by focusing on the order delivery process. The analysis presented in this article is useful for practice as it helps retailers identify options that best suit their order fulfillment strategy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The successful implementation of push-pull supply chain management strategy has an important role in improving the competitiveness of an organization. The objective of a push-pull strategy is to minimize the holding of inventory level in finished form and rather produce finished goods from semi-finished inventory only upon receiving final order. One of the vital building blocks of push-pull supply chain strategy is postponement. The main objective of this review paper is to discuss the concept of postponement and its sub-categories such as product postponement and process postponement and their benefits. Then it is investigated how two prominent fast fashion retailers who are also categorized as original brand manufacturers in the apparel value chain apply the two variants of process postponement e.g. process standardization and process re-sequencing in their manufacturing operations to activate push pull supply chain strategy. The push-pull supply chain strategy in turn helps to reduce their order-to-delivery lead time to stores, reduce inventory holding level and minimize both physical costs and market mediation costs. The paper ends with concluding remarks. A framework is developed to illustrate the push-pull supply mechanism. This paper is a useful resource for practitioners in apparel supply chain willing to remove inefficiencies, costs and risks in their operations.</jats:p>"

The producer decides the price of the direct channel and the intermediaries decides both price and order quantity in the traditional method. We show that the difference in problem faced by the producers’ of the two channels plays an important role in determining the existence of dual channels in equilibrium. For the study Erode and Kanyakumari districts were chosen purposively. A sample of 80 farmers was selected randomly who are involved in both of the channels. In the case that the producer and the retailer coordination and to follow a centralized decision approach, we find that a direct channel will be an optimum solution for improving the overall effectiveness. Our results show that an increase in retailer’s service quality may increase the producer’s profit in dual channel and a larger range of consumer service sensitivity may benefit both parties in the dual channel. The results suggest that both the channel have problem and the optimum solution lies in between two channels.</jats:p>"

The research is motivated by an issue of justin- time (JIT) parts dispatch to auto companies partly due to inadequate lead time given to the first tier suppliers. Compiling secondary data from industry sources, we estimated the overseas shipment time and parts dispatch lead time while developing heuristics to forecast vehicles parts requirement with due care for buffer stock. Results suggest a strategic hybrid approach combining MTS parts ordering with JIT supply to auto manufacturers. MTS will help first tier suppliers to source and stock parts in-house that can be supplied just in time to help completing vehicle fitment. This approach is likely to ease the lead time pressure of first tier suppliers without affecting JIT supply to the automotive companies. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications for Australian first tier parts importers as well as automotive companies.</jats:p>"

Desalination with reverse osmosis (RO) represents an effective solution to meet the challenges of cleaning brackish water and seawater for drinking and industrial purposes. The principal problem of RO plant operation is the precipitation of low soluble salts (scaling). There are some well-known techniques to reduce scaling; one of the most widespread is antiscalant dosing. In this study, 11 samples of new prototype chemicals based on co-polymers of acrylic and methacrylic acids, polyaspartic acid, maleic anhydride and different cross-linking agents is tested. A wide range of commercial phosphorus-based and green inhibitors were used as reference antiscalants. The testing procedure included circulation experiments on a RO laboratory unit with continuous concentration of feed water – tap water and model solution with elevated hardness. The amount of calcium carbonate accumulated in the membrane module was determined and the inhibitor efficiency was calculated. The best results were obtained for scale inhibitors based on polyaspartic and (poly)acrylic acids. The most promising was the reagent based on a mixture of polyaspartate and nitrilotrimethylphosphonic acid.</jats:p>",

The permeability depends upon both material properties and fluid characteristics. Previous studies are concentrated on the influence of regularly shaped particles on permeability, whereas the present study aims to analyse its variation due to natural randomly shaped particles. Seepage velocity of the fluid and hydraulic gradient of the soil bed materials are evaluated with the help of discharge and pressure measurements in a constant head permeameter. Specific gravity tests are conducted on different materials in order to calculate their porosities. The dependence of permeability on Dp/dg (i.e. ratio of permeameter size (Dp) to particle size (dg)) for various wall effect conditions is analysed through standard experimental procedures. The present study examines the effect of relative resistance of permeameter wall (i.e. the ratio of permeability of confined to unconfined bed) on Dp/dg. The results reveal that the aquifer confinement i.e. the distance up to which the region of randomly packing occurs directly influences the measure of permeability at lower values of Dp/dg. This effect decreases with increasing values of Dp/dg and becomes negligible at values 120 and above.</jats:p>",

The effects of these factors on the leakage have been investigated by several researchers. However, few studies have been found considering the effects of soil around the pipes on the leakage discharge. Here, the leakage from polyethylene pipes is simulated in the laboratory, selecting several soils with different specifications. The leak discharge equation is adjusted to evaluate the effects of soil characteristics. Accordingly, grain diameter greater than 10% and 50% passing, coefficient of uniformity, coefficient of curvature, liquidity limit, plastic limit, plasticity index and hydraulic permeability have been considered to represent the soil properties. It is observed that the leakage is changed in accordance with most of the above parameters. The effects of grain diameter greater than 50% passing, plastic limit and hydraulic permeability are higher on the leakage, comparing to those of other parameters. However, no meaningful relationship is observed between the leakage and some parameters. The effects of significant characteristics are shown by the equations presented in this study.</jats:p>",

Instead, I argue that banking is a service industry, which sets the terms and conditions whereby the private sector can create additional money for itself. The problem is that such money creation tends to be highly procyclical, so the question then becomes finding the best trade‐off between official control of that process and allowing sufficient flexibility for the private sector. I conclude by reviewing how Lord King's reform proposals, in his book on The End of Alchemy, might fit into this broader analysis.</jats:p>",

To evaluate the infectious risk of norovirus (NoV) in various applications of the reclaimed water, five types of ultrafiltration (UF) membrane treatments were considered: (1) coagulation with low pH + UF membrane process, (2) UF membrane process alone, (3) UF + ultraviolet (UV) irradiation process, (4) UF + nanofiltration (NF) membrane process, and (5) UF + reverse osmosis (RO) membrane process. These treatments were used in a pilot plant and the NoV concentration after each treatment process was studied over the long term (2010–2014). Infectious risk was described using disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) when the reclaimed water was applied for agricultural irrigation, landscape irrigation, recreational enhancement, and toilet and urinal flushing. The results show that reclaimed water could be considered acceptable for recreational enhancement by adding a UV, an NF membrane, or an RO membrane treatment to the UF membrane treatment process.</jats:p>",

Selecting the optimal intake is based on water quality and operators' experience; however, there is potential to optimise this process. In this study, a comprehensive hybrid (data-driven, chemical, and mathematical) intake optimisation model was developed, which firstly predicts the chemicals dosages, and then the total (chemicals and pumping) costs based on the water quality at different depths of the two reservoirs, thus identifying the cheapest option. A second data-driven, probabilistic model then forecasts the volume of the smaller LND 6 weeks ahead in order to minimise the depletion and spill risks. This is important in case the first model identifies this reservoir as the optimal intake solution, but this could lead in the long term to depletion and full reliance on the electricity-dependent Advancetown Lake. Both models were validated and proved to be accurate, and with the potential for substantial monetary savings for the water utility.</jats:p>",

This study proposes the new hydrological drought index, Korean Surface Water Supply Index (KSWSI), which overcomes some of the limitations in the calculation of previous SWSI applied in Korea and conducts the probabilistic drought forecasts using KSWSI. In this study, all hydrometeorological variables in the Geum River basin were investigated and appropriate variables were selected as KSWSI components for each sub-basin. And whereby only the normal distributions are applied to all drought components, probability distributions suitable for each KSWSI component were estimated. As a result of verifying KSWSIs, the accuracy of KSWSIs showed better drought phenomenon in drought events. The monthly probabilistic drought forecasts were also calculated based on ensemble technique using KSWSI. In 2006 and 2014 drought events, the accuracy of the drought forecasts using KSWSIs were higher than those using previous SWSI, demonstrating that KSWSI is able to enhance the accuracy of drought forecasts. The influence of expanding hydrometeorological components and selecting appropriate probability distributions for each KSWSI component were analyzed. It is confirmed that the accuracy of KSWSIs may be affected by the choice of hydrometerological components, the station data obtained, the length of used data for each station, and the probability distributions selected. Furthermore, the uncertainty quantification of the KSWSI calculation procedure was also carried out using the Maximum Entropy (ME) theory. The large MEs and standard deviations of KSWSIs in the flood season cause uncertainties, implying that the selection of the appropriate probability distributions for selected drought components in the flood season is very important.\n                        </jats:p>"

The prepared adsorbent was characterized by the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) surface analyzer, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The BET surface area and average particle size of the prepared PPy powder was 10.27 m2/g and ∼180–295 nm, respectively. Different adsorption parameters, such as adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH of the initial solution, temperature, initial ions and co-ions concentrations were investigated. The results showed that PPy powder acted as an effective sorbent for the removal of arsenic ions at the optimum conditions of pH 6.5 and a contact time of 6 h. The experimental data of PPy isotherms for arsenic ions followed the Freundlich isotherm model and kinetics data were well fitted to the pseudo-first-order model. Thermodynamically, the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous in nature. The FTIR and FESEM-EDX results also confirmed the presence of arsenic in adsorbents after adsorption. The presence of amine groups in PPy is believed to play the key role of adsorption of arsenic ions.</jats:p>",

The objectives of this desktop study were to investigate the feasibility of biogas use for substitution of presently used solid fuels in rural and peri-urban households, the subsequent health co-benefits, and the constraints to adoption of domestic biogas technology in South Africa. The energy demand of low-income South African households for cooking with fuelwood was found to be 27 MJ/day and the total energy demand 68 MJ/day. This is equivalent to 2 500 L/day/household of biogas for cooking and 6 250 L/day/household of biogas for complete substitution of conventional domestic fuels. Complete substitution of fuelwood used for cooking and household fuelwood use with biogas can result in the avoidance of 43% and 85.4% respectively of total disability adjusted life-years lost (702 790) and mortalities (22 365) from indoor smoke as a consequence of solid fuel use. Approximately 625 000 households in South Africa can potentially benefit from bio-digester fed with cattle and pig waste, on the basis of livestock numbers. It is infeasible to operate a domestic bio-digester fed solely with human waste, chicken waste and food waste because of insufficient feedstock. Non-sewered households with access to on- and off-site water supply generate sufficient greywater for feeding a domestic bio-digester for cooking purposes. This is, therefore, recommended over the use of drinking water.</jats:p>"

A fast growing population, expanding agricultural and industrial sectors and the impacts of climate variability, create demands for new water sources and innovative management of water resources and services. The object of this study is the water resources management in the lower Seybouse basin characterized by a steady increase of water demand to meet different uses. This study takes into account changes in water demand of different urban, agricultural and industrial supply process. Our approach is to integrate data in WEAP modelling software to simulate current and future water balance and then to analyse the situation of water in different scenarios, socio-economic development and climate change to 2050. This software is based on the representation of the feeding system in a form of the network of water demand and supply. Our findings reveal the vulnerability of the region in its ability to the pressures resulting from the increase of needs of different sectors at the horizon of the forecasted period. They also indicate the need for larger mobilization of new resources into the system and lay the foundations for a sustainable water policy in the northern region of the Seybouse valley.</jats:p>",

Considering the surrogate model's uncertainty, a chance-constrained programming (CCP) model was constructed, and it was solved by genetic algorithm. The results showed the following, for the problem considered in this study. (1) Compared with the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method, the OLHS method improves the space-filling degree of sample points considerably. (2) The effects of the two sampling methods on surrogate model performance were analyzed through comparison of goodness of fit, residual and uncertainty. The results indicated that the OLHS-based surrogate model performed better than the LHS-based surrogate model. (3) The optimal remediation strategies at 99%, 95%, 90%, 85%, 80% and 50% confidence levels were obtained, which showed that the remediation cost increased with the confidence level.

This article reviews the characteristics of the existing subjective and objective assessment methods, and introduces decision maker's preferences in the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for a better assessment of flood disaster level. The indicator weight vector of the fuzzy clustering iterative (FCI) model is used as the position vector of a particle in the approach herein proposed. The individuals that do not satisfy the preferences are screened out during the evolution process, in order to obtain more reasonable assessment results according to the preferences for the given scenario. The optimal weight vector of flood disaster samples is then obtained using FCI model combined with the proposed PSO with decision maker's preferences, referred to as PSODP algorithm. A case study of Xinjiang autonomous region of China demonstrates the results of flood rating using different decision maker's preferences, and provides several suggestions on preference type choice. This type of analysis could be used by the water conservation department to better classify the level of a disaster and channel resources accordingly, in the best way possible to manage the situation.</jats:p>",

Consequently, consolidating seepage prevention and treatment is important. When applied to seepage prevention works for tailings reservoirs, current seepage prevention technologies can cause destruction of the dam and require further construction sites. It is therefore essential to adopt new types of advanced and practical technologies. Aimed at studying the feasibility of the application of non-water reaction polymer grouting technology in seepage prevention of tailings reservoirs and acquiring the properties for practical engineering, an analysis of the environmental impact, chemical resistance and permeability of the polymer material, and the main technical characteristics of the polymer cutoff wall was conducted. The test results showed that the polymer grouting technology applied to seepage prevention works of a tailings reservoir caused little disturbance to the dam, possessed good anti-seepage performance and perfect durability. This study may provide a reference for the seepage control of tailings reservoirs.</jats:p>",

Considering stochastic inflows, an implicit stochastic optimization method is employed and a multi-objective parallel differential evolution algorithm is proposed to extract dispatching rules. Finally, a method which combines discriminant method and dispatching rules is proposed for practical operations and achieves good performance. Compared with routine scheduling, the power generations of the proposed method are improved observably in different typical years. The average power generation increases about 3% with the same cascade minimum output.</jats:p>",

This study addresses water allocation to urban-industrial, agricultural, and environmental water uses downstream of the Zarrineh-roud dam, Iran, which diverts water from the Zarrineh-roud River, an important tributary to Lake Urmia. Lake Urmia has been severely stressed by reduction of its water inputs. Water allocation is posed in this study as a bankruptcy game in which the allocation to stakeholders is optimized with proportional (P), adjusted proportional, constrained equal award (CEA), and constrained equal losses methods. The CEA was chosen as the best allocation method based on performance criteria and the Bankruptcy Allocation Sustainability Index. Monthly, real-time, water allocation rule curves were calculated with genetic programming.</jats:p>",

The population of this study was supply chain professionals in selected commercial banks in Ghana. A quantitative research technique was employed. The simple random sampling method was used to select 178 respondents from four (4) commercial banks. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Pearson’s correlation test and linear regression analysis were used to analyse data. Findings indicated that supply chain practices significantly influence firm performance, with supply chain practices accounting for 67.7% of the total variation in firm performance. Moreover, supply chain practices significantly influence each dimension of firm performance. Thus, it accounts for 89% of the total variation on market performance, while it accounts for 30.1% and 9.2% of the total variation on operational performance and financial performance respectively. It is therefore concluded that firm performance would improve when supply chain practices in the banks are enhanced. Generally, supply chain practices positively influence firm performance among the banks. This means that improved practices of supply chain would enhance firm performance among the banks.</jats:p>"

The performance of the agri-food chain significantly but negatively correlates with all the major risks studied.

The result implies that risks are inevitable in agri-food chain but they differ in terms of menace to the chain’s operation. Therefore, to manage agri-food supply chain risks effectively, managers should periodically identify, quantify and categorize risk sources before making risk response decisions. In addition, the results show that risks account for about half of the overall agri-food chain performance in Ghana. This infers that managers/practitioners could improve the performance of the agri-food chain if limited resources are allocated to plan and effectively respond to major risks sources (such as demand, supply, finance, weather and logistical/ infrastructural services-related risks) undermining the performance of the chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This research contributes to the agri-food chain risk literature and provides managers/practitioners with empirical evidence of risk thresholds and their corresponding major impact on agri-food chain’s performance.

An assumption stating that price changes are among the most important factors determining money demand function in Iraqi economy was adopted. It was found, using descriptive analysis of data available on economic variables that express money demand and its determinants (Non-petrol GDP, CPI, and interest rate) and the use of modern econometric techniques. And finally, after estimating money demand function of Iraqi economy, it was found that there is an important role of what is going on in price changes in money demand volume for the studied period, which confirms the hypothesis, due to exceptional conditions through which Iraqi economy went, and still suffering their consequences including wars, financial crisis, and fluctuations in petrol prices, which emphasizes the importance of conducting research and studies on money demand and its determining variables on a continuous basis to ensure the success of monetary policy in achieving its objectives.</jats:p>"

This paper analyses the role of branding for distributors in the context of a dynamic, competitive and disruptive market ie the lighting industry, as well as exploring the effects of changes in the behaviour and expectations of installers and contractors as the important customer group of electrical wholesalers. Interestingly, there is a dearth of research and data on the subjects of our research. We carried out personal interviews among 141 representatives of wholesalers and distributors and surveyed more than 2,000 electrical installers and contractors across five markets. We used a combination of correspondence and cluster analyses to evaluate the results of our survey and identified five distinct segments of electrical installers across the five countries. Our primary research reveals that price pressure is not the only major challenge facing wholesalers in the future. Adding real customer value through product and service innovations, adopting a customer-centric approach, and managing the transition to digital business are also important concerns. In light of these insights, developing and sustaining an appropriate brand proposition — one that includes knowing and catering to specific installer segments — seems important for electrical wholesalers. In this paper, the authors explain the four most important elements for a strong brand: a deep understanding of the customer, a strong value proposition based on the customer's needs, perfect execution of all customer touch points, and a performance management system that includes brand as a KPI.</jats:p>"

This study undertakes a time-series quantification (2001–2014) and comparative analysis of the energy use of the urban water supply systems and sewage systems in Melbourne and Sydney before, during and after the drought, and evaluates the energy implications of the drought and the implemented strategies. In addition, the energy implications of residential water use in Melbourne are estimated. The research highlights that large-scale adoption of water conservation strategies can have different impacts on energy use in different parts of the urban water cycle. In Melbourne, the per capita water-related energy use reduction in households related to showering and clothes-washing alone (46% reduction, 580 kWhth/p/yr) was far more substantial than that in the water supply system (32% reduction, 18 kWhth/p/yr). This historical case also demonstrates the importance of balancing supply- and demand-side strategies in managing long-term water security and related energy use. The significant energy saving in water supply systems and households from water conservation can offset the additional energy use from operating energy-intensive supply options such as inter-basin water transfers and seawater desalination during dry years.</jats:p>",

The level of demand for child labour is shown to be linked mainly to adult wage levels, the adult unemployment rate in an area, and the size of the informal and agriculture sectors. The supply of child labour is seen to be positively linked to the proportion of adult unemployment in the household. Unlike previous studies, the article analyses both demand and supply side factors in a context of poverty and takes account of the co-existence of formal and informal labour markets. Furthermore, to generalise the issue for a longer span of time (which previous studies fail to do), it adopts the methodology of a pseudo-panel approach based on that proposed by Deaton. This approach makes it possible to pinpoint more accurately the factors, and their interaction, that need to be considered in any effective policy approach to the issue of child labour. To prevent unintended consequences, a multi-faceted development approach is required.</jats:p>",

In humanitarian organizations the “customer” is the donor or supplier of goods. The study was conducted at the World Food Programme (WFP) which started operating in Somalia in 1967 and focusing on rural agricultural development and school feeding projects. At the onset of WFP operations, the conflict escalated and the humanitarian needs expanded as well. Today the WFP Somalia goal is to address basic food needs, strengthen coping mechanisms and support the efforts to achieve food security of vulnerable Somalis. The organization has its regional office in charge of operations and supply chain in Nairobi as well as the Somalia liaison office. There are rare studies focusing on supply chain relationship among humanitarian organizations particularly on the challenges of getting supplies on time due financial and other supply chain constraints. This is the gap this study sought to address. In order to achieve the objectives, the population of the study was the WFP employees (senior and the supply chain staff) in both the regional and the liaison office and the WFP food suppliers based in Nairobi. The sample comprised of 87 WFP employees and 7 personnel from the WFP food supplier family. Data was collected from 63 respondents who filled and returned the questionnaires representing a response rate rate of 72%. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyse the data collected in order to meet the objectives of the study. The results revealed that WFP continuously trains employees from the supply chain department and has mechanisms for ensuring suppliers conform to quality standards. It was also found that ICT is used in the execution and management of purchase orders. On WFP humanitarian supply chain performance, results indicated that WFP Somalia delivers defect free food supplies to beneficiaries by working closely with the internal staff and the logistics operators. The study recommends that WFP’s management should begin rewarding suppliers who share information for effective supply chain management. The organization should not only have multiple supply tiers but should also be well vast with each tiers risk profile to enable the organization mitigate any unforeseen events that may affect delivery of supplies especially during emergencies.</jats:p>"

The Larson ratio (LR) is a non-CaCO3 based index for measuring water corrosivity against iron pipes, but the involved mechanisms and application of LR are not completely understood. To understand the applicability of the two indices on iron corrosion product release in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS), unlined cast iron pipes were harvested from a real DWDS to establish pilot-scale experimental systems, and different chemicals were used to adjust LR and CCPP values of the pipe feed waters. Results showed that iron release increased with LR increase, but at the same LR, chloride adjustment could lead to more iron release than sulphate. When using different chemicals to adjust CCPP to the same level, the iron release could be significantly different, with NaHCO3 addition causing the lowest release. Increasing the alkalinity by Ca(OH)2 and CO2, which could be the most efficient and economic method for inhibiting iron release in DWDS, increased the CCPP and reduced the LR simultaneously. The crystalline composition characteristics of iron pipe corrosion scales also played a critical role in the iron release behavior.</jats:p>",

Verticulture is a way of planting in a vertical arrangement, such as for Capsicum frutescens L. This study aimed to examine the root anatomy and growth responses of C. frutescens L. Fourteen days old seedlings were grown in polybags on the ground and into vertical pots made of paralon pipe. Watering was given for every day, once in 3 days, and once in 6 days were apllied for 35 days, at elevation of 0 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm and 75 cm. The lower watering supply decreased the root diameter due to the thinner of cortical, xylem and stele tissues. Decreased  in plant height, leaf number, length-width of leaves, and fresh and dry weight of root-shoots were also observed in low watering plants, but there were increases in roots length and leaves chlorophyll content. The xylem was less developed in plants at higher position compared to the lower positon and this was more detected in plants with less watering. Decreasing plant growth occurs in conditions of water shortage and the higher plant layout on paralon, while root vascullar tissue was less developed in less watering and higher position plants.  Keywords: anatomy, biomass, roots, verticulture, watering</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Money-back guarantee (MBG) is a well-known service offered by many retailers. Under the MBG policy, a purchased item by a consumer can be returned for a full refund. In this paper, we explore a supply chain (SC) system comprising of one retailer, which offers the money-back guarantee policy and faces a stochastic demand. With a given supply contract offered by the supplier, the retailer makes decisions on the order quantity and the market coverage of the money-back guarantee service. With reference to real-world practices, we examine three models, namely, (1) the traditional wholesale pricing model without the buyback contract, (2) the model with a buyback contract (between the supplier and the retailer) for unsold items, and (3) a dual-buyback (DB) contract model for both unsold and consumer returned items. We find that using the buyback contract alone for unsold items cannot achieve Pareto improving supply chain coordination, whereas the DB contract can. Numerical findings also indicate that the DB contract can lead to an expansion of the money-back guarantee service program to cover more customers. This paper’s findings support the implementation of the DB contract, which is commonly seen in the industry, for efficient supply chain management in the presence of the money-back guarantee service program. </jats:p>",

As a result, reducing losses from water supply systems (WSSs) is of great environmental importance around the world. In France, water suppliers are legally bound to reduce losses from their WSSs through loss reduction action plans (LRAPs). For these plans to work, they need to suit the area to which they are applied. Their impacts on water bodies (WBs) and the environment also need to be taken into account. This paper explains an innovative approach to fulfil these objectives. It involves adding two elements to the design of LRAPs: calculation of a water abstraction and discharge balance (WADB) and analysis of environmental effects (AEE) relating to loss reduction actions, based on life cycle assessment. The usefulness and the practicality of this approach are examined through two practical case studies. It is shown that the WADB allows LRAPs to be configured to optimise water savings in the most sensitive WBs. AEE makes it possible to identify a loss reduction level above which the overall environmental balance becomes negative. While the LRAP design and the WADB calculation methods are ready to be used by WSS managers, the AEE still requires further improvement.</jats:p>",

One such change involves Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which posits an alternative attitude for companies towards business, the natural environment and society. The supply chain structure provides an excellent framework to disseminate the CSR idea among other members. That process is affected by different factors, including the level of internationalization of a given business. The purpose of this paper is to specify relations between the international nature of operations and CSR approach in 150 Polish companies. To better understand these relations a literature review and statistical analysis are conducted. Methods used in the quantitative analysis are a frequency analysis (with usage of One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov and One-Sample Chi-Square tests) and a correlation analysis (Spearman ratio). This research addresses a gap concerning international aspects of supply chain operations and its CSR sensitivity. The results can be used to support supply chain decision makers when applying CSR in their companies as well as can be an outgoing source of data for further, more detailed research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As power plant combustion turbines (CTs) are pushed towards higher thermal efficiencies, increased attention is being given to operating requirements for their fuel gas supply such as the maximum allowable rate-of-change in pressure. It is important to perform detailed analyses for multi-unit plants to ascertain whether pressure transient events, such as those caused by initial trip of one or two combustion turbines, will cause additional combustion turbines to trip off. In this paper, single and dual CT trips were postulated in a near-realistic combined cycle power plant. Predictions of the gas flow behavior, along with propagation and superposition of pressure waves, was carried out using the method of characteristics (MOC) for compressible flows. Specifically, the rate of change in fuel gas supply pressure to each CT was monitored and compared against a typical manufacturer limit of 0.8 bar/s. Instances where simulations showed this threshold exceeded were noted, since such events correspond to automatic valve closure that would shut down one more CT and thereby further reduce plant electrical output.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The overall goal of fuel gas transient analyses is to improve pipeline designs, iteratively when necessary, such that those additional trips are avoided. To that end, this paper presents several simulation cases to illustrate pressure transient phenomena and to show the impact of various pipeline design alterations, some of which caused 40% reductions in the worst pressure rate-of-change during simulations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier in the clean energy systems currently being developed. However, its effectiveness in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions requires conducting a lifecycle analysis of the process by which hydrogen is produced and supplied. This study focuses on the hydrogen for the transport sector, in particular renewable hydrogen that is produced from wind- or solar PV-powered electrolysis. A life cycle inventory analysis is conducted to evaluate the Well-to-Tank (WtT) GHG emissions from various renewable hydrogen supply chains. The stages of the supply chains include hydrogen being produced overseas, converted into a transportable hydrogen carrier (liquid hydrogen or methylcyclohexane), imported to Japan by sea, distributed to hydrogen filling stations, restored from the hydrogen carrier to hydrogen and filled into fuel cell vehicles. For comparison, an analysis is also carried out with hydrogen produced by steam reforming of natural gas. Foreground data related to the hydrogen supply chains are collected by literature surveys and the Japanese life cycle inventory database is used as the background data. The analysis results indicate that some of renewable hydrogen supply chains using liquid hydrogen exhibited significantly lower WtT GHG emissions than those of a supply chain of hydrogen produced by reforming of natural gas. A significant piece of the work is to consider the impacts of variations in the energy and material inputs by performing a probabilistic uncertainty analysis. This suggests that the production of renewable hydrogen, its liquefaction, the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane and the compression of hydrogen at the filling station are the GHG-intensive stages in the target supply chains.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, after many empirical experiments with many wavelet families, it has been found that Daubechies, Coiflets, Discrete Meyer(dmey) and Symlet wavelets are very suitable when denoising the data and out of these four wavelet families, the Daubechies and Discrete Meyer performed better.</jats:p>"

However, the existing SWRO desalination process still needs further improvement to lower the energy consumption. Recently, a novel hybrid SWRO desalination system using pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) technology has been studied, which can recover a large amount of osmotic power from the concentrated brine. In this study, GS Engineering &amp; Construction Corp. (GS E&amp;C) developed an advanced SWRO-PRO process to economically couple this PRO technology with a conventional SWRO desalination process. To investigate the SWRO-PRO process, pilot and demonstration plants, of 20 m3/d and 240 m3/d PRO treatment capacity, were constructed and thin-film composite spiral-wound PRO membrane modules (8 inches) were assessed. The operating parameters of the pilot plants, such as pressure, temperature, and flow rates of the draw solution and the feed solution, were found to be important factors determining the plant energy consumption and operating efficiency. An economic analysis of a large-scale SWRO-PRO hybrid desalination is also described.</jats:p>",

The results show that the values of proxies (TOC, TN, TP, δ13C, C/N) increased significantly after 2000 compared with before, which indicates Lake Hulun has heightened nutrient level and pollution extent, thus induced growth of algal bloom and water quality deteriorated after 2000. Since the event of decreased river discharge and lowered water level began in 2000 corresponds extremely well with our sedimentary records that nutrients pollution and eutrophication occurred in Lake Hulun at the same moment, the change of river discharge can be seen as the primary and direct reason of lake water quality deterioration in this period. In addition, the increased wind and water erosion as a result of serious and widespread destruction of grassland in Lake Hulun basin is the potential factors for changing the nutrients concentration in Lake Hulun.</jats:p>",

A comparative analysis of flexible manufacturing systems, economics, evolutionary biology, and supply chain management is conducted to identify the most important characteristics of flexibility. Evolutionary biology emphasises overlapping functions and multi-functionality, which allow a system with structurally different elements to perform the same function, enhancing resilience. In economics, marginal cost and marginal expected profit are factors that are considered to be important in incorporating flexibility while making changes to the system. In flexible manufacturing systems, the size of choice sets is important in creating flexibility, as initial actions preserve more options for future actions that will enhance resilience. Given the dynamic nature of flexibility, identifying the characteristics that can lead to flexibility will introduce a crucial dimension to designing resilient and sustainable socio-ecological systems with a long-term perspective in mind.</jats:p>"

Scanning electron microscope visual expressed that on the relatively smooth surface of raw scoria (RS) a large amount of micro pores and dense bulk-like structures after modification and filtration appeared. The data from Fourier transform infrared showed that the intrinsic scoria structure was unchanged during modification. The X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy instrumental studies revealed that the newborn manganese oxide layer was a mixed-valence of manganese (Mn3+ and Mn4+) which could absorb the Mn2+ and catalytically facilitate oxidation with oxygen. Subsequently, the adsorption capacity of RS and MOCS was demonstrated in adsorption experiments. The kinetics of manganese adsorption by RS and MOCS followed pseudo-second-order with the correlation coefficients of 0.983 and 0.989, respectively. The experimental data were better fitted to Langmuir isotherm than Freundlich isotherm, indicating that the monolayer adsorption process for manganese was acting on the surface of RS and MOCS. The filtration experiment showed high Mn2+ removal efficiency by MOCS in a wide range of hydraulic retention time (15–40 min) in 40 days, which demonstrated that the MOCS is a good potential application prospect for manganese removal from groundwater.</jats:p>",

We consider a three-stage supply chain, consisting of a R&amp;D firm, a manufacturer, and a seller. We develop six supply chain models based on various structures and power dynamics, and reveal important implications by comparing the models. R&amp;D performance is a function of supply chain structure; an integrated supply chain can expect improved performance. The selling price is a function of power dynamics, and is higher when R&amp;D has bargaining power. Market and profit performances are higher in an integrated, manufacturer-led supply chain. The manufacturer’s role must be revisited; due to its location in the middle of the supply chain, the manufacturer can directly control the overall chain. On the other hand, a R&amp;D firm could innately be associated with marginalization issues. Therefore, it is important for the R&amp;D firm to have a systematic understanding of the entire system. This study contributes to the literature and practice by not only bridging the gap in the previous studies but also offering important managerial implications.</jats:p>"

However, the existing algorithms usually have disadvantages such as the ‘curse of dimensionality’ and prematurity. This study proposes a grey discrete differential dynamic programming (GDDDP) algorithm for effectively optimizing the cascaded reservoir operation model, which is a combination of the grey forecasting model and discrete differential dynamic programming (DDDP). Additionally, a modification of the grey forecasting model is presented for better forecast accuracy. The proposed method is applied to optimize the Baishan-Fengman cascaded reservoir system in the northeast of China. The results show that GDDDP obtains more power generation than DDDP with less computing time in three cases, i.e., dry years, wet years and the whole series. Especially in the case of the whole series, the power generation of GDDDP is 2.13 MWH more than that of DDDP, while the computing time is decreased by 66,161 ms. Moreover, the power generation of GDDDP is comparable with that of dynamic programming but the computing time is much less. All these indicate GDDDP has high accuracy and efficiency, which implies that it is practicable for the operation of a cascaded reservoir system.</jats:p>",

The understanding of the relationship between the level of adoption of LSC practices and the contextual variables helps to anticipate occasional difficulties and sets the proper expectations along the implementation.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) is a novel, simple and inexpensive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based genotyping method which relies on the detection of different copy numbers inside each VNTR locus. In this study, we evaluated MLVA as a tool for the genotyping of E. coli strains of water samples collected from the Karaj River, Iran. Overall, high genetic diversity was observed among environmental E. coli isolates.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT The forest transportation represents a great proportion of raw material cost for pulp and paper production and, for this reason, the wood moisture content should be low to reduce these cost. The objective was to relate the wood moisture with fuel consumption per kilometer in each vehicle and the number of trips to supply a pulp mill. Three trees of Eucalyptus urophylla clone and three of Corymbia citriodora from seeds were used. These trees were felled and their logs removed from its base and at 50 and 100% of the commercial height. The basic density and initial moisture of wood were determined and the air drying monitored during 90 days. The fuel consumption to transport one ton of dry wood and the number of trips required to supply a pulp mill were estimated based on the number of air drying days. Air drying reduced the fuel consumption and the number of trips to supply the pulp mill. The accuracy of models to estimate the wood moisture, fuel consumption and the number of trips based in days of drying was high. Therefore, wood drying is an essential tool to reduce forest transport costs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Engine oil lubricated (semi) floating ring bearing (S)FRB systems in passenger vehicle turbochargers (TC) operate at temperatures well above ambient and must withstand large temperature gradients that can lead to severe thermo-mechanical induced stresses. Physical modeling of the thermal energy flow paths and an effective thermal management strategy are paramount to determine safe operating conditions ensuring the TC component mechanical integrity and the robustness of its bearing system. On occasion, the selection of one particular bearing parameter to improve a certain performance characteristic could be detrimental to other performance characteristics of a TC system. The paper details a thermohydrodynamic model to predict the hydrodynamic pressure and temperature fields and the distribution of thermal energy flows in the bearing system. The impact of the lubricant supply conditions (pressure and temperature), bearing film clearances, oil supply grooves on the ring ID surface are quantified. Lubricating a (S)FRB with either a low oil temperature or a high supply pressure increases (shear induced) heat flow. A lube high supply pressure or a large clearance allow for more flow through the inner film working towards drawing more heat flow from the hot journal, yet raises the shear drag power as the oil viscosity remains high. Nonetheless, the peak temperature of the inner film is not influenced much by the changes on the way the oil is supplied into the film as the thermal energy displaced from the hot shaft into the film is overwhelming. Adding axial grooves on the inner side of the (S)FRB improves its dynamic stability, albeit increasing the drawn oil flow as well as the drag power and heat flow from the shaft. The predictive model allows to identify a compromise between different parameters of groove designs thus enabling a bearing system with a low power consumption.</jats:p>",

Attention has been paid to the problem of risk assessment in the context of risk acceptance criteria. An example of criteria application was shown for the exemplary water supply network. The water network indicators: failure frequency, time of failure removal, repair time and intensity of renewal, were calculated. The obtained information was used to describe the general characteristics of the examined system and the technical conditions of the WSS.

This study investigates a novel application of correlated online searches in predicting stock performance across supply chain partners. If two firms are economically dependent through a supply chain relationship and if information related to both firms diffuses in the market slowly or rapidly, then our ability to predict stock returns increases or decreases, respectively. We use online cosearches of stock as a proxy for the extent of information diffusion across supply chain-related firms. We identify publicly traded supply chain partners using Bloomberg data and construct cosearch networks of supply chain partners based on the weekly coviewing pattern of these firms on Yahoo! Finance. Our analyses show that the cosearch intensity across supply chain partners helps determine cross-return predictability. When investors of a focal stock pay less attention to its supply chain partners, we can use lagged partner returns to predict the future return of the focal stock. When investors’ coattention to focal and partner stocks is high, the predictability is low. Our simulated trading strategy using returns of supply chain partners with low coattention generates a significant and positive return above the market returns and performs better than the previously established trading strategy using returns of all supply chain partners. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2016.0656 . </jats:p>",

This study evaluated the relevance of 10 known corrosion indices according to their estimate of corrosion rate and iron particle release for 20 different water qualities. Pilot-scale contact trials were run over 45 days using cast iron and steel coupons. Corrosion rate was measured by coupon weight-loss and by an online linear polarization rate probe. Particle release was monitored by an online turbidimeter. The results showed that none of the indices properly predicted the level of risk associated with each water and that corrosion and particle release were not correlated. Two novel indices were developed to predict the corrosion and particle release risks independently of each other. The corrosion index showed a strong linear correlation with the corrosion rate of cast iron and slightly less reliable results for steel. The Particle Emission Index presented good correlation with turbidity in waters following contact with cast iron. These two indices thus showed interesting potential as tools to limit internal corrosion risks for metal pipes in water distribution networks.</jats:p>",

In order to detect the changing trend of surface water quantity in the river basin, the long-term statistic data of sediment load and river discharge were gathered over the period between 1987 and 2013. For land use change detection of the river basin, the land use land cover maps of the study area in the years of 1987, 1998, 2002, 2009, and 2013 were prepared from Landsat satellite images using supervised classification method. The changing trend of river discharge showed a significant and positive relationship with rain-fed agriculture (R2 = 0.8152), poor rangeland (R2 = 0.7978), and urban areas (R2 = 0.8377). There was also a strong negative correlation between water discharge and irrigated agriculture (R2 = 0.7286) and good rangeland (R2 = 0.8548). In conclusion, increasing the area of rain-fed agriculture, good rangeland (type IV), and urban land uses, due to their effects on increasing the runoff, have caused an increase in the water flow of Zanjanroud River.</jats:p>",

It presents a new approach for assessing water service provision risk that considers the chronology of the series of causes, impacts and consequences to business outcomes including reputational, public health and supply continuity. The approach allows assessment of the relationship between causes and impacts, the potential for threat convergence, and the appropriateness, effectiveness, interdependence and criticality of controls. The provision of whole-of-system risk visibility allows better targeting of controls along the supply chain in preventive, detective or corrective timeframes, and at local site to corporate business levels. The approach allows enabling functions of the business such as information technology, human resources and safety to be assessed within the context of supply quality and continuity. An example of the application of this method to provision of water services shows the benefits of the method. Application of the methodology to the assessment of the whole-of-business risk is discussed.</jats:p>",

Over the past decade, several studies have analyzed various currency supply chains across the world. This study provides an overview of this research. The structure of a general banknote supply chain is given before the discussion of the problems from three different perspectives: (i) the supply side, that is, the parties who are in charge of supplying currency in the supply chain; (ii) the demand side, that is, the parties who request the currency; and (iii) the secure third‐party logistics providers. We also provide a framework for analyzing the US coin supply chain and descriptions of the coin supply chains in other countries. Future research directions are proposed based on the research work carried out so far and for the field in general. </jats:p>",

To carry out this study, secondary data were collected from official documents of municipal governments of these two cities. According to the results, there are differences in stationary energy GHG emissions due to the big distinction concerning electricity emission factors used by each city. Air transportation GHG emissions are also very different. These two cities share some common figures regarding road transportation and per capita waste sector GHG emissions. In the conclusion section, we discuss opportunities for improvement of the cities’ GHG emission inventories as well as some implications for policy-making and future researches on carbon accounting, with focus on an integrated production-consumption system.</jats:p>"

Firstly, different control strategies of boost converters such as peak current controlled PFC, average current controlled PFC and hysteresis current controlled PFC are discussed for minimising input current distortions and improving the power quality. Also, the current loop gain stability analyses are presented using small‐signal model for selecting the best model and optimisation of the same. Secondly, the important key parameters such as cost, size, weight, complexity in implementation and other application dependent parameters of various isolated type of DC–DC converter topologies are compared and the best DC–DC converter topology is selected for the proposed application. Finally, the modelling and stability analysis is performed on the DC–DC converter and optimisation is achieved for the welding current controller. The software packages MATLAB/Plecs/OrCAD PSpice are used for simulation and implementation of the desired circuitry with optimised design. A prototype has been developed based on optimised design, hysteresis current controller for PFC and DC–DC converter; and the control algorithm is implemented DSP TMS320F2812 and the experimental results were discussed.</jats:p>",

In this study, we presented the effects of afforestation on water supply and soil loss prevention. A spatio-temporal simulation of forest water yield and soil loss was performed from 1971–2010 using InVEST water yield and SWAT models. A forest stock change map was produced by combining land cover data and National Forest Inventory data. The forest water yield increased about twice with changes in forest stock and climate from 1971–2010 and showed a spatially homogeneous water supply capacity. In the same period, the soil loss decreased more than three times, and the volatility of soil loss, in the 2010s, was smaller than before. The analysis of the change in forest stock without considering climate change showed an increase of 43% in forest water yield and a decrease of 87% in soil loss. An increase in precipitation increased the water yield, but also increased the soil loss volume. A change in forest stock led to positive changes in both. This study presents functional positive effects of the afforestation program in South Korea that can be useful in various afforestation programs in other countries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cities are places of countless logistics processes, i.e. the processes of flow of all kinds of resources: human, material, information. The basic problem of contemporary cities are factors limiting their sustainable development. Most of them originate from excessive congestion caused by individual motorization and road freight transport. In recent years, supply chains intensively develop and implement new information technologies. That aims at rationalizing the business logistics processes by improving the information flows which is followed by reducing the demand for physical resources and the reduction of processing time and costs. Because the cities are large areas of logistics processes related to the economic activities of enterprises, the purpose of this article is to answer the following question: how do new information technologies, used in logistics processes, influence the structure of resources mobility in urban areas and how they can help in solving problems of congestion in urban areas. The main assumption of the study is that information flows can partially substitute real flows, which leads to the main thesis of the research that new technologies which streamline the flows of information in B2B and B2C relation can reduce the demand for goods and human flows within the cities. That rationalization translates into changes of resources demand structure and thus a change in demand for their mobility. The study used analysis and deduction method based on the literature and real life examples in the field of information technology which are already in use and those that can be used soon in logistics processes. This field of research is underdeveloped because logisticians focus their research on economization of business logistics processes and do not pay much attention to how they can influence urban areas.</jats:p>"

Although rocketry has proven to be an exacting science with highly predictable results, the same cannot be said for physician workforce planning in Canada. The “boom” in physician supply in the 1960s and 1970s was followed by a “bust” in the early 1990s and a further boom in the 2000s. A large generational shift in the physician population is anticipated between now and 2030; the proportion of “boomers” (1946-1964) will drop from 43% to 16% of the practising profession. Canada has not been alone in increasing physician supply. Any judgement as to whether too many or too few physicians are being trained must consider the drivers and mitigators of both supply and demand. Although there are current concerns about a shortage of practice opportunities for some specialties, the available data do not indicate a physician surplus on the horizon in Canada. </jats:p>",

The main phases of Fe3O4@C were magnetite, graphite and amorphous carbon. The adsorption kinetics of iron (III) ions on Fe3O4@C could be expressed by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the adsorption isotherm was fitted by a Freundlich model.

Exposure early-in-life to increased MCFA levels might affect development and impact (lipid) metabolism later in life. We tested whether an increased MCFA intake early-in-life positively affects adult body composition and metabolic status when challenged by a western-style diet (WSD). Male offspring of C57Bl/6j mice and Wistar rats were fed a control diet (CTRL; 10 w% fat, 14% MCFA) or a medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) diet with 20% MCFA until postnatal (PN) day 42, whereupon animals were fed a WSD (10 w% fat) until PN day 98. Body composition was monitored by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). In rats, glucose homeostasis was assessed by glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT); in mice, the HOmeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. At autopsy on PN day 98, plasma lipid profiles, glucose, insulin, and adipokines were measured; organs and fat pads were collected and the adipocyte size distribution was analysed. Milk analysis in mice showed that the maternal MCT diet was not translated into milk, and pups were thus only exposed to high MCT levels from early weaning onward: PN day 16 until 42. Mice exposed to MCT showed 28% less fat accumulation vs. CTRL during WSD. The average adipocyte cell size, fasting plasma triglycerides (TG), and leptin levels were reduced in MCT mice. In rats, no effects were found on the adult body composition, but the adipocyte cell size distribution shifted towards smaller adipocytes. Particularly mice showed positive effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Increased MCFA intake early-in-life protected against the detrimental effects of an obesogenic diet in adulthood.</jats:p>"

The modified Mts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential and thermal analysis. The adsorption of As(V) onto modified Mts as a function of initial As(V) concentration, contact time and solution pH was investigated. The removal efficiency was increased with increasing the As(V) concentration and contact time; however, it was decreased with increasing solution pH. The maximum As(V) adsorption capacities of Mt-Arg and Mt-Lys were 11.5 and 11 mg/g, respectively, which were five times larger than pristine Mt. The high adsorption capacity makes them promising candidates for arsenic removal from contaminated water. The regeneration studies were carried out up to 10 cycles for both modified Mts. The obtained results confirmed that the modified adsorbents could also be effectively used for As(V) removal from water for multiple adsorption – desorption cycles.</jats:p>",

The study was conducted in the years 2010–2015. Six characteristic research periods were identified (one per each calendar year), when the amount of sewage in the sanitary sewage system was greater than during dry weather. The analysis of changes in the amount of sewage supplied to the sewerage system in the six investigated periods revealed that the accidental water constituted from 26.8% to 48.4% of total sewage inflowing to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In exceptional situations, during intense rains, the share of precipitation water in the sewerage system would increase up to 75%. Then, the rainwater inflowing the sewerage system caused hydraulic overloading of the WWTP by exceeding its maximum design supply.</jats:p>",

Seed farming of native plant species is crucial to meet restoration goals, but may be stymied by the disconnection of academic research in seed science and the lack of effective policies that regulate native seed production/supply. To illustrate this problem, we identified 1,122 plant species important for European grasslands of conservation concern and found that only 32% have both fundamental seed germination data available and can be purchased as seed. The “<jats:italic>restoration species pool,”</jats:italic>or set of species available in practice, acts as a significant biodiversity selection filter for species use in restoration projects. For improvement, we propose: (1) substantial expansion of research and development on native seed quality, viability, and production; (2) open‐source knowledge transfer between sectors; and (3) creation of supportive policy intended to stimulate demand for biodiverse seed.</jats:p>",

The results have shown that the highest potential to support natural reproduction of Sevan trout is in the middlestream part of Lichq river, as well as in the downstream part of Bakhtak river and the part of Bakhtak-Tsakqar system near the connection of the Bakhtak and Tsakqar rivers; however, all these areas need some remediation to achieve ‘high potential’.</jats:p>",

This paper analyzes the characteristics of the IGBT and MSP430 and then designs a high-frequencyinverter control circuit based on MSP430. The PWM control wave is outputted in software by MSP430, and the PWMwave is amplified by the driver circuit for driving the half-bridge inverter main circuit made up of two IGBT components.Controllability includes adjustable frequency, variable duty cycle and dead time variable and several other aspects ofPWM waves. This design realizes reducing losses and improving the efficiency of the overall circuit purposes. Meanwhile,the other circuit configuration such as driver and protection circuits in the entire system are also made somecorresponding design description. Finally, the design of the control system is made further verification by IAR softwaredownload debugging. The final results prove that PWM control circuit based on drive and protection circuits can workand the frequency, duty cycle, dead time of the PWM can be adjusted. A brief analysis about the advantages anddisadvantages of the entire circuit is reported and some improved methods are also presented at the end of this paper. </jats:p>"

This study applies the anarchic society optimization (ASO) algorithm to find the optimal location and elevation of auxiliary tanks in urban water networks. The ASO is validated with mathematical benchmark functions, and is implemented to determine the location and elevation of auxiliary tanks in two urban water networks. The fuzzy reliability index for urban water network ranges between 74 and 79%, which is close to the global optima. The ASO exhibited better performance optimizing the reliability of WDNs than the genetic algorithm.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT  Purpose:  To evaluate the universe of published articles that propose frameworks about the relationship between green supply chain management (GSCM) and performance in the period from 1995 to 2014, in order to propose a conceptual model that can be applied to future studies, considering the green profile besides the practices of GSCM and performance.  Originality/gap/relevance/implications: The investigation revealed a lack of relationship among the organizations' profile, its environmental, economic and operational performance and GSCM practices.  Key methodological aspects: The relationship among constructs was established through bibliometric analysis obtained in the models/frameworks of GSCM practices and performance extracted from the databases \"ProQuest\", \"EBSCO\", \"JSTOR\", \"Web of Science\" and \"Scopus\". Further, the content analysis and network analysis were then performed.  Summary of key results: GSCM internal and external practices, environmental performance, economic performance and operational performance were revealed as main topics addressed in GSCM. Moreover, it was noted that studies on internal practices prevailed over those addressed to other practices.  Key considerations/conclusions: The models studied did not consider whether the corporate green profile could improve the performance of the organization. Therefore, they did not simultaneously measure environmental, economic and operational performance. It was concluded that the addition of the green profile in conjunction with GSCM practices and performance allows for a more in-depth analysis of the degree of a company's involvement with GSCM, as well as its intended objectives and results achieved in the future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The potential of wood raw material in the Slovenian forest wood supply chain is often insufficiently exploited. The promotion of its more rational use, while having indirect effects on the wider economic environment, is necessary to: (1) ensure the effective functioning of the entire forest wood supply chain, providing products with high added value; and (2) fully exploit the potential of wood raw material in terms of quality. In the article we examined added value of beechwood products, identified key challenges in this evaluation, and the relationships with other economic indicators that affect business decisions. Beechwood products were classified according to the amount of value added, and thereby the potential of beechwood raw materials was demonstrated in terms of both the impact on society and economic development. We thus confirmed the importance of the development and operation of the entire forest wood supply chain, and the importance of government economic policy in its functioning. More specifically, the state of primary wood processing as an important part of forest wood supply chain in Slovenia was examined, and some reasons for its ineffectiveness were identified. The availability of raw materials based on quality and purpose of use, and the value added per cubic meter of beechwood, were assessed in order to prove the reasonableness of investments in the newest technologies for hardwood processing and veneer production.</jats:p>"

This research conceptualises the dimensions and contingencies of CSR in SME supply chains. Drawing on institutional theory and stakeholder theory, we investigated the degree of importance and implementation of CSR practices in SMEs. A large‐scale questionnaire survey with SMEs in manufacturing sectors and panel discussions were conducted in South Korea. The findings indicate that SMEs tend to focus on explicit CSR practices that can be easily identified by their customers. Consistent with this, stakeholder and institutional pressures were valid in the performance of CSR practices, but largely biased to customers, government, and regulatory pressures. Based on institutional theory and stakeholder theory as overarching theoretical lenses, this research contributes to a fuller understanding of the dimensions of CSR practices in the supply chains from an SME perspective.

Two types of PACl-Ch coagulant were synthetized as PACl-Ch I and PACl-Ch II with chitosan to aluminum (Ch:Al) weight ratios of 0.5 and 1.0, respectively, and were used for defluoridation under different operating conditions. The composite coagulants were found to be more efficient than both PACl and chitosan. By an increase in the Ch:Al ratio from 0.5 to 1.0, the composite coagulant provided a little more efficiency of fluoride removal and lower residual level of Al. The optimum conditions of pH for fluoride removal by PACl-Ch I and PACl-Ch II were 8.0 and 7.5, respectively. Fluoride removal by the coagulants was not significantly affected by natural organic matter and turbidity, but was declined by high concentrations of common ions. To achieve desirable fluoride levels (lower than 1.0 mg/L) for natural water samples with fluoride levels of 2.0–2.9 mg/L, the required dosage of the composite coagulants were determined to be as low as 3–5 mgAl/L. The PACl-Ch coagulants demonstrated high efficiency for fluoride removal as well as low Al residual level (mainly lower than 0.2 mg/L) in a wide range of operating conditions.</jats:p>",

Reservoir operation and climate change have an effect on the thermal regime. The Jinpen Reservoir is a large canyon-shaped reservoir located in Shaanxi Province with a strong thermal stratification, which resulted in an anaerobic condition in the hypolimnion. We used a hydrodynamic module based on MIKE 3 to simulate the thermal structure of the Jinpen Reservoir and study the relationship between the thermal regime, reservoir operation and climate change. Based on the daily hydrological and climatic data from 2004 to 2013, we made 13 hypothetical simulated conditions that included extreme change of inflow volume, water level, air temperature, radiation, inflow water temperature and selective withdrawal to explore the effect of different factors on the thermal regime. The results showed that the period of thermal stratification, water column stability and surface water temperature were influenced by these factors. With the increase of air temperature, the simulation results indicated a stronger thermal stratification and a higher surface water temperature, which could cause water safety problems. Deep withdrawal could decrease water column stability and prompt water column mixing early, which could be used by reservoir managers to optimize the reservoir operation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many developing countries suffer severe energy deficiencies despite their ample reserves of resources – the so‐called predicament of “ resource rich, energy poor.\" A leading driver is the energy‐economy cycle, where poor economic status, inefficient utilization of limited budget, and energy deficiency reinforced each other and led these countries into a spiral of economic downfall. How to turn this cycle around? It is a classic question but not well answered in the energy policy/economics literature and barely studied in the operations management literature. We apply supply chain design and location optimization models to address the unique features of the energy sector in these countries and present a new class of mathematical models for designing coal‐fired energy supply chains. The model captures the interaction among different parts of an integrated energy supply chain, the unique economics of power transmission such as yield losses, the political issues associated with equity, and the dynamic interaction among energy consumption, economy and budget. The model attempts to answer the classic question by determining the optimal and politically feasible ways to build up an energy supply chain under limited budgets for energy security and economic prosperity. Applying the model to Pakistan's recent energy crises, we show that the solutions can significantly outperform the government's plan by reducing the energy gaps faster, boosting the economy stronger with less greenhouse gas emissions. We develop insights as to how an energy supply chain should be built up strategically for developing countries, and how various system parameters may affect the results. </jats:p>",

In adopting increased compute specialization, however, the relative amount of time spent on communication increases. System and software optimizations for communication often come at the costs of increased complexity and reduced portability. The Decoupled Supply-Compute (DeSC) approach offers a way to attack communication latency bottlenecks automatically, while maintaining good portability and low complexity. Our work expands prior Decoupled Access Execute techniques with hardware/software specialization. For a range of workloads, DeSC offers roughly 2 × speedup, and additional specialized compression optimizations reduce traffic between decoupled units by 40%.</jats:p>",

Fluorescence spectroscopy has been demonstrated as a viable technique to monitor carbon filter performance, using the fluorescently active DOM species as an indicator. Due to the relationship between DOM and THMs, where DOM is the precursor for THM formation during the chlorine treatment of water, fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to predict the breakthrough of both species from activated carbon filters. In order to establish a versatile measurement technique, the most appropriate fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths for detecting the DOM in water were firstly determined. These fluorescence measurement parameters were then applied to effluent water samples from carbon filters, over a total filtrate volume of 4,200 L. The total THM concentration in filtered water samples was determined by headspace gas chromatography (HSGC), with the fluorescence and HSGC results showing a high degree of correlation for the amount of DOM and THM respectively. Importantly, this correlation is observed for both of the determined fluorescence measurement parameters, highlighting the validity and versatility of this technique.</jats:p>",

We examine both the relationships of market power with price level transmission and price volatility transmission in the chain. We use a vector error correction model and least squares regressions to analyse price transmission and price volatility transmissions, respectively. Results show that retail market power limited both types of transmissions. Competition inducing policy measures coupled with measures that support price risk management initiatives of chain actors are suggested.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent leak failures in cross‐linked polyethylene tubing from several US locations have been studied using microscopy and microscopic spectroscopy. Such failures compromise the use of a material that has been regarded as more environmentally sustainable. The failures appear to be the result of local chemical attack by aqueous chlorine that reacts with the polymer, leading to its oxidation, decrystallization and expansion of its volume. This creates stress fields that lead to chemically induced cracking of the polymer and, eventually, failure of the tubing. Each failure studied in this work was found to be associated with a micro‐protrusion in the inside diameter of the tubes; it is proposed that turbulence in the water flow behind the protrusion may accelerate local mechanical and chemical attack of the polyethylene tubing. A simple inspection method is suggested to detect the presence of such protrusions before installation of the tubing. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

To evaluate the economic and environmental performance of sustainable investment from a power perspective, we develop an analytical model to study a two-echelon sustainable supply chain consisting of one retailer and one manufacturer with three different power structures. We derive the optimal solutions for various cases associated with different supply chain power structures and sustainable investors. Though it is beneficial for both the manufacturer and retailer to make sustainable investment, they often utilize high power to gain economic benefit with less sustainable investment. Interestingly, the follower with less supply chain power has more incentive to make a sustainable effort to achieve a higher profit. The optimal amount of sustainable investment in the apparel manufacturer investment case is greater than that in the retailer investment case in most scenarios.</jats:p>"

One example of such an alternative practice is Community‐Supported Agriculture (CSA), a <jats:italic>social innovation</jats:italic> that is comprehensively analyzed here in the German context. Applying the concept of social innovation, the authors carried out a standardized survey, semi‐structured interviews and a discourse analysis of CSA farms in Germany. This paper identifies the (international) crisis discourses to which Community‐Supported Agriculture is a reaction, and the motivations of CSA members are outlined. Innovative facets of CSA such as <jats:italic>solidarity, de‐commodification</jats:italic>, and<jats:italic> prosuming</jats:italic> are identified. It becomes apparent that Community‐Supported Agriculture is not a homogeneous phenomenon, but can be differentiated into various types ? sociopolitical, spiritual‐communal, and pragmatic‐economic ‐ which differ in respect of how they express (social) innovation as well as in their attitudes to crises.</jats:p>",

All lakes are classified into three types: non‐glacier‐fed lakes, upstream lakes and glacier‐fed lakes. The glacier‐fed lakes are separated into glacier‐fed_P1 (quick expansion region) and glacier‐fed_P2 (slow expansion region). Combining the changes in precipitation, temperature and evaporation, less precipitation may be the main reason for lake shrinkage from 1976 to 1996 and quickly increasing precipitation led to the lakes' expansion from 1996 to 2000. However, after 2000, upstream lakes remained in a stable state with slight variation, non‐glacier‐fed lakes and glacier‐fed_P2 lakes exhibited a slightly increasing rate with high precipitation and high evaporation, and glacier‐fed_P1 lakes still expanded quickly. On the basis of the assumption of same precipitation and evaporation, glacial meltwater may make an important contribution (&gt;52%) to the increase in water storage of Bangdag Co and Meima Co. The results suggest that glacial meltwater augments the increased rate of glacier‐fed_P2 lakes and plays a much more important role in the expansion of glacier‐fed_P1 lakes compared to other lakes.</jats:p>",

Sampling locations were chosen on the basis of residence time, pipe material and mixing zone. Water samples were collected and analyzed for temperature, pH, total organic carbon, turbidity, free chlorine and THM. Experiments were carried out where two different flow directions at cross junctions were studied. It was observed that for incoming flow at 90° with varying flow rate, mixing was shown to be incomplete where inflows tend to bifurcate rather than mix completely. For two incoming flows in opposing direction (180°), solute mixing has shown to be perfect due to the collision of the fluid streams. The results demonstrated how THM concentration can greatly vary in the same water distribution network due to the impact of pipe material, residence time and the outcome of mixing at cross junctions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In aiming to halt global biodiversity loss, it is essential to address underlying societal processes. The concept of ecosystem services claims to bridge between biodiversity and society. At the same time there is a considerable research gap regarding how ecosystem services are provided, and how societal activities and dynamics influence the provision of ecosystem services. Interactions and dependencies between ecosystem services supply and demand come to the fore but context-specific dynamics have largely been neglected. This article is a critical reflection on the current research of ecosystem services supply and demand. We argue that there is a functional relation between the supply and demand for ecosystem services, with the two influencing each other. Scientific interest should focus on both the temporal and spatial dynamics of ecosystem services supply and demand. Presenting two studies from Socotra Archipelago, Yemen and the Sahel regions in Senegal and Mali, West Africa, we illustrate that the society behind the demand for ecosystem services is highly interrelated with ecosystem services supply. We thus advocate the adoption of a social-ecological perspective for current research on ecosystem services supply and demand in order to address these context-specific temporal and spatial dynamics.</jats:p>"

Steps to restore country’s medical and chemical-pharmaceutical industry, that stimulated the improvement of the medical equipment supply of the military units and institutions, have been shown. It was found that the five-years targets of the national economy for the post-war recovery and development plan during 1946-1950, which provides increasing of drug, medical products, medical devices and equipment production have been achieved, and in many cases exceeded. Transferring troops (forces) medical supply system to work under new conditions has been studied. It was revealed that in spite of the specificity and existing difficulties in the state and military construction in the 1950’s and 1960’s of the 20th century, it was possible to establish planned medical supply system in the Soviet Army and Navy in short time. The contribution of the Military Medical Academy of S.M. Kirov to develop official documents, create new models of medical supply and training the military pharmaceutical personnel has been shown. Special attention is given to the role of war members who contributed a lot in scientific and educational work on the issue of supplying troops (forces) with medical equipment. It is established that the reorganization of troops (forces) medical supply system made it possible not only to increase the effectiveness of military health care, but also to contribute strengthening the country’s defense toward the global confrontation and «cold war» started.</jats:p>"

The experiment was laid out following a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 4 treatments and 4 replications (blocks). The treatments were T0= control, T1 = 0.2% IBA, T2 = 0.4% IBA, T3 = 0.8% IBA. The rooting ability of cuttings was significantly influenced by the application of IBA. The results showed that the highest rooting percentage (100) and maximum root number (8) of Flacourtia indica stem cuttings were obtained from the cuttings treated with 0.4% IBA followed by 0.2% IBA where as the longest root length (8.998 cm) was recorded with 0.2% IBA followed by 0.4% IBA. Survival percentage of the cutlings (the rooted cuttings) after 3 months of transferring them into poly bags was also significantly enhanced by exogenous rooting hormone (IBA) application. The highest survival percentage (84.5 %) was for the cuttings treated with 0.4% IBA followed by 0.2% IBA (71%). The similar trend was also observed for average cutling height and number of leaf. Findings of the present study reveal that the plant species is highly amenable for clonal propagation by stem cuttings using low-cost non-mist propagator. Considering both rooting percentage and root number, 0.4% IBA treatment of stem cuttings may be recommended for mass production of quality planting stocks for the domestication of the species in homestead agroforestry or in fruit orchards to provide edible fruit to rural poor people of natural disaster vulnerable Bangladesh.</jats:p>"

During the study, the city suffered a severe drought that had a significant impact on water availability and quality in the river that supplies water to the city. Samples (2 liters) were collected from the distribution system over a period of six months, which included wet and dry months, from three points: the point with the lowest altitude in the distribution network, the farthest point from the water treatment works, and an intermediate point. Free chlorine was measured in situ using a Hach kit. DNA was extracted using a FastDNA Spin Kit Soil (Qbiogene). Advanced sequencing techniques (Ion Torrent) were used to identify and quantify the relative abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria present in the samples. Coliforms and Escherichia coli, indicators currently used worldwide to assess microbiological safety of drinking water, were measured on all samples using an enzyme substrate method (ONPG-MUG Colilert®). Next generation sequencing results retrieved 16SrRNA sequences of E. coli and some potentially pathogenic bacteria, even in the presence of free chlorine. Operational taxonomic units related to pathogenic bacteria were present in all samples from the drinking water distribution system (DWS) and, in general, at high relative abundance (up to 5%). A total of 19 species related to bacterial pathogens were detected. Inadequate operational practices that could affect the microbiological safety of the DWS were identified and discussed. The current paper is the first to evaluate the community of potentially pathogenic bacteria in a real DWS.</jats:p>",

This paper defines SSCM in terms of environmental, economic, and social dimensions, also known as triple bottom line plus risk management. Prior to the SSCM serious game (SG) “Chain of Command (CoC)” there were no board-based SGs that incorporated the three dimensions of SSCM. Prior research has only managed to incorporate one or two dimensions of sustainability. “CoC” serves as a tool to bring about discussion, awareness, raise questions, and even identify a player’s preference towards the three dimensions of sustainability. The research results reveal that “CoC” does bring about awareness of SSCM. While encouraging players to carry out green activities and design a lean and efficient supply chain (SC), it also considers social implications and risk management.</jats:p>",

Thirty‐two 11‐week‐old pigs were kept without access to sunlight and divided into four groups receiving the following treatment in a 2 × 2 factorial design: (i) <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UVB</jats:styled-content> irradiation or not and (ii) vitD in feed or not. Blood, urine and faeces were sampled every third week. In serum, vitD metabolites, Ca, phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg) and bone markers were analysed. Digestibility of Ca, P and Mg as well as urinary excretion of these minerals was analysed. After 14 weeks, the animals were slaughtered, and samples of skin, intestines, kidneys and bones (metatarsus) were taken for further analyses: sterols of vitD synthesis in the skin, Ca flux rates in the intestines, expression of genes involved in Ca transport in the intestines and kidneys, bone mineral density (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BMD</jats:styled-content>) with the aid of peripheral quantitative computer tomography and bone mineral content by ashing the metatarsus. Irradiated animals showed higher levels of 7‐dehydrocholesterol and tachysterol in the skin, higher levels of 25‐hydroxycholecalciferol and 1,25‐dihydroxycholecalciferol in the serum and higher Ca net flux rates were determined in Ussing chambers. In contrast, the expression of genes involved in Ca transport in the intestines and kidneys was not altered. Similarly, the digestibility of Ca and P as well as the urinary excretion was not affected. With respect to the metatarsus, no differences in mineral contents and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BMD</jats:styled-content> were found between groups. At the end of the study, some subclinical signs of beginning vitD ‘insufficiency’ were observed in the group without access to vitD (represented by higher expression of 1<jats:italic>α</jats:italic>‐hydroxylase in the kidney and increased parathyroid hormone in serum).</jats:p>",

In recent years, activities that reduce environmental impact, such as recycling and reusing materials, have been increasing. Designing a closed-loop supply chain for recycling or reuse operations will support social responsibility and competitive advantage. However, in order to establish supply chains for sustainability, it is necessary to consider not only environmental benefits but also economic efficiency. Moreover, both the quantity of demand and returns are indefinite in an actual closed-loop supply chain. In this study, we assume that the arrival interval of return inward follows a logarithmic normal distribution. Further, we design basic models with a manufacturing and remanufacturing process to understand the behavior of a closed-loop supply chain with stochastic product returns in a finite horizon and investigate the influence of different choices in management on the cost and environmental factors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The particular challenges associated with supply chain application of emerging manufacturing technologies are increasingly recognised in industry, academia and government. The problem is often described in terms of technology readiness levels, with the particular challenge relating to the stages between proof of concept and initial adoption in the factory environment. In the United Kingdom, the government has established the High Value Manufacturing Catapult, a network of manufacturing innovation centres brought together with the objective of addressing the so-called valley of death between traditional academic research and industrial needs across a broad spectrum of manufacturing process technology. This is achieved through demonstrating manufacturing technology at full scale, in factory representative environments in terms of equipment, process control and operation. This provision helps to address the key gap of full-scale pre-production capability demonstration and can be seen to de-risk investment in new manufacturing technology. This article argues that addressing this particular gap is entirely necessary but not sufficient to drive exploitation of the full potential that is available from the latest manufacturing technologies. A three-dimensional maturity-based framework is proposed, which, in addition to considerations of technology demonstration, also allows the position of the target product application in its product lifecycle and the readiness of the supply chain to receive the technology to be taken into account as success factors in the potential for industrialisation. Case study examples, both current and historical, are used to illustrate the need for such an approach in achieving future technology-enabled supply chains. In combination, this analysis introduces the basis of a more complete ‘long valley of death’ description which articulates the needs of research networks to establish a level of foundational capability ahead of specific client readiness projects in order to maximise overall pace and achieve a level of agility of delivery which is consistent with future views on digitalisation of manufacture. </jats:p>",

This creates inefficiency and unbalances the capacity utilization of the fuel supply fleet in the direct fuel supplies from roadside storages to power and heat generation. Terminals can offer an alternative approach for the fleet management of fuel supplies in terms of smoothing the unbalanced fleet use towards more even year‐round operations. The aim of the study was to compare the supply costs of a conventional direct forest chip supply to an alternative fuel supply with the use of a feed‐in terminal using the discrete‐event simulation method. The influences of the terminal location, terminal investment cost, outbound terminal transport method, terminal truck utilization and quality changes of terminal‐stored forest chips for the fuel supply cost were studied in the case environment. By introducing a feed‐in terminal and a shuttle truck for the transports of terminal‐stored forest chips, the total supply cost was 1.4% higher than the direct fuel supply scenario. In terminal scenarios, the supply costs increased 1–2% if the cost of the terminal investment increased 30%, the distance to the terminal increased from 5 to 30 km or the total annual use of a terminal truck decreased 1500 h. Moreover, a 1 per cent point per month increase in the dry matter loss of terminal‐stored chips increased the total supply cost 1%. The study revealed that with the relatively low additional cost, the feed‐in terminal can be introduced to the conventional forest chip supply. Cost compensation can be gained through the higher annual use of a fuel supply fleet and more secured fuel supply to power plants by decreasing the need for supplement fuel, which can be more expensive at a time of the highest fuel demand.</jats:p>",

We also examine the impact of the supplier’s attitudes to loss on the supply chain’s sustainability and profitability. We build game theoretical modes to characterize one property of the fashion industry: the wide use of buy-back contract, and obtain the following results: (1) Compared to wholesale price contract, buy-back contract reduces the sustainability of the supply chain, and this result is robust with alternative power structures. (2) Under alternative power structure, the sustainability index is increasing in the buy-back price in the supplier-as-the-leader scenario, while decreasing in the retailer-as-the-leader scenario. That is, the relationships between sustainability and buy-back price is completely reversed when the leader is changed. (3) The sustainability is improved when the supplier acts as the leader and the buy-back price is lower than a threshold, but the contrary holds when the buy-back price is high. (4) Buy-back contract helps to improve the sustainability of the supply chain when supplier is extremely loss-averse, because the loss-averse supplier has the incentives to reduce the ordering quantity as well as the overstocking risk.</jats:p>"

A portion of consumers display traceability consciousness, and are willing to pay a premium for traceable food products. Four possible strategies in a transparent food supply chain and three sourcing strategies in a nontransparent food supply chain are identified and we determine when each strategy is optimal. We show that efforts to improve traceability that focus on consumers, by increasing their willingness to pay for traceability or expanding the portion of traceability consciousness consumers, may lead to an unintended consequence, such as a decrease in the provision of traceable food products. However, efforts that focus on revealing and penalizing the buyer always lead to a higher provision of traceable food products. We further find that efforts focusing on eliminating the information asymmetry may not be helpful for sustainable traceability in the food supply chain.</jats:p>"

The challenges arising from this paradigm shift are currently most obvious in the area of electric power supply. However, it affects all areas of the energy system, albeit with different results. Within the energy system, various independent grids fulfill the function of transporting and spatially distributing energy or energy carriers, and the demand‐oriented supply ensures that energy demands are met at all times. However, renewable energy sources generally supply their energy independently from any specific energy demand. Their contribution to the overall energy system is expected to increase significantly. Energy storage technologies are one option for temporal matching of energy supply and demand. Energy storage systems have the ability to take up a certain amount of energy, store it in a storage medium for a suitable period of time, and release it in a controlled manner after a certain time delay. Energy storage systems can also be constructed as process chains by combining unit operations, each of which cover different aspects of these functions. Large‐scale mechanical storage of electric power is currently almost exclusively achieved by pumped‐storage hydroelectric power stations. These systems may be supplemented in the future by compressed‐air energy storage and possibly air separation plants. In the area of electrochemical storage, various technologies are currently in various stages of research, development, and demonstration of their suitability for large‐scale electrical energy storage. Thermal energy storage technologies are based on the storage of sensible heat, exploitation of phase transitions, adsorption/desorption processes, and chemical reactions. The latter offer the possibility of permanent and loss‐free storage of heat. The storage of energy in chemical bonds involves compounds that can act as energy carriers or as chemical feedstocks. Thus, they are in direct economic competition with established (fossil fuel) supply routes. The key technology here – now and for the foreseeable future – is the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can be transformed by various processes into other energy carriers, which can be exploited in different sectors of the energy system and/or as raw materials for energy‐intensive industrial processes. Some functions of energy storage systems can be taken over by industrial processes. Within the overall energy system, chemical energy storage technologies open up opportunities to link and interweave the various energy streams and sectors. Chemical energy storage not only offers means for greater integration of renewable energy outside the electric power sector, it also creates new opportunities for increased flexibility, novel synergies, and additional optimization. Several examples of specific energy utilization are discussed and evaluated with respect to energy storage applications.</jats:p><jats:p>The article describes various technologies for energy storage and their potential applications in the context of Germany's Energiewende, i.e. the transition towards a more sustainable energy system. Therefore, the existing legal framework defines some of the discussions and findings within the article, specifically the compensation for renewable electricity providers defined by the German Renewable Energy Sources Act, which is under constant reformation. While the article is written from a German perspective, the authors hope this article will be of general interest for anyone working in the areas of energy systems or energy technology.</jats:p>",

Iodine supplementation ≥150 μg/day resulted in higher median UIC regardless of its duration (nonusers: 130 μg/L vs. prepregnancy iodine starters: 240 μg/L, and pregnancy iodine starters: 205 μg/L, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; .001, and <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .023, respectively). Median Tg value of pregnancy starters was identical to that of nonusers (14.5 vs. 14.6 μg/L), whereas prepregnancy starters had lower median Tg (9.1 μg/L, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .018). Serum Tg concentration at week 16 of pregnancy showed negative relationship (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .010) with duration of iodine supplementation and positive relationship (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .008) with smoking, a known interfering factor of iodine metabolism, by multiple regression analysis.

Real test has been carried out to demonstrate the TOC concentration in feedwater has been increased as the external heating increases. The presence of organic acid would significantly reduce the pH of the condensate and result in general corrosion, pitting and environment assisted cracking. For the cogeneration thermal power stations in which make-up water were produced with traditional ion exchange system and Integrated Membrane Technology separately, the main factors affecting cation conductivity of steam are residues of the organics in raw water and dynamic variation about bacterial reproduction in reducing environment, respectively. If gel type anion resin had been replaced with macroporous strong base anion resin, the remaining TOC in traditional ion exchange system could be significantly reduced. And if non-oxidative bactericide had been dosed before or after Ultrahigh Purity Filter, bacteria could be effectively killed. For heat-supply units, the actual rates of makeup water, denote with “N%”, are always more than the design value. So it is very important in this scenario to revise the ceiling values of TOC for makeup water, which should be divided by N, to allow that ceiling value to match the actual rate of makeup water. For drum boilers and once-through boilers which superheated steam pressure are greater than 18.3 MPa, in order to guarantee the cation conductivity (25 °C) values of feed water less than the standard of 0.10 μ S/cm, TOC values in feed water should be under 50μ g/L.</jats:p>",

An optimization model for reservoir flood control and water supply is adopted, to determine reservoir releases based on synthetic inflow hydrographs during typhoons, which are generated by Monte Carlo simulations. The release is then used to calculate the water level at a downstream control point using a novel developed back-propagation neural network-based model, to reduce computational complexity and achieve automatic-efficient risk evaluation. The calculated downstream water levels and final reservoir water levels after a typhoon event are used to evaluate the mapped over-levee risk and water shortage risk, respectively. The results showed that the different upper limit settings for the reservoir have a significant influence on the variation of 1.19 × 10−5% to 75.6% of the water shortage risk. This occurs because of the insufficient inflow and narrow storage capacity of the Shih-Men Reservoir during drought periods. However, the upper limit settings have a minor influence (with a variation of only 0.149% to 0.157%) on the over-levee risk in typhoon periods, because of the high protection standards for the downstream embankment.</jats:p>"

The overall goal of this work was to obtain experimental data for validating cost-effective approximate mathematical models, used in investigations aimed at the development of numerical methods for assessing the operating limits of current transformers and optimizing the designs of next-generation transformers. The laboratory model used in this work was a vertical, single-phase, closed-loop thermosyphon operating with water as the working fluid. The steady and unsteady behaviors of this closed-loop thermosyphon were established and investigated using the following series of power inputs: 50 W, 125 W, 200 W, 125 W, and 50 W. Each of these levels of power input was maintained until steady-state conditions were achieved; and then the excursion to the adjacent power level (up or down, depending on the position in the aforementioned series) was effected. The corresponding experimental results are presented and discussed in this paper. The steady-state experiments with water as the working fluid are used to obtain valuable benchmarking results and also reliable initial conditions for the unsteady experiments. The experiments with excursions from one power level to an adjacent one provide novel results pertaining to unsteady operation of closed-loop thermosyphons. Another novel feature of this work is a demonstration that a simple lumped-parameter formulation can yield good predictions of the overall unsteady behavior of closed-loop thermosyphon systems akin to those used for cooling transformers.</jats:p>",

This work proposes the potential of a novel MHK turbine drivetrain with three main modules. The first module is an “energy harnessing module” to harness variable hydrokinetic power. The waterwheel with a large catchment area is effective in harnessing low head, free flowing hydrokinetic energy. The second module is a novel “speed controlling module” that is a replacement of currently used power converters; it is the focus of this work. It produces a constant speed output from a variable input speed. Finally, the third module is the “power generating module” that generates grid-compatible constant-frequency electricity. The test results showed the superior performance of the proposed speed converter in obtaining constant speed frequency output from a variable input speed range.</jats:p>",

There are many sites where limited head and flow rate is available but these resources cannot be exploited due to inefficient technologies. Gravitational vortex turbine (GVT) is a novel technology that is suitable for micro-level power production where low head and flow rate is available. It consists of two main parts: vortex pool for vortex generation and turbine blades. This paper focuses on parametrical analysis of GVT to determine the geometrical characteristics which gives the best performance. These parameters would address; effect of velocity and symmetry of vortex with the ratio of upper diameter of funnel (D) to outlet diameter (d), effect of the angle of rectangular inlet passage on the vortex formation. It will also analyze flow in rectangular passage with constant cross section vs. converging cross section. All of these parameters have major impact on the velocity and symmetry of flow. Results show that outlet of the funnel should be 40% of the upper diameter while highest velocity was achieved when rectangular passage was at 60 degrees with pre-rotational plate at 30 degrees.</jats:p>",

Such systematic gas turbine risk assessment is a necessary step to develop strategies for turbine risk mitigation and loss prevention.

The risk of forced outages in turbines was evaluated in terms of outage days and number of outages per unit-year. In order to understand the drivers of the forced outages, the influence of variables including turbine age, capacity, type, loading characteristic, and event cause codes were analyzed by grouping the outage events based on the chosen values (or ranges of values) of these variables. A list of major findings related to the effect of these variables on the risk of forced outage is discussed.</jats:p>",

Statistical analysis is applied to study the characteristics of the highly unstable blade pass frequency (BPF) of the gas turbine and to establish the baseline data used for blade fault assessment and diagnosis. Based on the excessive increase observed on specific BPF amplitudes in comparison to the statistical baseline data, rubbing at the compressor blade is suspected. An immediate overhaul is therefore warranted, and the results from the inspection of the machine confirm the occurrence of severe rubbing at the compressor blades and labyrinth glands of the gas turbine.

Numerous studies shed light on these sources and technologies to utilize low-temperature heat. This paper evaluates the technical and economic feasibility of low-temperature Stirling Engine (SE) powered by hot water energy from evacuated tube solar water heater for distributed power generation when excess hot water energy is available. Evacuated tube solar collector provides hot water on-demand. When hot water is not consumed domestically, a SE is used to utilize the untapped heat from the solar water heater. The objective of this study is to evaluate the energy savings by using a SE to recover untapped heat from solar collectors. Thermal performance of the selected evacuated tube was measured experimentally under local weather conditions for different periods in summer and winter in the Mediterranean region and then simulated on hourly basis for a whole year to estimate the energy and hot water temperature output. Three different cases were taken to assess the potential of energy savings using SE to generate power namely, typical homes, office buildings and schools. SE is modeled using the most advanced third-order design analysis method. Air, helium, and hydrogen are used as working fluids in the SE at different charging pressures. Results obtained from solar collector’s thermal performance for the three cases are integrated with the results achieved from Stirling engine simulation of the various working fluids and pressures to evaluate the engine performance based on a dynamic approach. The study also investigates the economic feasibility of using Stirling engines for power generation from such low-temperature, intermittent heat sources. Results show that using hydrogen as working fluid is the most feasible. Typical schools show the most economical case to recover heat.</jats:p>",

Provenance data from sandstones were obtained from three exploration wells, two situated on the north‐eastern margin and one on the eastern flank of the Lake Albert Basin, NW Uganda. Data suggest that high‐grade to low‐grade metamorphic rocks and granitoids have variably supplied the heavy mineral assemblages around the Lake Albert Basin during the Miocene‐Pliocene, with contributions from the isotopically heterogeneous Archean Cratons (including the local Ugandan Craton, Tanzanian, and Congo Cratons) and the Pan‐African rocks (the Mozambique Belt) with possible contributions from the Neoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic rocks. These data also highlight clear differences between supply to the eastern basin margin, compared with the northeast, which is reconcilable with current models for Miocene‐Pliocene drainage in the region. Supply to northeastern Lake Albert during the Miocene‐Pliocene appears to have been through a proto‐Albert Nile (draining from NE to SW) and from a proto‐Victoria Nile or similarly oriented palaeo‐river systems draining from the east. In contrast, the eastern flanks of the basin were likely supplied via the palaeo‐Nkusi river, tapping local hinterland sources and more distal basement to the far‐east (Mozambique Belt). This study highlights the importance of utilizing a multiproxy approach in provenance analysis as no one signal is capable of distinguishing the different source lands and constraining the evolving drainage patterns.</jats:p>",

Local amplification coefficient of vibration response in the cases of different mistuning levels is obtained by introducing 10 random mistuned patterns. In addition, frequency splitting phenomena even appears at one of the blades by the contribution of high mistuning levels. According to the calculated results for different excitation levels, the curve of modal damping varying with response amplitude is gained. Lastly, rigidity mistuning is introduced and a combined analysis is performed to investigate the influence of friction damping mistuning on rigidity mistuning in the same 10 random mistuning patterns. The arrangement of dry friction damping mistuning also could be controlled to reduce the local vibration amplification originating from structure mistuning.

In the program, the integrated effect of three types of heat transfer, i.e. heat conduction, convection and radiation, in the process of heat transfer of receivers has been considered. With integrating the characteristics and the working conditions of receivers of both steam and molten salt, the developed program can be used to perform the thermal performance calculations for the receivers of both working fluids. The proposed program was validated through Solar Two project and the satisfactory results achieve. A steam receiver in a tower-type solar power plant with double superheats is selected as an example for thermal performance calculation. In view of the receiver operating in subcritical status, the thermal performance calculation is carried out for two sections, the one for evaporation and that for superheat. In evaporation section, the working fluid is circulated with a circulating pump at a very high circulating ratio. At the outlet of panels, the qualities of working fluid can reach to maximum about 0.35. Besides, the great difference of qualities of working fluid at the outlet of panels is observed. Even for some pipes of some panels, the working fluid at the outlet is in liquid phase. The distribution of metal temperature at fin end of panels in the evaporation region varies dramatically from place to place and reaches to over 520 °C. In superheat region, the temperature of the outer front crown of tubes is concerned. The highest front point temperature of pipe, which reaches to maximum over 660 °C, is in the middle region of the last parts of the primary superheat pass. The thermal efficiency distribution of the receiver, including the evaporation and the superheat regions, are also performed. The results show that the averaged efficiency is about 86%. Besides, the phenomenon of negative thermal efficiency happens in both two regions. That is because the solar incidence cannot compensate the natural heat loss due to incident radiation reflection, the pipe wall infrared radiation and convective heat loss.</jats:p>",

Fourteen Streckeisen STS-2 Broadband seismometers and two 3D sonic anemometers are deployed in/near an operating wind farm to collect the data used in these proof-of-principle analyses. The interquartile mean (IQM) value of power spectral density (PSD) of the seismic components in 10-minute time series are used to characterize the spectral signatures (i.e. frequencies with enhanced variance) in ground vibrations deriving from vibrations of wind turbine subassemblies. A power spectral envelope approach is taken in which the probability density function of seismic PSD is developed using seismic data collected under normal turbine operation. These power spectral envelopes clearly show the energy distribution of wind-turbine-induced ground vibrations over a wide frequency range. Singular PSD lying outside the power spectral envelopes can be easily identified, and are used herein along with SCADA data to diagnose the associated sub-optimal turbine operating conditions. Illustrative examples are given herein for periods with yaw-misalignment and excess tower acceleration. It is additionally shown that there is a strong association between drivetrain acceleration and seismic spectral power in a frequency band of 2.5–12.5 Hz. The long-term goal of the research is development of seismic-based condition monitoring (SBCM) for wind turbines. The primary advantages of SBCM are that the approach is low-cost, non-invasive and versatile (i.e., one seismic sensor monitoring for multiple turbine subassemblies).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ocean and wind energy require reliable, efficient electric conversion systems to be viable resources. Direct drive electric generators offer both benefits; however, it is difficult to generate the required torque at the low speeds typical of these resources. In this DOE sponsored project, ABB US Corporate Research partnered with Resolute Marine Energy (RME) and Texas A&amp;M University to investigate the suitability of direct drive electric power generation for a paddle-type wave energy converter (WEC). This WEC provides high torque in a relatively chaotic, oscillating manner and requires a machine capable of handling high peak torques of approximately 40,000 N·m at speeds typically not exceeding 3 rpm. The baseline concept uses a hydraulic power take-off coupled with a generator and convertor; a direct drive electric solution may be beneficial. As a first step in designing a suitable direct drive generator for this application, we have begun with a smaller scale prototype targeting one tenth of the speed and torque, and we investigated a machine topology that may be promising in the operating regime of the full-scale machine. To this end, we designed and tested an integral generator and magnetic gear which is rated at 3,800 N·m at 30 rpm and completed a paper design for a machine of the required scale. This paper describes the mechanical design and testing of the prototype machine and provides some reflection on necessary design changes for the full-scale machine.</jats:p>",

In this study we have significantly improved the Evacuated Tube solar Collectors (ETCs) by utilizing the “dry-drawable” Carbon Nanotube (CNT) sheet coatings to increase the solar energy absorption and Phase Change Materials (PCMs) to increase the heat accumulation for application in solar water heaters. The proposed solar collector utilizes a phase change material namely Octadecane paraffin, with melting temperatures of 28°C which is categorized as non-toxic with long-term chemical stability PCM. As PCMs particularly in powder form may not be effective by itself due to the poor heat transfer rate, low thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity, by combining CNT layers with the high thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity compare to phase change materials, we are able to overcome the shortcomings of PCMs and design an innovative and efficient solar water heater. With the current technology, we can provide a near ideal black body surface, absorbing a maximum of 98%, between 600–1100 nm, of solar light striking the surface, and providing additional spectral absorption which improves the performance of the solar heater. Applying CNT sheets in conjunction with PCM enables heat storage directly on the collector for a more constant output, even on a cloudy day and prolonged output of heat at night.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The impinging Stream is a novel technique in enhancing heat and mass transfer. In the conventional impinging stream reactor (ISR), as the particles in that reactor are affected by the fluid resistance, the energy of the particles is rapidly decreased after the infiltration of the reverse flow, which leads to the effective mixing of the particles. In this paper, we design an improved impinging stream reactor (IISR) that has different fluid inlet velocity but same mean fluid inlet velocity in a period, which still belongs to definition of impinging stream. In the present study, the flow characteristics in the IISR are investigated using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and computational fluid dynamics. The effects of the fluid inlet velocity in the axisymmetric opposed jets are discussed for equal mean volumetric flow rates of the two jets. The impingement plane and the flow filed of the IISR are measured from captured images using the PIV technique. The two fluid inlet velocity with different sinusoidal variations are applied in the improved impinging stream. Besides, the experimental results show that the impingement plane is moving instantaneously with the two inlet velocity changing dynamically, which expands efficient active areas compared with the conventional impinging stream. Besides, computational fluid dynamics are used in combination with the discrete phase model (CFD-DPM) to predict the flow characteristics within the improved Impinging Stream. The simulation results show that impinging stream flow field can be divided into the inlet, the impact zone, the exit zone and the vortex area. At the same time, the impact zone and the impingement plane is also found to be moving The CFD-DPM results give predictions that are in better agreement with the flow filed pictured by the PIV technique. Because of the complexity of the liquid immersion impinging stream, it is difficult to study the trajectory of the particles in the flow field, so we use the numerical simulation to study the motion of the particles in the immersion IISR. Analysis shows the effective mixing region of the particles can be greatly increased, particles’ motion trajectory can be longer and the heat and mass transfer between the particles and the interphase can be further enhanced. Compared with the conventional ISR, the IISR has obvious advantages. The results point out this improved impinging Stream has a good application prospect in future engineering works.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pipelines are widely used in energy power system including thermal power plants and nuclear power plants. In the power system, especially nuclear power plants, as thermal stratification characteristic of nonuniform temperature distribution in the pipe and thermal fatigue such as the low cycle thermal fatigue due to existence of the cycle thermal stress are inevitable, the pipe line system can be destroyed easily and thus affect the normal operation of the power plants. In order to study the pipeline thermal fatigue, the pipeline thermal stress needs to be calculated and therefore the temperature distributions especially the inner wall temperature was needed. The outer wall temperature and working fluid temperature can be obtained with installing measuring tools. The key and difficult point is the estimation of the inner temperature distribution of the pipe. At the same time, in the practical engineering, the pipeline structure with special safety requirements or higher requirements for structural completeness are not allowed to be destroyed by the measuring equipment. Based on the consideration above, this paper presents a method of solving the inverse heat conduction problem, which means the inner temperature distributions can be derived by the outer wall temperature distributions. For the pipe inverse heat conduction problem, this paper applies numerical analysis as the main way. Firstly, the method for transient inverse heat conduction problems applying separation of variables and Duhamel’s theorem is established. As the effects of the random error on the measured outer wall temperature are inevitable, the measured data need to be smoothed before used as an input. The Gram orthogonal polynomial method based on the digital filtering theory is applied in this paper to accomplish the smoothing process. The inverse process is accomplished by using MATLAB programming. Then this method is verified in the experiment with high temperature and high pressure. In order to directly validate the accuracy of the inverse analysis, for the test section, not only the transient outer wall temperature and fluid temperature were measured, but also the time dependent middle layer temperature were measured. Then the middle layer temperature obtained from inverse calculation was compared with the measured data from the experiment. The calculated results show that the accuracy of this method is high. The temperature distributions along the radical direction can be obtained quickly and accurate instantaneous heat load for the structural stress analysis and thermal fatigue analysis can be provided using this method.

However, it is quite difficult to monitor the regenerative system’s performance in an accurate, economical and real-time way at any operation load. There are two main problems about this.

First, this paper proved the model accuracy by computer simulation. Then, the models were used to predict the pressure of the piping outlet, the temperature of the outlet feedwater and drain water of heaters in a real-time by computers. The results show that the deviation rate between the theoretical predictions and the actual operation data is less than 0.25% during the whole operation load range. At last, in order to test the fault identification ability of this model, some real tests were done in this 1000MW power plant during the actual operation period. The performance changes are identified via the difference between the predict value and the real time value.

By increasing the velocity of the middle fluid, the outer droplets become bigger, while the inner droplet size decreases. As the velocity of inner fluid increases, more inner fluid is injected, which leads to an increment with both outer and inner droplet size. Both of the outer and inner droplet sizes become bigger as the outer surface tension coefficients increase, and for the same reason, the increment with the outer surface tension result in an increase with the outer droplet size, but has no effect on the inner droplet size. Similarly, the droplets morphology almost does not vary with the viscosity of both middle and inner fluid.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Methane hydrate has been paid considerable attention on how to exploit it by efficient and economical methods. A computer modeling approach was used to obtain more detail information during the process of methane hydrate decomposition. A comprehensive Users’ Defined Subroutine (UDS) was used in the FLUENT code to model the methane hydrate dissociation by depressurization. The kinetic model and equilibrium condition were contained in the UDS. The new UDS can model the heat and mass transfer during the decomposition process of methane hydrate. The behavior of the methane hydrate decomposition process in both laboratory-scale simulation and micro channels simulation was investigated in this paper. The laboratory-scale simulation results were compared with ones of the laboratory-scale system studied by Masuda et al. to verify the UDS. Evolutions of methane gas, water and hydrate in the cross micro channels were obtained. The phenomenon of water freezing was predicted by comparing the water temperature and freezing temperature. The results also showed that the dissociation process of gas hydrates as well as the water freezing phenomenon occur not only in the interface between hydrate layer and production zone, but also deep in the hydrate zone.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has played an increasingly important role in condition monitoring and machinery fault diagnosis in power generation plants. However, the accuracy and reliability of any AI-based machinery fault diagnosis is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the input data fed to the AI model. The hypothesis of this paper is that AI-based fault diagnosis can be further improved by taking into account all the available sensor inputs of the machine. In short, the more sensor inputs fed into the AI model, the more accurate and reliable the outcome of the fault diagnosis. This paper proposes an application of Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory for sensor fusion to improve the accuracy of decision-making in machinery fault diagnosis, by fusing all the available vibration signals measured on different axes and locations of the test machine. Vibration signals from different axes and locations of a machinery faults simulator were collected by multiple accelerometers simulating various machinery health conditions, namely healthy, unbalance, misalignment and foundation looseness. The accuracy of fault diagnosis using a different number of sensor inputs was then investigated. Analysis results showed that by combining more sensor inputs using a DS-based algorithm can improve fault detection accuracy from an average of 63% to 83%. In conclusion, the multi-sensor fusion algorithm can be applied to increase the accuracy and reliability of AI-based fault diagnosis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>High cycle fatigue (HCF) is the main cause of failure in rotating machinery especially in aircraft engines which results in the loss of human life as well as billions of dollars. More than 60 percent of aircraft accidents are related to High cycle fatigue. Major reason for HCF is vibratory stresses induced in the blades at resonance. Damping is needed to avoid vibratory stresses to reach the failure level. High speed rotating machinery has to pass through the resonance in order to reach the operational speed and chances of failure are high at resonance level. It is therefore required to suppress the vibrations at resonance level to avoid any damage to the structure. Application of coating to suppress vibrations is a current area of research. Various types of coatings have been studied recently. This includes plasma graded coatings, viscoelastic dampers, piezoelectric material damping, and magnetomechanical damping. In this research, the phenomenon of damping using a coating of nickel alloy on a steel beam is studied experimentally and numerically to reduce vibratory stresses by enhancing damping characteristics to avoid aircraft engine and rotating machinery failure. For this purpose, uncoated and nickel alloy coated steel beams are fabricated. The coating procedure was performed using plasma arc method. The beams were then mounted in a cantilevered position and bump and vibration shaker tests were conducted to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes. One of the most important parameter to measure the damping of a system is the damping ratio. In order to determine the damping ratio, vibration analyzer mode was adjusted in time domain and beam was excited by using a hammer. The vibration analyzer showed the vibration decay as a function of time. Using that decay, damping ratio was calculated by using logarithmic decrement method. In order to investigate and compare the damping characteristics of un-coated and coated beams, forced response method was employed. In this method, beams were excited at 1st and 2nd bending mode natural frequencies using vibration shaker. Results were very encouraging and showed a significant improvement in damping characteristics. The experimental results were then endorsed by numerical results which were achieved by performing modal and forced response analysis using finite element analysis techniques.</jats:p>",

Optimum first law efficiency ranged from 17 to 22%. Cis-butene and pentane performed the best in all performance factors analyzed. Pentane and isopentane performed the best at pressures near or below their critical point. It was also found that near the critical temperature, a subcritical ORC has better performance than an SORC.

Particle packing fractions of ∼60% were the prime focus in the current study as the targeted application is the use of dense particulate media as heat transfer fluids (HTF). Experimental and computational studies were previously conducted to understand the influence of different geometrical parameters on the flow physics [1], [2]. Flowrate, particulate velocity, and packing fraction profiles were studied for different inertial numbers and preliminary observations were made about the corresponding regimes. However, flow characteristics that could have a direct implication on the heat transfer behavior remained unexplored. Hence, the current effort serves as an extension of our previous studies. The three-dimensional computer simulations were conducted by implementing the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for the Lagrangian modelling of particles. Hertz-Mindilin models were used for the soft-particle formulations of inter-particulate contacts. Since the particle contact behavior plays an important role in the conduction heat transfer of these regimes [3], the particle-wall residence times and near-wall packing fractions are studied in the current work. Particle fluctuations, which lead to flow agitation that effect heat transfer [4] are also studied. It was observed that the intermittent nature of the flow resulted in the propagation of wave-like structures in the upstream direction. The characteristics of this phenomenon and its possible influence on the heat transfer physics is also discussed.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the new model is employed to a nuclear power plant project in progress in China, both the man-hour of the equipment procurement management and the human resource demand are calculated to support the reasonable human resource arrangement for the entire construction period, which plays significant role in price quoting and cost control of procurement in Engineering-Procurement-Construction (EPC) projects.

In the case without taking into account H2, the burners show poor ignitability. Using a multi-step mechanism for gas combustion, including char gasification and detailed compositions of volatile largely improve the ignitability of burners. The good ignitability also leads to more heat absorption in boiler and less CO in furnace. CO can be also increased because of the char gasification and detailed compositions of volatiles.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing world energy demand as a result of society development brings forth a growing environmental concern. The use of high-efficiency alternative systems is becoming progressively more interesting due to economic reasons and regional incentives. The issue of finding the best configuration that minimizes total annual cost is not enough anymore, as the environmental concern has become one of the objectives in the synthesis of energy systems. The minimization of costs is often contradictory to the minimization of environmental impact. Multi-objective optimization tackles the conflicting objectives issue by providing a set of trade-off solutions, or Pareto solutions, that can be examined by the decision maker in order to choose the best configuration for the given scenario. The present work proposes a mixed integer linear programming model for the synthesis of a trigeneration system that must attend the electricity, heat, and cooling demands of a multifamily building complex in Zaragoza, Spain. The objective functions to be minimized are the overall annual costs and the overall annual CO2 emissions, considering investment, maintenance and operation costs. As a first approach, the single-objective configurations for each objective function are evaluated. Then, the Pareto frontier is obtained for the minimization of total annual costs and total annual CO2 emissions, allowing to obtain the best trade-off configuration, which brings results close to the optimal single objectives. It is worth mentioning that the treatment of the energy prices was simplified in order to keep on the same level of detail as energy CO2 emissions, which are given only on an annual basis. On the other hand, the optimization model developed can be further complicated in order to consider more complex situations.</jats:p>",

The particular focus is on comparison between single plant and hybrid plants in terms of energy efficiency and penalty in power production to determine the more efficient configuration. The achieved results showed that integration of MED unit to the power cycle is thermodynamically more efficient, due to less reduction in power production and efficiency than the TVC-MED configurations. Also, for hybrid solar tower-MED plat, the average penalty in power production was between 9.27% and 12.88% when fresh production increased from 10000 m3/day to 31,665 m3/day. Another important finding showed the specific power consumption (specific power penalty) of the hybrid plant decreases with increasing the fresh water production. Especially at higher fresh water production, this specific power consumption was competitive to other desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis.

The proposed solar collector utilizes two distinct phase change materials (dual-PCM), namely Tritriacontane paraffin and Erythritol, with melting temperature 72°C and 118°C respectively. The integration of Silicone oil for uniform melting of the PCMs, utilizes the convective heat transfer inside the evacuated tubes, as this liquid polymerized material is well known for its temperature-stability and an excellent heat transfer medium. The operation of solar water heater with the proposed solar collector is investigated during both normal and stagnation (on-demand) operation. The feasibility of this technology is tested via small scale and large scale commercial solar water heaters. Beyond the improved functionality for solar water heater systems, the results from this study show show efficiency improvement of 26% for the normal operation and 66% for the stagnation mode compared with standard solar water heaters that lack phase change materials and silicone oil. The benefit of this method includes improved functionality by delayed release of heat, thus providing hot water during the hours of high demand or when solar intensity is insufficient such in a cloudy day and during night time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Effective Plume-Chimney Height (EPCH) was a factor engineers used to design and analyse the performance of natural convection in air-cooled heat exchangers particularly in the event of power outage. To date the number of papers in the open literature presenting data on natural convection performance of air-cooled heat exchangers is scarce. The aim of this study is to corroborate the experimental results and theoretical predictions of Effective Plume-Chimney Height (EPCH) using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in a laboratory-scale air cooled heat exchanger of 457mm × 457mm face area and an industrial-scale test rig of 2.4m × 6.0m face area forced draft air-cooled heat exchanger comprising of a bundle with 4 rows of annular finned tubes in staggered formation operating under natural convection. The CFD software Phoenics 2015 was employed to simulate the electrically-heated air-cooled heat exchanger fitted with a top screen which was built to study the aerodynamics of natural convection of air-cooled heat exchangers. The CFD geometry arrangement and dimensions were schematic in nature, where errors introduced were considered reasonably negligible. The laboratory-scale exchanger model experimental pressure drop data was found to have an insignificant effective plume-chimney height, as predicted by a theoretical equation. It was found that EPCH values calculated from CFD results agree closely to within −0.11m and +0.06m with both experiments and the theoretical prediction, confirming the same conclusion reached in an earlier report. However, for an industrial-scale test rig (ITR) in forced draft mode of large face dimensions the EPCH had been found to be non-negligible in an earlier work. Significant values of theoretical effective plume-chimney height were inserted in the heat transfer and pressure drop simulation that appeared to yield results that agreed with the experimental heat loads. The CFD simulations on the ITR have confirmed the existence of significant effective plume-chimney heights at more than 100 percent of the bundle depth, or the chimney height. The implication is that a solid-walled chimney can appear to have an efficiency of more than 100 per cent, if cold inflow can be prevented or the penetration to the central core hindered. Since the validation of the existence of EPCH by CFD here has used only a set of data from a single source, it is worthwhile to produce more experimental data and analysis to establish the concept for better predictions of air-cooled heat exchanger natural convection performance.</jats:p>",

In Adiabatic OCAES, heat from the compressed air is stored in a thermal energy storage (TES) and reused to reheat compressed air before sending it to the expander. In Isothermal OCAES, air is compressed and expanded isothermally which results in the least compression work and highest expansion work.

Most of them are discarded into atmosphere directly, causing the inadvertent waste and serous pollution. Currently, a new type gas turbine with catalytic combustion and rotary regenerator can be used to utilize these fuels and mitigate pollution. Differing from the conventional gas turbine, the chamber and regenerator of the new gas turbine is combined into one component, which is named rotary recuperative type catalytic chamber (RRTCC). The catalytic combustion is applied for RRTCC. The catalytic combustion characteristic of RRTCC is studied using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results indicate that when the inlet velocity is 20 m/s, the methane conversion rate is 90%∼95%, and the corresponding outlet gas temperature is 1030∼1200K. When there is a variation of ±25% in the inlet velocity, the variation of methane conversation rate is −15% and 5% respectively, and the variation of outlet gas temperature is −6% and 2% respectively. Additionally, it is found that the hotspot temperature of combustor wall decreases with the increase of inlet velocity. The lowest value of hotspot temperature is about 1000K, which is higher than the ignition temperature of CH4. Therefore, the existence of hotspot temperature is useful for the catalytic ignition. The temperature distribution on the combustion side exhibits a smoking-pipe-like shape, as well as the recuperative side. The results can provide data reference for RRTCC design.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Undeveloped small hydropower generation sites are abundant throughout the water conveyance infrastructure and natural rivers in the United States. Due to its small scale, micro-hydro development requires substantial upfront capital costs, maintenance and operation costs for customized engineering and construction. The significant investments required for developing small hydropower are inhibiting for utilities, residential and commercial users to adopt. An inexpensive energy storage system and a well-designed power controls system can be integrated with small hydropower sites to increase its cost-effectiveness and reliability. This paper introduces the concept of storing low-power generated from small hydro turbines during long off-peak periods and dispatching at high-power as grid-quality electricity during peak periods. The use of an ultra-low cost thermal energy storage (ULCTES) system is examined. Boosting the power output for small hydro generation allows commercial users to avoid significant demand charges during operation, making small hydro an attractive cost saving strategy and therefore breaking down the cost barrier. The ULCTES operates much like a bulk power production unit and a peaker plant, in which it is capable of dispatching constant power over a long period during peak periods when conventional sources are unavailable. Improvements in system reliability and economic value are evaluated using microgrid optimization software HOMER Energy. In particular, two cases are studied with variations in types of end users and energy management goals. Energy costs savings, demand charges savings and renewable energy penetration are determined. Distributed energy storage systems are shown to reduce energy costs and increase the renewable energy penetration for commercial users. With ULCTES, microgrids have the flexibility to manage fluctuating renewable energy generation as well as respond to rapidly changing loads on a daily basis. A larger hydroelectricity system is shown to be more feasible with distributed energy storage systems for isolated users without any connection to the grid.</jats:p>",

The results show that the hybrid system can reach the efficiency of 59.24% under the designed working condition.

Results show that the change of H2 proportion has the most significant influence to system output power, CO and CH4 have similar influence trend. System electrical efficiency increases slightly with the change of H2 proportion while decreasing significantly with the increase of CO and CH4 proportion. The increasing composition of CH4, H2 and CO in biomass gas fuel benefits the output power of hybrid system, but results in the higher risk of overheat as well, which might cause safety problems. The composition of water in biomass gas affects the [S]/[C] ratio of system, and results show that maintaining the [S]/[C] ratio at a certain level can guarantee the temperature of key components in the hybrid system below the limits, which can satisfy the safety standards.

The fan performance during constant speed operation and during R2 speed matching operation is presented and discussed using theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experimental research. The results show that R2 speed matching improves the power and efficiency characteristics of R2. Thus, the pressure rise and power characteristics of the fan were improved. The load of R2 under low flow rates condition was decreased, and the pressure rise and efficiency of R2 under high flow rates condition were increased. The blocking condition margin increased from 37.2% to 48.0%, and the high-efficiency working range of the fan increased from 33.2% to 37.9%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Renewable energy technologies and sources have been playing a key role in reducing CO2 emissions and its footprint. Solar energy which is one of the major renewable energy sources can be utilized by means of solar Photovoltaic (PV) or solar collectors. Concentrating solar collectors supply thermal energy from medium to high grade where as non-concentrating collectors (flat plate) delivers low-grade thermal energy. The use of thermofluids with boiling temperatures lower than water, allows the operation of low grade solar thermal systems on an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) to generate both mechanical and heat energy. At the same time, the selection of an appropriate thermofluid is an important process and has a significant effect both on the system performance and the environment. Hydrofluoroethers (HFEs) are non-ozone depleting substances and they have relatively low global warming potential (GWP). In this study, a solar ORC is designed and commissioned to use HFE 7000 as a thermofluid. The proposed system consists of a flat-plate solar collector, a vane expander, a condenser and a pump where the collector and the expander are used as the heat source and prime mover of the cycle respectively. The performance of the system is determined through energy analysis. Then, a mathematical model of the cycle is developed to perform the simulations using HFE-7000 at various expander pressure values. Experimental data indicates that the efficiency and the net mechanical work output of the cycle were found to be 3.81% and 135.96 W respectively. The simulation results show that increasing the pressure ratio of the cycle decreased the amount of the heat that is transferred to HFE 7000 in the collector due to the increased heat loss from the collector to the environment. Furthermore, the net output of the system followed a linear augmentation as the pressure ratio of the system increased. In conclusion, both the experimental and theoretical research indicates that HFE 7000 offers a viable alternative to be used efficiently in small scale solar ORCs to generate mechanical and heat energy.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a three-layer back propagation (BP) neural network model is established and the number of input, hidden and output layer node is set as 3, 6 and 1, respectively. To be specific, the flow rate, rotational speed and medium temperature are chosen as input layer, and the corresponding flow-induced noise evaluated by average of total sound pressure level (A_TSPL) as output layer. Furthermore, the tansig function is used to act as transfer function between the input layer and hidden layer, and the purelin function is used between hidden layer and output layer. The trainlm function based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is selected as the training function. By using a large number of sample data, the training of the network model and prediction research are accomplished. The results indicate that good correlation is established among the sample data, and the predictive values show great consistence with simulation ones, of which the average relative error of A_TSPL in process of verification is 0.52%.

In order to reduce the temperature difference in receiver tube wall and improve the efficiency of CSP system, the ternary eutectic salt LiF-NaF-KF (46.5-11.5-42 wt.%, hereafter FLiNaK), which has a better high thermal stability than that of nitrate salts at operating temperature of 900 °C, is selected as HTF, and heat transfer performance of FLiNaK in a corrugated receive tube with non-uniform heat flux is simulated by CFD software in the present work. The numerical results reveal that the non-uniform heat flux has a great influence on the temperature distributions of the receive tube and FLiNaK salt. Compared with the result of bare tube, the corrugated tube can not only significantly reduce the temperature difference in tube wall and salt by improving the uniformity of temperature distribution but also enhance the heat transfer of the salt, where the heat transfer coefficient increases with the Reynolds number and heat flux. Moreover, the enhanced effect of the corrugated tube depends on both the pitch and the height of ridges. It is found that the heat transfer coefficient of the salt gets a maximum when the ratio of the height of ridge to the pitch is 0.2.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Radiation heat transfer is the dominant model of heat transfer in the large scale industry boiler, especially in oxy-fuel combustion condition. Radiative properties of combustion gases and char oxidation in the oxy-fuel condition are obviously different from the air-fuel combustion, due to the N2 replaced by CO2. Through researchers proposed many helpful correlations based on the air-fuel Weighted-Sum-of-Grey-Gases-Model (WSGGM), the absorption coefficients were commonly constant or correlations were discrete by the classical molar ratio of H2O to CO2 (MR), which were mismatching the continuous value of MR in the real furnace. Meanwhile, the discrete MR is also not applied to the computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this paper, new correlations for the WSGGM are determined as polynomial function of MR and temperature, which can be conveniently employed in Fluent by the form of user-defined-functions in C language. Parameters of model are fitted by total emittances calculated based on the timely HITEMP 2010 database. New correlations are validated by comparing the emittances with line-by-line calculations and other classical models. New correlations are employed in the CFD for the real industrial oxy-fuel combustion with the temperature range of 400–2600K, pressure path-length between 0.01 and 60 bar m. Several assumed test cases have been investigated to evaluate the accuracy of the models. Modified correlations for WSGGM give a better accuracy of the total emittances for the mixed combustion gases in the real furnace. New models including radiative and chemical reaction mechanisms have been employed to CFD modeling of combustion process for a tangentially fired 300MWe utility boiler. The industrial boiler is modeled by a partition meshing method with the hexahedral structured mesh. Due to the atmosphere shift from N2 to CO2, three aspects are essential to be modified for oxy-fuel: radiation model, char oxidation model and homogeneous volatile oxidation model. To investigate the performance of the furnace, air-fuel combustion selected as the conference, three other cases employed are defined as Oxy21 (vol21%, O2), Oxy26 (vol26, O2) and Oxy29 (vol29%, O2), respectively. Temperature profile and heat transfer are investigated for the different test cases. Meanwhile, the simulation and calculation heat transfer in the furnace are also compared. The results show the new modified simulation has an approximate 4–11% lower than the thermodynamic calculation. To achieve an identical heat flux and temperature distributions with the air-fuel case, the molar fraction 29% of O2 is essential for the selected implementation. (CSPE)</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the natural oil circulation power transformer, the hot spot temperature and winding temperature should be within prescribed limits so as to ensure its life and reliability. Temperature rise of inner windings not only depends on the transformer loss, but relates to oil flow closely. Therefore, whether the oil flow of transformer and oil flow distribution rules among the three windings can be predicted or not, relates to success or failure of the winding temperature rise research. According to the structural characteristics of transformer, a three-dimensional computational model including windings and external radiators was built by a three-dimensional modeling software. Initially, from the view of flow, the flow resistance of natural oil circulation power transformer windings has been calculated and analyzed using the CFD methodology, and the resistance characteristic curves about high voltage windings, middle voltage windings, low voltage windings, radiators and pipelines were fitted respectively by the least square method. And then, on the basis of above, the porous media model was applied to simplify the integral model of transformer so as to build a three-dimensional coupled porous media-pure fluid computational model. Meanwhile, the author calculated porosities and linear resistance coefficients of high voltage, middle voltage and low voltage windings. At the end of this paper, to obtain the relationship of oil flow distribution among three windings, the pressure loss was calculated by numerical simulation. Compared with the theoretical calculation results which was based on the part of experimental data, the numerical calculation results are in agreement with these data. And the error between them is within 6 percent. Therefore, the feasibility and accuracy of calculation method, which was used to calculate oil flow of natural oil circulation power transformer windings by the porous media model, has been verified as well. There are two kinds of conventional method to calculate oil flow, including an empirical method and an experimental method. On the one hand, although the former kind of method can be applied conveniently, it cannot consider all the factors so that the accuracy cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand, experimental method to calculate the flow can present high accuracy, but the cost of carrying out experimental study is high. Therefore, this paper presents another calculation method aimed to the flow resistance and oil flow by CFD. And the calculation method presented has higher calculation accuracy compared to above. Meanwhile, the new method provides a theoretical reference about oil flow distribution for the design of the power transformer.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fast valving of ultra-supercritical unit has great effects on over-speed prevention, load-shedding control, transient stability analysis of electrical system and other security problems. The purpose of fast valving is to maintain the stability of power system once fault or load shedding of unit occurs in the electric power system. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the reliability of fast valving for ultra-supercritical unit. In this paper, the KU ( short shedding) logic condition of SIEMENS T3000 system is analyzed as the research object of fast valving. The unit can be avoided over speed by monitoring the unit load and fast valving under faulty grid conditions based on the KU control. A series of measures will be taken after KU is triggered, for instance the governing valving will be closed quickly and the DEH (digital electro-hydraulic) control of the steam turbine will be switched to speeding control mode. On the other hand, the unit will return to normal operation if the transient fault of power grid disappears. The key contributions of this thesis include three parts: Firstly, based on the analysis of control characteristics of ultra-supercritical unit and protective logic and triggered conditions of KU function, a novel dynamic model by coupling the fast valving of steam turbine and the transient stability of generator is established by applying the PSCAD software. Then, the dynamic response process of ultra-supercritical unit is simulated and calculated by adopting the coupling dynamic model when KU function is triggered. Also the influence factors and reliability of fast valving are analyzed under transient fault conditions. Finally, two optimized measures by increasing the time delay and the speed of quantitative judgment are put forward to reduce risks and avoid the misoperation of signal distortion which may be caused by the power transmitter under transient fault conditions. The results of this study can not only help to evaluate the reliability of fast valving function scientifically in power grid transient fault, but also guide the technicians to analyze the stability of the power grid.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In many parts of the world, the impact of renewable energy, especially from intermittent sources as wind and solar is continuously increasing. In Germany, the share of renewable energy in electricity production is believed to increase from 32.5% in 2015 to 50% in 2030. In order to operate an electrical system and control the mains frequency, the power supply must match the consumption at any time. Ancillary services like primary and secondary control are used to balance the system on a time-scale of several seconds up to 15 minutes. Those control reserves are usually provided by thermal power plants. Particularly in times of high shares of fluctuating renewable feed-in, thermal power plants are turned off or operated at minimum load to avoid electricity production at low electricity prices. However, an amount of about 3000 MW of fast responding primary control need to be provided in the European network of transmission system operators for electricity grid to maintain stable operation even in case of two simultaneous large unit outages. This requirement leads to situations, where thermal power plants are operated in minimum load below their marginal cost to provide control reserves even if there is a surplus of energy in the grid. Operation in low load while at the same time providing control reserves leads to new challenges. As the relation between energy production and the thermal storage capacities provided by the metal and fluid mass in the boiler is decreasing with the load, the ability of responding to control demands is naturally slowed down. Dynamic simulation of the thermodynamic power plant process turned out to be an efficient method to investigate such operational modes. Using comprehensive process models coupled with a control system model, equipment adaptions or control system updates can be evaluated in order to provide faster responses. By increasing the specific amount of ancillary services per unit, the number of units necessary to provide the total amount of primary and secondary control could be reduced in situations with energy surplus.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, the management level and information construction of wind power industry are still relatively backward, for example, the existing maintenance models for wind farm are much too single, and corrective maintenance strategy is the most commonly used, which means that maintenance measures are initiated only after a breakdown occurs in the system. Moreover, the wind farm spare parts management is out-dated, no practical and accurate spares demand assessment method is available. In order to enrich the choices of maintenance methods and eliminate the subjective influence in the demand analysis of spare parts, a spare parts demand prediction method for wind farm based on periodic maintenance strategy considering combination of different maintenance models for wind farms is proposed in this paper, which consists of five major steps, acquire the reliability functions of components, establish the maintenance strategy, set the maintenance parameters, maintenance strategy simulation and spare parts demand prediction. The discrete event simulation method is used to solve the prediction model, and results demonstrate the operability and practicality of the proposed demand forecasting method, which can provide guidance for the actual operation and maintenance of wind farms.</jats:p>",

Here, nutrient and phytoplankton vertical and horizontal distributions were investigated during a deep open‐ocean convection event and during the following spring bloom in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea (NWM). In February 2013, the deep convection event established a surface nutrient gradient from the center of the deep convection patch to the surrounding mixed and stratified areas. In the center of the convection area, a slight but significant difference of nitrate, phosphate and silicate concentrations was observed possibly due to the different volume of deep waters included in the mixing or to the sediment resuspension occurring where the mixing reached the bottom. One of this process, or a combination of both, enriched the water column in silicate and phosphate, and altered significantly the stoichiometry in the center of the deep convection area. This alteration favored the local development of microphytoplankton in spring, while nanophytoplankton dominated neighboring locations where the convection reached the deep layer but not the bottom. This study shows that the convection process influences both winter nutrients distribution and spring phytoplankton distribution and community structure. Modifications of the convection's spatial scale and intensity (i.e., convective mixing depth) are likely to have strong consequences on phytoplankton community structure and distribution in the NWM, and thus on the marine food web.</jats:p>",

A coordination principle is proposed to guide operating personnel to modify PFC parameters. First, the PFC parameters are calculated qualitatively based on the proposed principle according to the units of Zhejiang province-China. Second, as the important embodiment of the PFC ability, the PFC capacity of a unit is illustrated from the angle of control valve opening, condensate throttling and feed water bypass and the removing high-pressure heater. Third, several measures are put forward to help increase the economical efficiency and safety when units are working in low-load due to the access of UHV. Finally, the future developing directions and the problems which need to be solved are discussed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper proposed an approach to modeling alkali metal reacting dynamics in turbulent pulverized-coal combustion (PCC) using tabulated sodium chemistry. With tabulation, detailed sodium chemistry can be incorporated in large-eddy simulation (LES), but the expenses of solving stiff Arrhenius equations can be avoided. The sodium release rate from a pulverized-coal particle is assumed to be proportional to the pyrolysis rate, as a simplification. The chemical forms of released sodium is assumed to be atomic sodium Na, because atomic sodium is predicted to be the favoured species in a flame environment. A detailed sodium chemistry mechanism including 5 sodium species, i.e., Na, NaO, NaO2, NaOH and Na2O2H2, and 24 elementary reactions is tabulated. The sodium chemistry table contains four coordinates, i.e., the equivalence ratio, the mass fraction of the sodium element, the gas-phase temperature, and the progress variable. Apart from the reactions of sodium species, hydrocarbon volatile combustion has been modeled by a partially stirred reactor concept. Since the magnitude of sodium species is very small, i.e., at the ppm level, and the reactions of sodium species are slower than volatile combustion, one-way coupling is used for the interaction between the sodium reactions and volatile combustion, i.e., the former having no influence on the latter. A verification study has been performed to compare the predictions on sodium species evolutions in zero-dimensional simulations using the chemistry table against directly using the detailed sodium mechanism under various initial conditions, and their agreement is always good. The PCC-LES solver used in the present study is validated on a pulverized-coal jet flame ignited by a preheated gas flow. Good agreements between the experimental measurements and the LES results have been achieved on gas temperature, coal burnout and lift-off height. Finally, the sodium chemistry table is incorporated into the LES solver to model sodium reacting dynamics in turbulent pulverized-coal combustion. Properties of Loy Yang brown coal, for which sodium data are available, are used. Characteristics of the reacting dynamics of the 5 sodium species in a pulverized-coal jet flame are then obtained. The results show that Na and NaOH are the two major sodium species in the pulverized-coal jet flame. Na, the atomic sodium, has a high concentration in fuel-rich regions; while the highest NaOH concentration is found in regions close to the stoichiometric condition. It should be pointed out that the proposed chemistry tabulation approach can be extended to modeling potassium reacting dynamics in turbulent multiphase biomass combustion. (CSPE)</jats:p>",

The position of nodal maximum Von Mises stress is still located at the first tooth upper surface near the leading edge at the blade root of pressure side.
