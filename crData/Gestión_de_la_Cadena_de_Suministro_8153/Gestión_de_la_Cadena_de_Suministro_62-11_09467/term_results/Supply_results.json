Rats, varying in age from one month to over one year, were used to study the changes in the vascular supply to the molar teeth and periodontium as a result of aging. The blood vessels were demonstrated by the saline‐India‐gelatin perfusion method. The jaws and teeth were fixed in a formol‐acetic acid‐alcohol solution, decalcified, dehydrated, and embedded in nitro‐cellulose in the usual manner. The embedded specimens were sectioned at 100–250 μ, cleared by the Spalteholz method and mounted unstained.</jats:p><jats:p>2. In immature animals (younger than four months) the pulpal terminal vascular capillary networks were located at the predentin border. As the animals became progressively older, there was a gradual “withdrawal” of the terminal capillary plexuses from the odontoblastic zone so that at eight months of age, all the vascular terminals were restricted in location to the pulpal‐odontoblastic border.</jats:p><jats:p>3. In the young animal the vessels supplying the periodontal ligament passed gingivally paralleling the bony surface of the membrane with the cemental side being devoid of vessels. During the process of aging, the above basic pattern was altered in the following manner: (a) The apposition of cellular cementum on the apical third of the root was accompanied by the presence of capillary terminals in or adjacent to the layer of cellular cementum. (b) There was a progressive decrease and eventually a loss of the interseptal vessels and their perforating branches. (c) Vascular twigs originating from the main periodontal vascular trunk were found in areas of cemental resorption indicating their need in the process of repair.</jats:p>",

These factors are: the capacity factor of the proposed improvement, including the firming effect on the primary source of supply; the conjectural nature of the demand projections; and, the susceptibility of alternative plans to staged construction. Two general aspects of economic studies are considered: the choice of the formula to be used for deciding between the design alternatives; and, the rate of interest to be used to place events occurring at different times on a common basis.</jats:p>",

These terminate in sinusoidal capillaries within the cartilage, the corresponding veins leaving along the lines of entry of the radiate arteries. No anastomoses exist between adjacent intracartilaginous vessels, their distribution in the epiphysis being segmental. The lateral superior genicular radiate epiphyseal arteries, for example, supply a relatively fixed segment of the lateral femoral condyle. This arrangement no longer exists when the ossific center extends to involve the sinusoidal tips of more and more vessels, effective anastomoses eventually developing between all vessels supplying the lower end of the femur.</jats:p><jats:p>Analagous findings are reported in the tibia.</jats:p><jats:p>The patella is penetrated at its center and lower pole by nutrient arteries.</jats:p><jats:p>In adult bones a subarticular collecting vein system is orientated parallel to articular surfaces.
