      "abstract": "<jats:p>The review begins with a study of several analyses of statistics relating to interlibrary loan. The subjective nature of some of these is stressed and the danger of using statistical data in isolation is highlighted. Statistical evidence is also brought into the discussion about the conflict between interlending and preservation which centres on the difference between the book and the text. Whilst two authors take a rather conservative approach, the third looks on the problem with a more liberal attitude. Although the intrinsic safety of the materials involved is a partial barrier to interlending in developing countries, writers from both Africa and Latin America emphasize the major obstacles to advancing ILL are professional attitudes and jealousies. The proceedings of a seminar in India are reported in which a number of participants put forward possible interlending models for their country. The deliberations in Australia also centre round the alternative models available, and arguments over the costs involved persist leading to some novel arguments about making ILL a free service. The development of interlending in Illinois is examined in some detail. The impact of interlending on acquisitions policies is discussed in two papers which show that interlending is still a backup for low use material when viewed in this context. The review closes with a discussion of the future particularly in terms of money and resources which are likely to become more and more limited. The demise of the US plan for a National Periodicals Center is used to show that money and power are major elements in deciding the fate of interlending schemes.</jats:p>",

The decision maker's dilemma is that on the average, the accuracy of forecasts increases with time, but the benefit from the supply allocation decreases as the commitment is delayed. This planning problem is modeled as a Markovian stopping process with maximization of the expected utility of outcomes as the planning criterion. The optimal decision strategy, obtained via dynamic programming, prescribes the timing of the commitment and volume of the planned supply as a function of forecasts. The strategy takes explicitly into account uncertainties in the forecasts, value of water (economic or subjective), risk attitude of the decision maker, and utility reduction factor caused by delaying the commitment. An extensive numerical example illustrates the capabilities of the model as an aid to real‐time decision making and evaluation of the economic worth of forecasts.</jats:p>",

Many of these studies have used single equation, partial adjustment models with the price specified as the contract rate. In this study, two of the assumptions that underlie these previous studies are tested empirically. First, the proper specification of the price of mortgage funds is tested by using both the contract rate alone and all of the terms of the mortgage as the price. Second, the speed of adjustment in the mortgage market is examined by estimating the model in both the instantaneous adjustment and partial adjustment forms. Both of these tests are carried out using a simultaneous equation rather than a single equation model. The empirical results indicate that the contract rate along with the loan initiation fees, the loan‐to‐value ratio and the maturity is the better specification of price and that the partial adjustment model performs better than the instantaneous model in the mortgage market.</jats:p>",

Cultures of Vero cells on microcarriers were perfused with 100%, 50%, 25% and 12-5% modified L15 media (galactose was replaced with 10 mM-fructose, with 4 HIM-glutamine and 5% foetal bovine serum) in phosphate-buffered saline at either 4 or 8 vol. day−1. Cell growth, pH, dissolved oxygen, and changes in the metabolites, lactate to pyruvate and lactate to ammonia indices, demonstrated that under the conditions used in the present study, perfusion of cultures with 50% L15 medium in PBS at 8 vol. day−1’ provided the optimum microenvironment for Vero cell growth. The highest cell density in the perfused cultures was 3×107 cells ml−1, which at these conditions was ten times higher than the maximum cell density (3×106 cells ml−1’) obtained in a batch culture. Nutrient supply and conditioning factors were the most probable growth-limiting factors in cultures that were perfused with 12·5% and 25% L15 media, while multilayering, limitation of available oxygen, and accumulation of metabolic endproducts in the cellular microenvironment were the most probable causes of a densitydependent inhibition of cell growth observed under the optimized and overfed (supply of 100% L15 medium at the rate of 8 vol. day−1’) culture conditions. Under the optimized environmental condition, the major source of energy was probably glutamine during the first week. However, significant utilization of fructose became evident at higher cell densities during the second week, when lactate production dramatically declined and reached an almost undetectable level, while respiration progressively assumed the predominant role in energy production. It is postulated that ‘available’ oxygen in the multicell-layered microenvironment of the optimized cultures was higher than in the overfed culture due to the greater utilization rate of oxygen for oxidation of excess nutrients in the overfed culture.</jats:p>",

Plasma and red blood cells phospholipids were determined on days 1 and 20 in these 10 treated and six untreated infants on TPN and compared with those of normal control infants. On day 1, plasma nonessential FA including 20:3 n‐9(p &lt; 0.01) were increased in both TPN groups while 18:2 n‐6 and and 18:3 n‐3 (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.01) were decreased. On the 20th day, EFA deficiency had worsened with a decrease in plasma level of 20:4 n‐6 (p &lt; 0.02) and a higher than normal triene/tetraene ratio : 3.4±1.1 and 2.3±0.6 us 0.1±0.1 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.02). As for red blood cells phospholipids, 16:0 was increased and 18:2 n‐6 and 20:3 n‐6 were decreased (p &lt; 0.05) on day 1. On day 20, these FA were more abnormal while 20:3 n‐9 became significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). No difference was observed between the TPN groups at any time. These results show that cutaneous application of large amounts of EFA‐rich oil is unable to prevent or cure TPN induced EFA deficiency. <jats:italic>(Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition</jats:italic> 10:216–219, 1986)</jats:p>",

They can be kept in several separate groups, divided by electric fencing, each group containing sows at a similar stage of pregnancy. The use of a computer controlled feeder would allow the sows to be kept as one dynamic group and allow food intake to be controlled on an individual or group basis. Also, normal pelleted food can be used in such a machine. Bulky feeds are playing an increasing role in the diet of outdoor sows, and it was decided to investigate the use of an electronically controlled feeder to supply a compound feed to balance grazed fodder beet.</jats:p>",
