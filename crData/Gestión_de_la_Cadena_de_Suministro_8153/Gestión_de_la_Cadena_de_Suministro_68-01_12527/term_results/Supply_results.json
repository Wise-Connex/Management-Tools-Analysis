The article discusses run‐off data that indicates the amount of reduction that has occurred to the entire New York City system and each of the city's watersheds, including the Catskill, Croton, Delaware and Rondout Systems. Methods for restoring a dependable water supply are discussed, along with the effectiveness of the intensive water conservation campaign conducted by the city water department. The reduction in release requirements by the Delaware River Basin Commission to the Delaware River also helped the situation.</jats:p>",

Oxygen consumption and hatching rates in a Warburg experiment were compared with hatching rates in dilute agar gel systems involving supply of oxygen by diffusion. Mathematical solutions of oxygen supply for the diffusion systems are possible. Analysis of experiment and of simplified theory suggests that the isolated nematode egg sac or egg has a floating oxygen potential at its surface. For the systems tested there is apparently a linear relationship between cumulative exposure to oxygen concentration and cumulative hatch in both experiment and theory.</jats:p>"

Echinochloa tillered earlier than rice, and increasing nutrient supply encouraged more rapid tillering. Echinochloa competition reduced the number of rice tillers, panicles, and spikelets per panicle, and these effects were accentuated at high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus application. The percentage of grain filled spikelets was unaffected by increasing Echinochloa density except at high nutrient levels. Superphosphate did not increase the yield of rice, even in the absence of Echinochloa competition. The response by rice to nitrogen was reduced in the presence of barnyard grass. At high weed densities, crop failure resulted when phosphorus and high levels of nitrogen were both applied.</jats:p>"

The relation between the calculated supply to the root by root‐interception plus mass‐flow and the uptake of Ca and Sr was different for each species but was not affected by soil or transpiration rate. The relation between supply of Mn and Zn and uptake was not affected by plant species. The relation of the uptake of Mn was highly correlated with supply by root interception plus mass‐flow over a very wide range of values. The correlation observed between Zn uptake and the supply by root interception plus mass‐flow was lower than for Ca, Sr, or Mn because considerable quantities of Zn also reached the root by diffusion.</jats:p><jats:p>Three methods of calculating the quantity of root interception were evaluated by determining the relative degree of correlation between the calculated supply and uptake by the plant. The method which estimates the maximum possible root interception gave the highest correlation. The use of a parameter based on root area was very poorly correlated with uptake.</jats:p>",
