      "abstract": "<jats:p>This symposium begins with a paper written by Ronald G. Allen, Director of the Water Research Association, a British association dedicated to research in the water field. The paper begins by discussing how the British government, in 1916, created the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) whose objective was to encourage industry by creating “research establishments” for various fields of technical and scientific disciplines, and to provide them with scientific and financial support. The Water Research Association is the newest of the 50 research associations that qualify for government assistance through DSIR. This paper discusses the function and progress of DSIR, along with the basic structure and common goals of the research association movement as a whole. The second paper in this symposium was written by Albert E. Berry, General Manager of the Ontario Water Resources Commission, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The paper discusses the present status and attitudes about water research in Canada, along with past accomplishments and previous experience in research (specifically the McCrady project in Quebec), and using Canada's research facilities to their fullest extent. The Ontario Water Research Commission (OWRC) is discussed in detail. The third paper of the symposium was written by Harry A. Faber, Research Grants Coordinator of the U.S. Public Health Service, and discusses the development of water research in the United States. The paper begins with the establishment of the Lawrence Experiment Station of the Massachusetts State Board of Health in 1887, where the first basic studies of water filtration were done in 1890. The paper goes on to cover such topics as the definition and nature of research, statistics on the number of U.S. water research projects, the principal federal agencies in charge of basic‐data studies in water, the process of publishing and distributing the research, and the future needs of water quality research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>‘Laminar’ bone, commonly found in artiodactyls and dinosaurs, is described. It consists of a series of bony laminae arranged like tree-rings round the marrow cavity, each lamina being between o-i and o-2 mm thick. Sandwiched between each lamina and the next is an effectively two-dimensional network of blood-vessels. Laminar bone grows in a series of spurts ; a sheet of woven-fibred bone is formed very quickly, not actually on the pre-existing sub-periosteal surface, but separated from it by a space. The new bone is held clear of the original surface by an occasional bridge of bone. The space so formed is filled in slowly by parallel-fibred lamellar bone, and while this is going on more woven bone, with spaces, may be formed by the periosteum.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The vascularization of laminar bone on the one hand and bone composed of haversian systems on the other is compared, chiefly in cattle. Laminar bone has a more intimate blood-supply than haversian bone, and it has a larger surface area of bloodchannel per unit volume. The volume of channel per unit volume is about equal in the two types of bone. The mean distance between anastomoses is less in laminar than in haversian bone. The cement-line round haversian systems hinders the passage of materials through the canaliculi. The osteocytes in the interstitial lamellae are thus in a worse position for obtaining foodstuffs and disposing of waste products than osteocytes in laminar bone a similar distance from the nearest blood-vessel.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>It is suggested that the formation of haversian systems in laminar bone interferes with the latter’s blood-supply and leads to the formation of further haversian systems.</jats:p>",

Besides a small stock of ores to draw on at the beginning of the period, high‐quality foreign ores have to be imported or low‐quality domestic ores made suitable for the production of alloys. In the latter case, however, the plants for upgrading and processing the ores first have to be constructed. The objective is to meet the requirements, assumed here to be given for the years of limited war, at minimum cost. The cost function contains, besides linear, also quadratic terms, positive as well as negative ones. Two recently developed computational methods have been used to solve the problem.</jats:p>",
