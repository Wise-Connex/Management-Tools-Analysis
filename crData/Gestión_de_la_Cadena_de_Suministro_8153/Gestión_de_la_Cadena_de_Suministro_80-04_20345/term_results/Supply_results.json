This follicular artery first undergoes a series of convolutions and branchings, out of which a parallel array of tightly bound arterioles and capillaries, an anteriorlar capillary bundle (ACB), leading into the central part of the nodule is formed. From the proximal end, side, and distal end of the ACB, arterioles and capillaries radiate outward through the mantle zone of the nodule to terminate in the marginal zone. Some capillaries are formed within the bundle and others not until an arteriole nearly reaches the marginal zone.</jats:p><jats:p>A similar ACB and capillary distribution is found in the human spleen.

A polynominal distributed lag model is fitted to quarterly data with deflated prices for the period 1966 to 1978. The variations in the number of milk cows is explained by about 98 percent. Farmers react positively to milk prices after 1–2 years, while wages and feed prices have a negative impact on cow numbers. Milk production per cow shows positive adjustments to milk prices after 6 to 15 months. Technology and feed prices influence also milk production <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mime-subtype=\"gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"S0163548400002405_inline1\" /> While the short-run price elasticity of milk production is only .2, the long-run aggregate elasticity grows to 2.8 percent.

MAPS is a set of computer based models which can be used to simulate the water resource alternatives and to develop planning level design and cost estimates. Two application examples are discussed. The Salinas‐Monterey (California) Urban Study sought to identify and determine cost of combinations of water source, transmission, and treatment to meet an array of water needs in future years. The Nashville (Tennessee) Urban Study had similar objectives but the output was prepared on a service area basis for more than 40 such units. Using MAPS it was possible to prepare planning level design and cost estimates for a very large number of alternatives.</jats:p>",

Multipurpose planning requires long‐range forecasts and the accuracy of the forecasts has a significant effect on economic benefits. In an effort to increase the accuracy of snowrnelt runoff forecasts, selected practices in water supply forecasting were evaluated. These practices include 1) using multiple regression in developing forecasting models;2) using a model that was calibrated to make forecasts an April 1 for making forecasts at other times;3) using maximum snow water equivalent measurements in forecast equations; and 4) using weighted snow water equivalent measurements for making forecasts. The results of a case study indicate that forecasting accuracy is significantly affected by these practices. Goodness‐of‐fit statistics may not be indicative of the accuracy of forecasts when the prediction equations are used to make forecasts for dates other than that used in calibration. The use of maximum snow water equivalentmeasurements and weighted averages did not improve forecast accuracy.</jats:p>",

This paper reports the results of two integrated studies of (1) recreation users of Quabbin Reservation, the largest inland water source in New England and (2) the general public of Massachusetts. Data were obtained by conducting on‐site interviews of Quabbin users and through state‐wide telephone interviews of the general public; both studies focused on assessing attitudes toward the recreational use of drinking water reservoirs in Massachusetts.</jats:p><jats:p>Unlike the findings of a 1969 study conducted by Baumann, results showed that the majority of Massachusetts residents do not favor recreation‐prohibiting laws for most activities. Most favored at least moderate use of reservoirs for recreational purposes. In addition, over all views were not as restrictive as present legislation would suggest. Finally, these findings suggest that current recreation‐prohibiting laws should be reassessed in light of pugblic opinion which favors the use of these valuable resources.</jats:p>",
