As these young women age (from 21 to 25 years on average) they become increasingly likely to have young children, to be employed, and to use nonrelative forms of child care. A multivariate analysis reveals that rising wage rates and changes in household structure are important determinants of these upward trends. Further analysis reveals a considerable amount of movement each year among states defined by the presence of young children, employment, and child care arrangement. Overall the young women in the NLSY can be characterized as being in a volatile stage of their lives, when many economic and demographic factors are changing. They appear to respond to these changes by altering their labor supply and child care behavior.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A proportional pressure relief valve is used to control the pressure supply to an electrohydraulic servo-valve in conjunction with a novel yet simple way of eliminating position error. This requires the measurement of the load force and a means of adjusting the supply pressure as the load force changes. The technique hinges on the need to have symmetrical underlapping of the servo-valve spool, and this then enables position error to be eliminated, the transient behaviour to be optimized, and a fortuitous improvement in power dissipated. The concept is verified by the use of a two-axis system, the main position control axis being rotated in a vertical plane, thus creating a variable load. The effect of pressure adaptation is clearly shown for slowly varying rotation of the test axis, pressure adaptation being achieved via a microcomputer interfaced between the load-sensing transducer and the proportional pressure relief valve. </jats:p><jats:p> The dynamic performance for rapid changes in the demanded position is studied, and it is shown how a linearized transfer function approach leads to a simple design strategy. It is shown that fluid compressibility effects are negligible owing to an appropriate choice of servo-valve spool underlap, which also leads to a robust design in terms of the closed-loop damping ratio. This leads to simplicity in maintaining optimum dynamic performance, which is then only affected by supply pressure changes which are known. </jats:p>",
