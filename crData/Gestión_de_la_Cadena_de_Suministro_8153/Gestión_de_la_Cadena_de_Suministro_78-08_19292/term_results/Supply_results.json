This paper offers some criticisms of the procedure and outlines an alternative procedure which divides the variance of gross revenue into components due to demand variability, supply variability and interaction between these. The procedure is used to investigate the causes of instability in quarterly beef revenues in the Australian beef industry. Since demand and supply variability are both important contributors to beef revenue instability, direct market intervention to stabilise beef industry revenues would be a complex and risky task.</jats:p>",

This amount of supercooling is very significant in a water main in that it will have a major effect on the way in which a pipe freezes. The effects of the temperature‐time history of the water, of the presence of certain nuclating agents and of mechanical vibration on the nucleation temperature were determined and were related to the behaviour of undissolved particulate matter in the water. In addition to determining the nucleation temperature in a water supply under various conditions this study also serves to illustrate some of the phenomena that can be expected in general when hetergeneous nucleation occurs.</jats:p>",

Any empirical investigation of the nature of a supply function disturbance is hampered by considerable uncertainty about the deterministic part of the function. Nevertheless, some progress might be made by considering alternative disturbance specifications in conjunction with a variety of deterministic specifications. Applying this approach to the supply of wheat in southern N.S.W., we find some empirical support for an additive disturbance and, surprisingly, for the use of price, rather than revenue, as an argument In supply functions.</jats:p>",
