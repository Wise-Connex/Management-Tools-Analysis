      "abstract": "<jats:p>Concurrent design and engineering in the supply chain are vital to the growing competitiveness of the US automotive industry. However, these innovative design and development processes are hampered if product data cannot be exchanged seamlessly across the supply chain. This paper estimates that imperfect interoperability costs the US automotive industry about $1 billion per year and delays the introduction of new models by at least two months. It also evaluates different methods for alleviating interoperability problems and concludes that emerging technologies and formats offer promising solutions that may lead to significant savings for the industry. Benefits from alleviating interoperability problems can also be realized in other product data exchange‐intensive supply chains like shipbuilding and aerospace.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article discusses about a universal CAD language that would enable users to pass information freely back and forth between systems without a great deal of translation. Vital CAD information can get lost or botched when models are translated by means of initial graphics exchange specification (IGES) or standard for the exchange of product model data (STEP). Many small suppliers are more agile than their larger, bureaucracy-bound counterparts. BMW is experimenting with CAD conferencing technology that is similar to Harbec's software, although it has not yet brought a system in-house. Automakers must use CAD conferencing and other collaborative technologies more, but they are often held back by one very important issue: security. Collaborative technology allows OEMs to get design, document, and pricing information to their suppliers more easily, but it really does not change the true nature of the supplier and OEM relationship, which has historically included sharing documents and a level of trust.</jats:p>",

Using employment data at the county level, it is found that the help supply services in the South were concentrated in metropolitan areas with a population of 250,000 or more, and in central counties of metropolitan areas. However, there is relative decentralization downward and outward as help supply services expanded both hierarchically from large-and-medium metropolitan areas to small metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan areas and horizontally from central counties to sub-urban counties and nonmetropolitan counties.</jats:p>",

This case study documents Griffin’s survival through evolution in capabilities, technology, and especially attitude. The Griffin case study suggests that keeping a portion of the manufacturing onshore at an agile, quick response factory is cost effective: it increases sales and improves margins. However, the new relationship between the parties is much more complex and requires commitment on both sides.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many organizations have only recently recognized that sharing information with other members in their supply chain can lead to signficant reduction in the total costs.Usually these information flows are incorporated into existing operating policies at the various parties.In this paper we argue that, in some cases, it may be necessary to change the way the supply chain is managed to make complete use of the information flows. We support this argument by analyzing a supply chain containing a capacitated supplier and a retailer facing i.i.d. demands. In addition there are fixed ordering costs between the retailer and the supplier.In this setting, we consider two models: (1) the retailer is using the optimal (s,S) policy and providing the supplier information about her inventory levels; and (2) the retailer, still sharing information on her inventory levels, orders in a period only if by the previous period the cumulative end-customer demand since she last ordered was greater than δ. Thus, in Model 1, information sharing is used to supplement existing policies; while, in Model 2, we have redefined operating policies to make better use of the information flows. We will show, via a detailed computational study, that the total supply chain costs of Model 2 are 10.4% lower, on the average, than that of Model 1. We noticed that this reduction in costs is higher at higher capacities, higher supplier penalty costs, lower retailer penalty costs, moderate values of set-up cost, and at lower end-customer demand variances. </jats:p>",

Vertical mixing is found to be the dominant supply mechanism in the subpolar North Atlantic, while horizontal advection provides most of the simulated nitrate input into the subtropical gyre. Contributions by vertical advection are largest in the equatorial upwelling region and in the subpolar gyre. A comparison with observational estimates of nitrate flux into euphotic zone of the subtropical gyre reveals that the model can simultaneously fit the estimates by <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#jgrc8537-bib-0028\"><jats:italic>Lewis et al.</jats:italic> [1986]</jats:ext-link> and <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#jgrc8537-bib-0021\"><jats:italic>Jenkins</jats:italic> [1988]</jats:ext-link> that were previously thought to be contradictory. The simulated nitrate supply is, on the other hand, not consistent with estimates of export production based on oxygen consumption [<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#jgrc8537-bib-0019\"><jats:italic>Jenkins</jats:italic>, 1982</jats:ext-link>]. The model results are used to investigate to what extent the advective input of organic matter could possibly explain a local imbalance between new and export production. It turns out that the simulated advective input of organic matter alone, which in the model provides nitrogen at a rate similar to that arising from nitrate supply, is not sufficient to explain observed oxygen consumption rates.</jats:p>",

There is a single means–tested benefit involving a ‘taper rate’ at which benefits are withdrawn as earnings increase. It is found that take–up increases as the level of the taper rate increases, and the value of benefits increases. The achievement of 100% take–up is associated with labour supply responses whereby there are few, if any, individuals who are both working and eligible for benefits. The results have implications for the effects of lowering the taper rate on the costs and effective targeting of benefits.</jats:p>",

Logistics and supply chain management emphasize achieving lowest total cost through synergistic interaction of all supply chain components. The cash‐to‐cash (C2C) metric is an important measure as it bridges across inbound material activities with suppliers, through manufacturing operations, and the outbound sales activities with customers. This paper first defines how to calculate C2C. It then overviews the importance of measuring C2C, using both accounting and supply chain management perspectives. Next, it identifies key leverage points that are necessary to manage C2C effectively. Finally, future research questions are developed that should prove useful in guiding the development of C2C as a usable metric.</jats:p>",

Supply chain simulation (SCS)is a strong and popular tool for designing, evaluating, and optimizing the structure of supply chains, and it requires an important task to estimate the effect of the planning to coordinate such flows in SCM. Stochastic natures existing in the supply chain can be analyzed efficiently using simulation. One uses discrete-event simulation to model a supply chain in general. However, the nature of the supply chain system is neither completely discrete nor continuous; both aspects must be considered together in developing an SCS model. In this paper, a framework of discrete-continuous combined modeling for supply chain simulation is proposed. Equations for the continuous aspects of a supply chain in this framework are included, and a simple example of the SCS model using this equation is presented. </jats:p>",

The trend over these 28 years is for subemployment to range from 20 to 30 percent of the labor supply, tending to rise from the early 1970s through the early 1990s, and then, in the last seven years, to decline.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Like bakers forced to grow wheat, scientists now find themselves with the burden of producing their own raw materials for studies of aging. A central supply of laboratory mice is genetically contaminated, curtailing the availability of animals for 2 years, National Institute on Aging (NIA) officials informed researchers on 8 May. The situation threatens to invalidate results from existing research projects and delay future studies.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>NIA provides aged mice to researchers at academic and nonprofit institutions. Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc., an Indianapolis-based commercial supplier of laboratory animals, maintains the animals under contract with NIA. The cause of the contamination is unknown, but it appears to have affected mice in two environmentally isolated chambers. One contains half of NIA's aged C57BL/6 mice, the strain most commonly used for studies on aging. The two enclosures together house all of NIA's calorically restricted animals. (Caloric restriction extends rodent life-span.) Several hybrid lines are also affected. No one knows how many animals are contaminated because only a fraction of them has been tested.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Last month, a researcher notified NIA after her experimental results suggested that some animals obtained from the colony didn't carry genes that they were supposed to have, according to Nancy Nadon, chief of the Office of Biological Resources and Resource Development at NIA. Nadon says she reviewed genetic test results, which revealed that the contamination arose in spring 2000. According to NIA's contract with Harlan, the company bears responsibility for monitoring sample animals for genetic contamination and for immediately reporting any problems to NIA. Harlan executive vice president Jack McGinley confirmed the genetic contamination but would not elaborate on the testing procedure or why 2 years elapsed before the contamination came to light.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>NIA will use its remaining stock to replace tainted animals that already have been shipped to investigators. Nadon anticipates that no new requests will be filled until June or July; those orders will go to NIA grantees only, and delays are likely. According to NIA, dieting mice won't be available for at least 2 years--the amount of time required to develop a new colony. Researchers can arrange through NIA for the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, to test animals or tissue for genetic contamination. \"A lot of completed work can be validated if we can show that some of the animals are OK,\" says Nadon.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>NIA supplies about 20,000 mice a year, and 300 different investigators received animals during the 2-year period since the contamination occurred. The consequences are already clear to some scientists. \"A research project for which we just received funding has been halted,\" says biochemist Stephen Spindler of the University of California, Riverside. \"We're going to have to buy young animals and age them ourselves before we can begin the study.\" That means spending nearly 3 years on a study that might otherwise have taken 3 months.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>--R.

Algal resources were sufficiently renewable that no significant difference in growth rate was detected between the dominants of the competitive groups and the two types of solitary enclosures, indicating that the defended area supplied algal resources that exceeded the dominants’ ability to grow. All the territorial holders realized an increase in relative body weight, suggesting the occurrence of inhibition, which corresponds to Verner’s concept of superterritory. However, as inferred from the pheophytin/chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>ratios, algae within a territory showed less senescence, perhaps owing to cropping by the dominant, and this was considered to be an adaptive response by the fish to an unpredictable food supply. In conclusion, the ayu conditionally defends a territory for long‐term benefits, and inhibition is a consequence of facultative territory size and not a cause of it.</jats:p>",

This paper helps clarify the nature of project alliancing and how alliance member organisations were selected for this case study. A core issue that differentiates between the two approaches is that in partnering, partners may reap rewards at the expense of other partners. In alliancing each alliance member places their profit margin and reward structure “at risk”. Thus in alliancing, the entire alliance entity either benefits together or not all. This fundamentally changes the motivation and dynamics of the relationship between alliance members. </jats:p>",

Ten case studies have been conducted in organizations using the European Article Numbering (EAN) system for the application of business‐to‐business e‐commerce. The evidence from these indicates that those organizations that implement this system for electronic commerce with trading partners from a “strategic” stance can reap substantial benefits. It is also apparent that adoption of this system has at times been slow, and essentially driven by trading partners. There are, however, barriers to implementation and difficult organizational issues that need to be addressed in order to ensure these potential benefits are realised. It is also apparent that these barriers have been perceived to be strong in the past. The point of convergence for all case companies is in their preparedness to adopt and apply new technologies such as the Internet, and their commonly held view that these technologies will become increasingly important enablers of business‐to‐business e‐commerce in the near future.</jats:p>",

The concordant transience of the\n            <jats:italic>prrA</jats:italic>\n            mutant phenotype and\n            <jats:italic>prrA</jats:italic>\n            promoter activity indicates that the PrrA-PrrB two-component system is involved in the environmental adaptation of\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            , specifically in an early phase of the intracellular growth, and that, similar to other facultative intracellular parasites,\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            can use genes temporarily required at different stages in the course of macrophage infection.\n          </jats:p>",
