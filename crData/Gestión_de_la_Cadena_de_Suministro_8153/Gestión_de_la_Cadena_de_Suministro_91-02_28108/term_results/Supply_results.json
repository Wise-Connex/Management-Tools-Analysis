Data from the Matlab Family Planning Health Services Project are used to examine the contributions of these factors to the difference in prevalence of modern contraceptive use between the project area and a control area served by the government family planning and health programs. Results of multivariate analysis deriving from the Easterlin synthesis framework show the importance of family planning supply factors in reducing psychic and resource costs of fertility regulation and in activating latent demand for contraception. Demand for birth limiting and for birth spacing emerge as important explanatory factors; demand for birth spacing is greater in the project area, and both demand measures exert a stronger effect on contraceptive behavior in that area.</jats:p>",

The analysis measures the benefits arising to consumers and producers of stumpage from increases in softwood stumpage availability. Over the period of the analysis, average total benefits are roughly equal between the pulpwood and solidwood (combined lumber and plywood) stumpage markets. Average combined benefits range from $1.3 million to $5.3 million per year (1967 $). The size of the total benefits are more greatly affected by the level of shift assumed than they are by the structural characteristics of the market. The distribution of the benefits, however, differs quite markedly depending on the market structure. Pulpwood consumers (pulp and paper mills), for instance, receive greater than 150% of the total benefits from increased productivity effects on stumpage production as producers receive negative benefits. Solidwood producers receive positive benefits from increasing supply, although only 10% of the total benefits that are created. These distributional imbalances in the effects of policies designed to improve forest productivity should be considered in future analyses which assess the impacts and returns of these policies.</jats:p>",

In the marketplace, however, the growth of a new product can be retarded by supply restrictions such as the unavailability of the product due to limitations on the production capacity or difficulties encountered in setting up distribution systems. In the presence of supply restrictions, diffusion models must be developed to capture the dynamics of supply restrictions and to allow management to evaluate the impact of such supply restrictions on the growth of a new product in the market place. Based on the Bass innovation diffusion model, the objective of this paper is to suggest a parsimonious diffusion model that integrates the demand side dynamics with the supply side restrictions. The sensitivity of innovation diffusion patterns in the presence of supply restrictions is examined. An application examining the diffusion of new telephones in Israel is documented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model. </jats:p>",

Harvest could expand dramatically in later years, however, if the high rates of plantation establishment observed during the 1980s are maintained into the next century. Industrial harvest will continue to rise, but cannot increase fast enough to offset the nonindustrial shortfall. Sawtimber stumpage prices will rise sharply over the period to 2015 and stabilize or decline thereafter. Higher rates of planting influence only the later portion of this projection. Prospects of higher rates of recycled fiber use in U.S. paper and board production could have dramatic implications for the adequacy of Southern timber supply and sharply reduce stumpage price growth in both the near- and long-term.

For northeastern U.S. dairy farms, these elasticities are shown to vary with farm size because of size‐related differences in capital intensity, specialization, yield and herd size variability, and rates of entry/exit into dairy. In the short run, price responsiveness is shown to decrease with farm size. In the long run, large farms are shown to be most price responsive. Results suggest that lower milk prices could make revenue distribution less equal in both the short and long run by altering output and population distributions.</jats:p>",

The medial and intermediate muscles are supplied by separate branches of rostral spinal nerves and do not attach to the branchial skeleton. The lateral muscle therefore is the most likely homologue of the cucullaris (trapezius) of sharks and perhaps other fishes and tetrapods.

Our goal was to identify differences within the public and target groups who might be receptive to educational efforts to increase donation. We distinguish differences in attitude and demographic characteristics in three groups: those committed to donation, those opposed, and those who might change their opinions with more specific information. While approval of donation is nearly universal, only about half of the public would donate a relative's organs when they do not know the relative's preference. Whites, higher-income individuals, and those with higher educational levels were more favorable. Those who might change their minds fall midway between those committed and those opposed, both demographically and by attitude. They include more nonwhites and more individuals with incomes less than $25,000 than members of the group committed to donation. Targeting public education messages to this group is likely to have the most success in reducing the gap between supply and demand for human organs.</jats:p>",

We hypothesized that, in a soil with little moisture retention capacity, irregular rainfall patterns would result in large fluctuations of water supply and, in the early wet season, drought episodes could cause seedling death. This hypothesis was tested in a seasonal tropical forest in Mexico where seedling density is low and the soil consists of almost pure sand with a low water retention capacity. Various patterns of simulated rainfall were applied in the forest to seeds and seedlings of three common tree species. Overall very little difference in germination and seedling survival was observed between the various rainfall treatments. The results showed that rainfall patterns and the soil texture may interact in a much more complex way than was initially hypothesized, and that water availability to seeds and seedlings is not necessarily predictable. The absence of seedlings of the three tree species might be better explained by high seed predation and low light level in the understorey.</jats:p>",
