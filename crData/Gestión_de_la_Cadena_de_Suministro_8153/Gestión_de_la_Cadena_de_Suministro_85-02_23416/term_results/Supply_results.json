In 1913, the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, was founded ‘for the improvement of the well‐being of the masses’, which led to the development of the Central Library for Students, the Rural Libraries and the Regional Library systems, out of which grew the county libraries that complete the public libraiy coverage of the United Kingdom today.</jats:p>",

The frequency range is from 0.5 to 10 Hz. The output bears a ripple which is as large as ±15% at a voltage of 12.5 kV. The distinctive features, besides the waveform, lie in that it simultaneously serves the two electrodes with voltages of the same magnitude and of different polarities so that the electric potential at the center of the electrodes is always maintained at the ground level, and that the modification of the output waveform is possible by making a change in the waveform to the dc-to-dc inverters.</jats:p>",

Using plant bioassays, forest floor materials from representative examples of each of the major forest types in interior Alaska were examined for nutrient supplying power. The work supports conclusions reached in earlier studies which indicated that black spruce forest floors were highly nutrient limited compared with those of other interior Alaska forest types. In addition, floodplain white spruce forests may experience marked P deficiency because of dilution of the element by periodic siltation. Potential phosphorus supply for seedling growth was best described by P concentration of the rooting medium. The supply also was related to the concentrations of lignin and tannin which control forest floor decomposition and recycling of P within the microbial population. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works in Melbourne, Australia operates two principle models of its water supply system. The first of these is a headworks model that simulates the major reservoirs and transfer mains of Melbourne's water supply system. This model uses monthly data for both the long‐term planning of the water supply system and in assisting in operational decisions regarding transfers of water between headworks storages. The second model is a network model that solves for heads and flows within Melbourne's water supply distribution system. The model can be run over a 24‐hour period and is used for investigating ways of improving the distribution of water within the system and for assisting and training operational staff. This paper describes the application of this network model to Melbourne's water supply system, including the implementation of computer graphics techniques. Examples demonstrating the application of color graphics to different parts of the system are given together with a discussion of the present integrated modeling, operation, and telemetry capability. The models will be continually modified and improved as both new systems are added to Melbourne's water supply system and greater knowledge of the existing system is ained. The implementation and use of the 24‐hour network simulation program by the Board has already resulted in a current savings in excess of $30 million. This is more than six times the total cost of the modeling and telemetry system. Future benefits are expected to add to this savings.</jats:p>",

Efficient operation should result in minimum operation cost through reduction in total energy use and/ or reduction in on‐peak energy consumption. An optimization model was designed for operating the water supply systems of cities using groundwater. The Newton‐Raphson pipe network was used for network analysis and a dynamic programming optimization algorithm was used for determining a schedule for pump operation in the pipe network system. The model is most suitable for use in small cities with up to 45,000 in population, but with large‐scale disintegration techniques may also be used for larger cities. The savings in operation costs are a function of energy cost and energy use pattern and water use pattern in the area.</jats:p>",
