      "abstract": "<jats:p>A national survey of interlibrary lending in the UK was undertaken during the two weeks beginning 11 February 1985 to establish the current pattern of activity and to compare it with the picture as painted in a 1977 survey. Data collection forms were sent to all 5,804 UK addresses on the British Library Document Supply Centre's list of registered users. An actual response of 2,331 (41%) was achieved, recording a total of 76,402 transactions. The broad pattern of interlending appears to have remained constant over the last eight years. Categories of material in demand and the types of library from which the demand originates are almost exactly the same in 1985 as in 1977. Performance has, however, deteriorated: supply times are slower; the number of applications required for a single item has increased. The Document Supply Centre remains the principal interlending channel and source of supply: co‐operatives and regional systems carry only a small share of the total traffic; the efficiency of location tools seems to be low; new technology has made little impression on interlending. Most requests (72%) are sent unchecked to the Document Supply Centre, which seems to reflect the confidence fostered by the existence of a large, centralized and dedicated resource.</jats:p>",

A survey of 154 medical oncology training programs revealed 767 current trainees—316 first year, 307 second year, and 144 third year. Seventeen programs contained 301 persons (38.5%). After the 1985 certifying examination, 3,659 oncologists were certified. With approximately 750 eligible candidates for each examination, and assuming a 75% pass rate, by 1989 there will be 4,779 certified medical oncologists. By 1990, there will be no deficiency of clinical medical oncologists, but there appears to be a lack of academic oncologists. In order to assure the quality goals of oncology, and in an attempt to meet an adequate supply of medical oncologists, a position statement has been published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. To avoid an overproduction of medical oncologists, an ongoing assessment of the number needed is warranted.</jats:p>",

P uptake was lower in the lower water treatment at all P-supply levels, even when the P-supply was severely limiting P uptake. This reduction in P uptake at all P levels was equivalent to the reduction in water volume between the two water treatments, and is apparently a result of a lower supply of solution phosphate in the lower water treatment in the highly buffered soil.</jats:p>"

The most important ones are maintained by the Royal Library in The Hague, the Technical University at Delft, and the Library of the Agricultural University at Wageningen. On‐line library automation will have an increasing impact on interlending, and the challenge is being met by these libraries by setting up an on‐line catalogue of serials, monographs and conference publications combined with an on‐line system for handling interlibrary loan requests developed by the Project for Integrated Catalogue Automation (PICA). The first phase — the serials system — came on‐line in May 1983, and it is hoped the monograph system will be in operation by early 1986.</jats:p>",

The framework for the analysis is a two‐period model in which saving and labor supply are alternative sources of both present disutility and future income. The individual is assumed to make simultaneously his saving and labor supply decisions prior to the resolution of the uncertainty about the future price level. We find that, under theoretically plausible and empirically relevant assumptions about attitudes toward risk, an increase in future price level uncertainty increases individual saving and labor supply. These results imply that, for the economy as a whole, increased uncertainty about the future price level increases output and employment, while decreasing the real rate of interest, the present price level, and economic welfare.</jats:p>",

The response of the plants was analysed for three distinct stages of dehydration. In stage I, the rate of transpiration remained constant and equal to that of well watered plants even though soil water status fell by more than 50%. Stage II began when the rate of soil water supply to the plant was less than potential transpiration and stomates closed resultingjn the maintenance of plant water balance. When soil water content was expressed as a fraction of transpirable soil water, all species showed a transition from stage I to stage II at a fraction of transpirable soil water of about 0.3 to 0.2. As the soil water declined further, all species had a similar decrease in relative transpiration rate. Consequently, the responses of the four species in stages I and II were essentially identical, except that pigeonpea extracted a slightly greater amount of soil water. \n    Stage III occurred once stomates had reached minimum conductance and water loss was then a function of the epidermal conductance and the environment around the leaf. Substantial differences were found among the four grain legumes in epidermal conductance. Soybean had the highest conductance, followed by black gram, cowpea and pigeonpea. Substantial variation in dehydration tolerance among the four grain legumes was also found: the ranking of dehydration tolerance based on the relative water content was pigeonpea &gt; cowpea &gt; mungbean &gt; soybean. Differences among the four grain legume species in the duration of stage III which finished when plants died, were consistent with differences in epidermal conductance and in dehydration tolerance of leaves.</jats:p>"

In the presence of these constraints, it is shown that if researchers are concerned with obtaining consistent parameter estimates of the labor supply function, then it is important to correctly specify the type of uncertainty faced by workers. Specifically, a mean preserving increase‐ in wage‐rate uncertainty lowers the participation rate, while an increase in non‐wage income uncertainty raises participation.</jats:p>",

However, since these models are generally used for policy analysis they are required to satisfy some degree of theoretical consistency. This requirement has generally led to the adoption of rather simple ‘inflexible’ models based on additive preferences or linear labour supply responses. We estimate and test a sequence of models for the labour supply of married working women, emphasizing the importance of testing both the thecretical and statistical assumptions underlying the models.</jats:p>",

Sustainable agriculture can undoubtedly play an important role in joining the two sectors; however, before this can occur research is needed to answer questions in many areas. Some consumer concerns regarding the safety of the food supply can be abated through the use of sustainable practices in food production and processing which can lessen exposure to toxic contaminants and conserve resources. Among the farming issues considered here are pesticide toxicities and their synergistic interactions, yields, storability, nutrient quality, nitrates, mycotoxins, and antibiotics used in meat production. The manipulation of commodities during processing is also addressed, including the intense refining of grains, fortification and vitamin supplementation, imitation food, and food additives. Analogies between production and processing operations are drawn and specific research needs identified.</jats:p>"

These are powered by several types of power sources with differing voltages, e.g., commercial ac power sources as well as batteries. A multi‐input‐type converter is developed to simplify circuit configuration and realize a low‐loss power system.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper presents a method of designing a multiinput transformer as well as the operation principle of a multiinput‐type uninterruptible power supply and the circuit technology required for it. The power supply can be realized if the transformer primary winding‐turn ratio is designed considering the input voltage variation range and the voltage‐drop in the transformer primary circuit. The fact that the switching‐duty ratio must be changed drastically and that the switching transistor loss is inclined to increase in a multiinput‐type converter causes some problems. It is shown that the application of a collector current proportional drive circuit to the forward‐type converter or a base resistor switching circuit to the flyback‐type converter is effective in reducing the converter loss and the converter can be simplified by using most of the converter circuits in common.</jats:p>",
