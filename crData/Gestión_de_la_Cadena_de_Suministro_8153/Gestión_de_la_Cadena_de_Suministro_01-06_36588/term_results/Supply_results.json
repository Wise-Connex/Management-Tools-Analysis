      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>This article presents the findings of research into how and why large, multiunit firms make major changes to the organizational structure of the supply function. The research used case‐based methodology to investigate 10 large companies that had recently made a major supply structure change. A total of 15 major supply organizational changes were studied at the 10 sites. The research found that these major changes were a result of changes in the overall corporate structure, challenging the conventional view found in standard purchasing texts that supply executives have flexibility in matters of organizational design. The research identified that a common driver for corporate organizational change in each of the sites studied involved an attempt by the company to improve its cost structure. Chief financial officers (CPOs), business unit managers, consultants, and chief purchasing officers (CPOs) were all identified as having involvement in the supply organizational structure change process at some sites. A principal challenge for CPOs is to understand how to provide supply improvement opportunities under any organizational structure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Characteristic corrosion phenomena and materials selection in hard supply water areas in Denmark are reviewed. Both corrosion failures and metal release are described. Even though good protective layers can be formed in the majority of cast iron pipes, the ease of installation and the corrosion resistance of plastic pipes result in the use of medium- and high-density polyethylene and polyvinylchloride (PEM, PEH and PVC) for new pipes. Corrosion is problematic in domestic pipes. Due to localised corrosion, selective attack of the zinc-layer and zinc release, galvanised steel gives too many problems. The copper release from copper pipes is too high after stagnation. The tendency is to preferentially use the more resistant materials such as stainless steel and crosslinked polyethylene (PEX), for domestic pipes. Possible higher microbial growths in plastic pipes are under investigation.</jats:p>",

Stepwise multiple regression was used to identify variables that affect supplier effectiveness when they are involved. The results indicate that supplier contributions to process development/improvement are facilitated when the firm processes are a source of competitive advantage, there is comprehensive involvement by purchasing, and decisions regarding supplier involvement are not overly structured.

Specifically, it aids in supplier process improvement, which in turn enhances firm performance, allows for optimal allocation of resources for supplier development programs, and assists managers in restructuring their supplier network based on performance. In order to address these issues, this article proposes a methodology for effective supplier performance evaluation based on data envelopment analysis (DEA), a multi‐factor productivity analysis technique. The efficiencies derived from the DEA model are utilized in conjunction with managerial performance ratings in identifying supplier clusters, which are categorized into high performers and efficient (HE), high performers and inefficient (HI), low performers and efficient (LE), and low performers and inefficient (LI). Effective benchmarks from the HE cluster are identified for improving the operations of suppliers in the HI, LE, and LI clusters.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There exist various methods for structural design of buried pressure pipes. However, it must be remembered that sophisticated design methods needs a significant supervision of the construction work to be reliable. The need for detailed calculations varies for different materials. Ductile iron (DCI) pipes have high strength properties and for most DCI pipe installations a design check against EN 545 is fully sufficient as regards the structural design. Glass fibre reinforced polyester (GRP) pipes have a limited strainability and are thus highly dependent on the quality of the installation work. It is recommendable to check that the combined strain of the load cases which the pipe shall be designed for does not exceed the allowable strain for the pipe material. Polyethylene (PE) and Polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipes are flexible pipes with a high strainability. The allowable working pressure for these pipes will normally be determined by the PN class and the operating temperature and the need for structural design calculations is limited. It is interesting to note that PE pipes which have the lowest strength properties of all of the above mentioned materials have the lowest failure rate. The latter shows that it is not just the tensile strength, but other factors such as strainability and corrosion resistance which affect the structural performance of buried pipelines.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Membrane filtration processes have become widely used for low turbidity water sources that require particle removal and disinfection. In cases where the feed water contains high turbidity levels or high fouling tendencies, pre-treatment has been required to allow the membranes to operate efficiently. Submersion membranes have allowed direct treatment on many of these water supplies but operate under vacuum. This presents limitations on operating flux and design conditions for incorporating into existing facilities. The treatment unit designs are also very expensive to implement for small water treatment applications. A recently developed pressure driven ultrafiltration (UF) membrane is being tested on several different water sources and has demonstrated exceptional operation on high turbidity feed water sources. The module design includes a single potted end with the membrane fibers looped on the bottom to allow draining of solids from the module. The UF membrane filters outside to inside and has been operated on feed water turbidity levels up to 200 ntu. The availability of a pressure driven hollow fiber membrane that can efficiently filter high suspended solids water sources can provide a cost effective solution for many small to medium sized water supplies. Conditioning the feed water with a coagulant or direct filtration of high turbidity feed water can be used depending on the organic material present without settling or other clarification process. This eliminates the need for additional structural pretreatment and reduces overall system cost and size. Current limitations include the module size that makes this cost prohibitive for very large systems. Larger membrane systems where high-suspended solids are present in the feed water have been utilizing immersion membrane technologies more and more over the past few years. These systems typically operate under a vacuum and can be used for large water treatment plants as their design allows large filtration modules such as Memcor's CMFS filter block at 880 m3/hr. This allows significant capital cost reductions and allows membrane filtration to be competitive to conventional filtration technologies for virtually all filtration applications. This paper will review the economics and performance of both pressure driven and immersion membrane systems for small to large water supply systems on feed water containing high-suspended solid levels. Actual testing data for the new pressure driven hollow fiber UF membrane and immersion membrane systems will be provided on different water supplies including unconditioned surface water, filter backwash water and coagulated surface water.</jats:p>",

In this preliminary study we have followed the dynamics of flocculation of model clay/humic acid suspensions following the addition of three different coagulants: aluminium sulphate and two commercial PAC products. Experiments were conducted using controlled stirring rates in a modified jar test procedure, in which the formation and break-up of flocs could be monitored continuously by a flow-through optical technique. The results show significant differences in the behaviour of the coagulants and one of the PAC samples gives much larger and stronger flocs. Further experiments along these lines should help to elucidate the mode of action of different forms of coagulant and to aid in their selection for specific applications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The interest in ozone for drinking water treatment in the United States has increased dramatically in recent years due to new regulations and concern over Cryptosporidium. Ozone has many benefits, however, its expense is significant and its placement in the treatment train should be chosen with a sound understanding of its effect on other unit processes. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the effect of ozone on the coagulation and filtration processes. This is important given the enhanced coagulation requirements of the disinfection by-product rule and the filtered water quality goals of the Partnership for Safe Water. The effect of ozone on coagulation is shown to be dependent on the coagulant type and on the water quality characteristic that is setting the optimum coagulant dose. For waters with moderate to high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels, the coagulant dose is set by the DOC. Ozonation converts NOM into smaller, more oxygenated compounds, e.g. oxalic acid, that exert a greater metal salt coagulant demand than the parent compounds. In this case, higher dosages of alum or ferric chloride are needed. For low DOC waters, the coagulant dose is set by the particle and the adsorbed organic matter. Ozone may react with adsorbed DOC and alter the amount and conformation of adsorbed organic matter, which can lead to a decrease in the optimum coagulant dose. Finally, because cationic polymers react with particles and large organic matter (and not the smaller compounds formed after ozonation), the optimum polyelectrolyte coagulant dose after ozonation is reduced. Ozonation prior to filtration (intermediate ozonation) is shown to be beneficial for significantly reducing filtered water particle counts by as much as an order of magnitude.</jats:p>",

Current trends in scholarly publishing include the growth of alternative publishing initiatives.

A discrete-bubble model based on fundamental principles has previously been shown to hold considerable promise for predicting the performance of airlift aerators and the Speece Cone. In this paper, we have further verified this model by comparing its predictions to a series of pilot-scale experimental measurements and have also demonstrated its ability, under somewhat idealized conditions, to predict the full-scale performance of a bubble-plume diffuser in a stratified reservoir. The potential for the diffused-bubble aeration system to increase oxygen demand, and the rate at which nitrogen builds up during operation and de-gasses following destratification, are also considered.</jats:p>",

Both polar and non-polar substances, such as phenols, aromatic sulfonates, lignin-sulfonic acids, humic and fulvic substances (acids) and mono- and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons, their alkyl-substituted derivatives, respectively, are among the potential aromatic micropollutants. During the last 5 - 10 years, an analytical approach has been developed on the basis of total fluorescence measurement of the original water sample and its organic solvent (cyclohexane) extract. It has been demonstrated and verified that polar aromatic compounds fluoresce only in the original water sample, whereas non-polar (hydrophobic) compounds fluoresce in an organic solvent (e.g. cyclohexane) extract. During extraction, polar compounds remain in the water sample. This method has been used in a country-wide survey in drinking water aquifers, as well as in several environmental impact assessment studies, particularly for petroleum-related pollution. It is a very convenient method to determine the naturally occurring humic and fulvic substances in water and has proved to be an appropriate substitute of the infrared spectrophotometric method for oil pollution assessment in the environment, also having the advantage of signalling more harmful, toxic aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons.</jats:p>",

In a separate set of filtration experiments with monodisperse latex particles 0.10 μm, 0.43 μm and 1.00 μm in diameter, the transient behavior of permeate flux in CP and CF modes of operation was compared. Significant differences between model calculations and experiments were observed. A slightly more complex structure at the cake-suspension interface was hypothesized to explain these differences. A representation of the cake with a gradually changing solids concentration allowed for better matching of the extended model and experimental results. The CP operation mode yielded a higher specific permeate flux resulting from a thinner cake or a cake with a lower average specific resistance. Experimentally observed differences between performance in CP and CF modes were less sensitive to the size of particles in the suspension than predicted by theory.</jats:p>",

All membranes gave permeate product water of &amp;lt;0.2 NTU and &amp;lt;100ppb coagulant at all times. For both membranes mechanical cleaning, with sponge balls, was at least as effective as acid chemical cleaning, indicating that no significant permanent internal fouling occurred for these membrane materials. Hydraulic resistance data indicated a significant difference in the dynamic layer resistance between the two membranes. Whilst the UF membrane had a hydraulic resistance 3.7 times that of the MF membrane, the dynamic layer formed on the UF membrane during operation displayed a maximum hydraulic resistance almost nine times lower than that of the MF membrane operating under the same conditions. Correlation of cake resistance R versus feed solids concentration C for all the data generated for t&amp;gt;0 demonstrated reasonable agreement with the expression R∝ca where a=0.37 in the current study.

The generation of hydroxyl radical (OH•) in the process is demonstrated through the use of a probe chemical, n-chlorobutane (BuCl). Based on the experimental evidence, it is concluded that the OH•, which is produced through the interaction of H2O2 with the surface sites, reacts with solutes adsorbed on the iron oxide surface, causing oxidation of the organic compounds. The generation rate of OH• increases slightly with increasing pH in the range of 5-9. The oxidation rate of BuCl by OH• is relatively insensitive to the pH and the level of bicarbonate ion in subject water due to low affinity of bicarbonate for the surface. Phosphate, on the other hand, inhibits the oxidation rate by preferential adsorption on the surface. This new process provides a viable alternative to the existing oxidation technologies, especially when water has high alkalinity and/or it is desired to oxidize target compounds that have high affinity for the surface selectively.</jats:p>",

The hollow fibre membrane was made of cellulose acetate (CA) and has a highly porous structure with a very thin dense layer on the internal surface of the membrane. The ultrafiltration flux of the HFCA membrane was compared with that of the conventional CA membrane without such a highly asymmetric structure. The flux for the HFCA membrane was almost twice as high as that for the conventional one. The performance of the conventional CA membrane was also compared with that of membranes with different materials, namely polyethersulfone (PES) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The result showed much higher flux for the CA membrane, indicating that the fouling can be effectively controlled by using the membrane with hydrophilic and negatively charged properties. It was shown that the high flux for the HFCA membrane was due to characteristics of both membrane material and porous membrane structure. The pilot plant testing was carried out to examine the performance in the long term operation, and confirmed the high performance of the HFCA membrane for the application of drinking water treatment.</jats:p>",

In this study, the effect of various designs and operating parameters on the efficiency of the adsorption process is discussed using an adsorption model previously developed and verified by the authors.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The microfiltration and ultrafiltration processes are considered as matured membrane processes that are well established in industrial practice. Nevertheless, the main obstacles of their further development in the new competitive implementations are the economical problems. The key economic factors are permeate flux and energy consumption. However, although the cross-flow systems enable us to attain higher flux, it is usually very expensive. The high energy is consumed to maintain circulation velocity of the retentate that is sufficient for sweeping out the retained component from the membrane surface. Moreover in the case of cells separation the high intensity of the fouling and low cake permeability makes it necessary to apply additional efforts, such as backflushing, backpulsing, promoters of turbulence, vibrations, ultrasounds and many other. Therefore, dead-end systems are still quite competitive with cross-flow, especially for diluted (less than 0.5% of dry mass) suspensions or solutions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Cell separation with membranes is one of the most vivid problems for modern biotechnology, wastewater and water treatment. Membranes offer mild process conditions and high selectivity of separation. This enables us to solve a variety of problems such as cell culturing, fractionation, concentration, purification and sterilisation. The selected cells may be precisely separated from other components of broth and subsequently directed into the reaction space again in good conditions to ensure a quasi-continuous mode of operation. Moreover, membranes enable us to attain high efficiency of the bioconversion by removal of all product and inhibitors directly from the bioreactor. This is the reason for the huge interest in cell separation with membranes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The idea of the paper was to present the new concept of flux enhancement for cell separation on membranes. This concept lies in taking advantage of the specific rheological nature of biopolymers, which are the main foulants. The biopolymers retained on the membrane surface (i.e. on the top layer) can be applied as a lubricant for the cells that can settle on such a ‘movable layer’. As is shown, further in the paper, the thickness of the moving layer is lower and the flux is greater. The common movement of the cells and gel layer is very convenient from the cells integrity point of view. However the hydrodynamic conditions always play an important role in cross-flow systems; the resistance of ultrafiltration membranes may be reduced much more when compared with more open microfiltration membranes.</jats:p>",

In addition, the pilot-scale MF unit was challenged with high concentrations of coliform, Cryptosporidium, and spore, in order to assess the pathogen removal capability of microfiltration. A correlation between the integrity tests and microbial challenge data was also made. The integrity tests investigated in this study were pressure decay and diffusive air flow tests (direct integrity tests), and turbidity and particle counting (indirect integrity tests). Both pressure decay (PDT) and diffusive air flow (DAF) tests were sensitive enough to detect one damaged fiber out of 66,000. The extent of fouling did not affect the sensitivity of the PDT and DAF, showing that PDT and DAF tests are a simple, reliable means to monitor membrane integrity under field conditions. Indirect integrity monitoring using turbidity and particle counting, however, responded poorly to changes in membrane integrity. Microbial challenge study demonstrated that microfiltration was capable of removing various pathogens including Cryptosporidium, at the level required by drinking water regulations, under even adverse operating conditions. Finally, PDT and DAF tests showed a better correlation with actual microbial removal efficiency of microfiltration than turbidity and particle counting. The turbidity and particle counting grossly underestimated the removal of pathogen larger than MF membrane pore size due to poor sensitivity.</jats:p>",

The project was designed to evaluate the MBR performance treating municipal wastewater and the feasibility of using the MBR permeate as a feed source for thin film composite reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. The first part of the project was dedicated to operating both MBRs in a nitrification and denitrification mode. After completion of Part 1 of the project, both MBR systems were retrofitted and operated in a nitrification only mode. Throughout both parts of the study, the effluent from each MBR was fed to two separate, single stage RO pilot systems. Both MBR systems showed high BOD removal with values below the detection limit, and significant TOC reduction. The effluent turbidities from the MBRs were consistently less than 0.1 NTU. Both MBRs also produced a high quality effluent that could be used by thin film composite RO membranes with minimal fouling.</jats:p>",

The results confirm that, at zone level, RDT or 30MS samples taken in a sufficient number of properties give almost identical results. RDT is more practical and acceptable to the consumer whereas 30MS is more reproducible and should be preferred for assessment at an individual consumer's tap. Random selection of properties appears to be a good solution for assessing the actual situation in a zone and help in the definition of priorities and type of actions to implement.

Previous testing by the City (Phase 1) demonstrated the applicability and cost of microfiltration (Memcor and ZeeWeed systems) to enhance the quality of secondary effluent for subsequent treatment by RO and the feasibility of a membrane bioreactor system (ZenoGem) to produce RO feedwater directly from minimally processed sewage. Phase 2 testing, reported on in this paper, is designed to demonstrate reliable operation of MBR/RO treatment for processing screened, degritted sewage and that the effluent from such a train can meet all federal primary and State secondary drinking water regulations and comply with anticipated State requirements for indirect potable reuse. Results show the ZenoGem process to be reliable, require minimal operator attention and maintenance, produce an effluent that can be processed by RO with little fouling and that easily exceeds the City's current effluent discharge requirements relative to BOD, TSS and ammonia. The ZenoGem permeate quality exceeds RO feedwater criteria for turbidity and silt density index and RO system performance confirms minimal membrane fouling by particles. However, the high calcium hardness and phosphate levels in the City's wastewater (and ZenoGem permeate) caused mineral precipitation within the RO system when operated at higher recoveries. Precipitation can be controlled, however, by increased acidification of the RO feedwater.</jats:p>",

By looking at document delivery from both the customer’s and the organisation’s perspective, the real needs of the customer are defined. From a basic distinction between the “search and find” function and the “order and receive” functions, the internal logistics of document delivery are analysed.

In this study, the design of countercurrent air stripping towers was modeled using fuzzy numbers, taking into account uncertainties in mass transfer and Henry's constant. It was found that, in addition to cost, the risk of failure is an important design consideration for stripping tower design. A significant over-design is both cost-effective and results in less risk of design failure. The air-to-water ratio that yielded the least risk of failure switched from low to high as the removal efficiency of the tower increased. An important result is that at lower removal efficiencies, tower design and operation is most sensitive to uncertainties in mass transfer and at higher removal efficiencies, tower design and operation is most sensitive to uncertainties in Henry's constant . The implication is that low air-to-water ratios are best when the regulatory target removal efficiency is low and/or when the uncertainty in the value of the contaminant's Henry's constant is larger than the uncertainty in the mass transfer coefficient value. Otherwise a high air-to-water ratio results in the least risk of process failure.</jats:p>",

The purposes of this research were to investigate the competitive removal of VOCs and to develop the most optimal process by using a pilot plant composed of three GAC columns and three BAC columns. Simulated groundwater systems were used not only to examine the competitive adsorption availability for VOCs on GAC and BAC but also to examine the oxidation efficiency using O3 alone and H2O2/O3. The microbial species isolated from the soil contaminated by VOCs were Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria, identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinobacter calcoaceticus and Bacillus sphacricus. The results revealed that systems pre-treated by H2O2/O3 were more effective at removing VOCs than systems treated by ozone alone and non-pre-treated systems. The mixture of VOCs was removed in the order of PCE, TCE and TCA in GAC and BAC systems. Biological treatment alone was not effective at removing VOCs. However, pre-treatment of these chemicals by H2O2/O3 showed high removals. PCE and TCA were less effective than TCE at being oxidized by chemical oxidation and biodegradation.</jats:p>",

A steady-state materials balance model was developed and applied to the recycle of backwash waste water, clarifier sludge supernatant and sludge dewatering supernatant. Recycling backwash water reduced the plant treatment effectiveness from 3.0 log to 2.95 log removal when the recycle stream was treated (0.5 log removal) and 2.84 log removal when not treated. Recycling clarifier sludge supernatant resulted in a reduction of performance from 3.0 log to 2.78 log removal with adequate treatment (0.5 log removal) and 1.95 log removal with inadequate treatment (10% removal). The model was used to identify vulnerable treatment conditions. Conventional treatment with a poorly operated or upset clarifier was identified as a significant risk with the overall treatment effectiveness decreasing from 3.0 to 2.3 log removal.</jats:p>",

Different cleaning techniques are used to remove this accumulated material. Recently a new technique has been introduced, the AirFlush. This technique makes use of air to create higher turbulence as compared to a water flush. At Delft University of Technology research has started into the fundamentals of the combined air- and water-flush. First a series of experiments has been carried out to determine the different flow patterns, followed by experiments to determine which air- and water-velocities give the best cleaning. Finally head loss experiments have been done to get information about the energy dissipated in the system. The results of the head loss experiments have been compared to the theoretical head loss calculated with the theory of heterogeneous two-phase flow.</jats:p>",

To the extent that this occurs, the presence of sulphate and phosphate in water can increase copper solubility over much longer time periods. The relative effect can depend on the anion concentration and the rate of solids precipitation. Low levels of sulphate tend to hasten the transition from cupric hydroxide to tenorite, whereas higher levels of sulphate can interfere with that transition.

This biofilm-membrane process can perform strict solid-liquid separation and oxidation of ammonia nitrogen simultaneously. In this research, applicability of the conventional biofilm model (assuming the biofilm structure to be flat, homogeneous and continuous) to analysis of the biofilm developing in the proposed process was examined. A long-term operation for culturing the active nitrifying biofilm was carried out prior to kinetic investigation. By cryosectioning of the biofilm and image analysis, the thickness of the biofilm was determined to be 87 μm. From this biofilm thickness and the result of the batch ammonia consumption test, the intrinsic zero-order ammonia consumption rate of the biofilm was estimated precisely to be 930 g/m3/h. Using these parameters, the ammonia concentration profile in the biofilm was calculated by the conventional model, and the applicability of the model was examined by comparing the calculated profile with the ones measured with a microelectrode. The calculated profile was very close to the measured ones, which indicated feasibility of the conventional model to the analysis of the biofilm grown in the proposed process. The studied biofilm actually had a simple, i.e. flat, homogeneous and continuous, structure due to membrane filtration. This was the reason why the conventional model could still be employed. In the analysis of the data dealing with low concentrations of ammonia, however, first-order kinetics should be used. The first-order ammonia consumption rate constant of the studied biofilm was estimated to be 808 h-1.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>DBP control by nanofiltration was studied. Nine DBPs including THMs were selected as target compounds. Reagent DBPs and DBPs formed as a result of chlorination of NOM contained in river water, were applied to nanofiltration to examine DBPs removal. Humic acid was used to investigate DBP precursor control. Nanofiltration was conducted for about one day for each experiment using two 2-inch membrane modules. NF showed high performance for DBP precursor removal but little effect on the removal of DBPs themselves, especially THMs. In the experiment of DBP precursors removal, rejections were 98 to 100 percent for most of the DBPFPs. For NOM in river water, rejections of THMFPs were 96 to 99 percent. This shows nanofiltration is effective even at low concentrations of NOM. Nanofiltration can remove almost all organic substances with the apparent molecular weight of greater than 2,000 daltons. Molecular weight distribution patterns of the permeate were different depending on NF. THMs showed decreasing rejection as filtration proceeded because of adsorption on the membrane surface. THM rejections at 24 hours after filtration started were about 10 and 30 percent in Module-A and B, respectively. Haloacetic acids showed relatively higher rejections. It is recommended, from the viewpoint of THM control, that NOM removal using NF is much preferable to the removals of THM, formed by chlorination, using NF.</jats:p>",

Characteristics of the wastewater for initial washing waste were 488~2,847 mg/L COD, 62~674 mg/L MBAS, and 38~857 mg/L SS. The wastewater was contacted with ozone in a 10L storage tank and circulated through the membrane module for inner pressurized cross-flow filtration. The concentrate was returned back to the contact tank. The membrane used in this experiment was hollow fiber polysulfone UF membrane with MWCO 5,000 and 10,000. It has an effective filtration area of 0.06m2. The experiment was carried out in two phases with either continuous or intermittent ozone injection. For intermittent ozone injection, the mode of injection interval was changed to 5 min./5 min. and 5 min./10 min. for injection/idling. Ozone was dosed at the concentration of 1.5 mg/L. The permeate quality of UF (MWCO 5,000) was 57 mg/L as COD and 5 mg/L as MBAS at continuous ozone injection with removal of 95% in COD and 96.9% in MBAS. Using UF with MWCO 10,000, it was 93.7% and 95.5% of COD and MBAS, respectively. And using intermittent ozone injection, the removal efficiency was 93% in COD and 93.5% in MBAS without any deterioration in COD and MBAS removal. It could reduce the treatment cost. Using ozone injection, fouling of the membrane was also controlled by increasing organic degradation. The flux of UF (MWCO 5,000 and 10,000) was 0.13 and 0.20 m/d for 3 hour filtration (TMP 40≈45 kPa) without ozone injection. It was increased to 0.18 and 0.24m/d by ozone injection. The reclaimed water quality could be estimated well enough to reuse for rinsing purposes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Synthetic materials in contact with drinking water may affect microbial water quality by releasing growth-promoting substances. Various tests are being used for assessing the microbial growth-supporting potential of such materials. The biofilm formation potential (BFP) method is based on determining the concentration of active biomass (as adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) on the surface of a material incubated in slow sand filtrate (surface to volume ratio 0.15/cm) at 25°C during a period of 16 weeks. In addition to attached biomass (biofilm), suspended biomass is also produced. The amount of suspended biomass is a significant fraction (20-70%) of the total biomass production, depending of the type of material. Therefore, it is concluded that the production of suspended biomass should be included in evaluating the growth-promoting properties of materials in contact with drinking water. Consequently, the BFP test has been adapted to the biomass production potential (BPP) test, with BPP including BFP and suspended biomass production (SBP), as pg ATP/cm2. The defining criteria for BPP values for materials require further investigation into the effects of water quality on biofilm formation and the relationship between BPP values and regrowth problems.</jats:p>",

The results obtained in the pilot study can be summarized as follows: (1) A pilot scale BMR worked successfully even with the water from an actual drinking water source. By implementation of pre-treatment (coagulation and sedimentation), the filter run could be continued for more than 8 months without any chemical washing. (2) The sponge cleaning developed in this study was found to be very effective. This indicates that the accumulated cake resistance is dominant in the practical situation. (3) Sufficient nitrification was observed when water temperature was high. (4) In addition to the nitrification, biological oxidation of AOC and manganese can be expected with the BMR. In this study, both AOC and manganese concentration in the permeate decreased to a level less than 10 μg/L.</jats:p>",

Except during special water quality events, such as turnover of the raw water resource, results show that organic matter represents the most important fraction of suspended solids (from 40 to 76%) in treated and distributed water. Examination of the nature of the particles made it possible to develop several hypotheses about the type of particles penetrating Montreal's distribution system during the turnover period (algae skeleton, clays). These particles were found to have been transported throughout the distribution systems quite easily, and this could result in the accumulation of deposits if their surface charge were ever even slightly destabilised, or if the particles were to penetrate the laminar flow areas that are fairly typical of remote locations in distribution systems.</jats:p>",

One of the major observations from full-scale operation was that nanofiltration was a very effective means to reduce BDOC, but conversely, did not reject a significant fraction of AOC. The high BDOC rejection by nanofiltration (NF) membranes at full scale can be explained by size exclusion, since a significant fraction of BDOC consists of compounds, such as humic and fulvic acids, which are larger than the pores of NF membranes (molecular-weight cutoff ≈200 daltons). The insignificant AOC rejection observed in full-scale systems was probably due to the low pH, high hardness, and high ionic strength (TDS) of the raw water. Bench scale tests using simulated waters clearly demonstrated that AOC removal by NF membranes decreases markedly with decreasing pH, and increasing hardness and ionic strength, implying that electrostatic repulsion plays a significant role in AOC removal mechanisms. These solution environments repress the electrostatic interaction between charged organic compounds and membranes, allowing passage of small molecular weight compounds and thus reducing AOC rejection.</jats:p>",

In this system, part of the soluble organic matter was adsorbed by the activated carbon. Ammonia and soluble manganese were oxidized by microorganisms that were concentrated in a submerged tank. In preliminary experiments, it became clear that powdered activated carbon (PAC) addition improved membrane permeability, because PAC has a large volume of macro-pores, which can adsorb larger molecular-weight organic matter. In the pilot-plant experiment, however, it was difficult to slow the rate of membrane permeability loss by PAC addition only. This may be due to biological fouling, caused by operating the system at a high recovery rate in order to maintain a high concentration of microorganisms in the submerged tank. Therefore, backwashing using hypochlorite solution (50-200 mg/l of Cl2) was carried out every few hours. This simple chemical washing was effective in preventing bio-fouling of the membrane.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, in the case of linear cost functions, it is optimal to place orders from two supply sources, i.e., dual sourcing.

A separate internal corrosion monitoring programme was conducted, studying the effects of other water qualities on the internal corrosion rate. Corrosion coupons were exposed to the different water qualities for nine months. The results showed that the best protection of iron was achieved with water supersaturated with calcium carbonate.

They are composed of many parallel sets of intrinsic neurons that receive input from and transfer output to extrinsic neurons that connect the mushroom bodies with the surrounding neuropils. Mushroom bodies are particularly large in social Hymenoptera and are thought to be involved in the control of conspicuous orientation, learning, and memory capabilities of these insects. The present account compares the organization of sensory input to the mushroom body's calyx in different Hymenoptera. Tracer and conventional neuronal staining procedures reveal the following anatomic characteristics: The calyx comprises three subdivisions, the lip, collar, and basal ring. The lip receives antennal lobe afferents, and these olfactory input neurons can terminate in two or more segregated zones within the lip. The collar receives visual afferents that are bilateral with equal representation of both eyes in each calyx. Visual inputs provide two to three layers of processes in the collar subdivision. The basal ring is subdivided into two modality‐specific zones, one receiving visual, the other antennal lobe input. Some overlap of modality exists between calycal subdivisions and within the basal ring, and the degree of segregation of sensory input within the calyx is species‐specific. The data suggest that the many parallel channels of intrinsic neurons may each process different aspects of sensory input information. J. Comp.

Clarification pretreatment and adsorption pretreatment were evaluated at each site for impacts on operational membrane performance and on removal of dissolved organic compounds including total organic carbon (TOC), UV254, color and precursors to disinfection by-products. At the ACWD test site, studies were also conducted with spiking of taste and odor-causing compounds. In both pilot studies, clarification pretreatment was demonstrated to achieve some apparent improvement in operating efficiency. For example, an apparent increase in sustainable flux between 25% and 50% was demonstrated for clarified feedwater operation as compared to raw feedwater operation at the ACWD pilot site. Removal of dissolved organic compounds was achieved primarily through the pretreatment with clarification and/or addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC); however, some reduction of TOC and color was achieved via membrane filtration presumably due to removal of particulate/colloidal constituents.</jats:p>",

In the case of enhanced vortex flow filtration the permeate flux was found to be three times as large as that of the dead-end filtration, and two times larger compared with the vortex flow filtration. In addition, the flux decline was observed to be relatively low. The effect of the amount of glass balls on the permeate flux was also investigated by changing the values of glass ball volume fraction from 0.059 to 0.356. It has been observed that the permeate flux shows a maximum value of the volume fraction of 0.119.

As they better understand quality management in the context of the organization, managers formalize their efforts and share them widely. Credible management communication and top management support are important. Finally, managers link the process thinking created within the organization with process efforts of the business coalition.

The plant consists of ten USF Memcor 90M10C units. This paper details a bacillus spore challenge test conducted on the JRWPP. The objectives were to (1) confirm that the plant could achieve the required 5 log reduction of particles, and (2) evaluate direct and indirect integrity testing methods as means to confirm log-5 particle reduction performance over the life of the plant. The test used Bacillus megaterium spores dosed into the feed water with the plant operated to maximise the challenge on the MF hollow fibre membranes. The results showed (1) the ability of an integral MF plant to reject Bacillus megaterium spores and achieve at least log 5.9 reduction in organisms; (2) Bacillus spores are a good medium for testing as they are robust, easy to handle, cultured in large quantities, and easily identified; (3) the spore challenge test cannot be economically used to monitor full-scale plant performance; (4) particle counting results correlated poorly with bacillus counts in feed or filtrate; and (5) the USF Memcor integrity test methods, which included a pressure hold test and a diffusive airflow test, underestimated spore rejection.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Natural organic matter (NOM) present in raw water can not only impart color to water, but can also cause health risks associated with disinfection by-products (DBP). The most common DBPs found in drinking water are trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), which are formed when NOM reacts with chlorine or chlorine based disinfectants. In order to prevent the formation of DBP's, the US EPA has introduced a two stage Disinfectants-Disinfection Byproduct Rule (D/DBPR). Stage 1, finalized in November of 1998, established the maximum contaminant level (MCL) at 0.080 mg/L for total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) and 0.060 mg/L for five haloacetic acids (HAA5). This will be followed by Stage 2 (Final Rule due in 2002) of the D/DBPR, which may set lower contaminant levels at 0.040 mg/L and 0.030 mg/L for TTHM's and HAA5, respectively. Enhanced coagulation has been identified as the best available technology for meeting the requirements of the D/DBP Stage 1 Rule for Total Organic Carbon (TOC) reduction and the removal of disinfection byproduct precursors. With enhanced coagulation, NOM, color and TOC reduction is achieved using a higher coagulant dosage than would be utilized for turbidity removal. The pH of the raw water is also commonly optimized to maximize process efficiency. The application of immersed ultrafiltration membranes using enhanced coagulation has been successfully applied for disinfection byproduct precursor (DBP), color and TOC removal for drinking water applications. With this process, a single tank coagulation-ultrafiltration process replaces the coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation-filtration stages of a conventional treatment plant. Enhanced coagulation ultrafiltration has three stages: 1) rapid mix, 2) coagulation/adsorption of NOM, and 3) ultrafiltration. A high solids concentration is maintained in the membrane tank to promote the adsorption of organics onto the small settling flocs. Subsequently, the barrier characteristics of the ultrafilter are used to separate flocculated particles, precipitates, and colloidal particles. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) can also be used in combination with enhanced coagulation, or alone to reduce disinfectant byproduct precursors by addition to the rapid mix stage upstream of the ultrafiltration membranes. Compared to conventional treatment, this novel method of water treatment results in higher color and TOC removal and requires less coagulant and PAC. The use of lower chemical dosage results in significantly less treatment residuals and reduced disposal costs. The system also has a small footprint since it is designed with a shorter hydraulic retention time as it is only necessary to form a floc that exceeds the membrane pore size. This paper presents the application of immersed ultrafiltration membranes using enhanced coagulation and PAC processes for color and TOC removal as well as the reduction of DBP precursors. It also presents pilot data on a number of applications where the process is being effectively used and compares it with performance data reported for conventional treatment facilities using enhanced coagulation.</jats:p>",

Cross flushing with UF feed water has been reported to increase the net flux of hollow fiber systems by reducing the frequency of backwashing, the consumption of permeate and the system down time. In this study, the flux restoration achieved in a vertical and horizontal UF system employing an intermittent water and water/air cross flush were compared. The flux restoration in the vertical UF system was not improved by the addition of air to the water flush and a maximum flux restoration of 82% was achieved, irrespective of the presence of air. Similarly, in a horizontal ultrafiltration system, a maximum flux restoration of 82% was also achieved with a water flush (v = 1.63 m/s). However, the addition of air to the water flush decreased the flux restoration to 40% at the highest water/air ratio (33% air). Low flux restoration in the horizontal system was attributed to residual air in the module after cross flushing. Flushing with water alone (v = 1.63 m/s) yielded a wall shear stress of 16 Pa compared with 130 Pa and 279 Pa in the liquid film surrounding the air slugs in the horizontal and vertical UF system, respectively, with a water/air ratio of 2:1. Despite the high shear force on the cake layer accumulated when air was added to the system, the maximum flux restoration was 82% both with and without air. This was attributed to the fact that it was the filtration mechanism and not the shear force on the cake layer that limited flux restoration during cross flushing. To improve the flux restoration that can be achieved by the cross flushing process, the filtration mechanism must be manipulated to minimize blocking filtration and induce cake filtration from the beginning of each filtration cycle.</jats:p>",

For the pilot plants, both ozone/GAC and ozone/UF processes were operated simultaneously for NOM removal comparisons. Both systems were controlled at the same operating conditions with ozone dosing of 4.5, 6.0 and 9.0 mg/L. The results demonstrate that both ozone/UF and ozone/GAC processes can enhance NOM removal after the CSF process. More NOM was removed by the Ozone/GAC process because ozone broke the large molecules into smaller molecules, which increases the GAC adsorption potential. However, the ozone/UF process provides higher removal capacity in turbidity. In both processes, ozone dosing was not proportional to NOM removal of each process and 6.0 mg/L is found to be the optimal dosing. Owing to increasing adsorbability by ozonation, the ozone/GAC process is a very competitive process in NOM removal when associated with the CSF process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At the end of 1997, an innovative membrane-adsorption process was integrated at the Vigneux-sur-Seine water treatment plant in the southeast suburbs of Paris, France. This hybrid process consisted of the application of powdered activated carbon (PAC) upstream of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and recycled to a floc blanket reactor (FBR) after membrane backwashes (FBR-PAC/UF process). This process was designed to mitigate seasonal episodes of micropollutants (pesticides and taste and odors) and to reduce the content of natural organic matter responsible for disinfectant and disinfection by-products. An intensive monitoring campaign of the plant effluent and ten sites in the distribution system was conducted two years before (1996-1997) and two years after (1998-1999) the start up of the PAC/UF process to characterize the impact of this treatment on the water quality of the distributed water. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the positive impact of the PAC/UF process on the organic and biological water quality of the Vigneux-sur-Seine distribution system. Thus, the combination of coagulation and adsorption in the FBR-PAC/UF process resulted in a TOC concentration lower than 0.7 mg/l, BDOC values lower than the detection limit (&amp;lt;0.2 mg/l) and total trihalomethanes concentrations below 10 μg/l. This reduction in organic content results in a reduction of the chlorine consumption by the water produced, which translates in the maintenance of higher chlorine residuals throughout the distribution system while using the same chlorine doses at the plant (0.3 mg/l).</jats:p>",

Direct treatment of surface water frequently results in low net fluxes and high cleaning frequencies. Experiments have been conducted at constant flux on surface water with an ultrafiltration pilot plant with direct filtration, in-line coagulation and pre-coating (EPCE) with ferric hydroxide flocs. The aim was to control and reduce the rate of fouling. With the use of a pre-coat at the beginning of the filtration cycle a stable ultrafiltration process was obtained. This is contrary to the use of in-line coagulation and direct filtration which resulted, due to a very high fouling potential of the feed water, in high fouling rates at low fluxes. The result of this exploratory research is an important step towards a higher feasibility of micro- and ultrafiltration.</jats:p>",

The corrosion increased with increasing total carbonate content and increasing content of natural organic matter. The results imply the action of surface complexation. Heavy metal release in stagnant water was in the vicinity of the detection limit. Nickel leaching was observed on some occasions shortly after installation. The nickel release disappeared after a few weeks. Surface analysis of the internal pipe surface after 9-12 months of exposure revealed no indication of local corrosion.</jats:p>",

Pilot-scale experiments were carried out at Kosuzume Water Purification Plant, which is located at the Sagami River in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As a result, both UV-irradiation and chlorination strongly suppressed the increase of transmembrane pressure and prevented bio-fouling. However, in the case of pre-chlorination, the membrane color changed from white to brown after a long use, causing irreversible membrane fouling due probably to manganese adsorption. Suspended solids removal by membrane filtration decreased the formation potential for CHCl3, but didn't affect the CHCl2Br and CHClBr2 formation potentials. Pre-chlorination, however, increased both CHCl2Br and CHClBr2 formation potentials, thus making up for the reduction in CHCl3 formation potential due to membrane filtration. UV-irradiation pretreatment combined with membrane filtration in the water purification process is regarded as an accessible method and was proved effective in controlling bio-fouling, which gave us a better water quality without increasing trihalomethanes in contrast to pre-chlorination.</jats:p>",

The experiments were carried out in three different feed water conditions: river surface water, coagulated water containing micro flocs and clarified water from the coagulation/sedimentation process. The river water contained a lot of suspended particles (high turbidity) and natural organic matter (NOM) such as humic substances. From analysis of the data obtained in the three membrane processes, the mathematical model expressing the change of the filtration resistance is proposed and proved, which includes the pore size distribution of the membrane. The effect of DOC and DOC/E260 on the membrane fouling was also discussed. The analysis of the pore size distribution change with increasing filtration time suggests that the primary mechanism of the fouling is the decrease in the pore number by the high molecular weight humic substances. As a result of experiments and mathematical model analysis, it could be concluded that the coagulation/sedimentation pretreatment process was very effective for expanding ultrafiltration membrane life, because the coagulation/sedimentation process could remove the primary foulants such as high molecular weight humic substances.</jats:p>",

The department of Water Affairs and Forestry in South Africa monitors all environmental discharges and regulate the levels of toxic chemicals and pollutants. The ‘Tubular Filter Press’ a South African developed sludge dewatering system was proposed for the recovery of dust in this effluent. The filter press was operated for the dewatering of waterworks sludges and promises to be successful for this application. A single tube pilot study shows that chromium discharge to the environment can be eliminated. Feed solids concentrations of between 40 and 50 g/l were fed to the tubular filter resulting in cake solids concentrations in excess of 50%. The operating pressure of the system was between 200 and 300 kPa and the flux reduced to 200 L/m2.h during the filtration cycle. The filtration was modelled using a variable pressure, internal cylindrical compressible cake filtration model and operating parameters for a full scale plant were proposed.</jats:p>",

The minimum PAC dosage required to achieve a desired effluent concentration could quickly be optimized from the C/C0 plot as a function of the PAC dosage. The cross-flow operation was not advantageous over the dead-end regarding the SOC removal. Added PAC was re-circulated as a suspension in the UF loop for only a short time even under the cross-flow velocity of gt; 1.0 m/s. The cross-flow condition did not contribute much to the suspending of PAC. The pulse PAC addition at the beginning of a filtration cycle resulted in somewhat better SOC removal than the continuous PAC addition. The increased NOM loading on PAC which was dosed in a pulse and stayed longer in the UF loop could possibly further decrease the adsorption rate.</jats:p>",

In this paper, experimental results using 5.5m3/day demonstration plants are shown, and treatment performance is discussed mainly focussing on removal of disinfection by-products. Turbidity, color, total iron, total manganese and ammonia nitrogen were removed to below their detection limits. Accumulation of suspended solids including PAC at a maximum concentration of 8000 mg/L in the membrane tank increases biological degradation activity in the TSCM system. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the advanced TSCM system was able to effectively eliminate disinfection by-products and other organic contaminants in raw water. 75% of T-THMFP removal rate was obtained at only 10 mg-PAC/L dosage without the effect of ozone dosage, while the PAC treatment at 50 mg-PAC/L dosage prior to coagulation results in T-THMFP removals ranging from 40 to 60% (The Adoption Guideline of Advanced Water Treatment Facility, 1988). Therefore, it is concluded that the advanced TSCM system saves on the amount of PAC and is more cost-effective than the other conventional water treatment systems due to efficient utilization of the adsorption capacity of PAC.</jats:p>",

The standardization of the plants and the increase of membrane surface area per module allowed a lower manufacturing cost and therefore a higher production volume of the UF membrane modules. The optimized technology is now competitive as compared to conventional processes even for large scale plant capacities of 65,000 m3/day.

Vapors of TCE and water were transported through the pores of the membrane into the shell side maintained at a sub-atmospheric pressure, and condensed in cold traps. The effects of down-stream pressure, solution temperature, feed concentration, and feed flow rate on TCE removal, TCE permeation flux, water permeation flux and TCE concentration of the permeated solution, as well as the mass transfer coefficient were investigated. The down stream pressure and solution temperature were identified as the major factors to control VOC removal and TCE concentration in the permeate stream. A small amount of the permeated solution with higher TCE concentration was obtained at the temperature of 50°C and pressure of 80 mmHg when about 90% TCE was removed from the water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At the Heemskerk water treatment plant of N.V. PWN Water Supply Company North Holland the first full scale integrated membrane system in the Netherlands is realized. The 20 Mm3/year (15 MGD) ultrafiltration (UF)/reverse osmosis (RO) plant servicing IJssel Lake water has been in operation since the second half of 1999. Disinfection is a major objective of the direct surface water treatment plant without chemical disinfection. After UF indicator organisms such as E. coli and Clostridia spores were absent. Integer UF membranes removed MS-2 phage spikes completely (&amp;lt;5.4 log), severely compromised membranes removed 2.7 log only. RO showed a high although incomplete removal of MS-2 phages (up to 4.8 log). Therefore integrity monitoring is a critical issue. Before installation, vacuum testing was applied with a criterion of 10 kPa/min. Many standard modules failed to pass the test. During operation UF is monitored by 1 μm particle counting with 0.05 μm particle counting as a quality control. A 3 log removal can be established. At this moment for RO conductivity measurement is applied enabling a 2 log removal monitoring. Short term monitoring of conductivity will be replaced by sulfate, increasing the monitoring range by 1 log unit. The total monitoring range of 5-6 log units easily satisfies the maximum disinfection requirement for the membrane steps for viruses of 3.6 log. To determine a wider range of disinfection requirements PWN together with Norit Membrane Technology developed the Spiked Integrity Monitoring (SIM®) System. Spiking with 14000 PAC particles/ml combined with 1 μm particle counting increased the potential for log removal monitoring of UF to 5.8 log units. Additionally PAC particle spiking increased the potential to detect UF fiber compromising. During the first 200 days of full scale operation, system performance is excellent. Membrane integrity control is very satisfactory and SIM®-System integrity control has proved to be a valid technique to establish a broader range of required inactivation capacities.</jats:p>",

Ultrafiltration experiments were performed using cellulose derivative hollow-fibre membranes with ferric chloride as coagulant. The efficacy of adding coagulant just before the membrane module depends on the filtration mode, the process configuration and the module design. In dead-end mode, permeation flux of 70 l/hm2 can be maintained, but high backwash frequency (low recovery) is necessary to prevent plugging. Cross-flow filtration was effective in reducing fouling and allows operation at higher permeation flux. In cross-flow filtration, the feed-and-bleed configuration (single stage continuous process) appears promising to reduce backwash frequencies: for a recovery of 95% and at a permeation flux of 120 l/h.m2, quasi-steady transmembrane pressure can be maintained with a low fouling rate (10 kPa in 400 min.). In cross-flow filtration, the use of curved modules with Dean vortices reduces the fouling rate by a factor of 2 compared with a conventional straight module.</jats:p>",

The systems were tested using low- and high-strength domestic wastewaters and the system performance was continuously monitored for a long period to compare filtration characteristics and effluent quality in each system. The MBR system showed much better performance than the DMS system in terms of filtration characteristics and effluent quality. Even though the mixed-liquor suspended solid (MLSS) content in the MBR system was much higher than that in the DMS system, the MBR filtration resistance was much lower than the DMS filtration resistance. The DMS system was not able to remove dissolved organic matter, which seemed to be a major component of membrane fouling. The MBR effluent quality such as COD, BOD, TOC and T-N was more stable and better than the DMS. In the MBR process, the organic removal efficiency remained more than 95% regardless of fluctuation in influent qualities. The effluent quality of both systems was satisfying the legal standards for water reuse in Korea. Rejection of pathogenic microorganisms by membrane filtration was also investigated.</jats:p>",

To reduce the water loss and waste discharge in the conventional drinking water treatment process, the Macao Water Supply Co. Ltd (SAAM) plans to recover the backwash water by Microfiltration (MF) membrane process as water resources are scarce and new environmental regulations are mandated in Macao. Generally, the filter backwash water from the conventional water treatment plant with sedimentation process is recycled to the source water to be treated again under certain conditions, and the sedimentation tank discharges most of the sludge. However, it is possible to recycle the backwash water directly to the inlet for direct filtration process due to the limitation of inlet turbidity. This paper describes how to apply MF technology to treat the backwash water of the direct filtration plant and to optimize MF operation. Without pre-treatment of the settling basin for backwash water, the operation of the MF pilot plant is proved to be stable and the permeate quality can meet EU drinking water standards. The pilot study shows that it is both economically and technically feasible to adopt MF technology in backwash water treatment. The main parameters to test MF process include flux, chemical cleaning duration and transmembrane pressure (TMP). They are 150-200 L/m2.h, 20 days and &amp;lt;1 bar respectively. The estimated cost including O&amp;M and investment for a 1320-1760 m3/d backwash water treatment plant is USD 0.126-0.168/m3.</jats:p>",

The concentrations of thyrotropic hormone (TTH) in whole blood specimens dried on paper were measured in 29588 newborns in the Belgorod region (Russia) in 1995-1998 using the Neonatal hTSH FEIA (Labsystems OY, Finland). Slight iodine deficiency in this region (median iodine excretion with urine 69 mcg/liter, n = 1313) was associated with an extremely high incidence of NHT: more than 5 iU/liter in 47% and more than 20 iU/liter in 7% newborns. Overall prevention with iodinated table salt during 1 year notably decreased the incidence of NHT (by 1.6 times, p &lt; 0.001) and alleviated its severity from severe to mild degree. Preventive treatment of pregnant women by potassium iodide (200 mcg/day) during the same period more effectively decreased the incidence of the pathological parameter (five fold, p &lt; 0.001). A lower incidence of NHT resultant from prenatal iodine treatment was associated with a lowering of the mean TTH level solely at the expense of the newborns with high levels of the hormone; if TTH levels were normal, they did not change. Therefore, thyroid dysfunction in newborns (NHT) indicates iodine deficiency in a region during intrauterine development; this abnormality can be prevented by iodine treatment in microdoses meeting the physiological requirement in iodine, which is increased during gestation. At the beginning of overall prevention of goiter by iodinated table salt, group prevention with potassium iodide is justified in risk groups, primarily in pregnant women; compensation of prenatal deficiency decreases the cost of screening for congenital hypothyrosis due to a lower requirement in TTH retesting.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the Second Vatican Council (1965), Catholic marital annulments have risen dramatically, especially in the United States. A comparison of American and international rates demonstrates that, consistent with supply‐side theories of religion, annulment rates have risen only in countries where the Church competes with other religious institutions. However, supply‐side theory cannot explain why the American rate is double that of other countries with competitive religious economies. Historical analysis suggests that the growing number, estrangement, organization, and mobilization of divorced American Catholics motivated the American Church to engage in more intense marketing of annulments. I therefore argue that another variable that incorporates these “qualities of the target market” should be considered in future analyses of religious marketing.</jats:p>",

The Hollow Fiber Membrane (HFM) contactor has very high elimination (99.9%) under optimum operation conditions. 5.1 Nm3/(m2.h) gas treatment ability can be achieved, as outlet and inlet ammonia concentration are 0.02 g/Nm3 and 20.0 g/Nm3 respectively and gas stay-time in the contactor is only 0.04 s when acid supply around the membrane is sufficient. The results of industrial tests indicated that this technology could be used to eliminate mixed gas containing ammonia and replace conventional soft-water washing and absorption techniques.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Social Darwinism calls for “inequality, survival of the fittest” and not “liberty, survival of the unfittest. ” However, this theory fails to acknowledge that fitness can be a social construction. Social triage argues that bureaucratic decision makers find it inefficient to work with certain groups, and these decision makers sacrifice these groups’ needs in order that others (more beneficial to the organization) receive services. Social triage appears linked to social Darwinism. To favor society’s “most fit” members, it seems necessary to establish “unfit” members. Sacrificing the needs of certain populations seems possible only if fitness can be a social construction. Using a case study of efforts to reform private psychiatric hospitals, we argue that certain hospitals created a supply of “unfit” patients capable of paying the cost of private care, leading to social triage. Although it appeared that social Darwinism was outdated, the connection between these theories may suggest a resurgence in its use. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent research indicated that hydrophobic microporous hollow fiber membrane Contactor could be used to separate volatile contaminants from wastewater efficiently. The factors that influence the effect of separation of NH3/H2O are investigated carefully. It is found that the average diameter of micropores, porosity and gas penetration rate of polypropylene (PP) hollow fiber membrane are maximized synchronously at draw elongation 260%. The modules assembled with this PP hollow fiber membrane have good performance for separation of NH3/H2O. It is found that the overall mass transfer coefficient (K) only is dependent on the temperature and flux of ammonia solution and independent of the pressure and concentration of ammonia solution. Concentration of absorbing acid influences slightly the overall transfer coefficients K while the absorbent supply is sufficient. Under this condition, the relationship between transfer coefficient and raw ammonia water flow rate can be described using the Sieder and Tate equation. K is directly proportional to v1/3 (v stands for the flow rate of ammonia solution). The removal rate of NH3 was about 96-98% in the lab. Further industrial tests have been carried out individually in catalyst and chemical fertilizer factories to treat wastewater containing ammonium, whose concentration ranged from 1000-10,000g/m3. Wastewater treatment amount was 9.6 m3/day and 24 m3/day in catalyst and chemical fertilizer factories respectively. Average removal rate of NH3 was 93.5% during 5 months of continuous operation in the catalyst factory. The fouling is not heavy because the wastewater containing ammonia did not pass through the membrane wall. It is efficient to get rid of membrane fouling by washing the membrane with dilute acid and the cleanout period was 3 days. PP hollow fiber membrane can be produced by the melt-spinning and drawing method. This paper also investigates the relationship between processing condition of PP hollow fiber membrane and its structure and performance.</jats:p>",

Only transcription of the\n            <jats:italic>pepP</jats:italic>\n            gene is modulated by the source of sugar.

These results suggest that the fungus concentrates this transporter in haustoria to take advantage of a specialized compartment of the haustorial complex. The extrahaustorial matrix, delimited by the plasma membranes of both host and parasite, constitutes a newly formed apoplastic compartment with qualities distinct from those of the bulk apoplast. This organization might facilitate the competition of the parasite with natural sink organs of the host.</jats:p>",

Because of the scarcity of arable land, these watersheds cannot be managed only for drinking water. Efforts are under way to reduce sediment delivery, improve the quality of water entering Miyun reservoir, and improve the welfare of watershed inhabitants. An economic appraisal of a watershed management project for the 3,298‐ha Shixia watershed above the Miyun reservoir, indicates a 24 percent economic rate of return on the investment made in the project. The net present value (NPV) of the project, calculated at a discount rate of 10 percent, is approximately US$3.49 million. Sensitivity analyses indicate that a doubling of labor costs lowers the NPV to US$2.07 million and a 10 percent decrease in benefits lowered the NPV to US$2.87. It is concluded that the implementation of conservation practices on the Shixia Demonstration Watershed represent an economically efficient use of resources.</jats:p>",
