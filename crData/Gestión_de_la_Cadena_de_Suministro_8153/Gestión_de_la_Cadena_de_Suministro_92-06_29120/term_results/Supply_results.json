The optimal solutions obtained by different investigators for a simple two‐loop network, originally taken by Alperovits and Shamir as an illustrative example, are compared and it is shown that they are not even the local optimum solutions. The latest modification, introduced by Kessler and Shamir (1989), which incorporates the projected gradient of the objective function, is also briefly reviewed and is shown to lead to a truly local optimum solution as claimed by Kessler and Shamir. It is shown that it is preferable initially to suppress the minimum link flow constraint, necessary for reliability purposes, and introduce it later after obtaining the optimal solution for a branching configuration. The philosophy of the LPG method is analyzed. It is shown that the LPG method is inefficient, at least for optimization of the illustrative two‐loop network, as compared to a heuristic method that initially identifies logically good branching configurations for obtaining the optimal solution.</jats:p>",

In most cases bicarbonate is delivered either as prepacked powder or as a stable liquid concentrate in 6-10 I plastic containers. With a newly designed central supply system (CSS) using 800 I tanks of custom-made sterile and pyrogen free concentrates, we investigated the risk of bacterial contamination of dialysate in a 30-bed dialysis unit. During three months, samples of reverse osmosis (RO) water, concentrates and dialysate were taken every two weeks. Colony forming units (CFU) were counted after 48 h incubation. Further samples were taken during nine months of continuous use of the CSS without further intermittent disinfection. None of the samples had &gt; 10/ml CFU. Pseudomonas, corynebacteriae and enterobacter were the predominant species. In summary, this CSS proved reliable in providing bacteriologically safe bicarbonate dialysate as defined by international standards (CFU &lt; 200/ml). It significantly reduces costs, workload and environmental pollution by plastic waste. </jats:p>",

However, the skills and competencies needed today provide a starting point from which to project those that will be needed in the twenty‐first century. This study reports on the skills and competencies that were identified by purchasing and materials management executives in 23 major industrial corporations. Their perspective should be beneficial in identifying specific areas to emphasize in university purchasing and materials management curricula and in company training programs. The results of this study are not revolutionary, but evolutionary, in nature and hold several implications for purchasing and materials management educators.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to examine how this decrease in fees in real terms has influenced dentists' work decisions with respect to supply of services. Data on characteristics of the dentist and the dental practice were collected for 1979, 1984, and 1986. The dependent variable was supply of dental services, measured as the number of patient care hours worked per annum. The hourly fee for dental care was equivalent to dentists' hourly wage rate. Supply increased as fees decreased. This could be explained either as a response of the patient or the dentist to reduced fees. Although the data did not give conclusive evidence as to which effect was most important, the authors have put forward the view that the main effect was dentists' response to reduced fees. The main argument put in favor of this view is that dentists have an overall knowledge of the effect of a change in fees on their income. The impact of a change in fees is much greater on the provider who supplies the services to many individuals over a long period of time, than on an individual consumer who buys the services once or twice a year. It was concluded that, in the short run, a fixed‐fee schedule may not be very effective in limiting costs for dental care.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> BACKGROUND. Two types of data may be used to estimate trends in food and nutrient intake by the US population: per capita food supply estimates and survey estimates of individual intake. Because these data vary markedly in measurement goals and methods, we examined whether trends in food supply and survey intake estimates for fat, carbohydrate, and protein are reflective of one another. METHODS. The data selected for comparison included all available survey estimates of mean intake by the US population (i.e., periodic estimates from 1965 to 1988) and all available per capita food supply estimates from a comparable time period (i.e., annual estimates from 1965 to 1985). RESULTS. The two types of data generally did not reflect the same trends. Furthermore, expressing macronutrient levels as percentage of calories rather than in grams affected the trend relationships. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings indicate that caution is needed in the selection and application of available data to estimate trends in macronutrient intake by the US population and in the interpretation of these data with regard to public health research, policies, and programs. </jats:p>",

The posterior ciliary arteries were classified into three types: lateral posterior ciliary, medial posterior ciliary, and accessory posterior ciliary arteries. Both the lateral and medial posterior ciliary arteries reach the eyeball in three ways: (1) they run antero‐inferiorly in a winding course to the posterior margin of the eyeball, then shift upward vertically at a 60–90 degree angle and reach the eyeball, where they divide into several ciliary branches (69%); (2) after a similar course, others branch to the eyeball from the superior side (29.3%); or (3) they reach the eyeball in an almost straight course along the optic nerve (1.7%). The fundamental characteristics of these three types of posterior ciliary artery pattern also exist in subhuman primates. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

Renv., and <jats:italic>T. brachystachyum</jats:italic> (Nees) Renv. The genus has a basic chromosome number of 6, and from diploid to hexaploid specimens have been examined. Precocious segregation of metaphase I bivalents were observed in four species. Multivalent formation results in unequal chromosome segregation during anaphase I, and several cells with an 11–13 chromosome distribution have been observed. The presence of univalents and anaphase I bridges in all <jats:italic>T. brachystachyum</jats:italic> specimens suggests a hybrid origin for the species. B‐chromosomes were present in specimens from four species. The B‐chromosomes are similar to the euchromosomes with the exception that they do not participate in meiosis. The B‐chromosomes have a possible isochromosome origin. The cytogenetic evidence presented supports the combination of <jats:italic>Plagiochloa</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Lasiochloa</jats:italic> into <jats:italic>Tribolium</jats:italic> and indicates that the genus is closely related to <jats:italic>Urochlaena</jats:italic>, whereas it is not closely related to <jats:italic>Prionanthium</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

When the growth temperature was less than 300°C, GaAs deposited both on a GaAs substrate and on the SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> mask and the growth rate was about 0.7 monolayers/cycle. Raman spectra of the grown layers indicated that GaAs grown at above 300°C was a single crystal but that GaAs deposited below 300°C was polycrystalline. \n </jats:p>",
