      "abstract": "<jats:p> Successful exploitation of a fishery depends not only on the quantity of fish caught and processed, but also on the steadiness of supply. Too much variability in catch means that supplies will sometimes be inadequate, while at other times there will be too many fish to process, and the market will become glutted. Fisheries managers must therefore be prepared to make a trade-off between maximization of mean yield and minimization of the variance of this yield if the fishery is to function optimally. To do this they must understand the economic trade-offs that enter into the catching, processing, and marketing aspects of the fishery. This paper presents a strategy for coupling biological and economic models and illustrates how these questions can be quantified and integrated to arrive at a bioeconomically optimal management strategy.Key words: optimality, variability, fisheries management, sustainable yield </jats:p>",

A pH‐stat system, together with NO<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/tex2gif-stack-3.gif\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00063592:media:BIT260240308:tex2gif-stack-3\" /> in the medium, was used to regulate the pH in the range 7.92–10.67. Maximum productivity, which occurred at pH 6.6, was dependent on N source only to the extent that culture alkalinity was a function of nitrogen uptake. The results demonstrate that the choice of N is a critical factor in controlling the pH of large‐scale algal cultures. NH<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/tex2gif-stack-4.gif\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00063592:media:BIT260240308:tex2gif-stack-4\" /> is a poor source of N because it leads to destruction of culture alkalinity and concomitant growth‐inhibiting reductions in pH, whereas NO<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/tex2gif-stack-5.gif\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00063592:media:BIT260240308:tex2gif-stack-5\" /> has an opposite effect, although pH is not so severely affected in this case. Urea is, by far, the most suitable N source for maximizing algal yield when it is supplied in combination with the proper amounts of HCO<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/tex2gif-stack-6.gif\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00063592:media:BIT260240308:tex2gif-stack-6\" /> alkalinity in the growth medium and percent CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in the bubbled gas that will lead to an equilibrium pH near the optimum pH.</jats:p>",

The intensification of symptoms is attributed to accumulation of P to toxic levels in leaves.</jats:p><jats:p>It is suggested that Zn deficiency interferes with P metabolism enhancing the amounts of P absorbed by roots and transported to tops: under conditions of high P supply, P accumulates to toxic levels in leaves inducing or accentuating symptoms resembling Zn deficiency. This effect of Zn on P metabolism in roots seems to explain previously puzzling observations in which P treatments enhanced symptoms of Zn deficiency without any reduction in Zn contents of plant tops: there is no need to invoke any effect of P in inactivating Zn in leaves.</jats:p>",
