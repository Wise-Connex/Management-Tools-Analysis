      "abstract": "<p>Interdiction of addictive substances is a challenge in all settings. Prisons are no exception. Given the high prevalence of addictive disorders among prisoner populations the demand for illicit substances is very high. This chapter reviews the ways in which correctional staff have approached this concern, including a substantial focus on preventing illicit substances from entering the facility in the first place. This effort requires a broad array of interventions, including monitoring phone calls and mail; structuring and overseeing the visitation process; using trained canines; and employing intrusive searches any time a prisoner leaves the facility and returns. These efforts interface with an ongoing process to monitor prison activities for drugs that get past screening efforts. Random drug testing, canine tours of the facility, and an intricate system of informants, are each an element of effective monitoring activities. This chapter reviews the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such interventions, and considers the consequences of failure. Given that such consequences may include staff corruption and the development or growth of a prison drug economy, effective interdiction is a priority in every well-run facility.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain research and practice has moved beyond green or environmental issues to include social issues. But much of the focus still remains on attempts of large companies to reduce social harm along their supply chains rather than creating social good. At the same time, research investigating the role of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NGO</jats:styled-content>s in supply chains or humanitarian logistics often emphasizes temporary initiatives and overlooks long‐term viability. This conceptual paper seeks to expand the playing field by looking at how social enterprises manage their supply chains to generate social benefit while maintaining or improving their financial viability in the long term. Our contribution is to consider those socially motivated organizations that lie on the continuum between purely social and purely commercial enterprises. We consider how these organizations manage their supply chains for social impact and define this area as social impact supply chain management (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SISCM</jats:styled-content>). In this work, we view these organizations and managerial issues through the lens of institutional complexity, that is, the presence of multiple and possibly conflicting institutional logics in the focal organization. We propose that, for these organizations, supply chain strategy, stakeholder identification and engagement, and relationship management might differentiate <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SISCM</jats:styled-content> from traditional supply chain management. And as a result, we offer future research directions that might add clarity to effective <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SISCM</jats:styled-content>.</jats:p>",

So this turns out that $108,879,500,000 worth of crude oil was produced in Texas in 2014.\nThe cost of transportation decides a fraction of final price of a barrel of oil. It  accounts for almost 10%-15% of the final price per barrel of oil. If we are able to reduce the costs in the transportation of oil, we will be able to save a significant amount of money that can be utilized somewhere else to make the Texas economy even stronger.</jats:p>"

For renewal planning, there are a number of methods, techniques and software tools for decision-support, but in many cases most of them focus only on water mains. However, water supply systems consist of more various parts and structures than simply water pipes. Therefore, it is not appropriate to invest in renewal planning for a single part of the water supply infrastructure only. An effective and detailed evaluation of the technical condition requires the deployment of specialists and a reliable database, as well as considerable amounts of time, instrumentation and software. Therefore, it is preferable to first perform a rapid and efficient preliminary identification of problematic areas and elements of the entire water supply system. This paper presents the methodology and Technical and Energy Audit (TEA Water), as well as an effective preliminary assessment of the technical condition of water supply systems (WSSs). The paper presents the structure of proposed technical indicators, the method of their determination and evaluation, as well as including a presentation of case studies.</jats:p>",

The complex nature of pharmaceutical supply chain has made it difficult to control the proliferation of counterfeit drugs being consumed along with the regular drugs.   The pharmaceutical industry needs to come up with answers to protect public health, minimize supplier risk, protect brand reputation and promote the integrity of the supply chain. In its report on “Combating Counterfeit Drugs” the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that RFID tagging appeared to be “the most promising approach to reliable product tracking and tracing.” (FDA, 2004).[3] In this paper, we will explore how counterfeit pharmaceuticals are finding their way into the supply chain, the consequences experienced on a patient level as a result of counterfeit medicine consumption and more importantly how RFID is of help in fighting this global crime efficiently. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) has brought a revolutionary change in many industries, especially in supply chain management. Implementing RFID in pharmaceutical industry is a game changer for the pharmaceutical industry because of the ability it provides to efficiently and effectively track medicines from origin to customer, resulting in an overall reduction of the entrance of medicinal counterfeit items in to the supply chain. Not only will RFID technology use benefit the health industry, but also those at the warehouse level, by eliminating the manual work required when using barcodes.</jats:p>"

Notwithstanding the existing literature on the analysis of airports and surrounds, and normative models of airport-led development, extensions are required on the empirical analysis of spatial economic attributes of airports and surrounds.Objectives: Objectives of the article were twofold: firstly, to establish the economic activity mix and reasons for the location of firms on and around O.R. Tambo and Cape Town international airports; and secondly, to analyse linkages between firms on and around the two airports as well as linkages those firms have with their metropolitan, regional, national and international contexts.Method: The article focused on the South African case studies of O.R. Tambo and Cape Town international airports and used a telephone survey as the primary data collection method.Results: The article discovered that the developments around O.R. Tambo and Cape Town international airports are spatial clusters that are also linked with other airports in South Africa and beyond.Conclusion: The article extended existing knowledge by providing insights on the spatial economic characteristics of airports and surrounds. The findings can be improved upon with work on other case studies, and potentially be used as bases for extending a theoretical framework that describes and explains the spatial economic forces that drive development on and around airports.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today’s supply chains (SCs) are more than ever prone to disruptions caused by natural and man-made events with water scarcity identified as one of the highest impact events among these. Leading businesses, understanding that natural resource scarcity (NRS) has become a critical supply chain risk factor, extensively incorporate sustainable water management programmes into their corporate social responsibility and environmental management agenda. The question of how industries can efficiently evaluate the progress of these water scarcity mitigation practices, however, remains open. In order to address this question, the present study proposes a conceptual maturity model. The model is rooted in strategies for water scarcity mitigation using a framework developed by Yatskovskaya and Srai and develops an extensive literature review of recent publications on maturity frameworks in the fields of sustainability and operations management. In order to test the proposed proposed, model an exploratory case study with a leading pharmaceutical company was conducted. The proposed maturity model presents an evaluation tool that allows systematic assessment and visualisation of organisational routines and practices relevant to sustainable manufacturing in the context of water scarcity. This model was designed to help illustrate mitigation capabilities evolution over time, where future state desired capabilities were considered through alternative supply network (SN) configurations, network structure, process flow, product architecture, and supply partnerships.</jats:p>"

These companies encounter institutional environments with regulative, normative and cognitive characteristics very different from those in their home countries. SC localization uncovers and creates institutional voids; we argue that SC localization is a process of institutional change, requiring the MNE to build new institutional infrastructure. To the best of our knowledge, little is known about the institutional process of SC localization and its effects. We carry out a longitudinal case study to investigate SC localization of four MNEs in China. These MNEs are leaders of sustainable business practices in their industries, a distinction that highlights institutional voids in their SC settings. Based on the idea of fields in institutional theory, we build a mid‐range theory by introducing the notion of the <jats:italic>supply chain field.</jats:italic> Our study identifies and contextualizes the key elements of an SC field. It recognizes MNEs, government and semi‐government entities, and other participants as institutional actors who serve as architects and builders of the new SCs. We find that SC localization is an institutional process, taking place at both actor and field levels, where continuous ideation of new operations practices leads to structuring of the both the SC and SC field.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This research was conducted only focusing on the refrigerator division. The refrigerator division has problems in the upstream supply chain. Therefore, companies need a measurement of the performance of Supply Chain Management (SCM). The purpose of this study is to measure the performance of SCM to find out indicators that are still far below the target and provide recommendations for improvement. SCM performance measurement is done by SCOR method for process decomposition, AHP for KPI hierarchy weighting, and OMAX for scoring system. The results of the research that have been analyzed with the Traffic Light System indicate that there are 9 KPIs from 22 valid KPIs that have never been in the green category. The total index results of the overall supply chain performance show that the lowest performance is in December 2017 with a total index of 3.5934 and the highest is in March 2018 with a total index of 7.002. There are 10 KPIs in the red and yellow categories in December which should be given more attention. Improvement recommendations are given to indicators that have never been in the green category. For example recommendations, DRS 2.3 KPI (supplier response speed in response to late arrival of raw materials at the factory) in improving its performance needs to do tracking of raw material shipments and additional shipping fleets or suppliers from suppliers.</jats:p>"

The application of EC in manufacturing, retailing and service operations is examined, and a framework for describing EC components and their role in diﬀerent areas of an organization is proposed. The first part of the paper discusses challenges and new trends in supply chain business intelligence and provides background research of big data initiatives related to EC. The rest of this paper is from a discussion of the e-commerce impact on supply chain management and the advantages of supply chain management of e-commerce platform. The trend of e-commerce platform is proposed based on the development supply chain management. What will be the effect of the Internet on supply chain? What is the relationship between e-commerce and supply chain management?</jats:p>"

Designing supply networks is a strategic process that considerably affects the structure of the whole network. In contrast, supply networks for new products are configured without major adaptations of the existing structure, but the network has to be configured before the new product is actually launched in the marketplace. Due to dynamics and uncertainties, the resulting planning problem is highly complex. However, formal models and solution approaches that support supply network configuration decisions for new products are scant. The paper at hand aims at stimulating related model-based research. To formulate mathematical models and solution procedures, a benchmarking problem is introduced which is derived from a case study of a cosmetics manufacturer. Tasks, objectives, and constraints of the problem are described in great detail and numerical values and ranges of all problem parameters are given. In addition, several directions for future research are suggested.</jats:p>",

The Gulf of Naples is here employed as a study area to assess the effects ofinclusion of different conservation features and costs in reserve design process. In particular eight scenariosare developed using graph theory to identify propagule source patches and fishing and exploitationactivities as costs-in-use for local population. Scenarios elaborated by MARXAN, softwarecommonly used for marine conservation planning, are compared using multivariate analyses (MDS,PERMANOVA and PERMDISP) in order to assess input data having greatest effects on protected areasselection.MARXAN is heuristic software able to give a number of different correct results, all of them near to thebest solution. Its outputs show that the most important areas to be protected, in order to ensure longtermhabitat life and adequate propagule supply, are mainly located around the Gulf islands. In additionthrough statistical analyses it allowed us to prove that different choices on conservation featureslead to statistically different scenarios. The presence of propagule supply patches forces MARXAN toselect almost the same areas to protect decreasingly different MARXAN results and, thus, choices forreserves area selection.The multivariate analyses applied here to marine spatial planning proved to be very helpful allowing toidentify i) how different scenario input data affect MARXAN and ii) what features have to be taken intoaccount in study areas characterized by peculiar biological and economic interests.</p>"

The method can be used to estimate the energy consumption in the production, use and disposal phases of plumbing fixtures. This allows for the comparison between the performances of different plumbing fixtures and the identification of the share of each phase on the energy consumption over the life cycle. The method was applied in a case study in Southern Brazil to quantify the energy consumption in the life cycle of two types of taps installed on a university campus. The total energy consumption in the life cycle of ordinary and self-closing taps used in the study was respectively, 177.71 MJ and 164.11 MJ over 4 years. Production accounted for 33% of the energy consumption share of the ordinary tap, while the use phase accounted for 65% and the disposal phase for 2%. For the self-closing tap, the production phase accounted for 46% of the energy consumption share, the use phase for 52% and the disposal phase for 2%. Therefore, considering the energy consumption in the life cycle, self-closing taps should be preferred over ordinary taps.</jats:p>",

The findings of this research indicate that the sales and operation planning (S&amp;OP) processes and the key operations in the supply chain network need to be fully integrated. The findings also indicate that information system resources are the key enabler of S&amp;OP and supply chain integration. To be specific, this research is an exercise in theorizing a conceptual framework for optimally confronting the emerging challenges and opportunities regarding an extended supply chain and is intended to bring the proficiency of multi-criteria decisions and actions in the entire supply chain network.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing demand for miniaturized radio-controlled vehicles inspired the following research. The uses of these unmanned miniaturized/micro vehicles range from aero-modeling to drones for urban control and military applications too. The common characteristic of these vehicles is the need for a light and compact propulsion system. The radio-controlled (RC) turbines for modeling are ideally suited for this purpose, guaranteeing the necessary thrust with compactness and lightness. This device is a miniaturized turbojet, and it is generally composed of three basic elements: compressor, combustion chamber and turbine. The main goal of the paper is to evaluate the turbojet performance for considering the possibility of its use as a range extender in a hybrid vehicle. Considering the total volume constraints, it will be important to evaluate the specific fuel consumption. Also from the environmental point of view, the possibility of feeding the device with gas has been considered and, consequently, the needed device modifications performed. The test bench has been realized and assembled at the University Department Laboratory. Several different experimental configurations are reproduced and reported here, to obtain performance maps. The experiments results have been compared to previous tests results, as well as numerical simulations. Therefore, it has been possible to make a comparison between the two different fuels. The results show that this device can be used as a range extender for a hybrid vehicle. Moreover, the various tests have shown that, acting on the control unit, it is possible to feed the device with gas (mixture of propane and butane), obtaining a further benefit from the economic point of view. Surely, an in-depth study of the turbine management logic would produce a further advantage in terms of fuel consumption.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the potential of fluidic-oscillation-generated microbubbles (MBs) to defoul the filtration membrane. Cartridge filters for microfiltration (MF) of 1 μm pore size were fouled using surface seawater collected from the Hull coastal area. The seawater was circulated at 5.8 L/min to actuate colloidal substance deposition on the membrane surface. The recorded feed channel pressure drop (ΔP) across the membrane filters showed rapid fouling occurred in the first 8 hrs of the circulation. Fluctuations of ΔP during the next 8 hrs were observed showing the colloids filling the pores of the membrane, and remaining steady for 2 hrs showing the membrane was completely fouled. The filtration membrane was cleaned and defouled using fluidic-oscillator-generated MBs. The fouled membranes were sparged with 1 L/min of air scouring for ∼1 to ∼2 hrs to remove the deposited colloids and impurities on the surface of the membrane. The membrane, analysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), UV254 and Electrical Conductivity (EC) meter, showed the extent of MBs-mediated removal of the deposited colloidal particle from the membrane surfaces. This study found that the highest defouling rate occurs with MBs generated by fluidic oscillator (closed vent), followed by MBs generated by fluidic oscillator (opened vent) and MBs generated without fluidic oscillator at 9.53, 6.22, and 3.41 mbar/min, respectively.</jats:p>",

Corporate globalization of storefronts and extensive manufacturing supply chains have contributed to human trafficking becoming the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the world. California’s legislative and social experiments are often models other governments look to for guidance. California is the first government to require businesses to disclose their anti-trafficking supply chain policies to their consumers. Under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (CATSCA), large retailer sellers must conspicuously disclose on their web site their policies, if any, to detect and fight slave labor within their supply chain. This article explores the requirements of the CATSCA and will examine the legal effectiveness of the California transparency framework.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;em&gt;Contrary to the considerable development of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) research, the level of conceptual clarity falls short in unveiling the strategic implications of sustainability integration into core business practices. This leads to dilemmas with respect to aspired and achieved levels of business responsibility increasing exposure to financial and sustainability hazards. Given the various incidents of supplier misconduct and cases where no apparent breaches still impose threats to buying firms, it is undeniably mesmeric experiencing the defiance of “common sense” law: just because risks are classified, and responses are deployed, it would be wrong to assume that vulnerability is eradicated. To overcome impediments, we need to discern between uncertainty and risk. To this end, literature supports that firms address issues based on instrumental and moral rationales encompassing fundamentally different justifications. Building on work from risk management, SSCM, paradox as well as management accounting and control, and inserting ideas from entrepreneurship literature, we investigate these particularities and explain how firms could develop their sustainability initiatives and risk management strategies across their Supply Chains (SCs) through an integrative framework. This refinement allows us to increase the odds of more sustainable SCs through a multilevel approach reverberating the interface of strategy and operations. The paper concludes with commenting on the theoretical and managerial implications as well as proposing avenues for future research.&lt;/em&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the problem of the assessment of the supply chains in the context of their effectiveness. In this paper the concepts of a supply chain and effectiveness were characterized. The supply chain is a structure of entities which are connected with each other by the use of material and financial flows and functional, structural, technological, economic and information dependencies. Entities such as: suppliers, final recipients, entrepreneurs, warehouse facilities, supply centers, logistics operators, carriers, etc. perform material flows from suppliers to recipients. The concept of efficiency, in general terms, refers to economic rationality and means the relationship between the achieved or expected effects and the expenditures incurred. Additionally, indicators of measuring the effectiveness of the supply chain were described. In order to assess the effectiveness of the supply chain the decision model was developed. Optimization is crucial in decision support systems. The development of an appropriate model for mapping the behavior of a real object or system and formulating an optimization task is a necessary activity in effective management. This is even more important if we want to be competitive. Along with the development of decision support systems, as well as the development of systems for data acquisition on the system functioning, which feed optimization models in ever more detailed form, complex decision models are created that take into account many optimization criteria and require a large amount of data. It allows, however, to ensure the sustainable development of the system and simultaneous implementation of its basic tasks. The main aim of this paper is to present the stages and assumptions of the model for assessing the effectiveness of the supply chain. The main data input, constraints of the model, the criteria functions were determined.</jats:p>",

Three E-supply chain operation modes are constructed in this paper, then the optimal pricing and advertising strategies under those modes are studied and compared, which are demonstrated with numerical examples. The results of comparison and analysis show that: Selling price, network platform service level, advertising investment and the profits of manufacturer, network platform and E-supply chain all increase with advertising effectiveness of stimulating demand growth. Under centralized decision-making mode, service level is highest, advertising investment is largest and the profit of E-supply chain is highest as well. When manufacturer leads decentralized decision-making mode, not only network service level, advertising investment and the profit of manufacturer can gain better results, but also profit of network platform can be higher while the advertisement effect of increasing demand is big enough. Additionally, it is confirmed that centralized decision-making is better than decentralized decision-making for system operation. Besides, decentralized decision-making mode led by manufacturer is superior to it led by network platform on the condition that advertisement effect is obvious.</jats:p>",

To control the overload, various methods have been proposed, but there are some basic challenges presented in presented methods that lead to poor performance while there is an overloaded server in the network. The current study focusing on server – server’s overload, a distributed overload control method, based on dynamic window and implicit feedback is proposed to control overload. In order to extend the originally proposed algorithm which uses the violation of the calling delay from a specific threshold as an incentive for reducing the sending load to downstream proxy, adaptive methods are proposed.

The healthcare industry, particularly pharmaceuticals and diagnostic processes, has an ongoing need to improve item tracking and data collection to improve the quality of care while reducing cost.  This paper primarily focuses on integrating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) inside of artificial organs to provide doctors and nurses a better synopsis of the embedded organ. The remote, non-invasive characteristics of RFID can facilitate the information needs of healthcare without imposing additional burden onto the patient or staff.  Properly deployed RFID enabled devices is envisioned to provide convenient and accurate data for artificial organs conditions, and critical information that may be necessary for medical specialist to better serve patients with these organs. This paper describes an all-encompassing RFID tracking system that begins with compliance documentation from implementation duration of the patient’s life.  This RFID system can provide data for decision-making and facilitate compliance with FDA imposed e-pedigree requirements. This transcript introduces healthcare trends in order to motivate the need for a biocompatible RFID system. The overall goal of the pending research is to develop biocompatible RFID tag components for use with systems implemented inside artificial organs and continued through the duration of the device as mentioned above. It is envisioned that successful implementation of this technology could improve life expectancy of patients with artificial organs by ten percent. </jats:p>"

The quality of water used in daily activities of rural people is almost uncontrolled. Somewhere water supply systems are used, but they have been built over many periods, certain ones for over 50 years ago, thus having a lot of damage and many deposits, causing loss of pressure and huge loss of water.

Substantial private\nimplementation is needed if company management objectives to increase the share of recyclable clothing and prevent\ndangerous clothing risk be achieved. The aim of this paper, and the entire special issue, is to draw scholarly attention\nto the processes underlying strategic choices for recyclable clothing implementation. An modular apparel safety\narchitecture (MASA) framework for supply chain management was developed and implemented to provide guidelines\nfor apparel designers and manufactures to solve safe and sustainable problems related to apparel production. The\nMASA framework was developed by integrating modular theory and product recyclable concept into existing apparel\ndesign and production. Children’s clothing design and production was used to implement the MASA framework as a\nproof concept. The MASA framework is the first apparel design and production model that emphasizes safety and\nrecyclability in addition to functional, expressive, and aesthetic considerations. The originality of this work is its ability to\ncombine social, technical, environmental and economic aspects using modular theory in order to provide a more holistic\npoint of view on factors impacting recyclable clothing system through the design and development of recyclable\nmanagement modules.</jats:p>",

Due to a chronic lack of data, studies on these emergent structures have long focussed on local neighbourhoods, assuming simple, chain-like structures. However, studies conducted since 2001 have shown that supply chains are indeed complex networks that exhibit similar organisational patterns to other network types. In this paper, we present a critical review of theoretical and model based studies which conceptualise supply chains from a network science perspective, showing that empirical data do not always support theoretical models that were developed, and argue that different industrial settings may present different characteristics. Consequently, a need that arises is the development and reconciliation of interpretation across different supply network layers such as contractual relations, material flow, financial links, and co-patenting, as these different projections tend to remain in disciplinary siloes. Other gaps include a lack of null models that show whether the observed properties are meaningful, a lack of dynamical models that can inform how layers evolve and adopt to changes, and a lack of studies that investigate how local decisions enable emergent outcomes. We conclude by asking the network science community to help bridge these gaps by engaging with this important area of research.</jats:p>",

LBF has been used by several countries for more than 100 years as pre-treatment for water supply and hydrogeological characterization studies. LBF studies are still recent and essentially focus on water quality with little or no hydrogeological approach. The benefits obtained through this technique were the reason for the implementation of a pilot project on LBF on the lake banks of the ‘lake’ at the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV) in the city of Viçosa (MG), southeastern Brazil. Several hydrogeological studies were carried out in this research. In this article, we highlight the study by means of three-dimensional modeling of steady-state flow to learn the characteristics of the aquifer and its interaction with the ‘lake’. The three-dimensional numerical model of steady-state flow was elaborated for interpretative and predictive purposes. The results demonstrated the potential of the LBF system and how it can be used as an alternative for the UFV campus. The exposed scenario can help groundwater management in the study area.</jats:p>",

The different characteristics of these two supply chain systems allow the consumers to shift their preferences from modern retail supply chain to organic market supply chain when buying organic vegetables. Therefore, analysis of the performance and competitiveness of these two different supply chain systems is important for improvement of organic vegetable supply chain in the future. Based on the results of supply chain analysis, it was found that the added value obtained by modern retail supply chains TOM was 58.44%, while that obtained by organic market supply chain POJOG was 38.97%. The marketing margin ratio obtained by such players in modern retail supply chain system as farmers, TOM and Super Indo were 1.29, 1.91 and1.18 respectively, whereas those obtained by farmers and POJOG on the organic market supply chain were 2.10 and 1.29 respectively.

Utilizing of sediment soil has been studied. Likewise, this research aims to utilize the sediment soil, wastes of water supply treatment process for producing non-fired wall tiles. In the experiment, four types of raw materials have been employed consisting of sediment soil, laterite soil, Portland cement type 1 and fluvial sand. Constructed formulas have been divided into two groups. Substitution of sediment soil for laterite soil is the first group, and substitution for fluvial sand is the second group. After mixing the raw materials of all formulas, forming specimens by uni-axial pressing at 100 bars with dimension 100x50x8 mm. have been carried out. Then, they have been sprayed and aged for 7, 28, and 60 days at room temperature. After that, testing the specimens’ properties has been performed based on TIS 2508-2555 standard. The formula contains 10% of sediment soil wastes offering the highest bending strength 7.51 Mpa, and 6.87% water absorption at 60-day aging. The experimental results show that adding the sediment soil to the basic composition has an effect on the bending strength and water absorption. The water absorption property can pass standard TIS 2508-2555, and bending strength nearly passes the standard. Energy saving cost has been compared with fired wall tiles at 850°C. It can save cost by $13 USD/cycle/day In addition, imaging analysis using Scanning Electron Microscopy has been employed for analysing the microstructure of specimens at different curing age for 7, 28, and 60 days.</jats:p>"

Characterizations were done by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The nanocomposite was examined for the defluoridation of water, and the effect of contact time, pH, initial fluoride ion concentration, and adsorbent dosage were investigated. The Langmuir model showed the best agreement with the experimental data. The maximum adsorption capacity for the fluoride removal from aqueous solutions was 15.385 mg/g at 318 K and pH = 5.0. The adsorption mechanism matches the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with a rate constant (k2) of 0.68 g/mg·min. The thermodynamics study of the nature of adsorption showed that ΔH and ΔS were 13.767 kJ/mol and 0.066 kJ/mol·K respectively. A mechanism for the fluoride sorption was proposed by considering the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions.</jats:p>",

The experiments were carried out at the National Irrigation Laboratory of the Agricultural Engineering Research Institute. The emitters were tested and calibrated under different operating pressures (0.50, 0.75, 1 and 1.25 bar) to determine emitter flow rates and emitter emission uniformity (EU) and manufacturing variation coefficient (CV). The original emitter performance was determined using the relationship between emitter flow rate (2 lh−1) and operating pressure, with data indicating that the EU was 98.5%, at a CV of 2.3% and actual flow rate was 1.8 lh−1 for the original emitter. The EU was 93.8% with a CV of 5.2% and actual flow rate of 2.02 lh−1 for the modified emitter. For original emitter performance at 4 lh−1, data indicated that the EU was 96%, with a CV of 4.8% and actual flow rate of 3.78 lh−1. The EU for the modified emitter was 95% with a CV of 2.7% and actual flow rate of 4.5 lh−1. The emitter exponent values were 0.41 to 0.44 for modified and 0.37 to 0.38 for original emitters.</jats:p>",

The apparel supply chain has increased enormously in length and complexity, driving apparel retailers to employ sourcing intermediaries who manage their sourcing activities with suppliers from developing countries overseas. Thus, the purpose of this study is to enrich existing findings on SSCM by exploring the management of social sustainability when sourcing intermediaries are in between the focal company and the respective developing country factories. More specifically, this study aims to understand the role of apparel sourcing intermediaries for the implementation of social management strategies based on the perception of multiple supply chain actors. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews conducted in Vietnam and Europe. Ultimately ten propositions are presented, all explicitly concentrating on the apparel intermediary’s role as a significant enabler for social sustainability in apparel supply chains. The roles are social sustainability, supplier developer and coordinator, gatekeeper and safeguard, cultural broker, and social risk manager. The social sustainability roles assumed by the apparel sourcing intermediary offer great opportunities to both apparel retailers and developing country factories.</jats:p>"

The objective of the case is to evaluate the orange juice industry, assess the position of Florida’s Natural within the industry, and propose business actions for the cooperative. By the end of 2016, the orange juice industry was in the midst of a severe crisis, threatened by decreasing supply and changing consumption preferences. Total orange production in the State of Florida during the 2015-16 season was the smallest crop since the 1960s due mainly to a disease known as citrus greening. Marketers were also facing consumers’ concerns regarding high levels of calories and sugar in some juice categories. Furthermore, on May 2016, the Food and Drug Administration mandated a change in the nutrition facts label on packaged food, becoming effective in the summer of 2018, which may impact marketers in the sector.</jats:p>",

The base supply amount is modeled via a farmers’ decision model that estimates the amount of land dedicated to biomass production under a given biomass wholesale price. We develop a two-stage stochastic integer program for integrated design of a network as well as biomass pricing decisions under yield uncertainty. To efficiently solve our model, we suggest a Benders decomposition–based algorithm in which the Benders cuts, one for each scenario, are aggregated by utilizing a scheme that takes into account yield rates as well as the geographical nature of the underlying problem. With further strengthening of the cuts, we present a significantly improved approach for solving relatively large instances and illustrate its performance via a computational study. We further present an extensive case study in Texas using realistic data to test our model’s capabilities and to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing the relationships between total cost, biomass wholesale price, network structure, and various input parameters. Finally, we examine the relationship between farmers’ decision model parameters, which dictate the risk profile of farmers, and the expected total system cost, as well as the biomass wholesale price. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2017.0766 . </jats:p>",

To address these challenges, we devise a green closed loop supply chain (GCLSC) with uncertain demand. In the problem, two conflict objectives and recycling the used products are considered. To solve this problem, a mathematical model is formulated with the chance constraint, and the    ϵ   -constraint method is adapted to obtain the true Pareto front for small sized problems. For larger sized problems, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and the multi-objective simulated annealing method (MOSA) are developed. Numerous computational experiments can help manufacturers make better production and sales plans to keep competitive advantage and protect the environment.</jats:p>"

In the presence of private water storage, water supply is no longer linked to users' consumption and network-operating conditions can be off-design, therefore specific models have to be introduced in simulation models of water distribution networks. Here, a new mathematical model is proposed that is able to reproduce a tank's emptying/filling cycles. Specifically, by means of experimental analysis, a hyperbolic tangent law was tested to reproduce the filling process for private tanks. The flow rate is calculated by means of the classical Torricelli law, in which the float valve emitter coefficient and the valve area are calculated using a function that takes into account the water level within the private tank. The comparison obtained through the mathematical model and those observed from experiments confirmed the ability of the model to predict the flow rate balance within private tanks. The results show that the model is suitable for any length of float valve branch. The mathematical system can be easily used in a transient model to correctly estimate the supplied demand.</jats:p>",

Previous scholars have indicated the necessity of investigating the concept of value co-creation further by including various stakeholder perspectives and suggesting systems of evaluation. This research thus focuses on low-power smallholder farmers within the coffee supply chain by qualitatively evaluating the effectiveness of value co-creation projects. The study also analyzes the extent of development and the nature of empowerment initiatives designed conjointly by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and coffee roasters that are addressed to farmers. The mixed qualitative methodology includes a literature review, interviews, focus groups, and content analysis of 20 value co-creation projects conducted in various developing and emerging coffee-producing countries. The research proposes a theoretical framework employed to conduct focus groups with Brazilian coffee farmers. This framework empirically demonstrates that these farmers are in the process of becoming business partners of the coffee supply chain thanks to various empowerment initiatives, common to most of the analyzed projects, that appear to moderate specific vulnerabilities of the coffee supply chain and therefore benefit supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

This distribution starts from the finished goods warehouse, distribution warehouse, retailer up to the wearer. The existence of various parties involved and coordinate in the flow of products from the factory to the consumer will form a system known as the supply chain system (Pujawan, 2010). Providers of fast products and services, the right time, and the desired conditions while still providing an optimal contribution to the company. Obstacles that are often encountered in the implementation of supply chain is the lack of coordination in terms of sharing information between the chain, thus causing distortion of information and trigger the occurrence of bullwhip effect that is a spike from the actual demand in the consumer level or downstream chain resulting in a very sharp spike at a far level from the upstream consumer or chain. The result of the bullwhip effect is the excess inventory, because demand is much smaller than the demand of the retailers, the unorganized production schedule, the unutilized production facilities optimally, because the production plan still has a high level of speculation. The use of information systems that have not been effective, causing the flow of information to be distorted or distorted, resulting in chaos in the flow of products that occur bullwhip effect and indirectly affect the cash flow of the company. The final result of the research is the application of Web-based Information Sharing System on the distribution channel that can be used efficiently and can provide information deviations that occur between the chains. The hope of stock monitoring results can be used as a control in looking at stock inventory in distributors and retail, so if there is a bullwhip effect, it will appear warning and immediately addressed by the distributor.Keywords: information sharing system, bullwhip effect, distortion of information.</jats:p>"

Bioremediation of mercury using bacteria is a useful technique to remediate mercury contamination. In the present study mercury resistant bacteria (MRB) were isolated from Mithi River water samples. Total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) and MRB present in the Mithi river water samples were enumerated. The count for THB was found to be 3.7 × 106 CFU/ml. MRB enumerated in the nutrient agar medium with mercury concentrations of 50, 100 and 150 ppm had counts of 2.8 × 106, 9.1 × 105 and 5.8 × 104 CFU/ml, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the isolated bacterium was found to be around 500 ppm of mercury, and it was selected for further analysis. The bacterial isolate was found to tolerate a wide range of salt concentrations from 5 to 35 ppt of NaCl. The bacterial isolate was characterized by using standard biochemical tests and identified by using the 16S rDNA technique. Homology analysis of the 16S rDNA gene has confirmed the identity of the bacterium as Bacillus thuringiensis strain RGN1.2 with NCBI accession no. KX832953.1.

In areas where improved water sources are used, not all rural households experience the benefits of these improved water sources. Water samples were collected from boreholes in three wards in the Vhembe District to determine microbiological risks over a 5-month period. A Water Point Mapping tool was used to indicate the borehole distribution. Water samples were taken from each functional borehole and analysed for total coliform and Escherichia coli counts, electrical conductivity, pH and temperature. A multiplex PCR protocol was used for identification of pathogenic E. coli. A total of 125 boreholes were identified of which only 12 were functional. Seven boreholes tested positive for total coliforms and E. coli counts. Four boreholes (33.3%) tested positive for diarrhoeagenic E. coli. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of water samples were without health risks, 17% were low risk and 25% could cause infection according to the South African water quality standards. This study indicated the importance of the role of the Municipalities and the maintenance plans that need to ensure that all boreholes are functional and provide safe drinking water to the rural communities.</jats:p>",

The model of supply chain of indigo fish in Musi Rawas Regency is discussed descriptively by using development method following Food Supply Chain Networks (FSCN) process framework. The results showed that the supply chain of tilapia fish at Bandar Sriandoyo in Tugumulyo District of Musi Rawas Regency based on FSCN approach involves supply chain members consisting of partner farmers, Bandar Sriandoyo, bakul (wholesalers), and retailers. The flow patterns of goods, financial flows, and the flow of information have generally been relatively good. In particular, the dynamic flow of information becomes an important factor in the running of business processes and collaborative planning, as well as building trust among the members of the indigo fish supply chain.</jats:p>"

Using 155 completed responses, the study further analysed using SmartPLS to validate the proposed relationships. Findings suggest communication and cooperation as dominant enablers of SC resilience in the integrated model that explored the inter-relationships also among the proposed relational attributes. Also, SC resilience has positive performance implications. Alternate models were suggested to further explore the inter-play between communication, trust, commitment and cooperation and how the same influences the SC resilience. The study is the first to consider the inter-relationships among the relational attributes and how the same as a whole influences SC resilience. </jats:p>",

Manufacturing firms face multiple implementation challenges like cost limitations, competition, innovation and stakeholder pressure, and supplier and customer relationships, among others. Taking as an example a case of a medium-sized manufacturing company, opportunities to realise material efficiency improvements within the company borders—on the supply chain and by using circular economy measures—are assessed. Deterministic calculations and simulations, performed for the supply chain of this company, show that measures to increase material efficiency in the supply chain are important. However, they need to be complemented by efforts to return waste and used products to the economic cycle, which requires rethinking the traditional linear economic system.</jats:p>"

This study reviewed, prioritised and updated the rudimentary All Towns strategies initially developed by DWS in 2011. The purpose of the strategies was to reconcile water requirements with available resources for the 2011–2035 planning horizon by estimating the projected water requirements, determining available water resources (surface and groundwater) and developing a water balance. Recommendations were made to conserve, manage and administer local water sources as well as to augment water supplies from other sources if required. The recommendations provided actions and options for implementation by the relevant Water Services Authorities and the DWS at a local and regional level, providing the opportunity for integrated and coordinated planning. Bulk and reticulation metering, the implementation of water conservation and demand management programmes and recommendations on the updating of water use allocations were prioritised. Detailed studies required to determine the most feasible water resource augmentation options to ensure a positive water balance were identified. The study coordinated efforts by officials and stakeholders representing both the water resources and water services sectors. The prioritised strategies defined the deficit or surplus of the water resources per water source on a technical level, but also highlighted the need for planning and coordination between the water resources and water services sectors. The strategies are not legally mandated documents, but represent some of the best efforts spanning across various sectors to realise coordinated water infrastructure planning in DWS’ Northern Planning Region. The use of the documents in the local, district and national planning environments should be promoted for integrated planning, and it may be fitting to incorporate the All Towns Reconciliation Strategy documents as a valuable resource to inform the water legislation currently being reviewed.</jats:p>",

Carbon finance can help firms alleviate the finance pressure from carbon emission reduction. This research explores two financing methods, delay-in-payment and bank loan; and two cooperation decisions, carbon emission reduction cooperation and price cooperation. Four scenarios are considered: non-cooperation, partial-cooperation delay-in-payment, supply chain carbon finance (SCCF), and full-cooperation. We discuss how firms make their pricing and carbon emission reduction decisions under different cooperative levels and financing methods. For a manufacturer-dominated supply chain, the results show that SCCF will help the small and medium enterprise seek cooperation with the monopoly manufacturer, and improve supply chain’s profit compared to green loan. What’s more, SCCF pattern can effectively control the total carbon emission. In addition, we extend the model to consider the retailer-dominated case. The results show that SCCF pattern can help increase the emission reduction rate of the whole supply chain. From the perspective of emission reduction efficiency, it is better for the government to promote the SCCF mode in the retailer-dominated supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Glyphosate is a synthesis product and chemical substance that entered in the global market during the 70s. In the beginning, the molecule was used as an active principle in a wide range of herbicides, with great success. This was mainly due to its systemic and non-selective action against vegetable organisms and also to the spread of Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) crops, which over the years were specifically created with a resistance to glyphosate. To date, the product is, for these reasons, the most sprayed and most used herbicide in the world. Because of its widespread diffusion into the environment, it was not long before glyphosate found itself at the center of an important scientific debate about its adverse effects on health and environment. In fact, in 2015 the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France), an organization referred to as the specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization (WHO, Geneva, Switzerland), classified the substance as “likely carcinogenic” to humans. This triggered an immediate and negative reaction from the producer, who accused the Agency and claimed that they had failed to carry out their studies properly and that these conclusions were largely contradictory to published research. Additionally, in 2015, just a few months after the IARC monography published on glyphosate, the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority, Parma, Italy), another WHO related organization, declared that it was “unlikely” that the molecule could be carcinogenic to humans or that it could cause any type of risk to human health. The conflict between the two organizations of the World Health Organization triggered many doubts, and for this reason, a series of independent studies were launched to better understand what glyphosate’s danger to humans and the environment really was. The results have brought to light how massive use of the herbicide has created over time a real global contamination that has not only affected the soil, surface and groundwater as well as the atmosphere, but even food and commonly used objects, such as diapers, medical gauze, and absorbent for female intimate hygiene. How human health is compromised as a result of glyphosate exposure is a topic that is still very debatable and still unclear and unambiguous. This paper is a review of the results of the main independent recent scientific studies.</jats:p>"

In this study, a simplified equilibrium temperature model was incorporated into the CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) model. This model is easy to implement, needing fewer meteorological variables and no parameter calibration. The model performance was evaluated using observed data from four stations on the Lower Minnesota River. Results show that the simplified equilibrium temperature model performed as well as the original equilibrium temperature model and the term-by-term process model for water temperature predictions with the values of the coefficient of determination (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and Percent Error (PE) in the accepted range (R2 = 0.974, NSE = 0.972, PE = 1.377%). The impact of the water temperature on carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD) concentrations under three different water temperature models was evaluated, and results show that the monthly averaged CBOD concentrations of the simplified equilibrium temperature model were almost the same as that of the term-by-term approach. For all the four calibration stations, the simplified equilibrium temperature approach performs better than the other two models for dissolved oxygen simulation (R2 = 0.791, NSE = 0.65, PE = 7.596%), which indicates that the simplified equilibrium temperature model can be a potential tool to simulate water temperature for water quality modelling.</jats:p>",

They also connect people in unprecedented ways across social and cultural boundaries and have created new, interrelated webs of social relationships that are socially embedded. However, most of the existing theories of work are mainly based at the level of the corporation, not on the network of relations that interlink them, and how this may impact on work and employment relations. We argue that this web of relations should not just be seen in economic, but also social terms, and that the former are embedded and enabled by the latter. This article argues for the value of focusing on the role of brokers and boundary workers in mediating social relations across global supply chains. It develops four approaches that lie on a spectrum from structural perspectives focused on brokers who link otherwise unconnected actors to more constructivist ones focused on boundary workers performing translation work between domains. </jats:p>",

A robust economic control decision method for dynamic uncertain systems is proposed in this paper. It is developed based on the internal model principle and pole allocation method, and it is applied to an urban domestic water supply system with rising tendency and seasonal cycle fluctuation. To achieve this goal, first a multiplicative model is used to describe the urban domestic water demand. Then, a capital stock and a labor stock are selected as the state vector, and the investment and labor are designed as the control vector. Next, the compensator subsystem is devised in light of the internal model principle. Finally, by using the state feedback control strategy and pole allocation method, the multivariable robust economic control decision method is implemented. The implementation with this model can accomplish the urban domestic water supply control goal, with the robustness for the variation of parameters. The methodology presented in this study may be applied to the water management system in other parts of the world, provided all data used in this study are available. The robust control decision method in this paper is also applicable to deal with tracking control problems as well as stabilization control problems of other general dynamic uncertain systems.</jats:p>"

In this study, a simulation–optimization approach, i.e., a transport simulation model with a genetic optimization algorithm, was utilized to determine the pollutant source fluxes. We proposed a robust method for tuning the hyper-parameters based on Taguchi experimental design to optimize the performance of the GA. The effectiveness of the method was tested on an irregular geometry and heterogeneous porous media considering steady-state flow and transient transport conditions. Compared with traditional GA with default hyper-parameters, our proposed hyper-parameter tuning method is able to provide appropriate parameters for running the GA, and can more efficiently identify groundwater pollution.</jats:p>",

The result of Johansen’s cointegration test suggests a significantly positive long-run co-movement between the growth of money supply and stock prices in India but the result of vector error correction model (VECM) does not exhibit any significant relationship in short run. Further, the error correction term of the VECM reveals a long-run unidirectional causality from money supply to stock prices. However, the Granger causality test confirms that the growth rate of money supply does not cause the stock market movement in India in short run. Finally, the variance decomposition analysis reveals that both the Indian stock markets are strongly exogenous in the sense that shocks to money supply explain only a small portion of the forecast variance error of the market indices. Again, the impulse response function analysis indicates that a positive shock in money supply has a small but persistently positive effect on stock prices in India. </jats:p>",

The retailer moves first to decide a cost-sharing contract, then the manufacturer determines the energy-saving level, carbon-emission level, and wholesale price successively. In the end, the retailer determines the retail price. As a regulation, the government provides subsidies for energy-saving products, while imposing a carbon tax on the carbon emitted. The results show that (1) both the energy-saving cost-sharing (ECS) and the carbon emissions reduction cost-sharing (CCS) contracts are not the dominant strategy of the two parties by which they can facilitate energy savings and emissions reductions; (2) compared with single cost-sharing contracts, the bivariate cost-sharing (BCS) contract for energy saving and emissions reduction is superior, although it still cannot realise prefect coordination of the supply chain; (3) government subsidy and carbon tax policies can promote the cooperation of both the upstream and downstream enterprises of the supply chain—a subsidy policy can always drive energy saving and emissions reductions, while a carbon tax policy does not always exert positive effects, as it depends on the initial level of pollution and the level of carbon tax; and (4) the subsidy policy reduces the coordination efficiency of the supply chain, while the influences of carbon tax policy upon the coordination efficiency relies on the initial carbon-emission level.</jats:p>"

The study included field work to calibrate and validate the model together with lab determinations. Results show that the kinetics of first and second order together with the kinetics of mixed order can adequately describe the behavior of residual chlorine in this type of network. The research showed the variables that influence the behavior of residual chlorine in the network are: the quality of the input water, chlorine dosing, the effect of storage that increases the water age, and the presence of dead zones in the tanks. The study revealed that 95% of the reaction occurs in the storage tanks due to the small variation in the water level and the negligible reactions at the pipe walls. This study proved that the residual chlorine modeling in this small network in particular is a valuable tool for monitoring the water quality in the distribution network, which is useful to comply with water quality guidelines.</jats:p>",

There are many quantitative and qualitative attributes such as cost, responsiveness, and flexibility that need to be taken into account to determine the best supply chain strategy. Assessment of all attributes as mentioned is usually through a human evaluation process involving many subjectivity and uncertainty factors. In addition, the complexity of the problems directly related to each attribute used as an assessment increases the problem of uncertainty. Fuzzy MCDM (Multi Criteria Decision Making) is one of the MCDM methods that use a fuzzy approach to overcome complexity and uncertainty of the problem. Today the market has been able to witness a worldwide expansion and dynamic situation by leveraging new innovations in production methodology and information technology. With this new innovation, the market can increase demand for products tailored to minimum cost with minimum waiting time. Lean and agile are two chain strategy concepts evolved in the pursuit of business excellence, while the concept of leagile is in between. This study aims to select the best supply chain strategy (lean, leagile, agile) at a manufacturing company in Samarinda – East Kalimantan based on certain criteria by using Fuzzy MCDM.  </jats:p>"

We explore how this insight extends to the variability of payments to suppliers and its impact on how risk is generated and propagates upstream. To do so, we model the financial features of a supply chain based on industry reports and empirical findings from the finance literature. Capturing policies and constraints of the agents in the supply chain in a formal model, we are able to generate and explain the behavior observed in real supply chains. We show that payment variability occurs and propagates, even if orders are constant, in a cash‐constrained supply chain. Furthermore, our model reveals that payment variability may even become amplified under severe cash restrictions. We identify the factors that drive the propagation of variability—the industry risk, the firm's operational leverage, the existence of a financial leverage target, and the cost of debt. The model also makes it possible to explore states of nature not often observed in practice, but that may have an effect in managers' behavior, for example, bankruptcies. We numerically illustrate the impact of these drivers on the risk of upper echelons (suppliers and suppliers' suppliers) as well as the interactions between order and payment variability. We close by summarizing our findings and discussing future research opportunities.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Urban settlements are relatively few and small-sized, but rich natural resources (minerals, forests, rivers) attract energy-intensive industries. Energy demand is increasing as a result of new investments in mining and industries, while reliable energy supply is threatened by the planned phase out of Swedish nuclear power, the growth of intermittent power supplies and the need to reduce fossil fuel consumption, especially in the Finnish and Norwegian energy sectors. Given these challenges, this paper investigates the potentials of so far unexploited energy resources in the northern counties of Finland, Norway and Sweden by comparing and critically analyzing data from statistic databases, governmental reports, official websites, research projects and academic publications. The criteria for the technical and economic definition of potentials are discussed separately for each resource. It is concluded that, despite the factors that reduce the theoretical potentials, significant sustainable techno-economic potentials exist for most of the resources, providing important insights about the possible strategies to contribute to a positive socio-economic development in the considered regions.</jats:p>"

We argue that given the conditions present in small towns a different relationship is developed between private operators and asset holder than it would be the case in bigger, longer contracts for bigger urban centers. In this relationship much more information is exchanged and the objectives are shared, often making the conditions of the contract irrelevant for understanding how services have and will develop, giving more space to relational contracts and other informal arrangements.</jats:p>",

A career path is a cluster of jobs that uses similar skills and with due education and experience helps one to move up the ladder in their career. It often involves related training and certification in its field to reach the top level. A trial that any organization face is the integration or co-ordination of various activities between its different core functional areas. It becomes close to impossible to achieve such activities effectively. To accomplish such activities, organizations need to employ the modern information systems across their organization. One such system is the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that integrates all or most of the core processes that a company needs to run such as its finance, manufacturing, HR, supply chain, services, warehousing, procurement, accounting, marketing etc.,. The anticipated sales growth of the ERP market up to 7.2% by 2020 yielding an assessed sales value of about $41.60 billion [https://www.educba.com/three-broad-erp-career-options/] clearly explains the upcoming possible opportunities for the need of trained ERP professionals who often is someone usually has a good understanding of the business process.

The proposed UPS consists of three major parts (i.e., an output inverter, a unidirectional DC–DC converter, and a battery charger/discharger). Non-isolated topologies of both the unidirectional converter and battery charger/discharger ensure transformerless operation of the UPS system. A new topology of high gain converter is employed for boosting the low voltage of the fuel cell to a higher DC link voltage, with minimum semiconductor count, and high efficiency. A high-gain battery charger/discharger realizes the bidirectional operation between the DC link and the battery bank. Besides, it regulates the DC link voltage during the cold start of fuel cells and keeps the battery bank voltage to only 24 V. A new inverter control scheme is introduced that regulates the output voltage and minimizes the total harmonic distortion for non-linear loading condition. The proposed control scheme integrates proportional-resonant control with slide mode control, which improves the controller’s performance in transient conditions. The proposed UPS system is validated by developing a 1-kVA experimental prototype.</jats:p>"

Invalid data will have a negative performance impact on the ERP system and also lead to economic loss to the organization. Auto ID technologies is used to track and collect data in real time. They can also be integrated with ERP system to provide a live update reducing the data’s inconsistency. In this research it is hypothesized that by integrating Auto ID technologies into the ERP system the data accuracy and reliability can be increased significantly utilizing live data update. The expected results are that the Auto ID technologies will improve the ERP system data accuracy and reliability which will provide a huge cost savings.</jats:p>"

The work involved an experimental study on a simulated distribution system assembled in the Hydraulic Laboratory of the Engineering Institute at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Instituto de Ingeniería UNAM). Two different scenarios were investigated based on different pipe materials, variation of temperature and initial chlorine concentrations (4.0 and 4.5 mg/L). Feed water with varying amounts of organic content was dosed with varying amounts of chlorine concentration. Water samples were collected from different locations in the distribution system and analyzed for physicochemical properties and HAAs determination. The results of this research demonstrated that the concentration of HAAs in the different segments of the distribution systems varied depending on pipe material, initial chlorine concentration, pH, residence time and the presence of natural organic matter.</jats:p>",

In this study, we apply an integrated method combining the non-parametric Mann–Kendall trend test and the double-mass curve to analyze runoff data from 1961 to 2010. The major findings are as follows. (1) Annual runoff showed a statistically significant decrease, while precipitation showed no significant trend. (2) An abrupt change point was identified in 1998 at four representative stations, resulting in the study period being divided into pre-change and post-change periods for subsequent analysis. The double-mass curves were approximately linear in the pre-change periods, indicating that the dominant factor was probably climate change. Annual precipitation–runoff curves showed a decreasing trend from 1998, probably because of human activity. (3) The contributions of human activity to runoff in the post-change period for the four selected stations were 58.31%, 17.81%, 37.17%, and 47.66%, and the influence of human activity increased after the abrupt change point.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the study is to explore the current gap between supply and demand of sustainable financial investments in German retail banking from a financial advisor’s point of view. We use qualitative analysis of interviews with financial advisors based on a Grounded Theory approach with the aim to identify the key causation in the cause-effect relationship of the supply-demand-discrepancy. Our findings yield two explanations of the discrepancy. First, investment advisors attribute responsibility towards private investors, i.e., they ask for a clear signal whether private investors are interested in sustainable investment. Thereby, we refer to causal and responsibility attribution theory for grasping this phenomenon. Second, investors are risk-averse and therefore reluctant to invest in stocks, which represent the common form of sustainable investment in Germany. Accordingly, we propose risk averseness as a variable moderating the relationship between demand and supply of sustainable investment products within the frame of attribution theory. The study contributes towards the state-of-the-art by proposing an explanation for the mechanisms underlying the advisor-customer-relationship in the context of predominant risk-averse investment culture that currently hamper the expansion of the Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) segment of private investors in Germany. This paper outlines measures for promoting sustainable financial products in Germany, namely, among others, the creation of a more customizable offering of SRI products and the importance to inform customers about sustainable investment opportunities by advisors and banks.</jats:p>"

The proposed sensor transforms the temperature to complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) frequency and then into digital code. A CTAT voltage reference supplies a temperature-sensitive ring oscillator, which enhances temperature sensitivity and conversion rate. To reduce the supply sensitivity, an operational amplifier with a unity gain for power supply is proposed. A frequency-to-digital converter with piecewise linear fitting is used to convert the frequency into the digital code corresponding to temperature and correct nonlinearity. These additional characteristics are distinct from the conventional oscillator-based temperature sensors. The sensor is fabricated in a 180[Formula: see text]nm CMOS process and occupies a small area of 0.048[Formula: see text]mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> excluding bondpads. After a one-point calibration, the sensor achieves an inaccuracy of [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]1.5[Formula: see text]C from [Formula: see text]45[Formula: see text]C to 85[Formula: see text]C under a supply voltage of 1.4–2.4[Formula: see text]V showing a worst-case supply sensitivity of 0.5[Formula: see text]C/V.

At the same time, an additional intensity enhancement near the loop apex is visible in the IRIS slit-jaw images at 1400 Å. These observations suggest that the loop is probably heated by the interaction between the loop and the upflows, which are accelerated by the magnetic reconnection between small-scale magnetic flux tubes at lower altitudes. Before and after the possible heating phase, the intensity changes in the optically thin (Si <jats:sc>IV</jats:sc>) and optical thick line (C <jats:sc>II</jats:sc>) are mainly contributed by the density variation without significant heating.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> We therefore provide evidence for the heating of an envelope loop that is affected by accelerating upflows, which are probably launched by magnetic reconnection between small-scale magnetic flux tubes underneath the envelope loop.

The aim of this research article is to develop a mixed-integer linear programming model to configure the closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network and that could be optimized for maximizing the profit by determining the fixed order quantity inventory policy in various sites at multiple periods. The objective is to maximize the profit through CLSC by determining the optimal inventory of product and part mix during multiple periods. In onward supply chain, a standard inventory policy is followed when the product moves from manufacturer to end user, but it is very difficult to manage the inventory in the reverse supply chain of the product with the same standard policy. The proposed model examines the standard policy of fixed order quantity by considering three major types of return-recovery pair such as, commercial returns, end-of-use returns, end-of-life returns and their inventory positioning at multiple periods. Raw material supplier, manufacturer, distributer, retailer, customers and for major returns-collection sites like repair site, disassembly site, recycling site and disposal site were included in the network to develop this CLSC network model. The proposed model to configure the CLSC network has been solved by using IBM ILOG CPLEX OPL studio and the results of the model were analysed with numerical investigations followed by sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>"

The method can overcome the shortcomings of other methods, such as the quantile-selection-based method, which contains a certain level of subjectivity. The new method was used to estimate the annual reference condition of Chlorophyll-a in Taihu Lake. The log–log segmental regression results indicate that the distribution of specific volume (reciprocal of concentration) of Chlorophyll-a in Taihu Lake had a power-law tail. Both segmental regression and bootstrap approaches show two credible change points in the power-law relationship. This study's analysis shows that the value of 4.4 mg·m−3 was an appropriate annual reference value of Chlorophyll-a in Taihu Lake. Thus, the method would be useful in determining the numerical reference conditions of Chlorophyll-a for other shallow lakes.</jats:p>",

While a network with less redundancy implies less tolerance to further breaks, the isolation of nodes explicitly indicates unavailability of the system to service the nodes. This paper presents a method of measuring these topological changes using algebraic connectivity (AC). AC is a parameter that can be used to assess robustness and redundancy of a network. The changes in AC associated with pipe breaks are compared with the AC of intact networks to assess whether the removal of the pipe causes reduction of redundancy or isolation in the network. An AC of 1.5625 × 10−5 is calculated for an intake of a medium-sized water distribution network (WDN). The fluctuation in AC is used to assess the criticality of each pipe segment to the overall structure of the network. This study also evaluates the failure probability of the WDN, assuming that the network failure probability is equivalent to the probability of isolation of parts of the system due to pipe breaks. The breaks leading to the failure are identified using the method of the minimum cut-sets.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the main challenges in global procurement problems is the uncertainty in the demand and supply sides of supply chains. Besides, decision making in the stochastic supply chains is a complex problem. A powerful technique for decision analysis in complex stochastic problems is simulation. In this paper we propose a simulation-based optimization approach to solve a bi-objective (profit and service level) supply chain with uncertain customer demands and disruption events in the suppliers. The basic assumptions used in this paper are adopted from the multi-period newsvendor problem. In addition, based on the risk attitude of the buyers (retailers), to cope with the uncertainties, they can sign an option contract, reserving additional capacity in the secondary suppliers. Hence, a simulation approach is used to model the behavior (risk attitude) of the buyers. Indeed, because of the demand uncertainty, at the beginning of each contract period, buyers should decide on the amount of ordering from the primary suppliers. The risk attitude of the retailer (as a spectrum) is defined based on the amount of ordering from the primary supplier. Also, we use the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm to optimize the bi-objective model. Finally, a numerical example has been solved with the proposed algorithm and the results are reported. The results showed that if the profit is more important than service level, the risk sensitive retailer prefers to show more risk averse behavior. </jats:p>",

This paper describes the pathways by which farmers can access technology and research capacity from foreign firms. Then it examines some of the policies that India and Chinese governments have used to encourage access. The recent history of research and technology transfer to these countries is reviewed to do a preliminary assessment of how these policies work. India has had a much more liberal policy on foreign investment in recent years which resulted in more access to MNC research and technology. So far, however, there are no studies that show this policy led to higher benefits to farmers or lower costs of transferring technology. Studies of benefits and costs of these policies could be very useful to Indian and Chinese policy makers.</jats:p>",

According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, fall from elevations caused 14% of fatal work injuries that occurred at United States in 2010 [2]. 12% of these fall injuries are dedicated to fall from non-moving vehicles. Loading trailers are daunting and time consuming task that requires precision with heavy duty lifting equipment. It is easy for employees in these situations to cut corners and put themselves in situations where their safety is jeopardized. This paper focuses on applying decision analysis techniques to a situation where numerous fall protection alternatives are available and it is unclear which system would be the most effective for a specific situation. We have an approach for flatbed semi-trailers that integrates MCDA and AHP to determine the optimal best practice for loading.\nThis paper follows that given format of Section 1 presents the introduction, Section 2 provides relative definitions and background with respect to the paper, Section 3 describes the details of the problem statement and hypothesis for this paper, Section 4 presents the approach and data collection technique, Section 5 presents data and results concerning the functionality of the approach and Section 6 discusses the conclusions.</jats:p>"

The ANP helps in analyzing the interdependence and interrelations among the various determinants and dimensions of GSCM strategy selection. Fuzzy set theory is applied to avoid the vagueness and uncertainty in human preference judgement. This study uses an empirical case study of an Indian automobile organization to validate the applicability of the proposed model. The results show that the resource based strategy is in first position, having the maximum impact on each determinant. The case organization should improve the green management system with the assistance of a suitable GSCM strategy, i.e. the resource based strategy. This study may help managers to make decisions, and to analyze and standardize their environmental advantages dynamically. The robustness of the projected model is checked by conducting a sensitivity analysis. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment</jats:p>",

Such authentication system (also known as path authentication) not only guarantees the merchandise to be available in the right destination with no discrepancies and errors but also ensures the route of the merchandise progress to be valid. This paper outlines the current state‐of‐the‐art cryptographic solutions for path authentication, highlights their properties and weakness, and proposes a novel, privacy‐preserving, and efficient solution. Compared with the existing elliptic curve ElGamal re‐encryption–based solution, our homomorphic message authentication code on arithmetic circuit–based solution offers less memory storage (with limited scalability) and no computational requirement on the reader. Moreover, we allow computational ability inside the tag that articulates a new privacy direction to the state‐of‐the‐art <jats:italic>path privacy</jats:italic>. This privacy notion helps support the confidentiality of the tag movement in the context of IoT‐enabled cross‐organizational tracking environment where the stakeholders can be from different organizations associated together with the merchandise being delivered. As a potential extension to the path authentication protocol, we further propose a polynomial‐based mutual authentication as a security extension and batch initialization as an efficiency extension. Besides our brief security and privacy analysis, our evaluation shows that the proposed solution can significantly reduce memory requirements on tags with marginal computational overhead to ensure transmission path confidentiality. We observe that SupAUTH requires maximum 513‐bit tag memory and 57.3 ms of processing time during evaluation, which is not only practical but also suitable for any suitable low‐cost radio‐frequency identification deployment in IoT.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main anthropogenic factors of chemical and toxicological pollution of decentralized water-supply sources in rural settlements are examined. Complex estimation of water pollution level is made and the dependence of subsoil waters quality from season changes is elicited on the example of countryside within Berezany district Ternopil region. Berezhany district is mostly agricultural and that’s why agriculture becomes one of the biggest polluters of water resources especially subsoil. Dangerous source of water pollution, especially in the period of spring flooding and rainfall flooding are diffuse runoffs from agricultural areas/ in three to four times more nutrients and suspended solids are imposed from them than from natural areas. In the qualitative composition (cation and anions content mineralization ) among subsoil’s waters  of Ternopil region, that are used for water-supply, essentially dominate bicarbonate-sulfate calcium-sodium waters with mineralization 0.2–0.8 g/dm3. Especially in Berezhany district subsoil fresh waters have bicarbonate-sulfate calcium-sodium composition with common mineralization of 0.5–0.7 g/dm3. There are 3432 artesian wells in the region, including 2679 in the countryside and 753 in towns and 74296 mine pits. It is found that on this territory low concentrations of nitrites during the whole period of research are marked. Except for isolated cases of its growth: in the village Zhukiv (to 0.02 mg/dm3) in autumn and Posurhiv (to 0.04 mg/dm3) in spring, that are explained by the increasing of quantity of fall-outs and respectively, growth of runoff from agricultural lands. Small concentrations of nitrites in groundwater’s on the district territory (less more than 0.01 mg/dm3) are due to their extreme instability. They are oxidized, moving to the most stable inorganic nitrogen – nitrates. Concerning nitrates, their high levels with gradual growth from spring to autumn is found. In the village Zhukiv the figure does not exceed the norm, except in autumn, where it is 52.35mg/dm3. Significant increase of nitrates concentration on the territory of these villages in autumns is explained by the fact, than during the rains polluting substances penetrated into groundwater’s, that drained from fields, where nitrogen fertilizers were given. In summer this increase can be explained by fertilization. Receiver results speak about poor state of ground waters as the sources of decentralized water-supply due to increasing of nitrate contents in these objects. It is shown that effluents and fertilizers that are given into the soil, make the most influence on the quality of water from underground sources. It is also founded the increasing of contents of nitrites, nitrates, chlorides, sulphates in spring during snowmelting and in autumn during rains. Considering the excess of nitrates norm in ground water it is necessarily control making of nitrogen fertilizers into soil. It is necessary to conduct purification  of drinking water before its usage. It is obviously that on the areas with higher percentage of “unstandard” water the morbidity of cancer is higher. The effect of influence of water with higher contents of nitrates increases against the background of malnutrition that is particularly in the current crisis period of life.</jats:p>"

A field experiment was conducted at the Research Farm of the College of Agriculture, Tabriz University during two growing seasons of 2014 and 2015. The treatments were arranged as split plots based on randomized complete block design with three replicates. Irrigation treatments (irrigation after 70, 100, 130, and 160 mm evaporation from class A pan) were assigned to the main plots and spring safflower cultivars (Faraman, Goldasht, Sina, and Soffeh) were allocated to the subplots. Safflower seeds were harvested in 5‐d intervals at seven stages during development and maturity period. The result showed that Sina cultivar had the highest seed yield per unit area. Maximum oil percentage of safflower seeds was obtained at 1 to 12 d after plant physiological maturity. Water stress caused seed oil percentage decline across all cultivars. Sina and Faraman cultivars had higher oil percentage across all irrigation treatments. The highest oil and seed yield per unit area under both full and limited irrigation conditions was produced by Sina cultivar. Drought stress decreased seed yield, yield components, and oil content across all safflower cultivars, however, the extent of the damage was limited due to cultivar genetic characteristics and ecological origin.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

However, it is as difficult to define as to operationalize it, resulting in a lack of information on how to increase the level of integration among members. Thus, this research aims to evaluate the dimensionality of SCI, to check alignment with the features identified in the literature using multivariate statistical analysis. The methodology used was based on a questionnaire to assess the level of companies integration with suppliers of its supply chain. This instrument consisted of 21 items, with response options: yes, no or not applicable. The questions focused on evaluating the integration with suppliers, so each company consulted could answer a questionnaire for each supplier, since the intensity of relationships varies. Thus, 41 companies participated in the survey, resulting in 205 responses. Full-information item factor analysis and principal component analysis on the correlation matrix tetrachoric were used for the instrument dimensionality analysis. They are appropriate procedures for analysis of dichotomous variables. The results of this analysis enabled grouping the questionnaire items in the following underlying factors: trust, information sharing, partnership, collaboration or cooperation, and coordination. The identification of such factors such as dimensions of SCI enables greater understanding on how to raise the level of integration among the members of a supply chain.</jats:p>"

This study therefore identified determinants of NRW for a water utility in California by applying fixed effects panel regression analysis incorporating uncertainty. Network length, connection density, and net operating revenue per cubic meter of water sold were found to be negatively correlated with NRW while a positive relationship between number of leaks and NRW was identified. These findings will inform the water utility's management team/decision-makers regarding the specific impacts of NRW's critical factors and guide them to focus on these factors to further reduce NRW as well as set long-term benchmarks.</jats:p>",

Different traditional methods such as the sediment rating curve (SRC) can be used to estimate the suspended sediment load of rivers. The main problem with this method is its low accuracy and uncertainty. In this study, the ability of three intelligence models namely: gene expression programming (GEP), artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were compared with the SRC method. The daily flow discharge and sediment discharge at two hydrometric stations of the Kasilian and Telar rivers in the period of 1964–2014 were used to develop intelligence models. The performance of these methods indicated that all intelligence models give reliable results in the estimation of the suspended sediment load and their performance was better than the SRC method. Moreover, results showed that the GEP model with a high coefficient of determination (R2) and a low mean absolute error (MAE) was better than both the ANN and ANFIS models for the estimation of daily suspended sediment load of the two sub-basins of the Kasilian and Telar rivers.</jats:p>",

These pressures are being exerted from different stakeholders but in developing countries mostly there are powerful suppliers and customers, which can change the choices of decision makers in the local industry. According to institutional theory these pressures combined are called normative pressures. By using path modeling this study attempted to find out the role of normative pressures to adopt green supply chain management (GSCM) practices and the impact of those adopted practices on environmental and economic performance of those companies through partial least square (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM). Data was collected from 134 manufacturing companies in Pakistan through a questionnaire. Path analysis results confirmed that normative pressures have positive and significant impact on adopting the GSCM practices and subsequently these practices improve the environmental performance of the companies in Pakistan. Results also confirmed many existing studies that GSCM practices directly do not improve economic performance but environmental performance does have a significant positive effect on the economic performance</jats:p>"

Some of its coconut sugar products are sent to various regions in Indonesia, and some others are occasionally exported. The company, however, had encountered some constraints both in supply and product fulfillment. This research was,  therefore, aimed at studying the efficiency of performance at CV Menoreh Politan. The input variables used were order fulfillment cycle, supply chain flexibility, total supply chain cost, cash to cash cycle time, and daily inventory, while input variables for output of supply chain performance were delivery performance, order fulfillment, and conformity with standard. The efficiency of coconut sugar supply chain performance is analyzed by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method with constant return to scale (CRS) assumption.  Analysis of farmer efficiency by using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) resulted in farmer efficiency level. CV Menoreh Politan has operated efficiently with its 14 partners (24.14 percent), while the remaining 44 farmers of CV Menoreh Politan (75.86 percent) have not reached the maximum efficiency level. The inefficiency of farmers was largely due to the cost of supply chains and long-term enterprise turnover. Overall, the collectors have been fully operational. Similarly, the company has been technically efficient, meaning that in terms of input and output, it has been good.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The energy intensity of water—‘energy (electricity)-for-water’—is calculated for Benidorm, a mass tourism resort in the Spanish Mediterranean coast, where the urban water cycle has evolved in response to a series of episodes of water stress. The analysis is based on primary data compiled from various actors involved in the urban water cycle encompassing water extraction, end uses, and wastewater treatment, including tertiary treatment. The results provide one of the first analyses of the relations between energy and water in a mass tourist center, which may be of potential interest for other tourist areas. It is estimated that a total of 109 GWh/year of electricity is required to operate the water cycle of Benidorm. About 4% of total energy use in Benidorm is dedicated to extracting, transporting, and treating water. The most energy-intensive stage is represented by end uses, which accounts for 20% of the total energy use in Benidorm when the energy required for water pumping and hot water use is considered. Additionally, energy intensity for water extraction was estimated for normal, wet, and two dry year scenarios. In comparison with the normal scenario, energy intensity is six times larger when desalinated water is incorporated during a dry year, whereas the emergency interbasin water transfer resulted in a more moderate increase in energy intensity. While treated wastewater and emergency water transfers appear to be a more convenient solution in energy terms, the strong impulse given to desalination in Spain is forcing local water authorities towards the use of a resource that is much more energy intensive, although, on the other hand, much less dependent on the vagaries of climate. In light of recent technological and managerial developments, the Benidorm case illuminates the challenges appearing in the analysis of the water-energy nexus, especially the fact that scarcity may be transferred from water to energy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a new power supply architecture for generating a uniform dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma in air medium at atmospheric pressure. It is quite a challenge to generate atmospheric pressure uniform glow discharge plasma, especially in air. This is because air plasma needs very high voltage for initiation of discharge. If the high voltage is used along with high current density, it leads to the formation of streamers, which is undesirable for most applications like textile treatment, etc. Researchers have tried to generate high-density plasma using a RF source, nanosecond pulsed DC source, and medium frequency AC source. However, these solutions suffer from low current discharge and low efficiency due to the addition of an external resistor to control the discharge current. Moreover, they are relatively costly and bulky. This paper presents a new power supply configuration which is very compact and generates high average density (∼0.28 W/cm2) uniform glow DBD plasma in air at atmospheric pressure. The efficiency is also higher as no external resistor is required to control the discharge current. An inherent feature of this topology is that it can drive higher current oscillations (∼50 A peak and 2–3 MHz frequency) into the plasma that damp out due to the plasma dissipation only. A newly proposed model has been used with experimental validation in this paper. Simulations and experimental validation of the proposed topology are included. Also, the application of the generated plasma for polymer film treatment is demonstrated.</jats:p>",

Using a quali-quantitative technique – qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) – this article presents an investigation of determining factors for the presence of different service provision models in Brazil, and discusses the application of said technique. In this study, four models were comparatively analyzed: direct municipal administration, indirect municipal administration, state utility company, and private enterprise (PRIV). Eight municipalities, with an urban population ranging from 10 to 20 thousand inhabitants, from Minas Gerais (a state in the Southeast region of Brazil) were selected for this study. The findings suggest that the decision-making process regarding a service provision model, in the cases studied, involves a combination of economic, political, social, institutional, and legal factors. The qualitative comparative analysis proved capable of compiling information for this analysis as it uncovered how determining factors are inter-related and allowed the predominant factors in each of the studied management models to be identified.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As one of three prominent flows (material, money, information) in a supply chain, the information flow plays a key role in supply chain performance and also in reaching high degrees of integrity and cooperation between supply chain members. Regarding the vagueness and multi-dimensional nature of information sharing, evaluating the information sharing level in supply chain is a complex problem. This paper aims to develop a new rule-based inference system to evaluate the level of information sharing in a supply chain. To this end, first, the influencing parameters are obtained from the literature and are screened and refined by the experts, using Lexicography method. Then, they are categorised into a multi-level hierarchical structure. Finally, a hierarchical inference system, which consists of a set of fuzzy rule bases, is constructed to infer the information sharing degree. The use of fuzzy rule bases is due to the lack of explicit functions between the influencing factors as well as ambiguity of these parameters. Also, in this research, the input parameters’ measurement process is defined and some relevant indices are designed. The developed assessment system is a four-leveled hierarchical inference system, built of six fuzzy rule bases. The inference system has eight input parameters, the values of which are calculated utilising six designed indices and two quick questionnaires. Eventually, the developed inference system and the measuring method are implemented in a real case. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An integrated three-layer supply chain model for production and by-production system is formulated under fuzzy-rough (Fu-Ro)-environment. At first, supplier receives the deteriorating items in a lot and supplies the fresh units to manufacturer for production. Manufacturer has two plants: plant-1 and plant-2. Manufacturer purchases these fresh raw materials at a constant rate from supplier to produce the main product in plant-1. Retailer-I has purchased this product from manufacturer of plant-1 to sale to the customers. The residue units of plant-1 have transferred to plant-2 with constant rate to manufacture another usable by-product. Retailer-II purchases this usable by-product and sales to the customers. Ideal costs of supplier, manufacturer and retailer have been taken into account. By-production of residue units of plant-1 not only minimizes the environmental pollution, but also gives some return to the manufacturer. Due to the complexity of environment, inventory holding costs, idle costs and setup costs are considered as Fu-Ro type and these are reduced to crisp ones using Fu-Ro expectation. Supply rate, production and by-production rates are assumed as decision variables. Integrated model has been developed and solved analytically in crisp and Fu-Ro environments to find the optimum value of the decision variables and corresponding individual profits of the members of the supply chain are calculated numerically and graphically. Finally, the model has been realized with a case study of sugar mill. </jats:p>",

Surfactant quantity at 100% active concentration increases from ~1 ton (I) to ~1,000 ton (II) to 10,000s of ton per year (III). The industry is currently at Stage II and the EOR surfactants manufacturing/supply chain is being developed in parallel with field development. This paper describes how chemicals supply is being aligned with field projects.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Best practices from existing large-scale surfactant manufacture (for household and industrial applications) are being applied to EOR surfactants: Improve the manufacture and handling characteristics of surfactant concentrates that can be viscous, making them difficult to pump and dilute. In addition, dilution of the concentrate in the field facilities needs to avoid the formation of viscous phases.Use existing surfactant manufacture processes and plants that use standard industry petrochemical building blocks (ethylene, propylene oxide and ethylene oxide) to make products that are costeffective and can be readily scaled up.Larger projects (in Stage II and III) are supplied via 20 ton ISO-tanks, a standard bulk industry container.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The main findings are: For small field projects, it is usually advantageous to ship less concentrated products (e.g. ≤ 30% active matter, AM), for ease of mixing and dilution in the field.More concentrated (≥ 65% AM) products that are more viscous can be manufactured with a viscosity modifier to reduce viscosity and/or handled with the appropriate mixing equipment at the project facilities. In addition, the delivery of a mixed surfactant blend can be an option as this can be easier to handle than the single surfactant component due to reduced viscosity.For large projects, two strategies can be used to reduce logistics costs:○Supply a concentrated product (to minimise shipping of water) and/or○Manufacture the product (or part of the product) in country/region and near the field.A realistic supply chain was used to estimate the logistics costs to transport low and high %AM products from a USA point of manufacture to an EOR project destination in the Middle East. This calculation assumed an equal manufacturing cost for the low and high %AM products and transportation by 20 ton ISO-tanks, a standard bulk industry container. The transportation cost for the high %AM product is around 52% of the low %AM product. Additional logistics savings are achievable through manufacturing the product (or part of the product) in country/region, and the cost can be reduced to 34% of the low %AM product.Reduction in bulk chemical volume transport, achievable by the strategies above, gives a reduction in overall project costs as well as lower HSSE transport risks via fewer miles traversed per ton of product.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>More general learning for EOR projects are: Experience from the wider, bulk chemicals industry can be usefully applied for EOR projects.The need to align surfactant manufacture/supply logistics with reservoir management and the field life plan is important as significant lead time is required for supply of larger surfactant volumes.</jats:p>",

Many hospitals often have difficulty getting information or lack public knowledge about how to obtain information about the availability of bloodstock at PMI. Therefore we need an information system that can provide information quickly, well, and accurately. To overcome this, a system will be developed that uses the concept of Supply Chain Management to control the blood supply in PMI.

The bootstrap Granger full-sample and sub-sample rolling window causality tests are utilized. The full-sample test supports that reserve accumulations lead to significant endogenous money supply. However, the sub-sample test suggests that the endogenous money supply caused by reserve accumulations mostly existed before 2007 when China implemented a compulsory exchange settlement system. Structural changes also exist as a result of the impacts of excess money supply and reserve accumulations, which suggests specific backgrounds should be taken into account when investigating this issue. The rolling window causality test provides a more accurate result when considering structural changes, which proves reserve accumulations are more likely to cause endogenous money supply in a compulsory exchange settlement system. The significant difference before and after 2007 suggests that the ending of the compulsory exchange settlement system is helpful to improve the monetary policy independence. </jats:p>",

Com objetivo de analisar cooperação, aprendizagem e processos de inovação em uma cadeia cujo relacionamento é reconhecidamente assimétrico e que o grau de competitividade tem se acirrado nos últimos anos, como no caso da indústria têxtil brasileira, este trabalho foi realizado a partir de entrevistas, baseadas em questionários, com 14 empresas têxteis da região de Americana/SP. Essas entrevistas mostraram a existência de relações superficiais de cooperação entre os membros da cadeia entrevistados, e que essa forma de cooperação implica a inexistência de um processo sistemático e coordenado de aquisição de conhecimento e, por consequência, de inovações tecnológicas e organizacionais entre as empresas.

Data on 17 parameters obtained from seven sites from 2012 to 2015, with a total of 329 samples for each parameter, were analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques. Observation months were grouped into two periods (Period A, May–November; Period B, December–April) according to similarities in water quality characteristics through time analysis and cluster analysis (CA). Water temperature (TEMP), flow rate (Q), dissolved oxygen (DO), oils, fluoride (F) and cadmium (Cd) were the most significant parameters for discriminating between the two periods. Through a spatial analysis, the sites were classified into two groups (Groups 1 and 2). Q, total phosphorus (TP), oils, F and fecal coliform bacteria (F. coli) were the most significant parameters for discriminating between the two groups. Results suggested that TEMP, DO and Cd as functions of time, TP and F. coli as functions of space, and Q, oils and F as functions of both time and space should be monitored closely. The main sources of water pollutant were surface runoff and industrial wastewater, of time, and wastewater from agricultural irrigation, industrial wastewater, and municipal sewage, of space.</jats:p>",

Using a team‐based logistics simulation operating on a live commercial‐software application (SAP ERP) as a foundation, a supplemental exercise is proposed for deeper learning of transportation and logistics aspects of supply chain management. Sales and operations planning is used during four simulated months to develop detailed procurement strategies and logistics plans to enhance the baseline supply chain management (SCM) concepts of inventory control and forecasting in a distribution network. Transportation planning and scheduling complexity is introduced as students manage freight to conform to motor carrier weight regulations. The combination of commercial software and extensive real‐world planning allows students to assimilate numerous SCM concepts in a realistic environment. Student opinion survey data shows that students are highly engaged by the detailed nature of the simulation, which they concluded aided their conceptual learning. Additionally, the inclusion of the SAP ERP commercial software becomes a competitive advantage during collegiate recruiting by potential employers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increase in global supply chains is associated with increased interconnection between suppliers and manufacturers, leading to greater dependence between supply chain companies and a greater level of complexity. So, in spite of its great benefits, it makes them more vulnerable and with higher levels of risk. These risks must therefore be adequately identified and evaluated in order to carry out effective risk management to take the necessary measures to mitigate them. Risk management must be an ongoing process that helps the implementation of a company's strategy. We must methodically address all the risks associated with the activities that frame the company in the supply chains and provide the level of risk in the organization. In this sense, the objective of this article is to identify the main quantitative methods for the management of risks in supply chains through a systematic review of the literature based on a research methodology to that effect. This analysis has identified the main qualitative / quantitative, simple / integrated methods that have been used in the corresponding stages of the risk management cycle (identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring) as well as the main areas of application. As a result, the most explored stage has been the risk assessment and in particular the evaluation of the risk of supply. As far as applications are concerned, manufacturing supply chains have attracted more attention, while service supply chains are still little explored. Finally, new opportunities and challenges are identified as future lines of research.</jats:p>"

Additionally, a second analysis is included for 83 cities where water price and water conservation policy information is available. A hierarchical model using the nine climate regions (product of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) as the higher‐level groups results in the best out‐of‐sample performance, as estimated by the Widely Available Information Criterion, compared to counties grouped by urban continuum classification or primary economic activity. The regression coefficients indicate that the controls on water use are not uniform across the nation: e.g., counties in the Northeast and Northwest climate regions are more sensitive to social variables, whereas counties in the Southwest and East North Central climate regions are more sensitive to environmental variables. For the national city‐level model, it appears that arid cities with a high cost of living and relatively low water bills sell more water per customer, but as with the county‐level model, the effect of each variable depends heavily on where a city is located.</jats:p>",

The center of inflation is located in the NW part of the caldera, north of the active Santiago vent which has hosted a new lava lake since 11 December 2015. Simultaneous inversions of those Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data sets using a neighbourhood algorithm demonstrate that a spherical magma reservoir explains the geodetic data, with a horizontal location ∼3 km north of the active Santiago vent and a depth‐to‐center ∼3 km. The associated modeled volume increase (∼0.0042 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) is lower than the “excess” magma volume inferred from gas measurements from November 2015 to February 2016. The magma reservoir offset from the current center of eruptive activity may be the result of preexisting caldera structures.</jats:p>",

The research was conducted in six provinces in the northern peninsula of Sulawesi Island: North Sulawesi Province, Gorontalo Province, Central Sulawesi Province, Southeast Sulawesi Province, South Sulawesi Province and West Sulawesi Province. The research was undertaken from September 2011 to December 2011. The analysis unit in this research was PDAM, while the research population was the regional water company (PDAM) in Sulawesi. A quantitative approach was used for data analysis, i.e. variance-based inferential statistical analysis with structural equation modeling, known as partial least squares, with variable non-market capability acting as a moderating variable.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Government involvement has a significant and positive effect on the performance, indicating that the higher the government involvement, the higher the performance of a company. Efforts to reduce water loss level for PDAM is a strategic move, as they are associated with PDAM’s stakeholders. Water loss will lead to poor customer service, low contribution to the acceptance of regional governments and failure to meet natural conservation programs. On the other hand, to reduce the water loss level, considerable capital is needed for investment, for example, to finance the installation and repair of pipelines, pumps, mains water meter, customer water meter, the cost of water treatment, fuel costs and the expansion of the water source. In general, PDAM in Sulawesi still has problems in terms of expansion because of the lack of funding sources; hence, the role of regional government as the owner is expected, both in the form of financial aid and the tariff adjustment. The government should be in favor of thorough development of drinking water, as embodied in the form of finance, budget commitment and the commitment to the development of PDAM.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The limitations of this study are that the data used in this study are cross-sectional, so they only describe the condition at a particular time. Also, the sample was limited to Sulawesi taps; therefore, to generalize the findings, a larger sample needs to be considered.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The practical implications of this study are that development of water supply company cannot be separated from the government’s involvement as one of the stakeholders to improve corporate performance, especially through financial assistance. In connection with it, a board of directors or management of PDAM in every department of a company constantly works on government involvement, especially financial aid to fund or investment fund sharing, to improve service to customers. Such activities run a company aimed at achieving efficiency with emphasis on the efficiency of production and distribution capacity by managing the leakage rate, the emphasis on labor costs by keeping the ratio of employees ideal, the emphasis on aspects of the supply and distribution through control of water resources and water meter mains and water customers and an emphasis on the use of raw materials or chemicals with attention to the quality of raw water.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Social implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The social implications of this study are that government interventions are supported by the availability of resources according to the needs able to create efficiencies that have an impact on improving the performance of taps. Companies performing well can operate optimally in providing drinking water that meets health standards. In addition, the performance achieved allows the taps to embody the organization’s mission as a creator of jobs and local revenue for local governments.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Originality for this paper shows the moderating effect of efficiency and non-market capability in the relationship between government involvement and resources to PDAM. The originality also includes the location of this study (six provinces in the northern peninsula of Sulawesi Island: North Sulawesi Province, Gorontalo Province, Central Sulawesi Province, Southeast Sulawesi Province, South Sulawesi Province and West Sulawesi Province) as no previous research has investigated this relationship in this geography.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

We found that in the warmer summer, thermophilic cladocerans (e.g., <jats:italic>Bosmina</jats:italic> spp.) benefited most from diazotrophic <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AA</jats:styled-content>s in the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SW</jats:styled-content> (19.8°C), while only in the colder summer, temperate copepods (e.g., <jats:italic>Temora longicornis</jats:italic>) ascended from the subjacent winter water into the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SW</jats:styled-content> (16.2°C) and incorporated diazotrophic <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AA</jats:styled-content>s. Trophic position estimates based on the phenylalanine and glutamic acid δ<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N signatures revealed that the diazotrophic <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AA</jats:styled-content> supply into mesozooplankton was mainly indirect via feeding on mixo‐ and heterotrophic diets. Significantly enriched δ<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N signatures in phenylalanine in the deep mesozooplankton (mainly copepods of <jats:italic>Pseudo‐</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Paracalanus</jats:italic> spp.) from the bottom water (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BW</jats:styled-content>) that was a region of the suboxic zone point to a reliance on a local food web. Mesozooplankton in the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BW</jats:styled-content> was feeding on diets of heterotrophic origin and probably profited from the heterotrophic re‐synthesis of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AA</jats:styled-content>s originating from sinking organic matter, as well as from the indirect incorporation of de novo synthesized <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AA</jats:styled-content>s that most likely originated from chemoautotrophic bacteria or archaea communities in the suboxic zone. Our findings suggest that indirect feeding on diazotrophs and chemoautotrophs will be principal ways of amino acid supply for zooplankton in future enhanced stratified aquatic systems. Only a relatively small increase in temperature may restrict temperate key species from diazotrophic N‐based food webs in the mixed layer.</jats:p>",

Hundreds of wells were drilled in up-faulted structural traps within North East trending thrust ridges which some of it are dry. The interpretation of these reservoirs was established as a series of four turbidite fans from Upper Miocene to Pleistocene. Yet, no correlation was found between the same fan in different locations with regards to geometry, thickness and mineral composition. This research studied over 50,000 sqkm of 3D seismic surveys, over 100 wells with different sets of logs including image logs, cores from two wells and bathymetric images. Normal seismic structural interpretation was conducted and seismic attribute of the turbidite fans were analysed. Seabed morphology was examined using bathymetry surveys and 3D seismic. The deepwater sediments type and depositional environment were investigated using core and log data.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The geometry of the oil prone sand reservoir bodies and heterolithic sand bodies within the deepwater fields was found to be of three types: North East trending narrow sand channels and turbiditic channel levees in the Southwest area of deepwater offshore Sabah,North East trending confined turbidite sand bodies bounded by elevated structural ridges south and south east of type 1,Deepwater fan system composed of channel sand, levee turbidites and local and regional MTD to the North East of type 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This new understanding of the source and sediment supply of the deepwater fields Northwest (NW) Sabah explains the geometry, distribution and lack of correlation within the Miocene sediments.

These compounds are considered a priority contaminant due to their toxicity to aquatic life and effects on human health. The presence of phenols even at low concentrations generates flavour and odour in drinking water. Due to the molecular stability and solubility of phenols in water, their removal by conventional water treatment methods is inefficient. However, adsorption with granular activated carbon (GAC), after conventional filtration with sand and anthracite, is an efficient technique for the reduction of organic compounds such as phenols. This paper studied the effect of applying double filtration to the reduction of phenols present in the filtered water of a conventional drinking water treatment plant, using two types of GAC (vegetable and mineral) and three GAC:Sand configurations (100:00; 00:100; 50:50). The configurations with GAC showed an efficient reduction of turbidity, organic matter indicator variables (UV254 absorbance and total organic carbon) and phenols, the mineral GAC being the most efficient GAC.</jats:p>",

Frequency analysis of D = 1-, 7-, 14-, 30-, 90- and 273-day low flows calculated from the daily flow time series of each stream gauge was performed. Weibull (W2), Gamma (G2), Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and Log-Normal (LN2) are selected among the 2-parameter probability distribution functions together with the Weibull (W3), Gamma (G3) and Log-Normal (LN3) from the 3-parameter probability distribution function family. Selected probability distribution functions are checked for their suitability to fit each D-day low flow sequence. LN3 mostly conforms to low flows by being the best-fit among the selected probability distribution functions in three out of four hydrological basins while W3 fits low flows in one basin. With the use of the best-fit probability distribution function, the low flow-duration-frequency curves are determined, which have the ability to provide the end-users with any D-day low flow discharge of any given return period.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper considers a manufacturer with a two-station make-to-stock (MTS) and make-to-order (MTO) serial production system. The MTS facility processes a single type of raw material and provides these materials for the MTO facility. The facility in the second stage produces end items using the material from the order of firms. The materials processed by the MTS facility are either stocked for production in the second stage or consumed to satisfy exogenous demand from the material market. Revenues are generated in each stage by satisfying the material demands and the end item demands, respectively. The manufacturer can either accept or reject some of the exogenous material demands according to the status of the system and the rejected exogenous material demands incur no penalty. The orders of firms can be rejected with penalty. Holding costs are incurred for the materials and the end items in inventory at each stage. Demand processes and production times of the component and the end item are stochastic. The set of decision epochs in our model corresponds to the epochs of customer order and material demand arrivals, MTO production completion, and material process completion. At each decision epoch, the manufacturer determines whether or not to process materials. An the epochs corresponding to a customer order arrival or a material demand arrival, a decision must be made whether to accept or reject it. This paper studies a joint order admission, demand control, and material process rate control policy which maximizes the manufacturer’s profit. Using the Markov decision process model, we investigate the structural properties of the optimal policy using a numerical example. The numerical investigation indicates that the optimal policy can be defined by the monotone stitching curves. Specifically, the optimal policy will accept more customer orders as material inventory increases and accepts fewer material demands as the number of outstanding customer orders increases. Furthermore, it is more profitable to increase the material production rate as the number of outstanding customer orders increases. We also examine the impact of the material process rate control option on the manufacturer’s profit. The study confirms that the material processing policy with a controllable production rate has a great percentage improvement in the average profit over the one with a fixed production rate. The study also show that the performance improvement due to using the controllable production rate rather than the fixed one is more prominent for the cases with a lower MTO customer arrival rate, a lower unit MTO sales revenue, a lower MTO production rate, a lower unit material sales revenue or a lower material holding cost. It is also observed that the impact of the material demand rate on the performance difference between the policies with a controllable production rate and a fixed one can vary depending on the value of other parameters.</jats:p>",

The energy sector is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than any other sector. This has raised concerns about the consequences of the high consumption of non-renewable resources and increased the search for renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaic solar energy, enable diversification of the global energy system. In this study, a comparative environmental analysis was performed for a heat pump utilized for dehumidification and heating purposes. The carbon footprints associated with two different scenarios for the supply of electricity to a heat pump were calculated. The first scenario used electricity from the national electric grid (Brazilian electricity mix), and the second scenario used electricity from a photovoltaic solar energy system connected to the grid. Photovoltaic solar energy presented a considerable environmental advantage in comparison to the direct use of electricity from the grid, with a reduction of approximately −207.88 kg CO2-eq/year. The use of cleaner energy sources, such as photovoltaic solar energy, significantly contributes to a reduction of the carbon footprint, and herein a significant potential for the mitigation of climate change was demonstrated.</jats:p>",

This study aims to fill this gap by providing a nationwide inventory of AUF and local water resource, and assessing their roles in securing water supply across the 2,099 8‐digit hydrologic unit code watersheds in the conterminous United States (CONUS). We investigated the effects of river hydraulic connectivity, climate variability, and water withdrawal, and consumption on water availability and water stress (ratio of demand to supply) in the past three decades (i.e., 1981–2010). The results show that 12% of the CONUS land relied on AUF for adequate freshwater supply, while local water alone was sufficient to meet the demand in another 74% of the area. The remaining 14% highly stressed area was mostly found in headwater areas or watersheds that were isolated from other basins, where stress levels were more sensitive to climate variability. Although the constantly changing water demand was the primary cause of escalating/diminishing stress, AUF variation could be an important driver in the arid south and southwest. This research contributes to better understanding of the significance of upstream–downstream water nexus in regional water availability, and this becomes more crucial under a changing climate and with intensified human activities.</jats:p>",

Several causes of significant drop in food availability in Cracow are discussed: isolation of the city and fortress from the natural food import areas, inconsistent policy of civil and military authorities, and inefficiency of the intraurban food production. However, the decrease in the food supply was visible not only in the falling imports but also in the deterioration of staples’ quality. Both processes had a critical impact on the consumption levels, resulting in the drop of approximately 75 percent in the meat consumption. Finally, the article is intended to contribute significantly to the understanding of how Cracovians’ standard of living changed in wartime with some references to the situation in other European cities. </jats:p>",

The Final Rule prohibits geographic disparities in access to organs, but the current kidney allocation system does not account for potential supply variations based on disease burden and other population characteristics within DSAs. As such, regions with traditionally high rates of comorbid disease, such as the Gulf States region, may be disadvantaged if local supply is limited.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold>\n            Using data from the 2016 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings, the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients public reports, and the United States Renal Data System, we compared comorbid disease prevalence, rates of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and expected organ donation rates by Gulf States location.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>\n            Prevalence of African American ethnicity, diabetes, fair/poor self-rated health, physical inactivity, food insecurity, and uninsurance were higher among DSAs in the Gulf States region vs. non-Gulf States (Table). Conversely, the prevalence of non-Hispanic White ethnicity, college education, and median household income were higher among non-Gulf States. The rate of ESRD varied by DSA, ranging from &lt; 162 cases per 100,000 to &gt; 225 cases per 100,000 (Figure). Median rate of ESRD was 214.4 per 100,000 among DSAs in the Gulf States, vs. 187.1 per 100,000 in the non-Gulf States (p=0.003). Expected rate of organ donation per 100 eligible deaths was 71.1 in Gulf States and 75.4 in non-Gulf States (p=0.01).\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold>\n            Higher rates of ESRD were observed in the Gulf States region, suggesting a greater need for organs than non-Gulf States. However, fewer donors were estimated in Gulf States, likely due to high comorbid disease burden, compared to non-Gulf States. These data suggest the need to examine allocation policy to prevent geographic disparities in access to deceased donor transplantation.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"g1808.jpeg\"/>\n          </jats:p>",

The effects of exogenous sugars on the uptake, transportation, and assimilation of nitrate were studied with vitro grown pak choi. The optimal levels of glucose and sucrose for pak choi growth were 25 and 15 μM, respectively, which led to an increase in pak choi biomass by 18 and 25%, respectively. The uptake and N contribution of nitrate in pak choi grown under optimal glucose levels were significantly lower than those in pak choi grown without glucose. The optimal levels of both glucose and sucrose decreased the active nitrate uptake in roots. However, the optimal glucose level decreased the nitrate transportation to shoots by reducing the <jats:italic>NRT1.1</jats:italic> expression, while enhancing the nitrate assimilation ability by increasing the activities of nitrate reductase (NR) and glutamine synthetase (GS) and the gene expression of <jats:italic>Gln1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Gln2</jats:italic> as compared to the pak choi grown under optimal sucrose level. Under optimal glucose levels, the nitrate content of pak choi decreased by 37%, improving its edible quality in the mixed nitrogen. We recommend supplying pak choi with optimal levels of exogenous glucose to reduce its nitrate content, and thus improve its edible quality.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Soil degradation may amplify these impacts substantially and thus hamper crop production further. We quantify biophysical consequences and bracket uncertainty of +2°C warming on calories supply from 10 major crops and vulnerability to soil degradation in Europe using crop modeling. The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model together with regional climate projections from the European branch of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO‐CORDEX) was used for this purpose. A robustly positive calorie yield change was estimated for the EU Member States except for some regions in Southern and South‐Eastern Europe. The mean impacts range from +30 Gcal ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the north, through +25 and +20 Gcal ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in Western and Eastern Europe, respectively, to +10 Gcal ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the south if soil degradation and heat impacts are not accounted for. Elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and increased temperature are the dominant drivers of the simulated yield changes in high‐input agricultural systems. The growth stimulus due to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> may offset potentially negative yield impacts of temperature increase by +2°C in most of Europe. Soil degradation causes a calorie vulnerability ranging from 0 to 50 Gcal ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> due to insufficient compensation for nutrient depletion and this might undermine climate benefits in many regions, if not prevented by adaptation measures, especially in Eastern and North‐Eastern Europe. Uncertainties due to future potentials for crop intensification are about 2–50 times higher than climate change impacts.</jats:p>",

The aim of this article is to develop a method for managing the production line where it is possible to produce an entire spectrum of products without reconfiguring the production line. An illustrative example is the production of fruit yoghurt of various types. The entire life cycle of the product is monitored and documentation of all relevant raw material data is carried out through the production process all the way to product packaging where each product is specifically marked with QR code. A special technique for deciding on optimum maintenance of the production line has been introduced and a multi-criteria decision model has been developed using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method where it is possible to achieve a high degree of minimization of maintenance costs. In this work, a fuzzy-based multi-criteria decision making methodology is developed for conceptual design evaluation in the cost reduction in maintenance of mass customization process. For the purposes of monitoring the production process itself, a LabVIEW application was created in the form of a SCADA system. </jats:p>",

However, a large body of current forecasting studies neglect the application of experts’ interval knowledge where experts are expected to be more competent, considering that humans do much better in fuzzy calculation like interval estimation than in accurate computation like point estimation. To fill in this gap, this paper first proposes a novel forecasting paradigm incorporating interval knowledge generated by a Delphi-based expert system into the SARIMA and SVR models. For validation purposes, the proposed paradigm is applied to several representative seaports from the top three dynamic economic regions in China. The empirical results clearly show that interval knowledge, following the proposed paradigm, significantly improves the forecasting performance. This finding implies that the proposed forecasting paradigm has the good potential to be an effective method for sharpening the statistical models for container throughput forecasting. </jats:p>",
