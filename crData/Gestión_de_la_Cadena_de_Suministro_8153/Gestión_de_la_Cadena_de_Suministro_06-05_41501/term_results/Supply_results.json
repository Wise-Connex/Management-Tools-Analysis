      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Insulin production in pancreatic β cells is stepped up in tandem with glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Calcium, which triggers secretion, stimulates the calpain-dependent cleavage of islet cell autoantigen 512 (ICA512), a catalytically inactive member of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase family that is associated with secretory granules. The cleaved cytosolic fragment (ICA512-CCF) translocates to the nucleus, where it stimulates insulin gene transcription. Mziaut\n            <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>\n            stimulated rat insulinoma INS-1 cells with glucose and a depolarizing concentration of KCl and found that a calpain inhibitor attenuated the increase in pro-ICA512 abundance seen after 2 hours of stimulation followed by 4 hours of incubation in glucose-free saline. Moreover, cells expressing an ICA512-CCF-GFP fusion protein showed increased abundance of endogenous\n            <jats:italic>ICA512</jats:italic>\n            mRNA and pro-ICA512, as well as increased abundance of mRNA encoding other components of secretory granules. ICA512-CCF-GFP expression enhanced the nuclear abundance of total and phosphorylated STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription), and glucose only enhanced the growth-hormone dependent nuclear accumulation of STAT5b in cultured pancreatic islets if they expressed ICA512. Both coimmunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis indicated that ICA512 bound to STAT5b; moreover, a fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of ICA512 inhibited the in vitro dephosphorylation of STAT5. ICA512-CCF-GFP enhanced STAT5-dependent transcriptional activity, and STAT5b knockdown led to a decrease in pro-ICA512 abundance. The E3 SUMO ligase PIASy bound to and sumoylated ICA512; PIASy inhibited STAT5-dependent transcriptional activity and an in vitro assay indicated that sumoylation of ICA512 decreased its binding to STAT5. Thus, the data define a retrograde pathway involving STAT5 through which ICA512 regulates production of secretory granule components.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            H.

We demonstrate that a suitably specified q-theory model (including residential land values as well as construction costs) explains intended housing starts. Few prior studies have found significant land price effects, due either to their omission or (possibly) to incorrect data definition (use of agricultural rather than residential land values).  We examine the interaction of supply responsiveness and price adjustment following demand shocks, using a new panel dataset covering 53 quarters across 73 regions of New Zealand. Regions with high supply responsiveness have relatively small price spikes following demand shocks, consistent with a rational response that limits house price jumps in regions with strong supply responses.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Using nutrient concentrations on neutral density surfaces in the Southern Ocean and climatological winds, both of which are fairly well constrained, we have estimated the long‐term average of net export from the upper ocean (i.e., the net supply of nutrients in Circumpolar Deep Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water to the surface layer) over the whole of the Southern Ocean south of the wind stress maximum at an average latitude of 50°S. We calculate net new production (equivalent to export production) values of 51 ± 3 Tmol Si yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and 14 ± 3 Tmol N yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. The latter is equivalent to 1.1 ± 0.2 Pg C yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> when scaled with the Redfield ratio of C to N. These values are in good agreement with recent observational and modeling estimates and are reasonably in line with inverse model calculations. Interpolating the high‐quality data from meridional World Ocean Circulation Experiment sections onto the neutral density surfaces revealed remarkable constancy of nutrient concentrations at all longitudes and depths below about 340 ± 100 m, which we call the surface‐influenced depth. This indicates that isopycnic stirring by eddies in the Southern Ocean is efficient at homogenizing nutrient concentrations and removing any signature of remineralization. The large depth of the surface‐influenced depth, over twice the winter mixed layer depth, also indicates that eddies must be responsible for transferring nutrient deficits resulting from drawdown in the surface layer across the pycnocline to several hundred meters deep.</jats:p>",

Using SPR, we were able to monitor in real-time the hybridization between oligonucleotide or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated probes and target single-stranded PCR products obtained by using as substrates DNA isolated from normal or transgenic soybean and maize. This procedure allows a one-step, nonradioactive detection of GMOs. PCR-generated probes are far more efficient in detecting GMOs than are oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes. This is expected to be a very important parameter, because information on low percentage of GMOs is of great value. Determination of the ability of SPR-based analysis to quantify GMOs should be considered a major research field for future studies, especially for the analyses of food supplies.</jats:p>",

The methodology is necessary to find all possible conduits from origin to destination, including points where product may cross over between various logistics systems. The approach is applied to the bulk and container system with disconnects (elevators, ports) serving as the demarcation points. The pathways from supplier to end‐user must be identified prior to application of classification and costing techniques.

Mapping the flow of the goods through logistical systems provides visibility as to where costs are incurred and how they are to be assigned to the supplier or customer. An improperly assigned variable in the early stages of a supply/demand chain reduces accuracy of subsequent calculations.

The paper attempts to make this point by suggesting that, while supply chain management is to a degree customer‐focused, the emphasis is on efficiency. Management concern is cost‐led and attempts to provide an adequate level of service. The danger here is that customers may be “aggregated” or fitted into categories that appear to be nearly relevant. Thus the link between supplier relationship management and customer relationship management is tenuous. By contrast the demand chain approach is a broader view of relationship management, taking a view that supplier and customer relationship management overlap, and that effective management is to integrate the two. If this is achieved, it results in bringing often conflicting objectives more closely together.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>Contrasting the demand chain approach as a broader view of relationship management, and taking the view that effective management is to integrate the two.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study a single-product setting in which a firm can source from two suppliers, one that is unreliable and another that is reliable but more expensive. Suppliers are capacity constrained, but the reliable supplier may possess volume flexibility. We prove that in the special case in which the reliable supplier has no flexibility and the unreliable supplier has infinite capacity, a risk-neutral firm will pursue a single disruption-management strategy: mitigation by carrying inventory, mitigation by single-sourcing from the reliable supplier, or passive acceptance. We find that a supplier’s percentage uptime and the nature of the disruptions (frequent but short versus rare but long) are key determinants of the optimal strategy. For a given percentage uptime, sourcing mitigation is increasingly favored over inventory mitigation as disruptions become less frequent but longer. Further, we show that a mixed mitigation strategy (partial sourcing from the reliable supplier and carrying inventory) can be optimal if the unreliable supplier has finite capacity or if the firm is risk averse. </jats:p><jats:p> Contingent rerouting is a possible tactic if the reliable supplier can ramp up its processing capacity, that is, if it has volume flexibility. We find that contingent rerouting is often a component of the optimal disruption-management strategy, and that it can significantly reduce the firm’s costs. For a given percentage uptime, mitigation rather than contingent rerouting tends to be optimal if disruptions are rare. </jats:p>",

Organizations that effectively collaborate with their supply chain partners position themselves for success in 21st-century markets.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most cities rely on firm water supply capacity to meet demand, but increasing scarcity and supply costs are encouraging greater use of temporary transfers (e.g., spot leases, options). This raises questions regarding how best to coordinate the use of these transfers in meeting cost and reliability objectives. This paper combines a hydrologic–water market simulation with an optimization approach to identify portfolios of permanent rights, options, and leases that minimize the expected costs of meeting a city's annual demand with a specified reliability. Spot market prices are linked to hydrologic conditions and described by monthly lease price distributions which are used to price options via a risk‐neutral approach. Monthly choices regarding when and how much water to acquire through temporary transfers are made on the basis of anticipatory decision rules related to the ratio of expected supply to expected demand. The simulation is linked with an algorithm that uses an implicit filtering search method designed for solution surfaces that exhibit high‐frequency, low‐amplitude noise. This simulation‐optimization approach is applied to a region that currently supports an active water market, with results suggesting that temporary transfers can reduce expected water supply costs substantially, while still maintaining high reliability. Also evaluated are trade‐offs between expected costs and cost variability that occur with variation in a portfolio's distribution of rights, options, and leases.</jats:p>",

Bangladesh is faced with the worst arsenic contamination of groundwater in the world, with an estimated 35 to 77 million people at risk of exposure to drinking arsenic-contaminated tubewell water. Lack of appropriate technologies has complicated and inhibited mitigation initiatives. This paper discusses the data obtained during efforts made to develop technologies for safe water supply by the Government of Bangladesh and its national and international partners. It is expected that the information will contribute towards development of appropriate technologies for water supply for millions of people in Bangladesh and other countries.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>About 95% of Bangladesh's rural population drinks tubewell water. Both arsenic removal and alternative technologies were widely promoted for water supply in these areas. The government and its national and international development partners developed various arsenic mitigation technologies for water supply, but most of the arsenic removal technologies were promoted without sound testing and showed poor, questionable and/or confusing performance in real situations. Also, use of most of the arsenic removal technologies was discontinued after a few to several months of installation. Concerns about the microbiological contamination of safe feed water during treatment were noted in arsenic removal options, in addition to high costs, efficiency, social and/or other problems. The 2004 National Policy for Arsenic Mitigation and its Implementation Plan stated a need for access to safe drinking water for all through alternative water technologies while arsenic removal technologies are developed and promoted after specified verification.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The national policy specified and widely promoted alternative options such as improved dugwells, safe tubewells, pond sand filters, rainwater harvester and piped water systems from arsenic-safe water sources. A few of the promoted alternative options showed poor functional and social performance, in addition to supplying microbiologically contaminated water. Arsenic-safe shallow tubewells, deep tubewells and piped water systems may be regarded as appropriate technologies under the existing conditions when the performance of the arsenic removal and alternative water technologies were compared. There are constraints in promoting those three water technologies in various hydrogeological conditions throughout the county. A wide range of appropriate technologies needs to be developed and promoted, and the issue of how to deal with the existing millions of arsenic-contaminated tubewells also needs to be considered. Research and development of sound sciencebased appropriate technologies are urgently recommended for effective realization of the Millennium Development Goal for safe water.</jats:p>",

This result suggests that buyers temper their specific investments to the degree of joint effort according to the information that is obtained in the network. This implies that coordinating collaborative joint efforts with suppliers is more than just buying well. The degrees of trust, specific investments and the information from the network have managerial implications for the coordination of a buyer‐supplier relationship.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Material Input stage represented as the biggest environmental loads factor, over 97%, in the Porosity Film's manufacturing process system. 10% of the environmental benefits resulted from the waste recycling during Slitting &amp; Winding manufacturing process. Both the manufacturing process and material of Porosity Film was relatively simple. Therefore, smaller material-input and higher recycling rates of wastes was recommended as a conclusion.\n</jats:p>",

We measured gas exchange and primary and secondary C metabolites in seedlings of two dominant aridland shrub species (<jats:italic>Prosopis flexuosa</jats:italic> [S America] and <jats:italic>P. glandulosa</jats:italic> [N America]) grown at ambient (350 ppm) or elevated (650 ppm) CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and nitrogen at two levels (low [0.8 mM] and high [8.0 mM]) and at either 1 : 1 or 3 : 1 nitrate to ammonia.

Elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> did not increase secondary metabolites (i.e., phenolics). For these important aridland species, the effects of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> are strongly influenced by nitrogen availability and to a lesser extent by the relative amounts of nitrate and ammonia supplied, which underscores the importance of both the amount and chemical composition of soil nitrogen in mediating the potential responses of seedling growth and establishment of aridland plants under future CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐enriched atmospheres.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:label/><jats:p>In 2004, a survey of the deans of U.S. and Canadian dental schools was conducted to determine the implant dentistry curriculum structure and the extent of incorporating implant dentistry clinical treatment into predoctoral programs. The questionnaire was mailed to the deans of the fifty‐six dental schools in advance of the ADEA Implant Workshop conference held in Arizona in November 2004. Out of the fifty‐six, thirty‐nine responded, yielding a response rate of 70 percent. Thirty‐eight schools (97 percent) reported that their students received didactic instruction in dental implants, while one school (3 percent) said that its students did not. Thirty schools (86 percent) reported that their students received clinical experience, while five schools (14 percent) reported that theirs did not. Four schools (10 percent) did not respond to this question. Fifty‐one percent of the students actually receive the clinical experience in restoring implants, with the range of 5–100 percent. Of those schools that provide clinical experience in restoring implants, four schools (13 percent) reported that it is a requirement for them, while twenty‐eight schools (88 percent) reported that it is not a requirement for them. Three schools (9 percent) did not respond. The fee for implants is 45 percent higher than a crown or a denture, with a range of 0–100 percent. Twenty‐nine schools (85 percent) indicated that they did receive free components from implant companies, while five schools (15 percent) did not. The conclusions of this report are as follows: 1) most schools have advanced dental education programs; 2) single‐tooth implant restorations are performed at the predoctoral level in most schools; 3) implant‐retained overdenture prostheses are performed at the predoctoral level in most schools; 4) there is no predoctoral clinical competency requirement for surgical implant placement in all schools that responded to the survey; 5) there is no predoctoral clinical competency requirement for implant prosthodontics in most schools that responded to the survey; 6) prosthodontic specialty faculty are often responsible for teaching implant prosthodontics at the predoctoral level; 7) periodontics and oral and maxillofacial faculty are commonly responsible for teaching implant surgery at the predoctoral level; 8) support from implant companies is common for dental schools, with most providing for implant components at discounted costs; and 9) there is a lack of adequately trained faculty in implant dentistry, which is a significant challenge in providing predoctoral students with clinical experience with dental implants.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
