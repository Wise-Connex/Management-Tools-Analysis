We also assessed the probable effects of climatic variability and climatic change upon the nation's water supply needs, policy, and design.</jats:p>",

In this paper a five equation model reflecting these decisions is developed and empirical estimates of the equations presented for Eastern and Western Canada and the United States. First, stocker calf prices are estimated as a function of steer and feed prices. Second, stocker calf prices are used in equations to explain adjustments in a) the breeding herd and b) cow slaughter. Then the breeding herd is combined with steer prices and feed cost or availability to explain heifer and steer slaughter and carcass weights. Parameters of the estimated equations indicate the flow of causality in beef supply response and differences in response among the three regions.</jats:p><jats:p>Le niveau de l'offre dans l'industrie du boeuf résulte de la suite de décisions prisent par les éleveurs et les propriétaires de pare d'engraissement. Cet article développe un modéle à cinq équations pour expliquer ces décisions; des estimés empirique de ces équations sont données pour l'Est et l'Ouest du Canada ainsi que pour les Etats‐Unis. Premiérement, les prix des veaux d'engrais sont calculés en fonction du prix des bouvillons et des aliments pour le bétail. Deuxiemement, on utilise le prix des veaux d'engrais dans des équations qui expliquent les changements dans a) le troupeau de reproduction et b) l'abbatage des vaches. Ensuite, le troupeau de reproduction est combiné avec le prix des bouvillons et les coúts ou disponibilité des aliments pour le bétail pour expliquer les abattages et poids des carcasses des bouvillons et des génisses. Les paramétres des équations ainsi evaluées démontrent la suite des réactions de cause a effet de l'offre dans l'industrie du boeuf, ainsi que les différentes réactions entre les trois regions.</jats:p>",

The uptake characteristics of these germlings were studied in detail assuming the simultaneous operation of two uptake systems, one of low affinity and one of high affinity. The Km of the low-affinity system was constant after growth at phosphate concentrations greater than 1 mM but became progressively lower as the concentration was reduced below 1 mM. In contrast, the Km of the high-affinity system was independent of the phosphate concentration of the growth medium. The Vmax of each system was highest after growth at low phosphate concentrations. As the phosphate concentration was increased to a maximum of 100 mM, the Vmax of the low-affinity system fell gradually, whereas that of the high-affinity system at first fell rapidly but then reached a constant minimum value at concentrations of 2.5 mM and higher. The differences in the kinetic parameters fully account for the constancy of uptake rate shown by the germlings.</jats:p>",
