      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organized co‐operation between Swedish research libraries dates back to\nthe end of the nineteenth century, when work began on the Swedish union\ncatalogue. In 1990, Sweden, with 6,127 requests per 100,000 population,\nwas the most interlending intensive country in Europe. However, the\ndecentralization of higher education has focused attention on local\nservices rather than national co‐operation. To meet the threat of\nfragmentization, a system of national resource libraries has been\ndeveloped, administered by the Royal Library′s Office for National\nPlanning and Co‐ordination (BIBSAM). The tradition of co‐operation is\ncommon to the Nordic countries, Iceland, owing to its small size, taking\na rather unique position. Legal deposits provide access to the national\nimprint; interlibrary lending is used extensively for foreign\npublications; the union catalogues have been automated; and different\ntypes of central library system have been developed, Sweden being\nexceptional with regard to the extent of funding. The idea of planning\nacquisitions on a Nordic basis, introduced by the middle of the 1950s in\nthe so‐called Scandia Plan, proved completely unrealistic.</jats:p>",

The econometric assessment, carried out with a cohort approach to labour supply, shows that Italian female participation rates react well to the variables belonging to both the neoclassical versions of models — with the exception of the version regarding intertemporal choices — and the Keynesian ones. Both in terms of testing for the selection of alternative regression models, such as those for non‐nested hypotheses and for selection of regressors, and of “internal” investigation within the estimated models, the results obtained are not without ambiguity. They therefore leave open the question as to which theory can explain labour supply in the most significant and appropriate way.</jats:p>",

Growth of the industry is attributed to increasing affluence of the population and leisure time. Increasing awareness of the importance of the environment will further undergird future industry growth. A survey sample of 140 landscape firms located in Georgia yielded 137 usable questionnaires. Four equations representing the statistical relationships between the four types of landscape services 1) design, 2) installation, 3) maintenance, 4) seasonal color and independent variables representing firm characteristics were specified and estimated using logit procedure. A surveyed firm was more likely to supply landscape design services if it also supplied pruning services, landscaping was its main business activity, and the firm was located outside the Atlanta metropolitan area (AMA). The installation service supply was less likely to be among a firm's services if the firm was located within the Atlanta metro area but more if it purchased plants from other sources, and the firm practiced subcontracting. Maintenance services were impacted positively by the supply of pruning but negatively by fertilization services and location in metropolitan Atlanta. Firms in which landscaping was the main business activity and accounted for an increasing share of revenue were more likely to include seasonal color among services supplied.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With international refining industries facing a number of challenges in the near future, it seems clear that those who survive will be ones with the ability to turn serious problems into real opportunities. In the U.S. refining industry, challenges such as slow growth in product demand, increasing reliance on imported raw materials, and continued exposure to offshore exporting refineries will have critical effects on the ability of the industry to capitalize on available opportunities. Other challenges include the ability to tolerate continued declines in crude oil quality and the serious monetary questions related to compliance with environmental legislation, including air, soil, and water clean-up. This paper presents the challenges which the U.S. refining industry faces over the coming years, and seeks to address those issues which will impact the success or failure of the industry as a whole. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper begins with a focus on the demand for U.S. petroleum products, encompassing brief historical data and forecasts of demand for the next few years. Closely related to demand is the subject of U.S. refinery operations, including product import and yield patterns. In this vein, the paper offers forecasts of crude runs to stills, as well as forecasts of capacity changes. </jats:p><jats:p> Because profitability of U.S. refineries is affected by raw material costs, the paper next probes the possibilities resulting from world crude oil price fluctuations, considering the reemergence of Iraq as a market player. Forecasts of profit margins for U.S. refiners in 1998 are also offered. </jats:p><jats:p> Turning to crude oil supplies and qualities, the paper examines the downward trend of U.S. crude oil production, providing a forecast of the decline by 1998. An associated trend, that of U.S. crude oil imports, is also evaluated, with a discussion of the origins of these imports included. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper then presents a brief discussion of the principal recipient of Canadian crude oil exports, the U.S. Midwest (PADD II), encompassing statistics for refinery runs and deliveries of crudes. Volumes of Canadian crude exported to the region are also presented, as well as crude oil qualities in the region. </jats:p><jats:p> Finally, heavy crude oil prices are examined because of the degradation of average crude oil qualities consumed by U.S. refiners. Spreads between light and heavy crudes are contemplated, with a forecast for the current-dollar WTI/Maya price spread provided. </jats:p>",

Despite advances in technique. it is not clear whether further refinement in this direction is worthwhile for policy purposes. It may be that no further amount of statistical adjustment of inadequate data will increase understanding, and that better data is simply necessary to add to our knowledge. But rarely is sufficient credit paid to new forms of data. In short, econometric technique is emphasized to the neglect of data innovation, as if new data were merely lying about waiting for an ingenious suggestion for use. This paper surveys advances of the last twenty five years in estimating labour supply for policy purposes with a view towards appreciating the relative contribution of both improvements in econometric technique as well as developments of new data.</jats:p><jats:p>After briefly detailing the key parameters which economists have sought to estimate, we describe the early ‘first generation’ research (circa 1970), which is plagued by problems of unobservable variables, measurement errors, truncation and selectivity bias, and non linear budget constraints. ‘Second generation’ research constitute attempts to resolve one or more of these difficulties, and the respective contribution of econometric technique and new data is acknowledged and assessed, including the contribution of data generated by large scale social experiments in which participants are randomly assigned to different guaranteed income plans and their labour supply behaviour measured.</jats:p>",

An iron formation is a stratigraphic unit which is composed largely of ironstone. The solutes which have precipitated to become ironstone have dissolved from the Earth's surface, from the upper crust, e.g. the basaltic layer of oceanic crust, or from deeper within the Earth. Genetic modellers generally choose between surficial weathering, e.g. soil formation, and hydrothermal fluids which have convected through the upper kilometre of oceanic crust. Most genetic modellers attribute cherty laminated iron formations to hydrothermal convection and noncherty oolitic iron formations to surficial weathering. However, both types of iron formations are attributable to the exhalation of fluids from a source region too deep for convection of seawater. Evidence for a deep source of ferriferous fluids comes from a comparison of ancient ironstone with modern ferriferous sediment in coastal Venezuela. A deep‐source origin for ironstone has wide‐ranging implications for the origins of other chemical sedimentary ores, e.g. phosphorite, manganostone, bedded magnesite, sedimentary uranium ore, various karst‐filling ores, and even petroleum. Preliminary study of a modern oolitic iron deposit described herein suggests that the source of iron and silica to iron formations may have been even deeper than envisioned within most hydrothermal convection models.</jats:p>",

The sediments were analysed by bulk and partition analysis in order to characterize changes in sediment geochemistry with water depth and with latitude, with particular reference to the effects of variation in supply and dissolution of biogenic material. The surface sediments are heterogeneous, ranging from carbonate or siliceous oozes to pelagic red clays. The elements in the sediments are variably partitioned into different sediment fractions. Examination of the sediments along the Transect has also provided a profile of the carbonate compensation depth, which shows it to deepen from approximately 4800 m at 16°S to approximately 5300 m at the equator.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The relationships between the bulk sediments and the sediment reducible fraction and associated Mn-Fe nodules has been examined. Variations in the interrelationships between the nodules and the sediment reducible fraction are ascribed to variations in element supply and early diagenetic reactions. A major decoupling of the relationship between nodules and associated sediment reducible fraction is observed in the north of the Transect at water depths close to the position of the CCD. Diagenetic reactions involving the destruction of organic matter which result in the reductive remobilization of Mn and the release of trace metals from labile material are thought to be important causes of this decoupling.</jats:p>",

The plants were grown for 13 days under these conditions of nitrate nutrition, and for another three days with the nitrate distribution reversed from 80:20 to 20:80.

For all treatments, between 60 and 82% of the absorbed label initially left the root, and between 25 and 55% of the label recovered in roots had been supplied (cycled) via the shoot. Labelling of xylem N at the end of the 24‐h labelling period ranged from to 36 to 46% indicating that a substantial fraction of the N in the xylem had been absorbed by the plant prior to labelling. It is concluded that cycling of N to roots, and cycling of N in the plant as a whole, is substantial also during N‐limited growth. N allocation to roots increased with external nitrate dose. An increased utilization of non‐translocated N as well as an increased translocation of N from the shoot contributed to this effect. Thus, the results indicate that increased external availability of N also increased the sink strength of the root for cycling N.</jats:p>",
