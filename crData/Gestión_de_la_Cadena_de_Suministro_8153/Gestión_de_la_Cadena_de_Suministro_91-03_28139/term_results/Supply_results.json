The flow uniformity is measured experimentally by means of a hot-wire anemometer mounted at the end of a mechanical arm attached to an X-Y table. In addition, a numerical simulation procedure has been developed to calculate the flow velocity below the ceiling filter by taking into account the influence of supply plenum geometry. In the specific system studied, the major cause of flow non-uniformity is the turning of the flow at the end of the supply plenum and the impingement of flow directly at the filter face. The numerical result shows that the flow non-uniformity can be decreased by increasing the size of the supply plenum or reducing the velocity of the airflow in the plenum.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent yean, due to a virtual unanimity about the critical\n      role of hmnan capital in economic development, increased efforts are\n      being made in the developing countries to eradicate illiteracy. Despite\n      a significant increase over time in the number of educational\n      institutions and the government's expenditure on education in Pakistan,\n      the performance of the education sector in terms of output has been at\n      best meagre. This non-correspondence between the growth in the\n      educational institutions and the resultant output implies that failure\n      to enlist the participation of the population in education can hardly be\n      attributed exclusively to an insufficiency of the schools. To the extent\n      that child schooling reflects parental capacity to invest in hmnan\n      capital formation, there is a need to reckon with factors bearing\n      parental decision regarding child schooling. This paper investigates\n      family's decision regarding child schooling through an assessment of the\n      determinants of child school-enro1ment, using choice theoretic\n      framework. The regression results are indicative of the influence of\n      household status, both economic and social, on the propensity to invest\n      in child schooling. A positive association between the household income,\n      parental education, and tenurial status as land-owner bear out the\n      importance of these factors in shaping the household's decision\n      regarding investment in human capital formation. The study also fmds\n      traces of the quantity-quality trade-off in family's preferences\n      regarding the nmnber of children, and it is found to be male-specific.\n      The most disturbing fmding of the study appears to be the predominance\n      of the influence originating from parental education. It is this\n      inter-generational transfer of human capital which needs more attention\n      as it also implies that illiteracy, and hence poverty, of the parents\n      gets transmitted to the off-spring. The analysis also brings out the\n      fact that the labour market hiring practices serve as an important\n      feedback to the household's human capital formation\n      behaviour.</jats:p>"

When phosphorus is limiting, the maximum extent to which mycorrhizal infection can improve plant performance is thus predicted to be a function of the phosphorus deficit of the plant, the difference between phosphorus demand and phosphorus supply. Phosphorus demand is defined as the rate of phosphorus absorption that would result in optimum performance of the plant as measured by growth rate, reproduction or fitness. The phosphorus supply is defined as the actual rate of phosphorus absorption under the prevailing conditions. Variation among plant taxa in morphological, physiological or phenological traits which affect either phosphorus demand or phosphorus supply (and thus phosphorus deficit) is predicted to lead to variation in potential response to mycorrhizal infection. The actual response to mycorrhizal infection is predicted to be a function of the increase in phosphorus uptake due to mycorrhizal infection and the phosphorus utilization efficiency of the plant. Demonstrated variability in responsiveness to mycorrhizal infection among plant taxa suggests that mycorrhizal fungi may play an important role in determining the structure of plant communities.</jats:p><jats:p>Mycorrhizal infection may alter the phosphorus deficit or phosphorus utilization efficiency independently from its direct effect on phosphorus uptake, making the prediction of response to mycorrhizal infection based on the traits of non‐mycorrhizal plants quite difficult. For example, infection may at times increase the rate of phosphorus accumulation beyond that which can be currently utilized in growth, reducing the current phosphorus utilization efficiency. Such momentary ‘luxury consumption’ of phosphorus may, however, serve a storage function and be utilized subsequently, allowing mycorrhizal plants ultimately to outperform non‐mycorrhizal plants.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:table-wrap position=\"anchor\">\n\n<jats:table frame=\"void\">\n<jats:col />\n<jats:col />\n<jats:col />\n<jats:thead>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:th />\n<jats:th>CONTENTS</jats:th>\n<jats:th />\n</jats:tr>\n</jats:thead>\n<jats:tbody>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td />\n<jats:td>Summary</jats:td>\n<jats:td>365</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>I.</jats:td>\n<jats:td>Introduction</jats:td>\n<jats:td>366</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>II.</jats:td>\n<jats:td>The concepts of phosphorus supply, phosphorus demand and phosphorus deficit</jats:td>\n<jats:td>367</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>III.</jats:td>\n<jats:td>Factors which affect phosphorus supply</jats:td>\n<jats:td>369</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>IV.</jats:td>\n<jats:td>Plant traits which affect phosphorus demand</jats:td>\n<jats:td>370</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>V.</jats:td>\n<jats:td>Variation in response to mycorrhizal infection</jats:td>\n<jats:td>372</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>VI.</jats:td>\n<jats:td>The effect of infection on inherent traits which influence phosphorus supply, phosphorus demand or phosphorus utilization efficiency</jats:td>\n<jats:td>378</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>VII.</jats:td>\n<jats:td>Mycorrhizal effects not related to phosphorus</jats:td>\n<jats:td>380</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>VIII.</jats:td>\n<jats:td>Conclusions</jats:td>\n<jats:td>380</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td />\n<jats:td>Acknowledgements</jats:td>\n<jats:td>381</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td />\n<jats:td>References</jats:td>\n<jats:td>381</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n</jats:tbody>\n</jats:table>\n\n</jats:table-wrap></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An artificial-membrane-bound glycerokinase chosen as a membrane-bound two-substrate-enzyme model has been used to separate two unequal compartments of a specially designed diffusion cell. An interesting feature is the asymmetry of compartments and the existence of a diffusion layer adjacent to only one face of the enzymic membrane. In such a situation the apparent enzyme activity and the product distribution in the system have been studied versus all the possibilities of combination of ATP and glycerol supply. Our approach has lead us to differentiate two different roles played by a diffusion layer adjacent to a permeable enzymic membrane. Depending on the spatial origin of the enzymic substrates (i.e. from which compartment they derive), the diffusion layer can play either the role of a passive additional resistance to that of the membrane or the role of a third compartment in which the reaction product can partially accumulate before splitting on both parts of the membrane. Our results mainly demonstrate that a membrane-bound enzyme activity and the resulting product distribution occurring in a compartmentalized system may be regulated by the cumulative effect due to the asymmetry in volumes of the compartments, the presence of a diffusion layer and the different possibilities of substrate supply. With the topography studied, which is close to that reported for many ‘in vivo’ situations, the product may be diffused lead to vectorial metabolism processes.</jats:p>",

The mechanism of the transport of phosphate in the intestine is via a proton symporter whilst in the parotid gland it is effected by a Na+ coupled transporter. In sheep fed a low‐P diet there is no change in the capacity of the parotid basolateral membrane to transport phosphate into the parotid end piece cells. This is in marked contrast to the response of the enterocyte brush‐border membrane, where there is a significant enhancement of the capacity of the membrane to transport phosphate. We conclude that in sheep the gut appears to play a major role in response to phosphate deprivation, by increasing the capacity to transport phosphate. This enhancement is not achieved by increases in the levels of circulating 1,25‐dihydroxycholecalciferol.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Gastric intubation was adopted to examine the effect of continuous nutrient supply on digestive development of the pig during the immediate post-weaning period. The 14 d-weaned animals were slaughtered at 3, 5 and 7 d post-weaning (3W, 5W and 7W respectively) and the suckled animals were slaughtered at 14 and 22 d of age (14SR and 22SR respectively). The weight of the pancreas (g/kg body-weight) was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) in the 5W and 7W groups, as was the weight of large intestine (g/kg) in all weaned groups (P &lt; 0.01) compared with sow-reared pigs. The stomach weight (g/kg) tended to be greater in the weaned groups. Weaning, in conjunction with a continuous nutrient supply, did not significantly alter the time-related changes in the weight of the small intestine (SI) or the SI mucosa, although both variables tended to be lowest in the 3W group. However, there was a 20% reduction in the protein content of the mucosa within the first 3 d post-weaning (P &lt; 0.01) which persisted during the 7 d experimental period. Lactase, (β-galactosidase; EC 3.2.1.23) activity (μmol/g protein and mol/d) of the 7W group was reduced to approximately 40% of the 22SR value. Hence, continuous nutrient supply may have delayed, but did not prevent, the loss of lactase activity at weaning. The activity of sucrase (sucrose-α-glucosidase; EC 3.2.1.48) was significantly higher in 22SR compared with 14SR animals. Sucrase activity in weaned pigs was intermediate to the values for sow-reared pigs whereas maltase (α-glucosidase; EC 3.2.1.20) and glucoamylase (glucan 1, 4-α-glucosidase; EC 3.2.1.3) were significantly increased in relation to their sow-reared counterparts. Continuous nutrient supply did not prevent the reduction in villous height and the crypt hypertrophy associated with weaning. The results of the present study suggest that there may be some degree of interaction between nutrient intake and gut development during the immediate post-weaning period but that there is also a component of the adaptive response which is independent of nutrient intake. They confirm the rapid substrate induction of the brush-border glucoamylases and indicate the importance of considering total as well as specific enzyme activity for satisfactory interpretation of changes in digestive function.</jats:p>",
