      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The recognised relationship between company performance and supply chain performance has prompted managers, practitioners and researchers alike to seek a better understanding of the performance of supply chains. To this end, many firms have adopted and implemented various supply chain practices and enhanced collaboration and more recently e-collaboration within supply chains.Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate how firms can enhance their supply chain performance through supply chain practices and supply chain e-collaboration.Method: A quantitative design was adopted in which a survey questionnaire was administered to a sample of 500 senior managers representing some 350 firms. A non-probability sampling employing convenience and purposive methods was used. A confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling technique were undertaken to assess the psychometric properties of the measurement scale and to test hypotheses using the path modelling technique.Results: The key findings of this study were as follows: Supply chain practice was found to have a strong positive and significant relationship with supply chain e-collaboration, while supply chain e-collaboration has a strong positive and significant influence on strategic information sharing. Strategic information sharing has a positive and significant influence on supply chain competence and supply chain performance. Supply chain e-collaboration has a positive and significant influence on supply chain competence, while supply chain competence was found to have a negative and insignificant influence on supply chain performance.Conclusion: This study concludes that firms can use supply chain practices to enhance their supply chain e-collaboration and supply chain performance. The study also provides a useful framework for analysing the relationship between supply chain practices, supply chain e-collaboration, strategic information sharing, supply chain competence and supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>This chapter details the formation of Republican Rome’s urban supply chains. As much of the city’s material even in later periods derived from Italy, the geography of supply emphasizes the Mid-Republican period, when the first stages of imperial conquest allowed Roman access to Italian quarries, forests, mines, and so forth. This discussion also serves to introduce various building materials referred to throughout the volume. Alongside reviewing the evidence for the supplies of stone, terracotta, metal, and wood to urban construction, the chapter considers the role of the Republican state in acquiring and working territories that provided such resources.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Despite being strategic, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have failed to fulfil their mandate. Supply chain performance is ineffective largely because of weak organisational culture.Objectives: To explore the extent to which organisational cultural factors have influenced the supply chain performance of SOEs, review the literature; effectiveness of attaining financial targets, customer satisfaction, internal business processes, learning and growth; time orientation on the supply chain metric of delivery. The supply chain metric of flexibility; profitability on cost reduction; ‘no ownership’ culture on decision-making; and the level of customer satisfaction.Method: A mixed-method was used. The population comprised managers, employees and clients of eight selected SOEs. Judgmental, random and convenience sampling were employed. Questionnaires and interviews were the research instruments and quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted. Findings are presented thematically, in line with the research questions.Results: SOEs were not meeting financial targets, not satisfying customers, poor internal business processes not attaining learning and growth targets. Organisational cultural variables were weak; affecting flexibility, no timely delivery of goods and services. Also influenced the behaviour of human resources and an indirect effect on customer satisfaction, cost-saving and profitability in the SOEs.Conclusion: The SOEs failed to meet financial, customer, learning and growth targets. The internal business processes were not effective. The culture did not promote efficiency. The study recommends that commitment of leadership on human behaviour is necessary for effective supply chain performance and strategy implementation. Constant environmental scanning, strategic alliances, rationalisation of remuneration and sound corporate governance are essential.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Rome’s building industry shows unprecedented and sustained energy starting in the early third century. The structures of labor that supported this building boom are detailed here using literary and epigraphic evidence. The collapse of forms of dependent labor by ca. 300 BCE coincided with the rise of an urban labor supply characterized by slave- and free-wage labor. We detect signs of significant demographic growth at Rome in this period, and much of this increase was owed to immigrating labor. On the one hand, an active slave market pushed labor to the capital; on the other hand, we see at Rome all the prerequisites for wage-labor, even without direct evidence for wages. It is argued that freely mobile workers formed some significant part of the expansion of the city’s labor supply. The epigraphic corpus relating to the city’s working population in this period also suggests a picture of urban workers of various personal statuses.</p>",

There is a strong and persisting influence of the economic cleavage on voting choices with little change after the 2008 financial crisis. There is also a growing importance of the cultural cleavage. In recent elections, the cultural cleavage outweighs the influence on the economic cleavage. The polarization of party positions on the cultural cleavage increases the influence of this cleavage, but the same pattern is not apparent for the economic cleavage. The salience of each cleavage also affects its weight in voting decisions. European voters and parties have realigned their positions so that both cleavages are now important for electoral choice. The analyses are based on the European Election Studies in 1979, 2009, and 2014.</p>",

Business and commerce have been revolutionised with this new wave that connects markets, empowers consumers and incentivises innovation. Internet of Things (IoT) deployed devices now capture information in the fields, in the factory, at the distribution centres and on the transport vehicles and containers, at both the point of purchase and ‘point of demand’, while people are defining the criteria and searching products to make purchasing decisions. These technologies hold the promise and are helping companies across industries to discover key insights about the needs and choices of customers through their interactions in an increasingly omnichannel world. It is not just consumer goods that are being marketed and sold over the Internet. All things and services through distributors, or direct from the manufacturer are being marketed and sold leveraging the Internet. Armed with these insights, companies are able to re-imagine their supply chains and create connected digital supply networks that are smarter and better at responding to customer demands. This paper explores the modern and collaborative relationship companies now share with their customers. It then identifies the need and, leveraging the SCOR framework, the steps to building a demand-driven digital supply network that can sense and respond to real time demand signals, and the implications of such a network on the overall business model and the future of the business. It will also suggest an evolution to SCOR ‘enterprise’ that extends the current supply chain reference framework to include other enterprise processes to break down the constraints of silo management functions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The importance of South African small businesses, especially retailers, in improving communities’ standards of living necessitates sound business strategies to survive and remain competitive. Selecting appropriate business strategies is cardinal for the sustainable development and growth of all types of businesses, including small businesses. The supply chain strategy defines how operations in the supply chain will support the overall competitive strategy and is orientated to promote either responsiveness or cost-efficiency. It is imperative that all inventory decisions be aligned with the orientation of the selected supply chain strategy.Objectives: The aim of this article was firstly to determine how small retailers operating within the boundaries of Soweto, a township in Gauteng, South Africa, manage their inventory decisions considering the orientation of the supply chain strategy; and secondly, to investigate whether retail industries differ in terms of inventory decisions.Method: A survey was conducted among 650 formal, independent small businesses operating within Soweto of which 556 were classified as retailers based on the Standard Industrial Classification. Structured interviewer-completed questionnaires were used to obtain quantitative data from owners or managers. Both descriptive and inferential analyses were performed to determine the orientation of the retailers’ supply chain strategy based on their inventory decisions relating to the average rate of purchasing inventory, the amount of inventory purchased, as well as the quality and variety of products offered to customers. Five hypotheses were formulated to determine whether a difference exists between six industry groups with regard to the management of inventory.Results: It was established that small township retailers predominantly manage their inventory decisions responsively. It was also concluded that differences exist in terms of how small township retailers manage their inventory based on the industry in which they operate. The results showed that retail hardware stores are focused on making inventory decisions more cost-efficiently than the other industry groups, whereas retail general stores are focused on making inventory decisions more responsively than the other industry groups.Conclusion: The owners or managers of small township retailers need to be educated in terms of inventory management decisions. This article can be used as an educational platform to show how small township retailers can identify the aligned inventory decisions for supporting a selected supply chain strategy orientation. Generally, small township retailers may maintain their competitive advantage if they align all business strategies to promote responsiveness. Since the industry in which small retailers operate influences inventory management decisions in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency, owners or managers must consider the specific industry in which they operate before making such decisions.</jats:p>"

STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects, students, and teachers occupy a privileged position in UK government education policy because of their economic importance, but are in short supply and/or reducing in proportion to the number of available opportunities. As with scientists, there appears to be a constant demand for more teachers in the United Kingdom and other developed countries. This chapter shows that whereas UK public spending has declined in real terms since the economic downturn of 2008 onwards, one area where policy-makers have claimed that spending has been sustained and even increased is encouraging the supply of new STEM graduates. The UK government proposals to develop the nation's scientific skills base largely lie in increasing the supply of young people into the STEM professions. Similarly, a whole range of policy initiatives have been proposed and tried to increase the supply of teachers. This chapter shows, however, the issue of shortages has yet to be effectively addressed.</p>",

This requires these ports to revise their strategic development to accommodate the resulting shifts in cargo flows to and from these strategic ports in conjunction with hinterland corridor development.Objectives: The purpose of this research was to understand the changing landscape of strategic SADC ports and develop future strategies with regard to liner shipping services.The main objective was to assess the future development needs of the SADC port system in relation to the cascading effect in liner shipping, linked to the development of hinterland corridors, identifying the limitations and opportunities of each port.Method: Descripto-exploratory research and analysis of secondary data were used. An extensive research of 552 sources (journal articles, research reports, books, newspaper and magazine articles and webpages) dating mostly from the year 2000 onwards were analysed.Results: Durban will remain the preferred container hub port for the foreseeable future if the port can increase its capacity and offer superior customer service in relation to competing ports in the region, such as Maputo, Walvis Bay and Ngqura. Durban is well adapted to accommodate the port and landside requirements resulting from the cascading effect. This is most evident in the depth of the port and port-side handling equipment. The findings confirm that the success of other SADC ports and corridors are subject to regional cooperation and integration without which the dominance of the port of Durban and the Maputo and North–South corridors will continue.Conclusion: The findings of the research indicate that Durban is ideally suited to develop further as a container hub port for the SADC region. This development is subject to a more competitive port landscape in the region as other ports such as Maputo, Walvis Bay and Ngqura improve their liner shipping service offering.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the operating performance implications of service quality and environmental sustainability in the context of logistics. Specifically, using the resource‐based view of the firm as the theoretical framework, we examine future operating performance of firms that won service quality and environmental sustainability awards in logistics between 2004 and 2013. Awardees include firms that are logistics service providers and firms that operate in other industries; in all cases, these awards recognize firms’ logistics capabilities. Our results reveal that firms’ service quality and environmental sustainability capabilities, as recognized by winning awards in the respective categories, are associated with improved operating performance during the 3‐year post‐award period. Additionally, the performance benefits associated with service quality awards are greater than those associated with environmental sustainability awards. Our analysis further shows that whereas environmental sustainability relates to better future operating performance by enhancing only sales growth, service quality is positively associated with enhanced sales growth as well as cost efficiency. Finally, our results also indicate that positive operating performance implications of these awards are not contingent on the industry competitive intensity or innovative intensity. Implications for research and practice are discussed.</jats:p>",

Supply chains management (SCM) has acknowledged a great deal of interest by researchers and practitioners. The primary objective of the current research paper is to examine the relationship between internal integration and sustainable supply chain performance. In addition to that, the study has focused on the mediating effect of supplier integration and customer integration in the relationship between key between internal integration and sustainable supply chain performance. The study focuses on manufacturing enterprises of UAE under subject investigation and its relationship with sustainability goals. A detailed literature has been reviewed critically to develop the hypothesis of the study. A questionnaire survey was adopted to collect data from supply chain managers of manufacturing companies. Smart PLS 3 (SEM) is used to analyze the collected data. The results of the study have shown a great deal of agreement with the proposed hypothesis. Analysis of the study is divided into two major parts. Part one is based on an outer model assessment in which reliability and validity were examined. The second part is based on an inner model assessment in which hypotheses were tested. The result of the study will be useful for policymakers and researchers in understanding the emerging role of environmental concerns in strategic management and operational management.Â Â Â </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The European Union has recently enacted the Conflict Minerals Regulation, introducing new transparency requirements for importers of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold from conflict-affected regions. Similar legislation has previously been enacted in the United States. The purpose of the new transparency requirements in both jurisdictions is to cut off funding for armed groups in conflict areas and thus reduce the suffering of the civil population, with particular reference to the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The criticism of the legislation centers on the costs to companies in the minerals supply chain. In this article it is argued that the costs to companies subject to the transparency requirements can be minimized with carefully crafted legislation. It is also concluded that progress in achieving the humanitarian objectives of the legislation is slower than expected, mainly due to the lack of participation in the transparency efforts by all actors in the supply chain. Successful transparency regulation has to be supported by a multitude of actors in the international community. Also, mineral supply chain transparency regulation in itself is unlikely to solve armed conflicts in resource-rich but poor countries. Such legislation only provides for one component in a multi-level approach including legislative, economic and political efforts by the international community.</jats:p>",

Many of the currently operating concrete plants have implemented systems that increase the quality of manufactured products, have expanded highly automated production lines and have clearly reduced wastes and energy consumption. However, one of the problems often encountered in the construction industry is the inefficient organization of logistics processes. Proper shipments planning of aggregates consisting of the selection of their appropriate quantity and the aggregate stock, corresponding to the needs of concrete plants should contribute to lowering costs. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out the optimization, the aim of which is to minimize costs, as well as to maximize the fulfillment of the degree of expected needs of concrete plants. This paper presents a model that allows purchase strategy optimization of aggregates with different grain size fraction. For research purposes, three separate aggregate stocks and five different concrete plants are considered.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Natural gas pipeline network system is a critical infrastructure connecting gas resource and market, which is composed with the transmission pipeline system, underground gas storage (UGS) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal demand. A methodology to assess the gas supply capacity and gas supply reliability of a natural gas pipeline network system is developed in this paper. Due to random failure and maintenance action of the components in the pipeline network system, the system can be in a number of operating states. The methodology is able to simulate the state transition process and the duration of each operating state based on a Monte Carlo approach. After the system transits to other states, the actual flow rate will change accordingly. The hydraulic analysis, which includes thermal-hydraulic simulation and maximum flow algorithm, is applied to analyze the change law of the actual flow rate. By combining the hydraulic analysis into the simulation of the state transition process, gas supply capacity of the pipeline network system is quantified. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty of market demand, the load duration curve (LDC) method is employed to predict the amount of demand for each consumer node. The gas supply reliability is then calculated by comparing the gas supply capacity with market demand. Finally, a detailed procedure for gas supply capacity and gas supply reliability assessment of a natural gas pipeline network system is presented, and its feasibility is confirmed with a case study. In the case study, the impact of market demand uncertainty on gas supply reliability is investigated in detail.</jats:p>",

To achieve this aim M3 as a proxy variable to the money supply, the banking sector loan volume as a proxy for the money demand has been dealt with. The study tested the causality relationship between variables using the Granger Causality Test and Error Correction Model. According to the results of the Granger Causality Test, in the long run, the direction of causality between the money supply and credit expansion is straightforward from the money supply to the credit extension. According to the findings of the Error Correction Model, there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between money supply and credit expansion in the short term. Credit expansion increases money supply.</jats:p>"

In fact, the theory of blockchain and technologies behind are more worthy to be discussed to bring revolution to nowadays business operation. In this paper, we conduct an interdisciplinary study on business logistics as well as the cutting edge information technologies. We discuss the ongoing projects of blockchain in business industry, and then we propose our assessment model and blockchain framework to seek an enhanced metric for delivery performance with real-time feature and higher accuracy. Based on the our analysis, we identify the shortcomings of traditional assessment on delivery performance in contemporary global supply chain management and we discuss the potential benefits brought by adoption of our proposed framework.</jats:p>",

Due to the particular climatic conditions, the problem of water supply in the island has always been strongly felt. Water management systems were therefore of vital importance in the organization of private and public spaces in antiquity. Methods of planning and construction became quite precise, as did systems for control and maintenance; their use and evolution over the centuries could be seen in relation to expansion of urban centers and to demographic increase, to higher urban living standards, to enlarge of production systems and, maybe, to climatic variations. The purpose of this article is to provide a comparative overview of the most significant urban areas of Sardinia during the Punic and Roman period. The description of water works (wells, cisterns, tanks, channels), of techniques of water usage, of construction technologies, also with regards on public buildings directly fed by them, will give a comprehensive framework regarding these fundamental types of structures.</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:\n<jats:list list-type=\"simple\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Engineering Water &gt; Water, Health, and Sanitation</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Human Water &gt; Water Governance</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Science of Water &gt; Water Extremes</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list>\n</jats:p>",

Finally, to observe the difference of the influences of housing prices on labor supply of different groups, it distinguishes between households with and without houses, young and old groups. &lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Local content requirements are often included in legislation or contracts. Such efforts may be constrained by low capacity of potential suppliers, low skills, and the general business environment. A number of extractive industry companies have introduced supplier development programmes that attempt to reduce the constraints and skill gaps. Government industrial policies on local content vary: some prescribe quantitative targets for local content, while others focus on improving skills and raising the capacity of domestic industry. Infrastructure built for extractive industries can often be used by other economic activities. Difficulties in finding suitable financing arrangements have, however, limited the number of successful multi-user extractive industry-related infrastructure projects.</jats:p>",

By including SCM paradigm and Information Technology (IT), companies aim to enhance their responsiveness and flexibility, and by changing their operations’ strategy, they attempt to improve their competitiveness. This study focuses on the organizational variable, IT capabilities, technological structure, and possible antecedents and their impact on Supply Chain Technology (SCT) implementation. This paper proposes a model to examine the way, which SCT implementation affects IT enabled Organizational Performance (OP). The data were achieved through the questionnaires, and then they were analysed by using Smart PLS 3 program. The data collected from 118 employees in IT sector of Iran’s customs administration provide strong support to the proposed research model. The results of this research showed that SCT implementation has a mediating effect on IT enabled OP improvement. Besides, the study revealed that IT capabilities have the most and organizational variable has the least influence on implementation of SCT. Based on other organization’s situations, they can use the suggested model with a little changes.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, the application of theories in studies that try to explain GSCM practices is not totally well established. The main objective of this study is to integrate GSCM practices with organizational theories underpinning for three contextual perspectives in order to propose a framework, which is able to guide research and analyses of value chain. This is a theoretical study based on a systematic search. Results indicated 427 practices and nine theories to explain such practices, which were structured in eleven constructs. Finally, a predictive structure was presented, aligning the constructs with the theories, contexts and main characteristics of each set of practices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Within the US military, when a soldier is injured on the battlefield, they may observe a US Army Medic submitting a nine-line medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) request which is executed by an Air Force para-jumper rescue team that evacuates them to a US Navy medical facility, where they are treated by a US Navy Corpsmen detailed to the US Marines. The injured soldier ultimately receives their care, thanks to a complex evacuation management system, that, if executed correctly, returns the soldier to duty with limited disruption to themselves, family and branch of service. This scenario is not uncommon, yet includes multiple layers of bureaucracy that goes unnoticed and is underpinned by an equally complex logistics system. Medical supplies and equipment used to treat soldiers originate from a number of locations and sources of supply. Historically, each branch of service has its own distinct medical logistics agency through whom all such requirements are identified, communicated and purchased. This paper is concerned with examining the importance of a Joint One MEDLOG Concept.</jats:p>"

However, the traditional scheme of film cooling is characterized by appearance of secondary vortex structures that destroy the coolant film. From the existing alternative schemes of film cooling, which allow protecting the turbine blades from influence of high temperatures, the scheme with triangular dimples has demonstrated good results in the stationary conditions. This cooling scheme was patented and tested in the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. In order to determine the feasibility of such a scheme, it is necessary to consider the effect of the blade rotation influencing the film cooling efficiency. The results are given towards theoretical investigation of the film cooling efficiency of this scheme under rotation conditions. The study was performed using the ANSYS CFX package using SST-turbulence model. The blowing ratio was varied from 0.5 to 2.0. Numerical simulation performed for rotation parameters corresponding to the dominant influence of the Coriolis force – 10, 100 rpm, and centrifugal forces – 3000, 5000 and 7000 rpm. Оn the basis of computer simulation, it has been shown that rotation does not affect weakly the average efficiency of film cooling at Coriolis force, but causes a peak displacement of local adiabatic efficiency, at rotation parameter of 7000 rpm, when there is a distortion of the flow lines.</jats:p>"

Aim. Uninterrupted transportation process is ensured by the highly dependable and safe power supply system of railway transport. In addition, the railway power supply system provides power to external consumers. A risk-oriented approach to railway transportation management requires an infrastructure risk management and safety system. The main purpose of risk management in this area is to improve the dependability and safety of railway infrastructure facilities [1, 2]. Additionally, given the growing numbers of intelligent information systems, as well as automated railway transportation management systems, the task of ensuring functional safety becomes very important. In most cases this problem is solved by introducing redundancy that is understood as an exceeding complexity of the system structure compared to the minimal values required for the performance of the specified task [3]. The simplest way of ensuring redundancy is by creating backup capabilities, particularly standby duplication within the system of functional units and components. In order to evaluate the safety of the railway transportation power supply systems it is required to calculate the functional safety indicators of their components and system as a whole taking into account the factor of redundancy. This approach will enable the optimal redundancy architectures and ensure compliance with the assigned level of general system safety. That requires taking into consideration the complex structure of the evaluated facilities: presence of diagnostics systems, right-side failures, wrong-side failures, as well as their random nature. The paper aims to develop an applied algorithm of calculation and prediction of functional safety indicators using the example of railway power supply systems that can be used in both manual and automated calculation.</jats:p><jats:p>Methods. The power supply system evaluated for functional safety indicators is, from the functional point of view, a sequence of function implementations, while the failures of its components are random and some of them cause hazardous events. In this case, system analysis commonly involves Markovian and semi-Markovian methods, as well as graph methods. The advantage of these methods consists in the capability to evaluate the functional safety indicators of complex systems that go into many states, which is also typical for railway power supply systems.</jats:p><jats:p>Result. This paper examines the application of graph semiMarkovian methods for calculation of stationary and non-stationary functional safety indicators for components of power supply systems taking into account redundancy and right-side failures. This algorithm allows calculating safety indicators using the example of power supply systems and includes a set of incremental actions aimed at constructing the state graph, calculation of the initial and intermediate graph factors. An example is provided of calculation of the functional safety indicators of a graph of a traction substation power transformer. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a closed-loop supply chain composed of dual-channel retailers and manufacturers, a dynamic game model under the direct recovery, and an entrusted third-party recycling mode of the manufacturer is constructed. The impact of horizontal fairness concern behavior is introduced on the pricing strategies and utility of decision makers under different recycling models. The equilibrium strategy at fair neutrality is used as a reference to compare offline retails sales. Research shows that in the closed-loop supply chain of dual-channel sales, whether in the case of fair neutrality or horizontal fairness concerns, the manufacturer’s direct recycling model is superior to the entrusted third-party recycling, and the third-party recycling model is transferred by the manufacturer. In the direct recycling model, the horizontal fairness concern of offline retailers makes two retailers in the positive supply chain compete to lower the retail price in order to increase market share. Manufacturers will lower the wholesale price to encourage competition, and the price will be the horizontal fairness concern coefficient, which is negatively correlated. In the reverse supply chain, manufacturers increase the recycling rate of used products. This pricing strategy increases the utility of manufacturers and the entire supply chain system compared to fair neutral conditions, while two retailers receive diminished returns. Manufacturers, as channel managers to encourage retailers to compete for price cuts, can be coordinated through a three-way revenue sharing contract to achieve Pareto optimality.</jats:p>"

While near-threshold computing is a promising technique to improve energy efficiency, optimal supply demands from logic core and on-chip memory are conflicting. In this paper, we perform static reliability analysis of 6T SRAM and discover the variance among different sizing configuration and asymmetric minimum voltage requirements between read and write operations. We leverage this asymmetric property in near-threshold processors equipped with voltage boosting capability by proposing an opportunistic dual-supply switching scheme with a write aggregation buffer. Our results show that proposed technique improves energy efficiency by more than 21.45% with approximate 10.19% performance speed-up.</jats:p>"

One of the horticultural commodities is the potato (Solanum tuberosum). Potatoes are widely used as ingredients in the light meal industry such as potato chips. Restaurants and fast food industry also use potatoes as the ingredients. Wonosobo regency is one of the areas in Java producing a lot of potatoes and the majority of the population work as farmers. The purpose of this research is to find out the network design of potato supply chain in Wonosobo regency in order to design a more effective and efficient one. This research uses the descriptive qualitative method and the processes of collecting data are observation, interview, and documentation. The results suggest that the current supply chain design of potatoes is from farmers, middlemen, retailers, and consumers. An alternative network design proposed is the farmers should channel the lower quality potatoes directly to the retailers. While another alternative is, for the good quality potatoes, the farmers should sell them to cooperative for export.  </jats:p>"

Various studies have been carried out on ISCM globally, with possible problems affecting competitiveness and effective customer service identified as nonintegration, ranging from internal processes to suppliers. This paper reviewed literature on the application of ISCM in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Manufacturing industry in Nigeria. This involved collecting, sorting, grouping and analysing of available papers to identify strengths and weaknesses and suggest the direction for future research. The review shows that, although some research has been conducted onISCM in the manufacturing industry, little has been done in the FMCG manufacturing industry globally, and in particular, ISCM is still in the initial stages of adoption in Nigeria. The aim of this review is to unearth the extent of application and implementation of ISCM in the FMCG industry in Nigeria, and advise on the status of ISCM and problems confronting its implementation and use. This paper posits that, based on the reviewed literature, there is a need for the FMCG manufacturing industry in Nigeria to implement ISCM, considering its importance as iterated by both academics and business managers. This review was carried out focusing on literature relating to ISCM in the FMCG Manufacturing industry and does not cover the entire manufacturing industry.  </jats:p>"

The main problems hindering the dynamic development of innovative activity of enterprises of thermal power industry in the region are considered. The hierarchy of the basic levels of infrastructure of heat power engineering of economic system is offered. For each level of heat power infrastructure of the region certain tasks providing the necessary level of efficiency of functioning of system have to be solved. One of the most important tasks of thermal power enterprises is the introduction of energy saving and innovative technologies, energy efficiency, analysis of the balance sheet structure, economically justified tariffs and the introduction of new mechanisms for the implementation of innovation and investment programs. The key objectives and principles for the effective functioning of the infrastructure of the power system. The key tasks of thermal power companies are their technical controlling and audit, allowing timely detection of defective areas, reducing energy efficiency in the industry and creating the possibility of risk situations that can cause damage to the organization. A limiting factor in the interactions between the elements of the infrastructure are the consumers of heat energy, which include industrial enterprises and enterprises of sphere of services, social services, state enterprises, marketing and management companies, private persons etc. An important condition for solving many of these problems in the infrastructure of heat power industry in the region is to improve the efficiency of its innovation and increase the responsibility of management for the state of process equipment and heating networks. The most important component of this increase is the formation of an innovative environment, as a result of which there is a transformation of the methods of organizing and managing the infrastructure of the heat power industry of the region, an update of the technological base, the introduction of advanced technologies in production and management is achieved.</jats:p>"

Accurate prediction of hydraulic jump energy dissipation is important in design of hydraulic structures. In the current study, hydraulic jump energy dissipation was assessed in channels with different shapes and bed conditions (i.e. smooth and rough beds) using the support vector machine (SVM) as an intelligence approach. Five series of experimental datasets were applied to develop the models. The results showed that the SVM model is successful in estimating the relative energy dissipation. For the smooth bed, it was observed that the sloping channel models with steps performed more successfully than rectangular and trapezoidal channels and the step height is an effective variable in the estimation process. For the rough bed, the trapezoidal channel models were more accurate than the rectangular channel. It was found that rough element geometry is effective in estimation of the energy dissipation. The result showed that the models of rough channels led to better predictions. The sensitivity analysis results revealed that Froude number had the more dominant role in the modeling. Comparison among SVM and two other intelligence approaches showed that SVM is more successful in the prediction process.</jats:p>",

Buyers can therefore benefit from identifying trustworthy suppliers. We argue that precontractual actions by a supplier, for example making costly buyer-specific investments without a long-term contract, can signal a supplier’s trustworthiness. We develop a theoretical model to reflect supplier trustworthiness, and determine when a buyer can benefit from identifying trustworthy suppliers. We show that costly relationship-specific investments can serve as a signal of trustworthiness, and that supply chain profits increase when trustworthy suppliers are able to identify themselves in this fashion. We demonstrate the importance of the signaling mechanism using laboratory experiments. The experimental results show that relationship-specific investments lead to more collaborative transactions, with buyers offering higher prices and suppliers returning higher-quality products. This results in increased profits for both buyers and suppliers. Additionally, we design a treatment which shuts down the signaling mechanism and show that the benefits of the buyer-specific investment are no longer present in this case. Finally, we show that the benefits of buyer-specific investments for both suppliers and buyers are strengthened when firms interact repeatedly. </jats:p><jats:p> Data and the online appendix are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2817 . </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The largest part of food sales is managed by large food supply chains. However, an alternative system of food distribution focuses on locally produced and sold food that has gotten great attention in the last two decades. The challenges of those new systems, called short food supply chains (SFSC), represent tough market competitions, high distribution and logistics costs, small shipment sizes and so forth. Hence, the SFSC requires corresponding solutions in food distribution that are aligned with the contemporary logistics trends, sustainability and aspects of the new digital era. Using specially developed methodology, based on two different conceptual models, we showed how the SFSC could be designed from the aspects of innovative logistics modes and contemporary information and communication technologies, with the final aim to outline and evaluate different food distribution scenarios towards greater sustainability. The first conceptual model was aimed at the creation of innovative forms of SFSC, in which business process modelling was used in order to design and explore the given situation more thoroughly. For the purposes of conducting a comparative assessment of the distribution models developed in the previous part, the second conceptual model is developed. By using a qualitative approach, this is how the major advantages and challenges of practical implementations in creating sustainable distribution solutions are stated for each scenario.</jats:p>"

With a formal model, we analyze how NGOs can alleviate market failures and improve supplier economic inclusion while strategically interacting with firms. We account for the specific goals of the NGO and the need to induce collaboration between firms and their suppliers. The analysis reveals a “valley of frustration,” when NGO efforts benefit all actors but only marginally the firm. We also show that more powerful firms might prefer to internalize NGO functions, while firms with lower bargaining power and higher investment requirements are better off collaborating with NGOs. Finally, we study NGOs‐firms matching patterns and find that firms with higher bargaining power match with NGOs holding stronger capabilities.</jats:p><jats:p>\n<jats:bold><jats:italic>Managerial Summary</jats:italic>:</jats:bold> This article analyzes interactions between firms and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) aiming to improve the economic inclusion of suppliers or to promote the adoption of specific (e.g., sustainable) practices. For firm executives, this study shows the constraints and benefits associated with working with NGOs, the conditions under which integration of NGO functions is preferable as well as the types of NGOs that offer better prospects for a successful collaboration. For NGO executives, it highlights the need to provide enough economic incentives to firms and suppliers alike to ensure their collaboration and the trade‐offs associated with this constraint, in particular, if NGO capabilities are limited.

Prior to 2008, proppant demand grew at a relatively modest pace and overwhelmingly consisted of 20/40 mesh high quality natural sands and synthetic proppants. Fundamental changes in drilling and completion practices has given rise to a significant increase in the application of smaller mesh proppants, most notably 40/70, 30/50 and various forms of what is generically referred to as 100 mesh sand (i.e., sands that are predominantly smaller than 70 mesh) in natural gas and liquid applications. Proppant demand has now soared, increasing significantly as a result of the new high-intensity completions practices in horizontal wells. In 2018, an estimated 200 Billion pounds will be used for the first time in history (or 10 times that used in 2008).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The proppant supply industry responded well to the increased demand in the past decade, but the industry is increasingly concerned about future supply limitations and the potential impact on completion practices subject to high volume, quality and mesh size availability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper summarizes the historical supply of proppant by type and source, and the driver for each proppant type based on the authors’ current and prior research. The paper will further clarify the basics of proppant by type and size (e.g., what is 100 mesh?) and will address some of the challenges that both the proppant supplier and end-user may face subject to current or desired completion practices. Key observations will be: 1) Potential limitations in the amount of proppant size and type, 2) The impact that specific proppant shortages may have on both supplier and end-user, and 3) Risk factors the proppant supply base may experience subject to future changes in completion design.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The objective of this effort is to encourage the need to study alternative completion designs subject to proppant availability. It is specifically not the intent of this paper to propose one form of completion practice or proppant type over the other.</jats:p>",

Our aim was to investigate photochemical processes – which is one of the most determinant in case of yield – of crops by in vivo field measurements. We measured the chlorophyll content of leaves using Minolta SPAD 502. We used miniPAM fluorometer to determine actual photochemical efficiency and non-photochemical quenching of PSII during natural light conditions and also to evaluate the pigment (chlorophylls and carotenoids) and water content of leaves we applied field spectrophotometer (ASD FieldSpecPro 3). We utilized these methods by various treatments (1. treatment with soil bacteria + head and base fertilizer; 2. treated by only head fertilizer; 3. treated by only base-fertilizer) in field experiment of autumn wheat (4.1–2.43–1.19 ha) in June, 2017. The difference between treatments was clearly detectable. In the case of the first treatment, physiological processes were more intense and the ripening occurred earlier. The obtained yield was the highest in the case of the area treated by soil bacterial. Based on the results, the first treatment can be recommended in practice.</jats:p>"

Results revealed that benefit cost ratio is greater than 1, means that tilapia production is profitable in the study area. Tilapia farmers are also responsive to changes in market prices of inputs and outputs. Tilapia price is the most dominant determinant of output supply and input demand. A 1% increase in tilapia price will increase output supply by 3.836% and increase demand for lime, fingerlings, feed and labour by 0.941%, 0.987%, 0.523% and 1.00%, respectively.

To develop the model, the Delphi method was used. The objective of this method is to achieve the most reliable consensus in a group of expertsFindings: The research result is a developed framework for GSCM in the construction industry comprising five concepts, 22 dimensions, and 82 elements.Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this research is that its output was the discovered elements, but it did not cover the implementation of this model in construction projects, so some elements may be missing.Practical implications: The output of the research could give new perspective to manage the construction project based on Green Supply Chain Method.Social implications: The stakeholder of the construction project has to learn with this concept (Green Supply Chain) in order to improve construction’s project performance.Originality/value: The originality of this research is that it is a new theme in the area of the construction supply chain. Previous research merely considered the concept of GSCM in construction. Therefore, this research develops an assessment model for performance indicators of GSCM implementation in construction projects.</jats:p>"

Developers produce houses to make profits, however, with the increase in housing prices, homeownership rate and developers’ profit performance will be affected. This study examines the reasons why housing prices are increasing in spite of the government’s ‘cooling’ measures. Through a cross-sectional survey questionnaire, comprising 24 causes and 115 members of the housing developers and designers teams, 13 influential factors to the increase in housing prices were found. Additionally, the participants were also inquired on the five most influential factors causing the increase in housing prices. The factors include the shortage of materials, quality of materials, strategic factors, housing location and availability of transportation system. The results of the study are useful to developers, homebuyers and policymakers towards reducing housing prices.</jats:p>"

The research methodology was based on ANOVA analysis comparing samples of contemporary SMEs operating in Poland and Kazakhstan. Primary data was collected using the CAWI quantitative method and then studied using the ANOVA statistical data analysis method. The research results demonstrated similar involvement in the implementation of the concept with significant differences in some areas, such as cost reduction and focus on end customers. The concept of Supply Chain Management is a very common subject of theoretical and practical analysis. Even though research efforts in this area indicate the positive effects of the implemented concept, most of them concern large organisations. The research results showed similar involvement in the implementation of the concept, although significant differences were found in selected areas, such as cost reduction and focus on end customers.</jats:p>",

During the implementation of a sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), Chinese enterprises are faced with domestic and overseas institutional pressures, such as laws, regulations, and agenda, etc. Then, whether the dual institutional pressure has a promoting role for Chinese manufacturing enterprises in implementing the SSCM and whether the sustainable supply chain practices (SSCP) can promote the output of enterprise performance, have become a topic worthy of study. Hypothesis on the relationship between the institutional pressure of sustainable supply chain and economic, social, and environmental performances is innovatively raised in this paper and a theoretical model is built. Besides, a fitting test is conducted to a full model by using a structural equation model. An optimal model is eventually obtained after repeated modifications to the initial model by means of goodness of fit and causal path coefficient, thereby it is verified in this paper that the institutional pressure has a significantly positive impact on the SSCP; a conclusion is drawn that the impact of the SSCP on the economic, environmental, and social performances shows different characteristics, which has an important theoretical guiding role in promoting the SSCP.</jats:p>"

Thus, it can lead to improved tracking of goods and offer tamper-proof data to build trust among parties. Although a variety of blockchain use cases already exists, not all of them seem to rely on blockchain-specific features, but could rather be solved with traditional technologies. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to identify characteristic use cases described for blockchain in the field of LSCM and to analyze them regarding their mindful technology use based on five mindful technology adoption principles: engagement with the technology; Technological novelty seeking; awareness of local context; cognizance of alternative technologies; and anticipation of technology alteration. The authors identified five blockchain case clusters and chose one case for each category to be analyzed in detail. Most cases demonstrate high engagement with the technology, but there are significant differences when it comes to the other mindful use principles. This paper highlights the need to understand the problem and to apply the right technology in order to solve it. When solving a problem, care should be taken to address a technology’s unique features to ensure effectiveness and cost-efficiency.</jats:p>"

The evaluation results were also validated in the application to major dam basins in Korea. The findings are summarized as follows. As a result of analytical analysis, the concentration time was found to be proportional to the main channel length under laminar flow conditions and to the square of it under turbulent flow conditions, but inversely proportional to the channel slope. It was also found that the storage coefficient and the concentration time are linearly but loosely related. Most empirical formulas for the concentration time concurred with the basic equation form, but just a few for the storage coefficient. Applications to major dam basins in Korea also showed that the concentration time agrees well with the result of theoretical analysis. However, the behavior of the storage coefficient varied much, basin by basin, indicating that additional factors may be needed to explain it.</jats:p>",

Safety stocks, cycle stocks and seasonal builds drive the overall inventory position of the business, which has a direct impact on its cash flow and financial statements. For any company, it is important to service customers at the right level without getting stock-outs and, at the same time, carry optimal levels of inventory. It is often hard to find the right balance between inventory cost, customer service level and operational efficiency, as these three integral components of the supply chain go hand-in-hand and are prioritised over each other based upon the needs of the business. To achieve the optimum balance of service and cost, there is a need for a predictive working model which determines the causes of safety stock requirements for the current state of any business. This paper discusses a predictive model which can be used for any time horizon and enables an organisation to focus on the right variables to reduce safety stock requirements, thereby reducing inventory levels while meeting customer service level targets.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Utilization of renewable energy becomes a necessity in the future due to the fossil energy supply continues to decline. In Indonesia, the use of electricity from renewable sources is minimal. The utilization of solar energy in Indonesia is still limited to remote areas or islands. The main problem of electricity in Indonesia, especially in the city of Banda Aceh, is the frequent occurrence of power outages from the state power plant (PLN), especially during peak load time (WBP). Outside of that time, electricity supply exceeds demand. This study aims to utilize solar energy to reduce the electricity consumption of PLN during WBP. The system is designed to divert the power supply from PLN to the solar power plant (PLTS). The results of a survey of 10 A (current limit) customers are used as a reference to calculate PLTS capacity. During WBP, PLTS supplies to the load, beyond that time, PLN will supply the load. The system is designed to store maximum energy beyond the WBP period into the battery, the source of energy is mainly from the PLTS and alternatively from the PLN when the PLTS can not supply the maximum power. Based on battery energy, the system diverts the load supply from PLN when the battery energy is below the recharge limit. In the case of 10 A customers, with the energy requirement during WBP of 4.3 kWh, it requires 12 solar panels (160 Watt maximum power) arranged in parallel. Thus, the system needs three batteries with 150 Ah capacity also assembled in parallel. The implementation results prove that the PLTS can store solar energy to the battery properly, the system also successfully divert the PLTS source to the load at the time of WBP and transfer back to the PLN source when the battery energy is less than the recharge limit.</jats:p>"

To develop the method for increasing the efficiency of the equipment’s maintenance and repair system, ensuring necessary level of operational reliability of the equipment, safety and reliability of the electric equipment with minimal expenses on operation. Relevance. Aging of the power equipment in railway power supply systems sharply raised a need for assessment of its states and degree of risk for operation outside rated service life. In critical conditions of technological processes and operational modes of the railways it is necessary to increase the equipment’s operational reliability. The scheduled maintenance and repair system whose main technical and economic criterion is the minimum of equipment’s downtimes on the basis of a rigid regulation of repair cycles, in the conditions of market regulations in the field of repair in many cases does not provide the optimal decisions due to insufficient financing. The solution of this problem is possible by improvement of the maintenance and repair system. Under these conditions the main direction for supporting the operational reliability of power electric equipment on TS is a development of the modern methods based on individual supervision over real changes of technical condition of power equipment. Scientific novelty. In this article the authors proposed an integrated approach, on the basis of which can be developed the effective maintenance and repair system for traction power supply systems. Proposed approach allowed to react quickly to changes of service conditions on traction substations, to control the technical condition of power electric equipment under the conditions of uncertainty, to establish interrelation between quality of service and operational reliability of the equipment, to choose a service strategy on traction substations. Practical importance. The validity of the developed method was confirmed by the results of calculations and practically by choosing the optimal maintenance's option for transformer TDTN-25000/150-70 U1 (ТДТН-25000/150-70 У1) on traction power supply substation.</jats:p>",

To overcome current limits a new concept was introduced several years ago: the Physical Internet (PI) — in other words, the universal interconnection of logistics services. Initial research has shown a large potential for improvement by switching from current organisations to more interconnected ones. The concept attracted attention from researchers and professionals and several results, industry roadmaps and first applications are now available.

Moreover, the paper provides industry insights by exemplifying the value of the proposed framework for the UK food industry. A critical review on the most acknowledged sustainability assessment methodologies and tools resulted in the synthesis of the proposed framework. An illustrative application follows, based on data from semi-structured interviews with C-level executives from key players of the UK poultry sector. The results demonstrate an easy-to-use approach, with a comprehensive and sharp outcome on supply chain sustainability performance assessment. Industry insights demonstrate an adequate sustainability performance with respect to the entire supply chain. A detailed view on different echelons reveals specific areas that could be improved, such as the environmental performance at both farming (production) and processing levels. This work extends the scope of current sustainability performance assessment tools by providing a tangible triple bottom-line overview, as well as echelon-specific and indicator-specific details, in a user-friendly, yet straightforward, way. UK food industry insights are valuable for practitioners and academics. The illustration is based exclusively on C-level executives’ viewpoint; thus, any generalization of the results should be considered to this effect. Supply chain stakeholders, policy-makers, and researchers could perform a quick and reliable supply network sustainability performance assessment.</jats:p>"

It also examines the moderating role of organizational culture. In essence, this inquiry examines the role of external and internal forces in a context where organizational action is perhaps effectively mobilized only when both external and internal pressures are salient. Using data from 166 U.S. manufacturing firms, we found that the effects of coercive forces on SCS practice deployment are transmitted via top management involvement. In addition, the effect of top management involvement on SCS practice deployment is more salient for firms with high security‐oriented organizational culture, although a diminishing return was detected. SCS practice deployment was found to be strongly related to SCS performance. We discuss the theoretical contributions and managerial implications based on our findings.</jats:p>",

To achieve this, a supply chain was designed for a fictitious company located in the City of Celaya, Guanajuato and a set of suppliers located in different cities within the same State. It was used as a google tool to define the distances between each of the companies. As a final result, a representative model of a supply chain was obtained, as well as a methodology that allows the construction of lean supply chains regardless of the number of companies that comprise it. The effect of the variability in the delivery times between suppliers was incorporated into the simulation model, as well as an equation that calculates the pollution emissions of the vehicles that integrate the network that moves the products between the companies. With this work it is possible to represent networks of supply chains of real world companies, where the variability and contamination factor is included, to facilitate the decision making regarding the number of vehicles, inventory levels, quantities to be shipped, frequency in the shipments, etc. with the purpose of contaminating as little as possible and at the same time preventing interruptions in the supply chain using the least amount of resources possible.</jats:p>"

Developers produce houses to make profits, however, with the increase in housing prices, homeownership rate and developers’ profit performance will be affected. This study examines the reasons why housing prices are increasing in spite of the government’s ‘cooling’ measures. Through a cross-sectional survey questionnaire, comprising 24 causes and 115 members of the housing developers and designers teams, 13 influential factors to the increase in housing prices were found. Additionally, the participants were also inquired on the five most influential factors causing the increase in housing prices. The factors include the shortage of materials, quality of materials, strategic factors, housing location and availability of transportation system. The results of the study are useful to developers, homebuyers and policymakers towards reducing housing prices.</jats:p>"

Short food supply chains (SFSCs) are emerging as a potential option for this type of farm, but as a strategy it is apparently not being implemented strongly enough over the region as a whole. The current case study sought to explore the initiatives carried out by local producers to date in implementing SFSCs throughout the province and to examine, from the standpoint of the production sector, the constraints hindering its development and the strategies currently being adopted with a view to addressing them. The analyses carried out under local producers perspective shows us that although SFSCs are interesting for family farms, in terms of prices, economic profit and social recognition, the abilities and capacities these channels require to producers, jointly with technical, flexibility and time demands, make these channels to be not that successful and attractive. Small producers interested in SFSCs must be aware of the special importance of social linkages and the need to take care of them; as well as of the need of establishing synergies and cooperation with other producers and stakeholders, in order to facilitate the tasks associated and that not every food product suit SFSCs.</jats:p>",

Using game theory, optimal decision-making on wholesale prices, retail prices, and recycling prices are explored under decentralized and centralized decision-making scenarios, and representative expressions are established. By analyzing the effects of the risk aversion coefficient on players’ optimal strategies, we found that the manufacturer’s and retailers’ risk aversion coefficients have different effects on the wholesale price, retail price, and recycling price under decentralized decision-making, while in a centralized decision-making scenario, the effects are the same. The comparison also found that the wholesale price and recovery price under the centralized decision-making scenario are higher than those under decentralized decision-making. To achieve closed-loop supply chain coordination, we propose a revenue-sharing contract that we demonstrate by coordinating price competition with risk aversion and analyze a range of parameters that influence the revenue-sharing contract. The results show that the proposed contract can increase the profits of supply chain members by identifying the optimal revenue-sharing ratio.</jats:p>"

To mitigate the supply disruption risk, the authors investigate two types of procurement strategies for a firm with two ordering opportunities. Through establishing Stackelberg game models, the authors drive the supplier’s optimal production, and the firm’s optimal procurement and replenishment strategies under the option purchase (OP) strategy and the procurement commitment (PC) strategy, respectively. The findings show that, under both types of strategies, the firm’s procurement follows a “threshold” principle. Moreover, the firm’s procurement quantity can be represented by two newsvendor solutions. A lower option price or option exercise price benefits the firm, while it damages the supplier. The supplier benefits from a higher mean value (MV) of emergency procurement price and the firm benefits from a lower market demand variability. Counter-intuitively, a lower MV of the emergency procurement price is not always beneficial to the firm. A higher market demand variability could be beneficial to the supplier under the PC strategy. The firm should first choose the PC strategy and then change to the OP strategy as the disruption risk increases.</jats:p>"

Our spatially disaggregated analysis focuses on the greater South East region, approximately within 1.5 hours commuting time from Central London. A dynamic spatial panel model is applied to account for observed temporal variations in property prices and housing affordability across districts. The dynamic structure of this model allows us to assess the scale and extent of knock-on effects of local supply shocks in one district on other districts in the region. These complex spatial effects have been largely ignored in local or regional housing market forecasting models to date. Applying this model, we are able to demonstrate that local house prices and affordability are not only determined by the underlying supply and demand conditions in the market in question, but also depend crucially on conditions in neighbouring housing markets whose properties can be considered close substitutes within a larger regional housing market. We also show that increasing housing supply in the most critical areas has little impact on (both local and regional) affordability, even if wages do not change in response to an increase in employment. </jats:p>",

Under globalisation, individuals become increasingly interested not only in cultural heritage as a whole but also in its components, e.g. gastronomic heritage. Nowadays individuals are interested in such things as traditional foods, the techniques of preparing the foods and the traditions of consuming them. Individuals wish to see gastronomic traditions not only on a national scale but also a regional and even a local scale. Previous research studies conducted in Latvia focused on the progress of cultural heritage products as value and the introduction of such products by businesses in the rural areas of Latvia. Scientific cooperation opened up opportunities to study the phenomenon of a wider geographical space covering four countries – Poland, Lithuania, Romania and Latvia. The aim of this research stage: to identify an impact of information on the demand-supply balance of gastronomic heritage as a product in the market. The method of the research: a sociological survey (n = 1000 from Poland, Lithuania, Romania and Latvia; 285 men and 715 women) that was carried out during 2016. Despite the fact that the sample groups were not representative (did not reflect the views of the entire population), the obtained data and results of this analysis provided insight into the cultural issues under today’s circumstances through the population’s views. The results of the study strengthen the need for the modernization of the information system in order to promote rural viability.</jats:p>"

The location of control points was selected in order to assess the water quality depending on the pipe material and at unfavourable points - at the ends of the network. It was shown that as a result of secondary water contamination an increase in turbidity, colour and total iron occurred. The distance from the Water Treatment Plant and the type of material of the network or connection, affect the quality of the water. It was confirmed that at the ends of the network the water parameters were increased and exceeded the admissible values.</jats:p>",

Methods: Optimization of the traction power supply system according to characteristic criteria of resources and energy efﬁciency minimization. Results: Quality indices of power supply of hauling operations, voltage level of collectors for different electric propulsion systems with direct and single-phase alternating current were analyzed. The key factors, signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing the performance indices, are the voltage level and type of current of an electric powered network. It was shown that the system of electric propulsion is a promissory system and possesses the best competitiveness indices, as its electric power supply subsystem is functioning on high-voltage direct current with the use of a 24 kW direct current electric stock on the basis of a new multipurpose generation converting complex. Practical importance: The suggested justiﬁcation method of electriﬁcation variant by means of a dependence diagram depicting spacing between substations and catenary wire section makes it possible to justify a competitive high-voltage direct current electric propulsion system during the design of electric power infrastructure for busy railway lines.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, many industries are focusing on automation in manufacturing for high production and good quality to meet the needs of customers in a short period of time. This trend has produced a forward shift in technology in the form of advancement, which ultimately increases energy demand. For that reason, researchers have started working on sustainable development associated with cleaner-energy policies to avoid increasing energy consumption for enhanced manufacturing technology in developed countries. The other important issue affecting our world is global warming, which is the result of greenhouse gas emissions. That is the reason, renewable energies like solar energy have dramatically increased during recent years to compensate for the energy demand and reduced carbon footprint for cleaner production. This paper considers a supply chain management of automobile part manufacturing industry with suppliers to optimize the production quantity with multiple objectives i.e., minimizing the total cost of production including minimum quantity lubrication is a first objective, reduction of the carbon footprint is the second, and minimizing the cost of energy considering renewable energy is the last objective. This study considers a situation, where imperfect quality items are managed and controlled by the suppliers as outsourcing operations. A weighted goal programming methodology is utilized to solve the proposed mathematical model including sustainable suppliers. Sensitivity analysis of the model is performed for different scenarios with respect to the energy utilization. The optimal result of minimum production cost and carbon emissions is the evidence of successful pragmatic application in automobile industry. The results validate the model to provide the basis for sustainability in supply chain environment considering manufacturer and suppliers.</jats:p>"

Despite the lake of official statistics, a comprehensive review of biomass resource estimation of Iran has been conducted for the first time and 72 Mt animal manure, 61 Mt sewage and waste water, 19 Mt agricultural residue, 15 Mt municipal solid wastes, 4 Mt woody residues, and 1.3 Mt citrus residues are estimated. A novel biopower model structure is introduced using reference energy system modeling approach as a network representation of the technical activities to convert biomass to electricity. Therefore, 781 ML biodiesel, 5690 ML bioethanol and 20,500 MCM biogas could be extracted through the proposed structure. Thus, total biopower potential will be 63.7 TWh that is equal to 23.2% of total power generation in Iran (274.4 TWh). The sustainability assessment is conducted and the results show 79 Mt of carbon reduction, 9366 annual job creation and 0.01 USD/kWh cost reduction in order to 100% of bioenergy potential utilization, which are 79%, 22%, and 10% improve in social, environmental and economic indicators, respectively. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: 171–188, 2019</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) offer the promise of providing carbon-free electricity and heat to small islands or isolated electricity grids. However, the economic feasibility of SMRs is highly system-dependent and has not been studied in this context. We selected three case-study islands for such an evaluation: Jeju, Tasmania and Tenerife based on their system complexity. We generated 100,000 electricity-mix cases stochastically for each island and examined the system-level generation-cost changes by incrementing the average generation cost of SMRs from USD$60 to 200 MWh−1. SMRs were found to be economically viable when average generation cost was &lt;$100 MWh−1 for Jeju and &lt;$140 MWh−1 for Tenerife. For Tasmania the situation was complex; hydroelectric power is an established competitor, but SMRs might be complementary in a future “battery of the nation” scenario where most of the island’s hydro capacity was exported to meet peak power demand on the mainland grid. The higher average generation cost of SMRs makes it difficult for them to compete economically with a fossil fuel/renewable mix in many contexts. However, we have demonstrated that SMRs can be an economically viable carbon-free option for a small island with a limited land area and high energy demand.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Consumers increasingly want to know more about where and how the products they purchase are being made. To create transparency requires a company to both gain visibility into its supply chain and disclose information to consumers. In this paper, we focus on the dimension of visibility and investigate when companies can benefit from greater supply chain visibility. To do so, we design an incentivized human–subject experiment to study two key questions: (i) How does supply chain visibility impact consumers’ valuations of a company’s social responsibility (SR) practices in its upstream supply chain? (ii) What roles do indirect reciprocity and consumers’ prosociality play in affecting their valuations under different levels of visibility? In our design, greater visibility is represented by lower uncertainty in the outcomes of a company’s SR efforts. Our results show that consumers value greater visibility regarding a company’s SR practices in the upstream supply chain. This is especially true if consumers exhibit a self-serving bias and use uncertainty as an excuse not to pay for SR. We also observe that high prosocial consumers do not exhibit strong indirect reciprocity. Conversely, indirect reciprocity significantly increases low prosocial consumers’ valuations under High visibility. Our work adds to the experimental literature focusing on transparency and SR (which has primarily studied disclosure) by examining the equally important but understudied dimension of visibility. Furthermore, our results on consumer heterogeneity offer insights into what SR information resonates with a company’s target consumers. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0685 . </jats:p>",

Risk factors were assessed by literature review and analysis through the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and the Matrix-based Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC) methodologies, with a group of professionals of the field. The ISM model represented the relationships between twenty-two risk factors, and their position in the system, from higher to lower-level risks. The MICMAC analysis identified independent, autonomous, linkage and dependent risk factors according to their driving and dependence power. Data collected also allowed for the recognition of indirect influences between risk factors, complementing the system’s understanding, in special the strongest linkages. The paper also integrated both outputs to create a better representation of the risks factors into the system. The research characterizes current risk factors’ status on the Brazilian wind power supply chain, and the understanding of their implications into the system. It is a guide to implement effective mitigation strategies into the supply chain and more accurate and cautious decision-making in organizations.</jats:p>"

In this reply, we show that the main empirical result of Cardwell et al.—the degree of regressive distributional effects—is robust to alternative modelling choices and to alternative counterfactual price scenarios. We present new food price comparisons between Canada and the United States, showing that significant price premiums for supply-managed products persist under different exchange rates. Contrary to the results in Doyon et al., we find no evidence of systematic price premiums for non-supply-managed food products. Our new price comparisons highlight the shortcomings in the price comparisons in Doyon et al. and corroborate the results in Cardwell et al. Finally, we reject suggestions by Doyon et al. that our results are affected by research bias. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over 85% of Uganda’s 34 million people depend on rural water supply systems and the current water and environment sector performance report (2017) reports an 84% functionality of rural water sources such as boreholes and shallow wells with a hand pump. Ensuring the continued operation of water points, and in keeping with participatory theory, the water user’s committees (WUCs) should also be a vehicle for empowering communities while bringing about greater equity of use. However, WUC members do not acquire the knowledge and skills they need by default but require different types of training. This study sought to evaluate community participation and capacity development in WUCs in relation to community-managed water supply systems. A shared dialogue workshop (SDW), as well as 642 randomly selected households across 17 villages in two Parishes in Lwengo district, southern Uganda were considered. Results indicated that 41.7% of surveyed households used an unprotected source while up to 30% had a member in a WUC. Fifty-two percent of households had never made any financial contributions to a WUC, while 34.6% did so on an ad hoc basis. This paper examines the relationship between participation, mobilization, and financial contributions. The chi-square test indicated mobilization has no impact on household financial contributions to a WUC. However, the majority of even those households that were mobilized made a payment only occasionally, and specifically when the source broke down. Additionally, the test result reveals that there is no difference between better off and relatively poor households in their contributions to a WUC, an indication that other factors influence such decisions. Training activities, especially on the operation and maintenance of water points and to undertake minor repairs, were mostly provided by non-governmental organizations (NGOs)/project staff. Abandoned boreholes, lack of rehabilitation activities, and loss of enthusiasm are all indications that the technical, financial, and institutional performance of community-managed water supply systems needs improvement.</jats:p>"

So, to reduce the greenhouse gas emission and conserve the energy we need to use green energy like fuel cell and Li-ion battery system. This hybrid system consists of PEM fuel cell stack, Li-ion battery and bidirectional step up converter and can be used stationary as well as mobile equipment like vehicles.Methods/Statistical analysis: For the analysis of hybrid PEMFC/ Li-ion battery power supply system, portable embedded motor is proposed in this paper. The modeling, design, implementation and performance of hybrid system are demonstrate by using experimental results as well as MATLAB/Simulink.Findings: The simulation results shows that hybrid fuel cell-battery system could provide the continuous power to the sudden changing load and protect the devices. The results also shows that, bidirectional controller can successfully control the fuel cell output and maintain the state of charge of battery at a constant level which provides the significant efficiency of the hybrid power supply system and increased the life-cycle of the system more than 35%.Improvements/Applications: To improve the fuel cell system performance we need to provide the favorable conditions of temperature, pressure, humidity and control the flow rate of reactant gausses. Similarly, due to internal resistance, temperature, material used in manufacturing process, charging and discharging strategy reduces the efficiency as well as life of the battery pack. By using proper voltage balancing methodology we can maintain the similar voltage and prevent from irregular charging.Â </jats:p>"

Timely discovery and treatment of leakage can avoid drinking water pollution, save water resources or avoid road collapse accidents. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to study pipeline leak detection methods. In this experiment, piezoelectric acceleration sensors were placed in different locations of a leak pipe to acquire the leakage signals. According to the generation mechanism of leak acoustic signals, the unpredictability characteristics of leak signal are investigated. The autocorrelation function is used to describe the unpredictability of the leak signal because it has the ability to analyze the coherent structure of time series, and the Lyapunov exponent can describe its complexity. The autocorrelation function sequence is used as featured extraction object. The Lyapunov exponent of this sequence is used to quantify the signal characteristics. By this method, the leakage can be effectively identified. </jats:p>",

Sufficient information are lacking on these issues in Bangladesh. The study assessed the postharvest handling of key actors in mango supply chains and estimated the post-harvest losses at different stakeholder level in Chapai Nawabganj district, Bangladesh. In total 83 respondents taking 30 mango growers and 53 mango traders were interviewed from Chapai Nawabganj and Dhaka districts. The study identified eight marketing channels for mango marketing. The prominent channel was Grower&gt; Bepari&gt; Urban Arathdar&gt; Urban retailer&gt; urban Consumer since 85.1% mangos moved through this channel. Bepari incurred the highest marketing cost (Tk.7338/ton) due to long distance coverage followed by retailer (Tk.1218/ton) and Faria (Tk.738/ton). Faria received the highest net margin (Tk.8068/ton) due to lower marketing cost and spoilage followed by retailer (Tk. 6601/ton) and Bepari (Tk.5394/ton).The results revealed that the estimated average postharvest losses were 14.11% and 9.61% at farm and traders’ level respectively. At farm level, these losses occurred during harvesting, sorting &amp; grading, and transportation. Harvesting losses were due to cracking, bruising, compression, and disease and insect infestation. The highest loss was recorded at retail level (4.64%) followed by Bepari (3.95%). Farmers and Farias used different local carriers, whereas trucks and pick up van were used by Bepari to transport mango from assemble markets to urban wholesale markets. Major marketing problems in the supply chain were delayed sale and lack of buyers.Bangladesh J. Agril. Res. 43(3): 471-487, September 2018</jats:p>"

This paper presents a methodology for automatically creating future water distribution networks (WDNs) that are stressed step-by-step by disconnection and connection of WDN parts. The associated effects of demand shifting and flow rearrangements are simulated and assessed with hydraulic performances. With the methodology, it is possible to test various planning and adaptation options of the future WDN, where the unknown (future) network is approximated via the co-located and known (future) road network, and hence different topological characteristics (branched vs. strongly looped layout) can be investigated. The reliability of the planning options is evaluated with the flow entropy, a measure based on Shannon’s informational entropy. Uncertainties regarding future water consumption and water loss management are included in a scenario analysis. To avoid insufficient water supply to customers during the transition process from an initial to a final WDN state, an adaptation concept is proposed where critical WDN components are replaced over time. Finally, the method is applied to the drastic urban transition of Kiruna, Sweden. Results show that without adaptation measures severe performance drops will occur after the WDN state 2023, mainly caused by the disconnection of WDN parts. However, with low adaptation efforts that consider 2–3% pipe replacement, sufficient pressure performances are achieved. Furthermore, by using an entropy-cost comparison, the best planning options are determined.</jats:p>"

Supply chain network composed of different stages which involves products, services and information flow between suppliers and customers, is a value-added chain that provides customers products with the quickest delivery and the most competitive price. Hence, there is a need to optimize the supply chain by finding the optimum configuration of the network in order to get a good compromise between several objectives. The supply chain problem utilized in this study is taken from literature which incorporates demand, capacity, raw-material availability, and sequencing constraints in order to maximize total profitability. The performance of DE variants has been investigated by solving three stage multi-echelon supply chain network optimization problems for twenty demand scenarios with each supply chain settings. The objective is to find the optimal alignment of procurement, production, and distribution while aiming towards maximizing profit. The results show that the proposed DE algorithm is able to achieve better performance on a set of supply chain problem with different scenarios those obtained by well-known classical GA and PSO.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Despite the plethora of discourse about how sustainable development should be pursued, the production of agricultural commodities is held responsible for driving <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic> 80% of global deforestation. Partially as a response, the private sector has made commitments to eliminate deforestation, but it is not yet clear what factors these commitments should take into account to effectively halt deforestation while also contributing to broader sustainable development. In the context of private sector commitments to zero-deforestation, this study characterizes the perceptions of different types of stakeholders along the cocoa and chocolate supply chain in order to determine the main challenges and solutions to encourage sustainable production. The main purpose is to understand the key factors that could facilitate a transition to a more sustainable supply while harmonizing the multiple actors’ interests. A qualitative thematic analysis of perceptions was conducted based on responses from 59 interviews with different stakeholders along the cocoa and chocolate supply chain in six key producing and consuming countries. Thematic analysis of the responses revealed six main themes: (1) make better use of policies, regulations and markets to help promote sustainability; (2) improve information and data (e.g., impacts of climate change on cocoa) to inform sound interventions; (3) focus on the landscape rather than the farm-level alone and improve integration of supply chain actors; (4) promote better coordination between stakeholders and initiatives (e.g., development assistance projects and corporate sustainability efforts); (5) focus on interdependent relationships between social, environmental and economic dimensions to achieve sustainable development; and (6) engage with the private sector. The study shows the importance of identifying different stakeholder priorities in order to design solutions that accommodate multiple interests. It also emphasizes the need to improve coordination and communication between stakeholders and instruments in order to address the three different dimensions of sustainability in a synergistic manner, considering the interactions from production of raw material to end consumer.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is necessary to research how different fairness concern affects the joint decision of pricing and service quality guarantee in an LSSC. First considering a price and quality-sensitive logistics service market, a basic model without fairness concern of a customized LSSC is established. Then, a new model with fairness concern of a decentralized LSSC is constructed based on the basic model. The optimal decision of the LSSC with fairness concern is investigated in three cases. In each case, we analyze the effect of fairness concern on the optimal decision, and the expected profits and utilities. Finally, some numerical studies are shown to verify our theoretical analyses and some managerial insights are given. </jats:p>",

Successful implementation of supply chain management (SCM) can give SMEs an advantage over their competitors. Problems that occur for SMEs in Indonesia and other developing countries face problems in the implementation of SCM due to lack of resources and direction. To compete effectively in global markets, SMEs must have effective supply chain management and thus require comprehensive strategic planning in an effort to develop the SME business group itself. This research methodology used qualitative approach through interview approach and field study to group members of Women Interfaith Among Religious (PAUB), Malang city. The results of field studies show that integrated small and medium enterprise (SME) supply chain strategy planning contribute to the success of SMEs for PAUB members of Malang city. The supply chain strategy planning process that SMEs need has stages like \"source,\" \"create,\" and \"deliver\". Thus, when implemented it will connect with various supply chain cycles such as \"ordering,\" \"procurement,\" \"production,\" \"distribution,\" and \"customer\" for SME groups.</jats:p>"

In the current study, classical models and meta model approaches (i.e. Support Vector Machine and Gene Expression Programming) were applied to evaluate the impact of pipe diameter and hydraulic condition changes in prediction of the critical submergence depth ratio in horizontal intakes. In this regard, two types of critical submergence experiments, based on bottom clearance, were considered (i.e. c = 0 and c = d/2, in which c and d are the bottom clearance and diameter of the intake, respectively). Different models were developed and tested using experimental data series. The results indicated that in modeling the critical submergence depth ratio, meta model approaches led to better predictions compared to the classical approaches. It was observed that the developed models for the state of c = d/2 yielded better results. According to the outcome of sensitivity analysis, the ratio of velocities in the intake pipe and channel (Vi/Vc) had a key role in the modeling. It was also found that intake pipe diameter affected the critical submergence depth ratio in intake pipes. Increasing pipe diameter caused a decrease in model accuracy.</jats:p>",

The supply voltage quality of SST is related to its control strategy at this time. Therefore, a high supply voltage quality control strategy for SST has been proposed in this study. First, the supply voltage characteristics of SST and TT have been compared, and finding that the voltage quality is easy to worsen when SST working without power quality control strategy. Then, the voltage quality regulating mechanism of SST has been analysed. In addition, a novel control strategy which includes the direct voltage control loop and the virtual impedance loop has been proposed for SST. The characteristics of the voltage loop and virtual impedance loop are analysed. The computational burden, harmonic extraction and phase‐locked‐loop are considered in the voltage control loop. The compensational state can vary with the surplus compensation capacity by adopting the virtual impedance loop. Finally, the experimental results verified the validity and effectiveness of the presented control strategy.</jats:p>",

Considering that the optimal locations for EVCIs in most cities with a tight land supply are difficult to obtain, it is significant to study the planning of EVCIs in such cities. This paper proposes a planning method and model of EVCIs under the condition that alternative locations of centralized charging infrastructures (CCIs) are known. Firstly, based on the principle of energy equivalence, the sales volume of the fuel of gas stations in the planned area is converted into the equivalent electric quantity (EEQ) and the EEQ is divided according to the demands of different EVs for charging. Then, an equal product of the load and distance (EPLD) criterion is used to distribute the EEQ to CCIs and distributed charging infrastructures (DCIs) located in areas for load forecasting. The final plan is given out after checking the constraints and planning rationality. In addition, the net present value (NPV), the average charging distance, and the total harmonic distortion (THD) rate are used to evaluate the planning scheme. Finally, the feasibility and practicability of the proposed method are verified by a case study in Beijing.</jats:p>"

Water discharge was held constant over a sequence of seven runs, and 300 kg of sediment was supplied during each run in different magnitudes and frequencies. In runs with constant feed bedload transport rate increased gradually. In contrast, runs that received large sediment pulses showed pronounced increases in bedload rate as the bed surface got finer, followed by monotonic declines as the bed surface coarsened. We studied the temporal scales of bedload fluctuations by means of sample autocorrelation coefficients and the rates of decrease in bedload fluctuation with sampling time scale. The significant trends caused in bedload rate by large occasional sediment pulses increased long‐term autocorrelation in bedload rate time series relative to runs with constant feed. Bed evolution and local changes in sediment storage caused multiple scales of variability in bedload rate, which increased autocorrelation and caused long‐term persistence in bedload series over periods with a nearly constant mean. The scaling statistics of bedload transport fluctuation depended on grain size, and those for total bedload were similar to those for fine gravel (2–8 mm), which was fully mobile and dominated bedload transport. Grain size dependence of bedload fluctuation was not affected by changes in sediment feed because water discharge and sediment texture were held constant.</jats:p>",

With the increasing awareness about environmental issues, businesses and governments increasingly want to reduce the pollution which leads to green supply chain.

Narrow gastric tube, especially 3cm-wide one, is thought to improve the blood supply of stomach. But with the combine use of these two techniques, we found alimentary tract leakage became more common. The reason was obscure. Few have considered the influence of anastomosis-induced gastric wall defect on the blood supply of gastric tube (Figure 1). We carried out this research to prove this hypothesis and to find out method to resolve this problem.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Animal experiment and clinical cohort study have been carried out. Narrow gastric tube group (3cm wide) and baseball-bat-shaped gastric tube group (5cm in avascular area) were compared. In animal experiment, 3 pigs in each group. Impaired blood supply will slow down blood flow and cause metabolic acidosis. So blood gas analysis (with the blood collected in gastric wall distal or proximal to the anastomosis) and arteriography with methylene blue were performed. pH and BE(from blood gas analysis) and time required for methylene blue to reach the tip of gastric tube were used to evaluate the blood supply of these areas. In cohort study, 176 patients were enrolled with 24 in narrow gastric tube group and 152 in bat-like gastric tube group. The incidence of leakage was compared.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>In animal experiment, before anastomosis, no metabolic acidosis was found in both groups. But after anastomosis, methylene blue couldn’t reach the gastric wall distal to the anastomosis, and the blood gas analysis shows metabolic acidosis with the blood from the same area, only in narrow group, These indicated insufficient blood supply in this area. In the cohort study, the incidence of leakage was much higher in narrow group.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Anastomosis can influence the blood supply of the gastric tube distal to it. It's the reason of the increase of alimentary tract fistula incidence with the use of 3cm-wide narrow gastric tube. Widen the gastric avascular area is an effective way to prevent this. So for end-to-side anastomosis, 5cm-wide gastric tube is preferred, while narrower gastric tube is suitable for other mode of anastomosis which do not cause gastric wall defect</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosure</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>All authors have declared no conflicts of interest.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

While several structural supply chain characteristics have been found to be significant drivers of firm innovation and performance, a dearth of studies exists examining how these characteristics change over time by influencing one another. We develop and empirically test hypotheses on the impact of prior structural configurations and the moderating roles of absorptive capacity and industry growth on the temporal trajectory of supply chain alliance network structures. Adopting a multi‐method approach, we jointly use econometric analyses and simulation experiments to examine our hypotheses from complementary angles. Specifically, we characterize the dynamic relationship between the structural mechanisms on a longitudinal dataset of 2221 unique firms and 13,668 firm‐year observations spanning 25 years. We find empirical support for negative crossover effects between two key structural properties of supply chain alliance networks, a positive moderation of a firm's absorptive capacity, and a negative moderation of industry growth on the structural reinforcement. We conduct corresponding simulation experiments based on a separable temporal exponential random graph model (STERGM) to track the temporal changes in the simulated networks' key measures. The simulation results concur with most of our empirical findings and provide additional insights complementary to our econometric analysis results. By focusing on the mechanism of temporal changes in network structural properties, our study contributes to supply chain management research with a supply network perspective and interfirm alliance network research by broadening its scope into structural dynamism. Our multi‐method approach demonstrates how multiple complementary methodologies can foster a more nuanced understanding of managing supply chain alliance network management.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Then we compared suppliers’ contract acceptance, level of effort, and shirking across national cultures. Our findings reveal critical cultural influences on contract effectiveness. We show that although acceptance of bonus contracts is comparable across cultures, suppliers from Canada, a national culture considered low in power distance and high in humane orientation, exhibit lower acceptance rates of penalty contracts. In addition, we find evidence that suppliers associated with collectivist cultures exert more effort and shirk less in bonus contracts but these relationships also are more complex. When we compare contract effectiveness across bonus and penalty contracts within a given cultural setting, we find in all three countries greater acceptance of bonus contracts than penalty contracts. Also, after contracts are accepted, bonus contracts are more successful in China because suppliers exert greater effort and shirk less under bonus contracts than penalty contracts. However, in Canada and South Korea, the results of accepted contracts for both penalty and bonus contracts are nearly indistinguishable.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Методика. Исследован магистральный и капиллярный кровоток (окклюзионная плетизмография, ультразвуковая допплерография, полярография, лазерная флоуметрия) у здоровых людей (157 чел.) и различных групп больных в возрасте от 5 до 70 лет (620) с травмами костей и ортопедическими заболеваниями голени в процессе лечения по Илизарову. Результаты. Обнаружено, что с увеличением возраста у здоровых и больных обследуемых снижается скорость кровотока по сосудам бедра и по средней мозговой артерии при сохранении функциональных резервов сосудистого русла, выявляемых с помощью ишемических или нагрузочных проб. Заключение. Адекватность кровоснабжения предполагает не только соответствие скорости кровотока потребностям органов, но и сохранение при этом резерва функциональной адаптации сосудистой системы, а также возрастное ограничение функциональных способностей органов движения при снижении возможностей сосудистой системы.</jats:p><jats:p>The aim of the study was to expand the existing concept on the adequacy of blood supply as an exact correlation of the amount of delivered blood with energy demands of the tissue; to evaluate reserves of functional adaptation of the vasculature for functional stability of organs; and to assess the capability of tissue metabolism for adjusting to potentialities of the microcirculation. Methods. Conduit vessel and capillary blood flow (occlusion plethysmography, Doppler ultrasound, polarography, laser flowmetry) was studied in healthy subjects (n=157) and different groups of patients aged 5-70 years (620) with bone injuries and orthopedic diseases of the lower leg during the treatment according to Ilizarov. Results. Maximum values of blood flow in main limb arteries were not reached at maximum and average values of capillary blood flow, which were different for different groups of patients. With increasing age, the blood flow velocity in femoral blood vessels and middle cerebral artery decreased while the vasculature functional reserve was maintained as evidenced by ischemic or loading tests. Conclusion. The adequacy of blood supply involves not only matching the blood flow velocity to demands of organs but also maintaining the adaptive reserve of vasculature function as well as the age-related limitation of functional capability of the locomotor system when the vascular system function declines.</jats:p>",

Modern information and communication technologies enable stakeholders to punish buying firms for any sustainability‐related grievances at their suppliers, even in remote locations. This study investigates how the notion of country sustainability risk can inform sustainable supply chain management, in particular with respect to sustainability risk assessment at the individual supplier level. Drawing on institutional theory, we provide insights surrounding the emergence of environmental, social, and governance‐related country‐level sustainability risks and show their implications for and application in sustainable supply chain management. The study employs a design science methodology, based on cooperation with a multidivisional German technology firm, to develop a supply chain sustainability risk (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCSR</jats:styled-content>) map as technological solution design.

The research method is a descriptive of type of survey and target population is employees and managers of Khalessazan Rooy Company in Zanjan. A questionnaire was used to collect data and was distributed among 215 employees and managers of the different levels of the company through random stratified sampling. In this research, the modeling of structural equations and partial least squares (PLS) were used to test the hypotheses and fit the model. The results showed that market orientation was effective on the supply chain management strategies. But its impact on environmental performance was rejected. On the other hand, the indirect effect of market orientation has been confirmed through the intermediate variable of supply chain management strategies. Finally, it was revealed that supply chain management approaches have a positive and significant effect on environmental performance.</jats:p>"

This study was installed to evaluate productive performance of two processing tomato hybrids submitted to five water depths under drip irrigation system. Five levels of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) replacement (60%, 100%, 140%, 180% and 220%) and two tomato hybrids (BRS Sena and H 9992) were tested. The experimental design was a 5×2 factorial arranged in randomized complete block design with four replications. During the crop cycle, hybrids BRS Sena and H 9992 needed 692.20 and 418.43 mm of water, yielding 80 and 44.06 t ha-1, respectively. For both hybrids, the higher water productivity was observed when lower levels of irrigation were applied. Higher productivities and pulp yields of ‘BRS Sena’ and ‘H 9992’ were noticed when replacing 150-166% and 99-101% ETc, respectively. We observed that improving the performance of processing hybrid tomatoes is possible by adjusting irrigation levels for each hybrid according to growing conditions.</jats:p>"

An 18‐item questionnaire were completed by 91 experts in the industry, the results of which were analysed using the partial least square‐path modelling. The results of path modelling indicated that green product development is effective on the social issue through the environmental performance management and the green supply chain management. Moreover, the environmental performance management was found to be directly affected by the green supply chain management. Consequently, some implications were suggested regarding the significance of sustainable supply chain management and the manager's practice.</jats:p>",

No statistically significant differences were evidenced on demographic and preoperative clinical features, except for higher cigarette smoking history incidence in Group A. Those who developed a leak had an ‘hypo-perfused’ conduit at ICG-A in 71.4% and those who do not in only 15.8% (p 0.014). Median time from ICG injection to appearance of fluorescence at the basis of the gastric conduit was significantly longer in Group A than in Group B, 36 sec. (32–43.5) vs 28 sec. (20–39.8) (p 0.04) but median gastric conduit perfusion speed was similar. Patients in Group B had a higher median width of the conduit than Group A, 5cm (5.0–6.0) vs 4 (4.0–5.0) (p 0.032). Post-operative prolonged hypotensive episodes were seen more frequently in Group A than Group B (p 0.028).

Both the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety and the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh have been identified as the two primary facilitators for global apparel industry efforts to actively address this serious human rights issue; thus, they have the potential to help drive the success of the industry's corporate citizenship efforts to successfully manage the issue of fire and building safety in Bangladesh. The article further explores these relationships within the context of the “global corporate citizenship” concept, and develops a rationale for the limits of a socially responsible supply chain. In the context of global corporate citizenship, the article describes the existing state of these two industry organizations remediation efforts to ensure a stable supply chain in Bangladesh, and offers an analysis of existing industry nonmarket strategy approaches to improving contractor's factory fire and building safety environments for their employees. Lastly, a comprehensive set of nonmarket strategies for multinational apparel retailers is recommended when addressing their global corporate citizenship commitments to a safe working environment for Bangladesh garment manufacturing employees.</jats:p>",

He developed bilateral, nondermatomal foot dysesthesia 14 mo prior to presentation, which progressed to numbness below the L3 level. He reported progressive gait instability, bilateral lower extremity weakness, and required a cane for ambulation. He subsequently developed urinary incontinence, while bowel function was spared. The neurological examination upon presentation revealed lower extremity strength was reduced to 4/5 in all major muscle groups bilaterally, while sensation and proprioception were reduced below the L3 level. Patellar and Achilles reflexes were not elicited and clonus was absent. Gait was unsteady and slow. The patient was not able to perform heel, toe and tandem gait. MRI revealed abnormal T2 hyper-intense signal and spinal cord expansion from T6 through the conus medullaris. Angiography revealed a dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) originating from the left T9 radicomedullary pedicle, which also supplied the Artery of Adamkiewicz (AoA). The patient underwent T8-10 laminectomies. Prior to disconnection of the fistula, an aneurysm clip was applied to the fistulous point and an indocyanine green video angiogram was completed to show that the fistula no longer opacified, but that the AoA remained patent, which was later confirmed with angiography. As of discharge, the patient's motor exam had improved substantially, though his sensory deficits persisted.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The South African transport sector is estimated to emit 60 MtCO2eq and require 800 PJ of energy, similar in scale to industrial energy demand and emissions. The sector is forecast to potentially eclipse industry in this regard if conventional vehicle choices and travel modes persist. This paper explores scenarios of transport technology choices and demand in a future of uncertain fuel and technology costs, and the consequences for energy supply and greenhouse gas emissions. It explores the extent of electric vehicle (EV) adoption and the implication of fuel migration from petroleum products. The preference for alternative fuels such as hydrogen, liquid biofuels and natural gas is also investigated. The evolution of road transport in South Africa towards 2050 is investigated utilising the South African TIMES model, a full energy sector least-cost optimisation model that relies on a rich technological database of the entire energy supply and demand system. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are shown to be a viable option in freight and public transport, potentially meeting 70% of travel demand by 2045. The private passenger and light commercial sectors emerge as the main market for electric vehicles, potentially accounting for 80% of new vehicle sales by 2045. Electricity as a transport fuel could account for 30% of fuel supply and reduce transport emissions to half of present day estimates. However, the key uncertainty driving EV adoption is future vehicle costs and crude oil prices, which could dampen EV uptake. Another main finding is that petroleum-dependent vehicles remain an important vehicle class, and that re-investment in existing crude oil refineries to conform to Euro5 standards is a likely requirement. There seems to be little indication, however, that additional refining capacity would be economically viable within the planning horizon.</jats:p>"

The prototype is especially suitable for environments with abundant low frequency motions such as wearable electronics. The proposed e-KEH consists of a capacitor with a finger-teeth interdigited comb structure. This greatly reduces the air damping effect, and thus the capacitance variation remains important regardless of the presence of air. With the new design, the energy transduced per cycle of excitation is no less than 33 times higher than the classic design within 10–40 Hz/2 <jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>peak</jats:sub>, while is 85 times higher at 15 Hz/2 <jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>peak</jats:sub>. An enclosed miniature ball combined with non-linear stoppers enables the oscillation of the movable electrode through impact-based frequency up-conversion mechanism, which is also improved by the low air damping. Thanks to this new design, a higher efficiency than the classic gap-closing comb structure is obtained, as a larger range of working frequency (1–180 Hz) in air. A maximum energy conversion of 450 nJ/cycle is obtained with a bias voltage of 45 V and an acceleration of 11 Hz, 3 <jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>peak</jats:sub>.

For this, a survey was conducted among 386 households in the seven districts of the commune of Sô-Ava. The data collected was analyzed using the XLSTAT 17 software and the Excel Spreadsheet. The results obtained show that in the commune of Sô-Ava, drilling is the most used water source and that nearly 66.33% of households do not cover their containers during the transport of water with a rate that varies from 2.85 to 25.39% from one borough to another. Sô-Ava is the district that has the highest number of latrines is that with a rate of 3.11%. In addition, most households dispose of their garbage and wastewater either in the wild or in the water body in the absence of a waste collection system. The low level of hygiene and sanitation observed could affect the quality of drinking water and hence the health of the population.</jats:p>"

To enhance the concentration of the residual chlorine in the public water-supply system of a part of Souk Ahras city (Faubourg) (Algeria) known by its low concentration of the free residual chlorine (according to the water utility – Algérienne des Eaux: ADE investigation) especially at the point of use, practical steps were carried out. The method is a combination between numerical simulation using EPANET2 software and field measurements. Using statistical analysis the hydraulic model was calibrated and the observed values were very closer to the simulated results.

However, complaints about drinking water quality are a common issue among the Brazilian population. Also, due to the pollution of water bodies, social groups that are not supplied by treated water may be exposed to different contaminants. The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of a water treatment tank coupled with UV light on the inactivation of enteric viruses and the reduction of chlorine concentration for use in residences, as well as in rural and isolated communities. Viral disinfection and chlorine concentration decay assays were performed in a tank with capacity of 300 L and a 36-W UV lamp coupled, with controlled temperature. Recombinant human adenovirus (AdHu5-GFP) and murine norovirus (MNV-1) infectivity were assessed after 0, 3, 6 and 12 h of water recirculation. 99.99% inactivation was reached after 12 h for AdHu5-GFP and before 6 h for MNV-1. Chlorine concentration had a decay of 0.77 mg/L after 12 h. Regarding the efficiency observed, a product model was designed. This tank model was efficient in ensuring viral inactivation as well as in reducing residual chlorine and can be adjusted to other scales.</jats:p>",

The goal of the design is to regulate the oxygen excess ratio (OER) towards its optimal set point value in the PEMFC air‐supply subsystem. Hence, an algebraic estimation approach is used to reconstruct the OER based on a robust differentiation method. The proposed observer is known for its finite‐time convergence and low computational time compared to other observers presented in the literature. Then, a twisting controller is designed to control the OER by manipulating the compressor motor voltage. The parameters of the twisting controller have been calculated by means of an off‐line tuning procedure. The performance of the proposed algebraic‐observer‐based output‐feedback controller is analysed through simulations for different stack‐current changes, for parameter uncertainties, and for noise rejection. Results show that the proposed approach properly estimates and regulates the OER in finite‐time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As one of the lifeline projects, an urban gas network is a complex system, as it requires maintenance of the supply capacity when\nany single pipeline is isolated due to failure. For such a system, its reliability needs to be evaluated. Considering that existing\nstructural reliability and hydraulic reliability analyses reflect different aspects of the working conditions of an urban gas network,\nsystem reliability theory is employed to explain that only the gas supply reliability can achieve a comprehensive evaluation of the\nwork capacity of the entire urban gas network, as it takes into account the combined influence of the structural reliability and\nhydraulic reliability. To calculate the parameters in the gas supply reliability evaluation, such as pipeline failure rate, flow reduction in the gas network under different failure conditions, etc., some research achievements in the field of structural reliability\nand hydraulic reliability are fully utilized. Then, the detailed calculation procedures of these parameters are given to evaluate the\ngas supply reliability in terms of operational and practical considerations. Finally, using an example of a simple double-loop gas\nnetwork, the detailed process of the gas supply reliability evaluation of an urban gas network is described, and the feasibility of\nthis evaluation method is also illustrated.</jats:p>"

A simplified Kloss formula is widely used for describing speed-torque characteristic because it is fairly simple. Only two parameters related to break-down torque and break-down slip are regarded as input parameters. Because this simplified formula ignores an unknown parameter that is a ratio between Thevenin’s and rotor resistances, an accurate torque curve characteristic may not be fully obtained over an entire speed range. Moreover, the conventional Kloss formula does not offer a speed-torque curve calculation when motor’s supply voltages and frequencies are deviated from rated values.

Considering the demand uncertainty and demand forecast, we analyze the information sharing strategy under these two warranty policies. Our results show that the manufacturer has an incentive to share the demand forecast information under both warranty policies when the cost efficiency in providing a warranty is high, which is different from the existing literature on the incentive for demand information sharing in the supply chain. Moreover, we find that it will hurt the party who determines the warranty period but benefit the other party.</jats:p>",

Labor supply responses are considered along both intensive and extensive margins. Our quantitative results are consistent with those of the existing empirical literature. First, we find that a decline in tax progressivity associated with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 has a significant impact on the aggregate labor supply with approximately 61 percent occurred along the extensive margin. Second, households differ in their labor and income responses to tax reform. A decline in tax progressivity changes the income composition of each household by affecting labor supplies and asset holdings. This leads to an increase in income inequality. Therefore, the tax share paid by the most educated group rises due to an increase in capital income after tax reforms are instituted.</jats:p>",

This novel design enables the microbial fuel cell (MFC) systems to be easily adjusted in situ by changing anode distance to the membrane or anodic volume without the necessity of building many trial-and-error prototypes for each condition. A maximum power output of 20.7 ± 1.9 µW was obtained with an optimal reactor configuration; 2 mM acetate concentration in the feedstock coupled with a flow rate of 77 mL h−1, an anodic volume of 10 mL and an anode electrode surface area of 70 cm2 (2.9 cm2 projected area), using a 1 cm anode distance from the membrane. COD removal almost showed the reverse pattern with power generation, which suggests trade-off correlation between these two parameters, in this particular example. This novel design may be most conveniently employed for generating empirical data for testing and creating new MFC designs with appropriate practical and theoretical modelling.</jats:p>"

Thirty water samples were collected from 15 wells in dry and wet seasons, 2017. Electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids as well as major ions of all samples were within the World Health Organization (WHO) permissible limits for drinking water. In contrast, nine wells had pH beyond the WHO limit during the dry season and one well had very high NO3- concentration in the wet season. Most wells were seriously polluted with total Cr (CrT) in both seasons (11 and 14 wells in dry and wet seasons, respectively). Although Pb was not detected in the wells during the dry season, six wells showed Pb concentrations exceeding the WHO guideline limit for drinking water in the wet season. Graphic interpretation, including the Piper diagram, major ion ratios and Na/Cl versus EC, were used to characterize the hydrochemistry and water &amp;ndash; rock interaction within the wells. The dominant hydrochemical facies of the wells was Ca-HCO3 during the dry season, reflecting the influence of silicate weathering. Following loadings of agricultural and domestic effluent, the hydrochemical facies shifted to more mixed type during the wet season. All samples had negative chloro-alkaline indices, suggesting retention of Ca2+ and Mg2+ by the aquifer materials and release of Na+ and K+ into the groundwater. In addition to silicate weathering, the hydrochemistry and water quality of the majority of the wells were partially controlled by the evaporation process and longer water&amp;ndash;rock interaction in the dry season. In contrast, recharge and dilution effects appeared to alter the natural hydrochemistry of the wells in the wet season. Geochemical characterization has clearly shown that seasonal changes do affect the dug well water quality. The study also demonstrated that, in terms of CrT and Pb, water from the majority of the wells was not suitable for drinking. A special attention should be therefore paid to groundwater quality protection in the </jats:p>"

Most prevailing methods of addressing this problem take one of two contrasting approaches—that is, (1) price subsidization or (2) benefits/cash transfers. The former has been heavily studied in the literature with the consensus being that it is highly inefficient and prone to leaks. We investigate the viability of the latter by focusing on how branching out to reach the poorest customers impacts the performance of banks. Results indicate that the impacts of this approach are deleterious, thereby questioning its commercial scalability. Therefore, we argue that this approach may also have only limited potential in terms of being an effective, large‐scale solution to the problem of access for the poor.

The fuzzy integral method is applied to avoid inconsistent assumptions between the interdependence relation and linear aggregation for obtaining the aspiration-gaps of green suppliers. Last, the visualized dashboard allows for a clear representation of the interdependent-network structure of the attributes to assist companies in the selection of suitable suppliers, as well as assisting the suppliers in improving their performance with higher levels of service. A Taiwanese Electronics Company is demonstrated as an example. The results demonstrate that the dashboard can enable managers to make better decisions from a systematic perspective.</jats:p>",

Regulatory initiatives in the emerging policy regime complex struggle to resolve sector‐wide structural performance issues: pervasive land conflicts, yield differences between companies and smallholders, and carbon emissions arising from deforestation and peatland conversion. Identifying opportunities for more effective governance of the palm oil value chain and supply landscapes, this paper explores disconnects, complementarities, and antagonisms between public regulations and private standards, looking at the global, national, and subnational policy domains shaping chain actors’ conduct. Greater complementarities have emerged among transnational instruments, but state regulation disconnects persist and antagonisms prevail between national state regulations and transnational private standards. Emerging experimental approaches, particularly at subnational level, aim to improve coordination to both enhance complementarities and resolve disconnects.</jats:p>",

A MATLAB programming is develop and field of sustainable supply chain is use as experiment purpose. There is one out of four criteria need to be selected by using FAHP. The criteria are cost, quality, delivery time and supplier distance. Both methods are done simultaneously and the answers were recorded. The percentage accuracy shows 100% for every step showing there is no error and the answers are the same if MATLAB is applied.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Heterogeneous data collected by smartphone sensors offer new opportunities to study a person’s mobility behavior. The mobility patterns extracted from the travel histories found in these data enable agents residing in mobile devices to model transitions between visited locations, so that upcoming trips can be predicted after observing a set of events, and assistance can be planned in advance. When several agents cooperate, the forecasted trips made by multiple users can provide a potential supply for shared mobility systems such as dynamic ridesharing. These trips must be sufficiently regular and frequent to be reliably announced as shareable trips. This paper describes a methodology to identify a predictable aggregate supply for ridesharing via mobility patterns discovered in users’ travel histories. The methodology empirically quantifies measures like the regularity and frequency of these patterns on a dataset consisting of 967 users scattered across different geographical areas. The sample exhibits high heterogeneity with respect to these measures (hence, of predictability, regardless of the prediction method). This paper shows how frequency of trip patterns decreases, while regularity increases, when additional dimensions such as departure times are added to the analysis. It was concluded that the traveler flexibility with regard to accepting less regular trips is vital to discover a larger supply. These results provide insights to develop future applications able to take advantage of this approach, to increase ridesharing rates, allowing a critical mass to be more easily attained. </jats:p>",

To address the uncertain cost information, we propose a decision rule based on confidence levels to measure the goals of the supply chain participants. We provide the new concept of the belief‐degree cost of a supply chain that embodies the decision maker's ability to comprehensively address information uncertainty and control the risk caused by information uncertainty. We find that regardless of which of the three games it is in – integrated, hybrid, or decentralized – a chain should order more and thereby gain more profit when its cost uncertainty increases or the competing chain's cost uncertainty decreases. The chain with a low or sufficiently low belief‐degree cost gains a competitive advantage on both quantity and profit. A chain's competitiveness can be enhanced by either decreasing its confidence level or increasing its rival's confidence level. Furthermore, we demonstrate that supply chain integration is the dominant strategy for given confidence levels. Nevertheless, a prisoner's dilemma occurs when the differences in the belief‐degree costs of the two supply chains are not significant and the competitive intensity is high. In addition, the magnitudes of the confidence levels can be changed to avoid or cause a prisoner's dilemma. Finally, under different confidence levels, the Stackelberg model for competing hybrid or decentralized supply chains is extended to the bargaining model, and the impact of bargaining power on supply chain competition is analyzed.</jats:p>",

The capacitor static voltage imbalance during HVDC system start‐up stage has become a key issue. This study presents a new capacitor static voltage balance method based on auxiliary‐power supply (APS) pulse width control for MMC. The control signal of APS can be generated by comparing the modulation signal for voltage closed‐loop control with the carrier signal with fixed frequency. An AND gate circuit is used to improve the APS Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) driving circuits. Based on these circuits, the input current of APS can be regulated, and the capacitor voltage can be controlled. Since only the inherent sub‐module (SM) APS is needed in this method, it has low hardware costs. The control strategy in this method is simple, and it has no restrictions on the SM number. This determines that the presented method has a wider range of application. Furthermore, the value of equalising resistor is increased, and the losses of SM and MMC are reduced in this method. Experimental results from the laboratory prototype verify the effectiveness of the presented method.</jats:p>",

The supplier estimated the demand with excessive precision which influences the inventory financing decision-making deeply. We built the demand function based on the supplier’s overconfidence. Then we established the retailer, supplier, and the Bank’s profit function, respectively. Through the analysis of the bilevel Stackelberg game, we obtained the order quantity of the retailer with the capital constraint, the wholesale price of overconfident supplier, and the loan-to-value ratio of Bank, and we analyzed the influence of overconfidence on the decision variables. We have several findings as follows. First, the overconfidence makes the decisions of the retailer, supplier, and Bank deviate from the rational decisions. Second, the space of the market profit will affect the decision variables in the joint decision-making. Third, the financing supply chain (including the Bank and supply chain) should have a positive attitude towards the overconfidence of the supplier. Forth, in the joint decision-making, the supplier need determines the buyback price according to the capital demand; and in the decentralized decision-making, the supplier should try to use high buyback price strategy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Debris-covered glacier tongues in the Himalaya play an important role in the high-altitude water cycle. The thickness of the debris layer is a key control of the melt rate of those tongues, yet little is known about the relative importance of the three potential sources of debris supply to those glaciers: the headwalls, the glacier bed or the lateral moraines. In this study we hypothesize that erosion from the lateral moraines is a significant debris supply to the debris-covered tongues, in particular when the tongue is disconnected from the headwall due to glacier downwasting. To test this hypothesis eight high-resolution and highly accurate digital elevation models for the lateral moraines of the debris-covered Lirung glacier in Nepal derived from an unmanned aerial vehicle between May 2013 and April 2018 are used. The analysis shows that the lateral moraines erode at an average rate of 0.31 ± 0.26 m yr−1 during this period driven by different erosion processes. There is also a higher erosion rate observed in the monsoon season (0.42 m yr−1) than in the dry season (0.25 m yr−1). In addition the loose lower parts of the lateral moraines erode at a faster rate during both seasons. These erosion rates translate into an annual increase in debris thickness ranging from 0.17 m yr−1 when the eroded material is distributed over the entire glacier to 0.29 m yr−1 in case the material is deposited in a narrow runout zone. It is concluded that the lateral moraines provide an important source of surface debris for glaciers in an advanced state of mass loss, and the source needs to be incorporated into models of glacier evolution. Further research should focus on how large this negative feedback is in controlling the melt of the tongues and a better understanding of the redistribution of debris on the tongue is therefore required.\n                        </jats:p>"

We have reported the three blood supply routes to the reconstructed stomach using ICG fluorescence imaging for reconstruction during esophagectomy. Blood flow routes in the 33 patients with esophageal cancer were classified into categories on the basis of ICG imaging findings: the gastric wall route, the greater curvature route, and the omentum and splenic hiatal route. The gastric wall route was found in 13 patients and characterized by large blood vessels in the gastric wall. The greater curvature route was present in 11 patients and characterized by blood vessels in the greater omentum. The omentum and beside splenic hilum route was found in 22 patients. Blood vessels ran in the greater omentum beside the splenic hilum. a photodynamic eye (PDE) showed blood flow from right gastroepiploic artery, omentum vessels, left gastroepiploic artery, splenic hiatal vessels, short gastric artery, and gastric wall vessels to the top of the reconstructed stomach. The ‘splenic hiatal route’ was present in 66.7% of the patients and was formed by large vessels or networks of small vessels. We rechecked the ‘splenic hiatal route’ cases and recognize that the branch parted from the right gastroepiploic artery.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The issue of efficiency analysis of network and multi-stage systems, as one of the most interesting fields in data envelopment analysis (DEA), has attracted much attention in recent years. A pure serial three-stage (PSTS) process is a specific kind of network in which all the outputs of the first stage are used as the only inputs in the second stage and in addition, all the outputs of the second stage are applied as the only inputs in the third stage. In this paper, a new three-stage DEA model is developed using the concept of three-player Nash bargaining game for PSTS processes. In this model, all of the stages cooperate together to improve the overall efficiency of main decision-making unit (DMU). In contrast to the centralized DEA models, the proposed model of this study provides a unique and fair decomposition of the overall efficiency among all three stages and eliminates probable confusion of centralized models for decomposing the overall efficiency score. Some theoretical aspects of proposed model, including convexity and compactness of feasible region, are discussed. Since the proposed bargaining model is a nonlinear mathematical programming, a heuristic linearization approach is also provided. A numerical example and a real-life case study in supply chain are provided to check the efficacy and applicability of the proposed model. The results of proposed model on both numerical example and real case study are compared with those of existing centralized DEA models in the literature. The comparison reveals the efficacy and suitability of proposed model while the pitfalls of centralized DEA model are also resolved. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is also conducted on the breakdown point associated with each stage. </jats:p>",

The intense global competitive scenario have generated new forms of competition for the various players. Faced with the unstable and complex environment, organizations need to focus their efforts on shared strategies. Agribusiness presents a set of specificities that lead to greater complexity to manage the activities. Regarding the agro industrial fruit pulp chain, this dynamic becomes even more complex, considering the peculiarities of the sector. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the fruit pulp chain from the perspective of the business processes of Supply Chain Management (SCM). To do so, eight business processes were considered for the qualitative analysis supported by the bibliographical research on a well-known scientific basis such as Web of Science, Scopus and Ebsco. Considering the study of a current phenomenon and according to the profile of the research agents, it is a multiple case study applied in four fruit pulp processing agroindustries. The results describe the business processes and the activities that compose it in the fruit pulp sector, allowing understanding the synchronous and dependent relationship between the processes, as well as the importance of information sharing in the dynamics among all activities.</jats:p>"

Based on the game theoretic models, optimal solutions for the two supply chains are derived with different consumers’ preference for low-carbon products. Through the discussion, we uncovered the influence of consumers’ preference on price and demand and the relationship between the influence coefficient of retailers’ promotional effort on consumers’ utility and retailer profits. In addition, given the increase of government’s low-carbon production subsidy, two supply chains will both more likely choose low-carbon production. Interestingly, under the government subsidy, the profit of manufacturer will increase or decrease more than its retailer and the market structure will not change if the two supply chains have chosen low-carbon production.</jats:p>"

The proposed topology operates with pulsating waveforms and allows unidirectional energy flow from the power supply to the load with no energy return. Furthermore, due to the multi‐stage operation, it presents a lower stress in the switches compared with other similar topologies. To validate the proposed topology, a prototype was designed to feed a set of ozone generating cells in a power range of 0 to 500 W. This prototype provides an efficiency of 95% with an ozone production of 10.5 g/h and efficacy of 22.89 g/kWh. The proposed power supply is an alternative to feed any other type of dielectric barrier discharge load while keeping the efficiency of the power supply above 90%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management and integration play a key factor in contemporary manufacturing concept. Companies seek to integrate itself within a cooperative and mutual benefiting supply chain. Supply chain scheduling, as an important aspect of supply chain management, highly emphasizes on minimizing stock costs and delivery costs. Most previous researches on supply chain scheduling problems assume make-to-order production, which includes delivery cost in lot-size. This practice simplifies the complexity of the problem. Instead, this research discusses make-to-contract production, where the supply chain has a rolling planning horizon that changes according to contracts. Within a planning horizon, two types of interval are defined. The first is frozen interval, in which the manufacturing decision cannot be changed. The second is free interval, where schedules can be adjusted depending on new contracts. This research aims to build a robust rolling supply management schedule to satisfy customers’ needs, by considering supplier, production, and delivery lot-size simultaneously. The objective is to effectively decide a combination of supplier, production, and delivery lot-size that minimizes total cost consisting of supplier cost, finish good stock cost, and delivery cost. Based on the concept, this study designs a problem-solving process that combines the methods of rolling planning horizon and genetic algorithm. Delivery size (DS), finish good stock (FS), and early delivery cost (ED) are the three methods applied; each will provide a guideline to produce a feasible solution. By further considering the fluctuations in practical needs and performing an overall evaluation, a robust and optimal supply chain scheduling plan can be decided, including the optimal lot-sizes of supplier, production, and delivery. In the effectiveness test which considers 3 types of customer demands and 11 types of company cost structures, the simulated data test results suggest that the proposed methods in this study have excellent performance.</jats:p>",

We established experimentally evolving populations in which we varied the assistance that parents provided for their offspring and investigated how offspring evolved in response. We show that in populations where parents predictably supplied more care, larval mandibles evolved to be smaller in relation to larval mass, and larvae were correspondingly less self-sufficient. Previous work has shown that antagonistic social interactions can generate escalating evolutionary arms races.

The postharvest supply chain with microbial travelers (PSCMT) model, presented here, provides a unique tool for postharvest supply chain simulations to evaluate microbial contamination. The tool was validated through modeling an observed tomato supply chain. Visualization of dynamic contamination levels from harvest to the supermarket and analysis of the model parameters highlighted critical points where intervention may prevent microbial levels sufficient to cause foodborne illness.

Since the supplier can be negative to adopt RFID, the main objective of this study is to design an effective mechanism that maximizes the profits of both players and the whole supply chain by implementing item‐level RFID. For this objective, we propose a novel revenue‐cost‐sharing (RCS) contract based on the bargaining game as the incentive to encourage the implementation, and numerical results show that the RCS contract is considerably more effective than the wholesale‐price contract for supply chain coordination. Moreover, we show that the retail supply chain can be coordinated perfectly under the RCS contract when the thresholds of the revenue/cost sharing rates are set appropriately. This study provides significant managerial insight into the incentive and coordination strategy to implement item‐level RFID in the retail supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As the primary means of refined products transportation, multi-product pipeline plays a vital role in connecting refineries to local markets. Once disruptions occur, it will cause security issue on oil supply to downstream markets, even on the economy and stability of society. Based on the conventional reliability theory and detailed scheduling method of multi-product pipeline considering hydraulic constraints, this paper firstly proposes a multi-module systemic approach for the supply reliability analysis of multi-product pipeline under pump units failure conditions. Pump units are important corollary equipment in multi-product pipeline and their failure would affect the pipeline normal operation and downstream oil supply greatly. The approach includes three modules, namely, pump units analysis module, pipeline system analysis module and reliability evaluation module. In the pump units analysis module, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method is adopted to analyse the correlations between pump units failure modes and causes. The Monte Carlo simulation method is employed to generate different failure scenarios based on the estimated failure rate of pump units. In the pipeline system analysis module, the detailed scheduling method of multi-product pipeline is adopted to calculate the maximum supply capacity for all delivery stations under a specific scenario. Due to the difficulty in solving detailed scheduling problem considering hydraulic constraints directly, two mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models are established. In the reliability evaluation module, the indexes of shortage, probability and adequacy are calculated to analyse the supply reliability quantitatively from global perspective and individual perspective. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to a real-world multi-product pipeline in Zhejiang, China. It is proved that this approach could provide significant guidelines for the supply reliability analysis of multi-product pipeline.</jats:p>",

The results indicated the arc produced an obvious effect of pulsed pressure, due to the argon-arc and helium-arc stroked in turn in the process of argon and helium supply alternately at 1 Hz frequency.

Supply inadequacy risk can result from climate‐induced shifts in electricity demand and/or damaged physical assets due to hydro‐meteorological hazards and climate change. In this article, we focus on the risks associated with the unanticipated climate‐induced demand shifts and propose a data‐driven approach to identify risk factors that render the electricity sector vulnerable in the face of future climate variability and change. More specifically, we have leveraged advanced supervised learning theory to identify the key predictors of climate‐sensitive demand in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. Our analysis indicates that variations in mean dew point temperature is the common major risk factor across all the three sectors. We have also conducted a statistical sensitivity analysis to assess the variability in the projected demand as a function of the key climate risk factor. We then propose the use of scenario‐based heat maps as a tool to communicate the inadequacy risks to stakeholders and decisionmakers. While we use the state of Ohio as a case study, our proposed approach is equally applicable to all other states.</jats:p>",

Data was extracted from the 2015 World Bank Vietnam District and Commune Health Facility Survey. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was applied to identify associations of CHCs’ access to improved water and sanitation and their medical waste management. Overall, 72.76% CHCs had access to both improved water and sanitation facilities, and better access was found in the richest communes. Rural CHCs had higher prevalence of appropriate wastewater treatment. The majority of CHCs combusted medical solid wastes by specialized incinerations, contracted out with sanitation companies, or transported them to district health centers. However, the data was insufficient to give in-depth analysis and conclusion on water and sanitation conditions and the management of medical wastes at CHCs. More information should be collected for further analysis and conclusion. </jats:p>",

The results show that a centralized market can lead to improvement in total profit. Furthermore, based on an improved Shapley value method, a theoretical model for the centralized market income distribution mechanism is developed that incorporates three corrective risk factors, ecological investment, and technological level. Finally, a numerical analysis is conducted using a MATLAB simulation to obtain intuitive results, which, in turn, show the validity of incentive income distribution mechanisms for green supply chain development in China.</jats:p>"

Floating cells were prepared by vegetating plants, Typha domingensis and Leptochloa fusca, on a floating mat. The plants were inoculated with three different pollutant-degrading rhizospheric and endophytic bacterial strains. Significantly greater decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and total organic carbon (TOC) was observed in inoculated FTWs than in the wetlands without bacterial inoculation. However, a slight decrease in pH and EC was seen in most of the treatments. The total nitrogen (TN), nitrate and total phosphorus (TP) contents decreased to 1.77 mg/L, 0.80 mg/L and 0.60 mg/L, respectively. Additionally, the concentration of iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), and chromium (Cr) in the water lowered to 0.41, 0.16, 0.10, 0.25, and 0.08 mg/L, respectively. Overall the performance of T. domingensis was significantly better than L. fusca. The treated effluents meet the water quality guidelines for irrigation and aquatic life. This study revealed that FTWs supplemented with selective bacteria are a promising approach for the restoration and management of polluted river water.</jats:p>",

The opposite effects exerted by the enhanced photosynthate supply at vegetative stage versus at reproductive stage on yield performance could be associated with its distinguished roles in influencing plant physiology at the two growth stages.

Fly ash, activated carbon, corncob and plant ash were tested to determine the best adsorbent by their adsorption capacity. Plant ash showed the highest adsorption capacity compared with the others. Different parameters such as solution pH and adsorbent dose were explored. The maximum As(V) removal efficiency was 91.4% at the optimized conditions (pH 9.0, adsorbent dose 5 g/L) when the initial concentration of As(V) was 15 mg/L. With the ADS/DEP technique, the plant ash particles with adsorbed As(V) were trapped on the electrodes in a DEP device. The ADS/DEP process could increase the removal efficiency of As(V) to 94.7% at 14 V even when the initial concentration of As(V) was 15 mg/L. And the residual concentration of As(V) decreased to 0.34 mg/L after two series of the ADS/DEP process. The adsorbents before and after DEP were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. After the DEP process, the weight percentage of As(V) on the adsorbent surface increased to 0.96% from 0.5%. The ADS/DEP process could be a new efficient way to remove arsenic pollutant at high concentrations.</jats:p>",

We use TISM to explain the interrelationships among variables and the FANP to calculate specific scores for each candidate. We illustrate an application of the proposed hybrid model using a case study from the Chinese food industry. The result demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of combining TISM and the FANP for socially responsible supplier selection.

Firstly, based on the analysis of the influencing factors, an urban agglomeration transport demand structure model was established using entropy theory. Secondly, according to the actual passenger and freight turnover of urban agglomeration, a transport supply structure model was proposed with entropy theory. Then, by comparing the two entropy models, the equilibrium state of an urban agglomeration transport structure was analyzed. Finally, HuBaoOr urban agglomeration was taken as an example to verify the science and effectiveness of this discriminant model. The research in this paper lays a theoretical foundation for the achievement of urban agglomeration transport equilibrium structure and for realizing the best economic benefits and social benefits.</jats:p>",

The oxygen-uptake rate (OUR) was positively correlated with volumetric surfactin productivity. When OUR value increased from 0 to 250 s−1, productivity increased up to 45 mg/L·h; however, no further increase was observed at OUR values above 255 s−1. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient KLa increased with increasing agitation speed. However, a reduction in surfactin production was observed at the highest agitation speed of 500 rpm. Productivity sharply decreased after spore appearance, and remained low until the end of the culture. A mesh-type sparger was installed to generate microsized air bubbles. When the system was operated at 400 rpm with the mesh-type sparger, KLa was higher than that at 500 rpm with an original sparger. Under agitation at 400 rpm with the mesh-type sparger, productivity was maintained above 42.3 mg/L·h until 24 h, resulting in the highest surfactin concentration of 875 mg/L. Thus, a mesh-type sparger promotes KLa, leading to an increase in productivity.</jats:p>"

In this study, the energy release rate from ethanol and glucose under different aerate rate were compared, and the relationship between energy metabolism and acetic acid fermentation was analyzed. The results imply that proper oxygen supply can maintain the reasonable energy metabolism and cell tolerance to improve the acetic acid fermentation. Further, the transcriptions of genes that involve in the ethanol oxidation, TCA cycle, ATP synthesis and tolerance protein expression were analyzed to outline the effect of oxygen supply on cell metabolism of Acetobacter pasteurianus. Under the direction of energy metabolism framework a rational two-stage oxygen supply strategy was established to release the power consumption and substrates volatilization during acetic acid fermentation. As a result, the acetic acid production rate of 1.86 g/L/h was obtained, which were 20.78% higher than that of 0.1 vvm one-stage aerate rate. And the final acetic acid concentration and the stoichiometric yield were 88.5 g/L and 94.1%, respectively, which were 84.6 g/L and 89.5% for 0.15 vvm one-stage aerate rate.</jats:p>",

We prove that the production fluctuations can be interestingly smoothed and stabilized independent of the delivery frequency of the manufacturer used to satisfy the retailer’s demand, even if the retailer subsystem is unstable. The sufficient and necessary stability condition for the whole supply chain system is obtained. To further explore the production fluctuation problem, the bullwhip effect under unknown demand is explored based on a transfer function model with the purpose of disclosing the influences of parameters on production fluctuations. Finally, simulation experiments are used to validate the theoretical results with respect to inventory and production fluctuations.</jats:p>",

The measured inventory of an element divided by the derived supply yields a replacement time estimate, which in special circumstances is related to a residence time. As a proof of concept, Th‐based supply rates imply a range in the replacement times of the rare earth elements in the North Atlantic that is consistent with the chemical reactivity of rare earth elements related to their ionic charge density. Similar estimates of replacement times for the bioactive trace elements (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cd, Cu, and Co), ranging from &lt;5 years to &gt;50,000 years, demonstrate the broad range of elemental reactivity in the ocean. Here we discuss how variations in source composition, fractional solubility ratios, or noncontinental sources, such as hydrothermal vents, lead to uncertainties in Th‐based replacement time estimates. We show that the constraints on oceanic replacement time provided by the Th‐based calculations are broadly applicable in predicting how elements are distributed in the ocean and for some elements, such as Fe, may inform us on how the carbon cycle may be impacted by trace element supply and removal.</jats:p>",

Other non-replicative histone variants deposited throughout the cell cycle at specific loci use pathways uncoupled from DNA synthesis. Here, we review the particular dynamics of expression, cellular transit, assembly, and disassembly of replicative and non-replicative forms of the histone H3. Beyond the role of histone variants in chromatin dynamics, we review our current knowledge concerning their distinct regulation to control their expression at different levels including transcription, posttranscriptional processing, and protein stability. In light of this unique regulation, we highlight situations where perturbations in histone balance may lead to cellular dysfunction and pathologies.</jats:p>",
