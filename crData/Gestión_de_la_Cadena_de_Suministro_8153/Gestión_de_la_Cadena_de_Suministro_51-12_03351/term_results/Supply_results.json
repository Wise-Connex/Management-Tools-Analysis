Not only are teacher-education workers alert, but elementary- and high-school adminis trators, school-board members, P. T. A. chapters, chambers of commerce, and various other groups and individuals are beginning to show concern. Since we know that the elementary schools of America must receive, house, and teach 7,000,000 more children within the next six years the historical background of the problem, outlined by Mr. Maaske, President, Oregon College of Education, Monmouth, is of particular interest, as are his thought-pro voking suggestions for action. </jats:p>",
