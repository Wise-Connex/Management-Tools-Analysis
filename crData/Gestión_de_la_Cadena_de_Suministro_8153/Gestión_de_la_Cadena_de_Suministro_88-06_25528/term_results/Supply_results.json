Moreover, its importance is growing as exploration and production activities are extended to progressively deeper water and harsher weather conditions. However, no systematic approach for ensuring effective logistic support has yet been realized. A method of studying the characteristics of logistic support and of designing a system for securing effective supply to an offshore rig is proposed. It is based on event simulation modeling of offshore supply operations, together with more conventional technical and economic models for yielding economic criteria which take into account a possible interruption of drilling operations. The method has been developed through a detailed investigation of each component of the supply operation and of the inherent problems. To evaluate the feasibility of the approach, an example has been provided.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:italic>This</jats:italic> Briefing Paper <jats:italic>describes a new version of the London Business School model, which incorporates our most recent research on the supply side. The changes reflect the desire to improve the specification of the supply‐side of the model, and to capture the effects of taxes on the incentives to save, invest and to work, while still retaining the basic features of the income‐expenditure framework. The main features of the new model are:</jats:italic></jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>‐ Gross domestic product is determined as the sum of the outputs of five sectors. Previously GDP was determined by the demand side as the sum of the expenditure components</jats:italic>.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>‐ Domestic demand for the output of the private sector depends on domestic absorption and on the price of this output relative to import prices. Overseas demand for exports depends on world economic activity and on the price of exports relative to the world price of exports</jats:italic>.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>‐ Supply depends on the capital stock, real unit labour costs and real raw material prices. In the short run, input prices are allowed to affect the mix between goods which are exported and those which are supplied to the domestic market. In the long run, however, the mix depends only on the price of exports relative to the price of domestically supplied goods (i.e., relative profitability</jats:italic>).</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>‐ In the short run, disequilibrium in the goods market is reflected in adjustments to prices, inventories and the external balance</jats:italic>.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>‐ Since gross domestic product is determined by summing the output of each sector, output decisions are reconciled with expenditure decisions by making imports the difference between final expenditure and aggregate supply</jats:italic>.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>‐ In the long run, increases in government expenditure crowd out private expenditure, but the effect takes several years to come through</jats:italic>.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>‐ A cut in corporation taxes which is not financed by higher taxes elsewhere boosts the supply side by raising investment and the capital stock, but not by enough to raise revenues sufficiently to pay for the tax cut. Private sector saving increases but not by enough to fund higher public sector borrowing, so the current account goes into deficit</jats:italic>.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>‐ In the short run, both supply and demand factors influence economic activity; in the long run, the path of the economy depends only on population growth, capital accumulation and technical progress</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

In four villages, all with large open reservoirs (hafirs), the one‐year period prevalence was over 34 per cent, and was not strongly related to age. In the remaining 23 villages, the prevalence did not exceed 20 per cent but was greater in adults than in children. The former pattern suggested contamination of the water carried home, while the latter appeared to be associated with casual use of water sources outside the village. Guinea worm disease was associated with the use of certain water sources, particularly in the poorly‐maintained hafirs, but not with hand pumps, when these functioned, or open dug wells. In this context, open dug wells seem to be a more cost‐effective intervention for guinea worm control than boreholes with hand pumps or the rehabilitation of hafirs.</jats:p>",

The effects of these parameters on the final yarn properties have been investigated using instability, linear density, and strength tests, together with SEM photographs for visual assessment of the yarn structure. Optimizing any given yarn property almost always affects other yarn characteristics, and therefore this must be remembered when selecting suitable process parameters and supply yarns for specific end uses. For a given texturing nozzle and conditions, there is an optimum filament fineness and number of filaments that can be textured effectively. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When systemic delivery of oxygen (QO2 = blood flow X arterial O2 content) is reduced, the systemic O2 extraction ratio [(CaO2 - CVO2)/CaO2; where CaO2 is arterial O2 content and CVO2 is venous O2 content] increases until a critical limit is reached below which O2 uptake (VO2) becomes limited by delivery. Patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis exhibit supply dependence of VO2 even at high levels of QO2, which suggests that a peripheral O2 extraction defect may be present. We tested the hypothesis that endotoxemia might produce a similar defect in the efficacy of tissue O2 extraction by determining the whole-body critical systemic QO2 (QO2 c) and critical extraction ratio in a control group of dogs and a group receiving a 5-mg/kg dose of Escherichia coli endotoxin. QO2 c was determined in each group by measuring VO2 as QO2 was gradually reduced by bleeding. The VO2 and QO2 of an isolated segment of small intestine were also measured to determine whether O2 extraction was impaired within a local region of tissue. The dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated with room air. Systemic QO2 was reduced in stages by hemorrhage as hematocrit was maintained. The systemic and intestinal critical points were determined from a plot of VO2 vs. QO2. The mean systemic QO2 c and critical O2 extraction ratio of the endotoxemic group (12.8 +/- 2.0 and 0.54 +/- 0.11 ml.min-1.kg-1) were significantly different from control (6.8 +/- 1.2 and 0.78 +/- 0.04) (P less than 0.001), indicating that endotoxin administration impaired systemic extraction of O2. Endotoxin also increased base-line systemic VO2 [6.1 +/- 0.7 (before) to 7.4 +/- 0.1 (after)] (P less than 0.001). The critical and maximal intestinal O2 extraction ratios of the endotoxemic group (0.47 +/- 0.10 and 0.71 +/- 0.04) were significantly less than control (0.69 +/- 0.06 and 0.83 +/- 0.05) (P less than 0.001). In addition, intestinal reactive hyperemia disappeared in six of seven endotoxemic dogs, whereas it remained intact in all control dogs. Thus endotoxin reduced the ability of tissues to extract O2 from a limited supply at the whole body level as well as within a 40- to 50-g segment of small intestine. These results could be explained by a defect in microvascular regulation of blood flow that interfered with the optimal distribution of a limited QO2 in accordance with tissue O2 needs. </jats:p>",

This was done to explain how optical absorbance changes corresponding to parallel reduction of cytochromes aa3, b, and cc1 were observed in perfused pancreas stimulated with high concentration of an exocrine secretagogue such as cholecystokinin-(26–33) (CCK-8). With perfusion flow rate between 1.5 and 3.0 ml/min, there were no optical absorbance changes corresponding to cytochrome reduction, but these optical absorbance changes occurred when the perfusion flow rate was decreased to 1.0 ml/min. These optical absorbance changes were not observed during exocrine secretion stimulated by CCK-8 (30 pM, 100 pM, and 1 nM) at the perfusion flow rate of 3.0 ml/min. Transient but slight changes in optical absorbances, which correspond to reduction of cytochromes, were observed in the glands perfused at the flow rate of 2.0 ml/min when secretion was stimulated by 1 nM CCK-8. When the perfusion flow rate was decreased to 1.0-1.5 ml/min, these optical absorbance changes corresponding to reduction of cytochromes occurred in glands stimulated by CCK-8 (30 pM, 100 pM, and 1 nM). Optical absorbance changes corresponding to reduction of mitochondrial cytochromes during secretion stimulated with CCK-8 may indicate local hypoxia in the perfused organ. </jats:p>",

Dynamic capacity declined by a further 5.0 +/- 0.35% from the static pressure at any given lung volume for every liter per second increase in inspiratory flow.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Very different diel patterns of vertical migration in Ceratium hirundinella were observed during two midsummer periods of study in a north temperate reservoir. During the first study (29–30 July), Ceratium migrated within a 2-m-deep oxygenated zone, moving upward near to the surface during the day and downward to the oxic–anoxic interface at night. During the second study (7–8 August), Ceratium did not migrate towards the surface during the day. High photosynthetic oxygen production and mixing processes increased oxygen distribution from 2 to 3 m providing Ceratium with access to a significantly greater water volume, with a greater nutrient content. Riverine phosphorus loading during the week prior to the first study was about 10 times greater than during the week prior to the second study. Limiting cell phosphorus concentrations and no measurable soluble reactive phosphorus in the upper (0–3 m) water column suggested a relationship between phosphorus limitation and the cessation of positive phototaxis. Diel patterns of vertical migration in this species may be influenced by episodic variations in phosphorus and/or other nutrient loadings via riverine inputs as interflows to this reservoir. </jats:p>",
