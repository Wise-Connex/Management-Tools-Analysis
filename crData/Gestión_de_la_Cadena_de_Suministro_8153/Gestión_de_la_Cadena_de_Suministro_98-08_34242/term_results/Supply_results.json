Relative to a counterfactual without competition, there are likely to be large transfers from electricity companies (and the coal industry) to consumers, but the companies lose more than consumers gain.

Historically this pattern was attributed to constant or declining stand photosynthesis and increasing stand respiration, but this explanation has been largely invalidated by field measurements and modeling. Production in older stands might decline as a result of declining soil nutrient supply. To test this idea, we examined patterns of productivity and nitrogen (N) supply and use in four age classes of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex. Loud.) ecosystems in southeastern Wyoming. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) increased from 2200 kg ha-1 yr-1 at age 30 to 4600 kg ha-1 yr-1 at age 50, then declined to 2000 kg ha-1 yr-1 at age 200. Soil N supply (indexed with ion exchange resin bags) was highest in the 30-yr-old sites, but showed no further pattern with age in older sites. The ratio of ANPP to the supply of N rose sharply from age 30 to age 50, and then declined slowly. The ratio of ANPP to the N actually taken up was high for the three youngest age classes, but declined substantially in the old-growth (200 yr) site. We conclude that the low ANPP of the old-growth stands was probably not driven by changes in stand nutrition; the decline in efficiency of N use indicates some other factor probably constrains productivity of old-growth stands.

The activities and parties involved in the biomass fuel supply chain are discussed together with the management of the chain in order to achieve smooth and consistent flow of biomass fuel to power stations. Explains the approach used to modelling the delivered costs of biomass fuels for four types of biomass fuel included in the project: forest fuel, short rotation coppice, straw and miscanthus. Comments are given on the environmental impacts of the fuel supply chains. The results indicate that straw supply systems are capable of producing the lowest delivered costs of the four fuels studied. Short rotation coppice and miscanthus, two new energy crops, are likely to have the highest delivered costs at present. This is due to the cost of growing these fuels and the financial incentives required by farmers to persuade them to grow these crops. Logistics costs (i.e. transport, storage and handling) are shown to represent a significant proportion of total delivered cost in biomass supply. Careful supply chain planning and logistics management will be of central importance to the success of the biomass industry.</jats:p>",

Many policies directed at reducing poverty or malnutrition involve one or the other of these roles. Programs to reduce child malnutrition, for example, typically target mothers as caregivers. However, because of the time constraints women face, there are potential conflicts between women's different activities about which policy makers are rarely informed. Nutrition interventions have not usually considered the barriers to participation in such programs facing mothers who, either by choice or necessity, have entered the labour force (Leslie, 1988; Engle, 1994). Similarly, policies directed at improving female employment opportunities typically ignore women's important role in household activities related to children's healthy development.</jats:p><jats:p> In this paper we address a potentially important implication of women's multiple roles and the time constraints they face: that female labour force participation, by reducing the time available for household activities related to child development, may place young children at nutritional risk.</jats:p>",

Moreover, despite the reductions in soil nitrogen, the chilling temperatures, and the increased quantum flux associated with winter, chronic photoinhibition was not observed in this species at this time of the year. We were interested in the photosynthetic acclimation and photoinhibition characteristics of this species when grown under contrasting light and nitrogen regimes. Newly expanded shade‐acclimated leaves of forest‐grown plants exposed to strong light varying in intensity and duration at 25°C showed a reduction in F<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>/F<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> (the ratio of variable to maximum room temperature chlorophyll fluorescence measured after dark adaptation), which was correlated with a decline in ø<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> (the intrinsic quantum yield of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐saturated O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> evolution on an absorbed light basis). Plants grown in the glasshouse under contrasting light (high and low light; HL and LL, respectively) and nitrogen supply (high and low nitrogen; HN and LN, respectively) regimes showed that photosynthetic acclimation to HL was impaired in LN regimes. The HL‐LN plants also had the lowest values of F<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>/F<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> and of ø on both incident and absorbed light bases and had 50% less chlorophyll (per unit area) compared to plants from other growth regimes. Controlled exposure to bright light at low temperatures (2‐3°C) for 3 h resulted in a sharp decrease in F<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>/F<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> (and rise in F<jats:sub>o</jats:sub>, the minimum fluorescence yield) in all plants. Shade‐grown plants from both N regimes were highly susceptible to chronic photoinhibition, as indicated by a greater reduction in F<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>/F<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> and incomplete recovery after 18 h in weak light at 25°C. The HL‐HN plants were the least susceptible to chronic photoinhibition, having the smallest decrease in F<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>/F<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> with near full recovery within 6 h. The decline in Fv/Fm in HL‐LN plants was comparable to that of shade‐acclimated plants, but recovered fully within 6 h. Low‐N plants from both light regimes displayed greater increases in F<jats:sub>o</jats:sub> which did not return to pretreatment levels after 18 h of recovery. These studies indicate that HL‐LN plants were sensitive to chronic photoinhibition and, at the same time, had a high capacity for dynamic photoinhibition. Experimental garden studies showed that <jats:italic>H. americana</jats:italic> grown in an open field in summer were photoinhibited and did not fully recover overnight or during extended periods of weak light.

In resting cells 6‐phosphogluconate accumulation began after 4 h and glutathione depletion after 24 h of 6‐aminonicotinamide treatment. Cellular activation by lipopolysaccharide/interferon‐λ decreased glutathione by ∼50% and synchronous 6‐aminonicotinamide treatment exacerbated this to 31.2% of control (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05).

NADPH production via the pentose pathway is therefore important to sustain macrophage NO production whilst maintaining protective levels of glutathione.</jats:p>",

Altogether 48 limbs were injected with gelatin, red latex milk, or Revertex and macroscopically prepared; 41 limbs were studied for the variation and division of the truncus profundo‐circumflexus. In 200 femurs and 200 tibias the location of the nutrient foramen was determined. The arteries supplying the periosteum of the distal femur and the proximal tibia have defined nutritive areas. The following technique should be followed: If the femoral artery alone is prepared as the vascular pedicle, the optimal section for resection of the femur in knee joint transplantations is 6 to 12 cm above the level of the femur condyles and 5 to 7 cm below the tibial plateau. For the transplantation of femoral diaphyses, the deep femoral artery can be used if the lateral femoral circumflex artery is protected. The proximal line of resection is defined between the greater and lesser trochanter. For shorter grafts one must consider the number and location of nutrient foramens. For longer grafts the distal branches of the femoral artery must be respected as the intraosseous blood supply reaches distally down to the level of about 8 cm above the femoral condyles. In all these operations the variation of the truncus profundo‐circumflexus and the trifurcation of the popliteal artery must be considered.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Chlorine and major elements in &gt;400 mid‐ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glasses from 20 suites are used to examine how spreading rate, magma flux, tectonics, and hydrothermal activity influences assimilation and crystallization beneath MOR. Crystallization depths were determined for fractionated glasses using published models that describe liquids saturated with olivine+ clinopyroxene+ plagioclase. Calculated depths are minima for the onset of crystallization and maxima for the completion of crystallization for each liquid. Glasses from fast spreading ridges and from medium and slow spreading ridges with low Na<jats:sub>8.0</jats:sub> define low‐pressure liquid lines of descent (LLDs). Higher crystallization pressures and greater variability are obtained from slow and medium spreading ridges with high Na<jats:sub>8.0</jats:sub>. Crystallization pressures do not vary regularly along individual segments. The correlation between average crystallization pressure and Na<jats:sub>8.0</jats:sub> suggests that magma supply (and perhaps mantle temperature) plays an important role in determining magma ascent and crystallization depths. Cl/K in glasses is an indicator of assimilation of hydrothermally influenced material. Suites of MORB with high crystallization pressures have low Cl/K: from below detection limits (≈0.01) in normal MORB (NMORB) to about 0.05–0.08 in enriched MORB (EMORB). We propose that this trend defines the mantle limit of Cl/K and that higher values are related to assimilation. Cl/K is highest (up to 1.1) and is negatively correlated with MgO along the superfast spreading southern East Pacific Rise (EPR) and the propagating, low‐Na<jats:sub>8.0</jats:sub> Galapagos Spreading Center (GSC) at 85°W. Cl/K is also above mantle values, but is not well correlated with MgO, in MORB from fast and medium spreading ridges and from slow spreading ridges that have low Na<jats:sub>8.0</jats:sub> and low crystallization pressures, e.g., Reykjanes Ridge. Cl/K is not correlated with crystallization pressure for individual samples within any suite. We propose that the spreading rate and the extent of melting act together to determine the total magma flux to a ridge, which influences crustal temperatures and determines how magmas ascend. At the highest magma fluxes, Cl/K is correlated with MgO, consistent with continuous assimilation of material that has a uniform Cl content: crystallization and assimilation are steady state processes that occur in crustal magma bodies that are larger than the scale of crustal heterogeneity in Cl. The lowest magma fluxes occur on slow spreading ridges that have formed by small extents of melting. In this cooler environment, magma crystallizes at the base of the strong lithosphere, below the level of alteration, and then ascends rapidly with little crystallization at shallow levels, so Cl contamination is avoided. On slow and medium spreading ridges with high extents of melting, magma flux is intermediate and forms small or transient crustal magma bodies: whether a magma batch becomes enriched in Cl depends upon the particular crust that it encounters.</jats:p>",

The relative growth rate (RGR) as a function of the internal plant nitrogen concentration (N<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>), was increased by elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> at optimal and intermediate N<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>. The rate of photosynthesis, expressed per unit leaf area and plotted versus N<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>. was increased by 20‐30% at elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> for N<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> above 30 mg N g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> dry weight. However, the rate of photosynthesis, expressed on a leaf dry matter basis and plotted versus N<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>, was not affected by the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration. The allocation of dry matter between shoot and root was not affected by the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration at any of the N addition rates. This is in good agreement with theoretical models. based on a balance between the rate of photosynthesis of the shoot and the acquisition of N by the roots. The concentration of total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) was increased at elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and at N limitation, resulting in a shift in the partitioning of photosynthates from structural to nonstructural and, in terms of carbon balance, unproductive dry matter. The increase in concentration of TNC led to a decrease in both specific leaf area (SLA) and N<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> at all levels of nutrient supply, and was the cause of the increased rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf area. Correction of the relationship between RGR and Ni for the accumulation of TNC made the effect of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on the relationship between RGR and N<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> disappear. We conclude that the shift in the relationship between RGR and N<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> was due to the accumulation of TNC and not due to differences in physiological variables such as photosynthesis and shoot and root respiration, changes in leaf morphology or allocation of dry matter.</jats:p>",

A set of simplified equations for the thermal design of natural air-cooled electronic equipment casings has been proposed. The proposed set of equations satisfied the demand of practical air-cooling systems, since it takes account of factors such as the stack effect, the air flow resistance and the heat transfer due to natural convection. The effects of the outlet area and the location of the main power supply unit on the natural cooling capability of electronic equipment casings were studied using a set of equations. The results have shown that a uniform temperature distribution could be achieved when the main power supply unit was placed at the bottom of the casing. It has also been suggested that the value of the heat removed from the casing surface could be more significant than that from the outlet vent in the thermal design of natural air-cooled electronic equipment casings. </jats:p>",
