Evidence is presented on the determinants of the Australian money supply over the period 1960-75. Variation in the augmented monetary base (monetary base plus trading banks' holdings of government securities) is found to be a major source of variation in the money supply. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Impaired oxygen supply and deteriorating health, in cystic fibrosis patients, correlates with abnormal changes in the fatty acid composition of blood lipids. As the proportion of oleates increases and that of linoleates decreases, erythrocyte membrane interference with the formation of intracellular oxyhemoglobin increases and arterial oxygen pressure decreases. The physical-chemical basis for these changes seems to be that oleic and linoleic acid differ in their ability to undergo reversible oxygenation in response to changes in oxygen pressure. The oxygen complex of linoleic acid dissociates at relatively high pressures, whereas that of oleic dissociates only at low pressures. Accordingly, excessive substitution of oleic for linoleic acid in membrane lipids would be expected to decrease the intracellular oxygen pressure to a level where hemoglobin oxygenation and any other oxygen-requiring processes would be impaired.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Medical supply industries are dominated by widely diversified multinational companies that produce chemicals, pharmaceuticals, computers, cosmetics, and electronic equipment. Of these products, the most profitable group is prescription drugs. This article contains a description of the general structure of the pharmaceutical industry worldwide and the specific details of drug operations in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is of special interest because of its long-standing and partially successful attempt to regulate drug prices. The government's inability to achieve total control is related to the competitive structure of capitalist economy, to the patent system that grants monopoly privileges to drug firms, and to the duplication of research efforts and waste of resources that push up drug costs. </jats:p><jats:p> The pharmaceutical industry serves the needs of people poorly in developed countries; its impact on underdeveloped countries is much worse. In the Third World, nascent national companies and small local producers of drugs cannot compete with the huge multinationals; the patent system proves to be an imperfect mechanism for the transfer of medical science and technology; and the high cost of imported drugs determines the amount of health care governments can provide for the population. The multinational corporations are now global enterprises that integrate the production of chemicals for many different uses-drugs for human and animal consumption, fertilizers, pesticides, and food additives. Thus the multinationals affect agricultural production and animal husbandry in underdeveloped countries and thereby nutrition as well as the treatment of disease. </jats:p>",

Calculation of left ventricular mass from the angiogram was verified by autopsy data in seven patients. Total mass, O2 consumption, and coronary blood flow, each was related quantitatively to left ventricular total load (force) in all patients. Left ventricular equatorial tension, however, was greater in proportion to mass in aortic stenosis than in aortic insufficiency patients. This discrepancy could be explained by the more eccentric shape of the left ventricle in aortic stenosis. Oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow per gram of myocardium were normal at rest in patients with hypertrophy. Tachycardia induced by atrial pacing provoked myocardial lactate production in half of the patients with aortic stenosis but in none of the patients with aortic insufficiency. Surgical mortality was related to myocardial mass and lactate production.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Among the marine fishes, the milkfish (Chanos chanos) is most successfully cultured in ponds. The total area of milkfish ponds in the three main milkfish producing countries (Indonesia, Philippines, and Taiwan) is about 320,000 ha. Yield of about 2000 kg/ha per yr is being achieved in Taiwan, the yield in Indonesia (340 kg/ha per yr) and Philippines (560 kg/ha per yr) being considerably lower.If the pond management method of Taiwan is adopted, the present 320,000 ha of milkfish ponds of the above mentioned three countries could produce at least 640,000 metric tons of milkfish per year. Production could be further increased by increasing the fish pond acreage. (Philippines has some 400,000 ha of undeveloped mangrove covered swampland that could be developed into fish ponds).Increase of milkfish production by expansion of the cultural areas faces the following problems: 1) limitation of the natural supply of seed fish; 2) market demand; and 3) effects of milkfish farming on local ecology.Little research on milkfish has been done. It is proposed that future research should emphasize: 1) research on artificial propagation of milkfish to supply seed for milkfish farming; 2) research on the nutritional requirements and feeding habits of milkfish; 3) research on modification of present cultural practice to permit polyculture in milkfish ponds; and 4) research on processing milkfish into products of universal acceptance. </jats:p>",
