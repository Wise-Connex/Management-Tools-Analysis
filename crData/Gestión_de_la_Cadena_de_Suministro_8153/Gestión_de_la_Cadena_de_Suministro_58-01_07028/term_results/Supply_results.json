The geography, geology, climate, permafrost conditions, engineering, geology and hydrology of the area are treated in turn. Spits like Point Spencer can be classed among the barrier-bars or offshore bars; supply of fresh water in such areas is always limited; permafrost is the factor which permits its preservation in natural or artificial basins, and this must be considered in planning construction.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The effect of skeleton weed competition on the yield of wheat and oats was investigated in seasons when rainfall was plentiful. Nitrogen was found to be the major factor limiting crop yields. In soils with comparable nitrogen-supplying powers, skeleton weed density governed the crop's response to applied nitrogen. Competition between skeleton weed and crop was severe at low nitrogen levels, but minor at the high nitrogen levels achieved either by nitrogen application, or when the crop followed a legume-rich pasture. Competition had its effect early in the crop's growth. Temporary removal of competition, by spraying with plant growth regulating substances (JICPA) at different times, was used to determine when competition was critical, and measure its effects. Skeleton weed reduced nitrogen supply early in the crop's growth, and so depressed yield. An application of 1 lb MCPA per acre in the fallow 54 days before sowing, or 10 days after crop emergence, increased the yield of oats from 710 to 1350 lb grain per acre: a response equal to that from 32 lb nitrogen per acre applied at planting in the same experiment. In each case, the response to spraying at the different times was analogous to the effect of a nitrogen application at these times. Early spraying gave responses in yield; later spraying gave responses in grain nitrogen. The results provide a new estimate of the reduction in crop yield due to skeleton weed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            This paper deals with chemical analyses for hydrogen, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, sulphate and nitrate ions in daily precipitation samples collected in the English Lake District, and examines the correlations of these analyses with (\n            <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>\n            ) one another, (\n            <jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\n            ) the amount of precipitation, (\n            <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>\n            ) wind direction, (\n            <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>\n            ) wind velocity, and (\n            <jats:italic>e</jats:italic>\n            ) temperature. Highly significant correlations are found between estimates for H, K, Ca, NO\n            <jats:sub>3</jats:sub>\n            and SO\n            <jats:sub>4</jats:sub>\n            ions, and atmospheric pollution appears to supply much of the sulphate in Lake District rain, since it comes largely as sulphuric acid from the south-east. The correlation between Na and Cl is also extremely close, with the proportion between the two ions very similar to that in sea water. Since these two ions are supplied mainly from the south-west, in amounts which are greatly increased by high winds, sea spray may be inferred as the principal source. Nevertheless, evidence is presented for some small supply from atmospheric pollution, and it is furthermore suggested that mixed droplets of sea salt and sulphuric acid may, upon abstraction of moisture by freezing or evaporation, release gaseous hydrogen chloride to the air and so alter the balance of Na and Cl in precipitation. The supply of Na and Cl is also considerably higher in cold than in warm weather, a phenomenon possibly connected with stormier conditions and greater evaporation over the Atlantic Ocean. The atmospheric contribution of ions to natural waters via precipitation is shown to be of great importance, in particular to bog pools, to upland tarns on hard rocks, and to the soil solution in highly organic\n            <jats:italic>mor</jats:italic>\n            humus layers overlying heavily leached hillside soils. Sodium and chloride in most surface waters appear to be almost wholly supplied by sea spray, while calcium and magnesium bicarbonates are the main products of soil weathering. A net loss of rain acids is evident in all soil waters, although some may be more acid than normal rain water owing to considerable concentration by evaporation. The soil waters are relatively rich in potassium, presumably supplied from decaying vegetation.\n          </jats:p>",
