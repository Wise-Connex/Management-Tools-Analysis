Instability has severe consequences in term of returns on mining investment and the balance of payments of the countries concerned. Studies on commodity instability ignore non-stationarity and tend to focus on relatively short time series. Other studies, that investigate whether economic variables behave as random walks or as mean-reverting series, seldom pay attention to structural breaks, end mainly examine macroeconomic variables. Following an overview of historical and methodological issues, which have raised different interpretations, an IO-ADF model is applied to metal price end supply series. Result lend support to both views on the long-run response of these variables to major historical shocks, depending on the metal. </jats:p>"

It has also been suggested that companies are increasingly beginning to customize products based on customer orders. Both the repositioning of final manufacturing into the distribution channel and the move towards customization‐on‐order are related to the implementation of postponed manufacturing. A framework for the analyses of supply chain reconfiguration patterns in the context of internationalization strategy is introduced and used in eight case studies. Results suggest that the implementation of postponed manufacturing require not only the reconfiguration of the logistics systems, but also that of other operations in the supply chain, thus creating a cross‐functional effect. In contrast to the literature different paths are found which are viable for structuring the reconfiguration process. Finally, different postponement applications have been found, suggesting that the existing framework for customization in supply chains needs extension.</jats:p>",

The decision process begins with the set-asides of wiring for power, clock, and vias, and ends with an optimized number of wiring levels and sizes. Some of the major conclusions of the preliminary analyses are: there are no significant problems with wiring at the lowest level as long as the local wire lengths are appropriately scaled; the MOSFET device may not be able to provide enough current to satisfy the capacitive fanout loads within the future allocations of clock period; and the global wires, despite significant improvements in performance, will continue to provide a design and technology challenge for larger chips and higher frequencies.</jats:p>"

Traditionally, this was an area that was considered of low priority, presenting little opportunity for value adding or innovation, and characterised by adversarial, uncompetitive management techniques.Similarly, in the oil and gas industry, especially in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, extended supply chains have necessitated a re-evaluation of the mechanisms used not only for provision of the supply service, but in the relationship between the operator and the service provider. Most notable examples being the CRINE (Cost Reduction Initiative for the New Era) initiative in the United Kingdom and Chevron Corporation's (one of West Australian Petroleum's participants and also its technical advisor) CSQIP (Chevron Supplier Quality Improvement Process) methodology.This paper will concern itself therefore with the application of cutting edge Supply Chain Management techniques garnered from both the North Sea and the United States. Focussing specifically upon alliancing/partnering, resource sharing and outsourcing, upon West Australian Petroleum Pty Limited (WAPET) and its respective contractors.It will seek to show that through innovative use of current supply chain management tools, as well as imaginative 'out of the box' thinking by WAPET personnel and contractor personnel alike, significant cost reductions and performance improvements can be brought to bear on oilfield operating costs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this paper is to review research which has evaluated the feeding of dairy cows with diets containing large proportions of grass silage. In Finland, milk production systems evolved are based on the use of restrictively fermented silages. Higher potential yields, smaller production risks than with cereal grains, short grazing period and high digestibility of grasses grown in northern latitudes have facilitated this development. Factors affecting nutrient supply from these diets are discussed. Digestibility is determined mainly by the stage of maturity at harvesting and it is not markedly affected by the level of energy and protein supplementation. Intake of grass silage is influenced both by digestibility and fermentation characteristics. Efficiency of microbial synthesis is high in animals given diets based on restrictively fermented silage but rumen fermentation pattern is characterised by low molar proportions of propionate. Production responses to additional concentrate are relatively small, especially when the amount of concentrate exceeds 10 kg day-1. High substitution of silage dry matter (DM), negative associative effects on digestion and partitioning of energy towards body tissues account for small production responses. Protein supplementation has consistently increased milk protein yield but responses do not appear to be related to the level of milk production, silage crude protein content, amount of concentrate or stage of lactation. The new protein evaluation system provides an accurate prediction of protein yield with the typical Finnish dairy cow diets. The high slopes (ca. 0.5) between protein supply and milk protein yield within experiments suggest that protein supply is suboptimal and protein supplements are used with a high efficiency. </jats:p>"

Thermal stratification in this semi-tropical storage produced problems at the water treatment plant due to manganese release from the bottom sediments under low oxygen conditions leading to high and fluctuating levels of manganese in the raw water. Automatic aeration, controlled by temperature sensors, was installed in the storage in January 1996 to maintain continuous unstratified well oxygenated conditions in the storage. The result has been a significant general reduction in manganese and its variability in the raw water.</jats:p>",

However, food evaluation systems are moving towards systems based on nutrient flows rather than on energy or protein. Nutrients are supplied via the digestive tract and presently available in vitro methods are inadequate to simulate the complicated and non-steady-state processes in this tract. This is partly due the lack of adequate in vivo reference values and partly due to a too-high degree of standardization and simplification. Future developments should therefore aim to develop in vitro systems which closely monitor the dynamics of the digestive processes. Adequate interpretation of the results may require sophisticated mathematical models.</jats:p>"

The effect of species on acid\nproduction was greater than the effect of P supply. Among the species,\nC. arietinum had the highest\nspecific acid production and B. pelecinus the lowest.

Oilseed rape was grown in a sand culture\nexperiment in a glasshouse to derive values for plant testing for the\ndiagnosis of sulfur (S) deficiency and for the prediction of seed yield. Five\nrates of S, combined factorially with 4 rates of nitrogen (N), maintained\nconstant throughout the experiment, were used to determine critical\nconcentrations of S fractions and ratios (total S, St;\nsulfate-S, SO4; total N/total S,\nN/St;\nSO4/St). The most satisfactory\nindices of rapeseed S status for diagnosis or prediction were\nSt and SO4. Whole shoots and\nyoungest fully expanded leaves exhibited similar critical values in plants at\nthe rosette stage, and critical values (St =\n0.20–0.25%; SO4 = 230–460\nmg/kg) changed little with time. Critical values for\nN/St changed with time, required 2 analyses, and\ngave no indication of the degree of deficiency when used to predict yield.\nCritical values of SO4/St\ndepended on N supply, so 3 analyses were needed. It is argued that high\ncritical values reported previously for prediction of seed yield have been\nobtained when there was a decline in soil-available S and plants relied on S\ntaken up during early growth.</jats:p>"

These scenarios simulate choices among several generic generating technologies made to achieve the lowest overall net present cost of operating the power system through 2015. Key results include: (i) single‐cycle natural gas‐fired combustion turbines prove highly attractive for Poland because of its urgent need for peaking capacity, (ii) nuclear power cannot be excluded from consideration for Poland on economic grounds alone, (iii) the effectiveness of conservation to reduce airborne emissions is limited under scenarios in which nuclear generation is adopted, and (iv) the attractiveness of nuclear is shown to be highly sensitive to assumptions on some uncertain inputs, suggesting the need for a more detailed analysis before policy implications can be drawn.</jats:p>",

The situation worsened in about 1990 when the concentration began to rise steadily. Concentrations of other ions, including chloride, had also risen over a number of years. The site has limited treatment capacity and, because of the ammoniacal nitrogen contamination, it became necessary to take the source out of supply. Investigation of the problem began in 1994, concentrating on the potential contaminant sources nearby which were a pig slurry lagoon, a landfill and a river, which carries a loading of sewage effluent. Monitoring indicated the slurry lagoon to be the most likely cause of contamination to the public supply. The lagoon was emptied in 1995 which revealed that no liner existed and that there was apparent continuity with groundwater. Subsequent monitoring reinforced the evidence for a connection between the slurry lagoon and the public supply. However, contaminants were also found in association with the landfill and the river and contributions from these cannot be ruled out.</jats:p>",

The 2 sites\nare representative of the major soil types of the region: a chromic vertisol\nat Dooen and a calcic xerosol at Walpeup.\nStubble retention had the greatest effect on yield, providing a median\nincrease of 0·8 and 0·6 t/ha at Dooen and Walpeup,\nrespectively. Zero tillage had an importantbut small advantage in the presence\nof stubble at Dooen (0·2 t/ha) and no significant advantage under\nany system at Walpeup. Yield response was primarily caused through increased\nfallow-stored water of approximately 89 and 25 mm at Dooen and Walpeup,\nrespectively. The accumulation of soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) at sowing in\nfallows did not show the same treatment differences as with water or yield.\nThere was a significant interaction between soil type and fallow method. At\nDooen, stubble depressed SMN by about 24 kg N/ha (163{185 kg\nN/ha) below those without stubble (188-207 kg N/ha). Tillage reduced\nSMN with or without stubble by about 20 kg N/ha. At Walpeup, on the other\nhand, the highest SMN was associated with tillage and was enhanced by stubble,\nbut the differences were small (&lt;10 kg N/ha). Nitrogen fertiliser\nproduced a small increase in yield (median 0·2 t/ha) at Dooen,\nincreasing to about 0·4 t/ha in wetter years when stubble was\nretained and fallows were maintained with zero tillage. Over a 100-year\nperiod, nitrogen fertiliser reduced the rate of yield decline. The use of\nnitrogen fertiliser with stubble retention and zero tillage offers an\nopportunity for arresting declining yield and quality in intensive cropping\nsystems in the Wimmera region of Victoria.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nNitrogen (N) is the main fertiliser input to tea plantations because of the\nlarge removal of this element with regular harvests of young shoots in the\nfield. The form of N supply is known to influence the uptake of other plant\nnutrients, notably phosphorus (P), through its effect on soil pH in the\nrhizosphere. A glasshouse study was conducted to test the effect of N form (NH\n+4,\nNO-3 , or both) on the\ntransformation of soil P in the rhizosphere and its availability to tea\n(Camellia sinensis L.) plants fertilised with sparingly soluble Eppawala\nphosphate rock (EPR). Four-month-old tea (TRI 2025) plants were grown in\nrhizosphere study containers containing an Ultisol from Sri Lanka (pH 4\n·5 in water) amended with EPR and KCl at 200 g P or K/g soil, and\nmixed with\n(NH4)2SO4\n(100% NH+4 -N),\nNH4NO3 (50%\nNH+4 -N and 50%\nNO-3 -N), and\nCa(NO3)2 (100%\nNO-3 -N) at the rate of 200 g\nN/g soil, with a control (no N fertiliser), as treatments.\nRhizosphere pH decreased compared with the bulk soil when N was supplied as\nNH+4 or\nNH+4\n+NO-3 forms, and increased\nwhen N was supplied as NO-3. The\ncation{anion balance estimations in the plants showed that the plants had\ntaken up more NO-3 than\nNH+4 even in\n(NH4)2SO4\ntreated soil, suggesting high nitrification rates, especially in the\nrhizosphere, in spite of using a nitrification inhibitor. More EPR dissolved\nin the rhizosphere compared with that in the bulk soil, regardless of the N\nform applied. The\n(NH4)2SO4\ntreatment had the highest dissolution rate of EPR in the rhizosphere, whereas\nCa(NO3)2 treatment had the lowest,\nreflecting the degree of acidification in the rhizosphere.\nResin-P and NaOH-Pi (inorganic P) concentrations were\nlower and NaOH-Po (organic P) concentration was higher\nin the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. Plant and possible microbial uptake\nof P is the main reason for the decrease in resin-P and\nNaOH-Pi. The increase in NaOH-Po\nconcentration in the rhizosphere is believed to be due to transformation of\nPi to Po by the high microbial\nactivity in the rhizosphere. The\n(NH4)2SO4\ntreatment caused the highest depletion of resin-P but lowest depletion of\nNaOH-Pi, probably due to the fixation of P by the soils\nat the low pH in the rhizosphere.\nThe study revealed that the use of the\nNH+4 form of fertiliser can\nincrease acidification in tea rhizosphere compared with bulk soil and this can\nenhance the effectiveness of PR fertiliser utilisation by tea plants.\n</jats:p>"

The close proximity of the LRW injection polygons to the wellfield creates a geoenvironmental conflict, due to the possibility of migration of radionuclides and other toxic components of LRW from the Cretaceous aquifer system used for LRW injection to the Palaeogene aquifer complex used for water supply. Although a significant argillaceous aquitard and a non-utilized buffer aquifer horizon lie between the aquifer systems, there are indications that such inter-aquifer migration may take place, either due to sandy windows in the aquitard or to inadequately sealed well annuli. A major groundwater monitoring network, based on the co-operative use of automated information systems and GIS technologies, has been established. In order to simulate contaminant migration scenarios, the use of variably scaled numerical hydrogeomigrational models is recommended. These would allow prognostic estimations and form a basis for administrative decision-making to minimize damage to the geological environment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>In July 1995, the United States requested the establishment of the first Panel under Chapter 20 procedures of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and challenged Canada's duties on its “supply-managed” dairy, poultry, egg, barley, and margarine products. These industries had grown and prospered under supply management – a system intended to establish stability in a domestic market afflicted by unpredictable production cycles. The import restrictions were designed in conformity with the international trade rules as set out in the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT). These rules changed in 1995 as a result of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture under which Canada and WTO members replaced quantitative import restrictions with tariffs and tariff-rate quotas. The United States claimed that the duties contravened the basic NAFTA obligation to not rahe tariffs. Canada countered that the new tariff rates were justified under the new WTO Agreement on Agriculture that had been negotiated in Geneva after NAFTA. The resulting decision in favour of Canada was both praised for its consideration of the case in the context of the complex interplay of relevant trade obligations and criticized for finding “an implied bargain among negotiators … that was never struck.” The Panel assumed that if tariff eqivalents could not be applied – which in effed would render the WTO Agreement on Agriculture inoperative – the result would be that the parties would be entitled to apply Article XI restrictions as if the Uruguay Round had never happened. The logic was impeccable – the NAFTA was “not to be read in clinical isolation from public international law.”</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nSorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is often\ngrown under nitrogen- or water-limited conditions, but there is little\ninformation on genotypic variation for grain yield and grain nitrogen (N)\nconcentration under these conditions. This study examined the expression of\nspecific adaptation of hybrids to these stress conditions and, secondly, the\neffect of N fertiliser application on yield and grain N concentration of the\nhybrids. Two experiments, one irrigated and the other under rainfed\nconditions, were conducted in 2 seasons to examine 14 hybrids grown under 3\nlevels of fertiliser N supply (0, 60, and 240 kg/ha).\nGenotypic variation for yield and grain N concentration was generally larger\nthan the in˚uence of genotype environment (predominantly N and water)\ninteractions. Genotypic variation for phenology was important in determining\nvariation for yield and grain N concentration in high-input and rainfed\nconditions when N was not the limiting factor, but not under N-limiting\nconditions. Under high-input conditions (240 kg/ha of N fertiliser and\nirrigated), maturity date accounted for about 50% of the genotypic\nvariation for grain yield (798-1049 g/m2), with\nlater maturing hybrids having a higher yield. Maturity date had little effect\non plant N content at maturity or N harvest index, and hence grain N\nconcentration (1·67-2·01%) was negatively correlated with\ngrain yield. Under N-limiting conditions, N fertiliser application had large\neffects on yield and/or grain N concentration in both well-watered and\npre-anthesis water stress conditions. In the irrigated experiment, when N was\nlimiting (0 and 60 kg/ha of N fertiliser), genotypic variation for grain\nyield (225-729 g/m2) was not related to that for\nmaturity date. It was, however, related to the variation in N uptake and dry\nmatter growth by anthesis in the non-fertilised treatment. There was\nsignificant genotypic variation for grain N concentration\n(0·94-1·26%), which was not explained by variation for\ngrain yield. Under rainfed conditions, where severe pre-anthesis water stress\noccurred, phenology was important in determining about 40% of the\ngenotypic variation for yield (69-286 g/m2). The\nlate-flowering hybrids escaped the major impact of the pre-anthesis water\nstress, had reduced damage to panicle development, and had higher N\nutilisation, consequently producing higher grain yield.\nGrain N concentration (1·09-2·85%) was again negatively\nrelated with grain yield. Genetic improvement of N uptake is identified as a\npossible breeding strategy for raising productivity and quality of grain\nsorghum under N-limiting conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>It is well recognized that photosynthesis of C3 plants is highly responsive to CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration. However, in natural ecosystems, plants are subject to a range of feed‐back effects that can interact with increased photosynthetic carbon gain in different ways so that it is not clear to what extent increased photosynthesis will translate into increased growth. To assess the probable growth response of nutrient‐limited forests to increasing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration, we use a previously developed modelling framework and apply it under conditions where the supply of nutrients is affected by a range of different factors.</jats:p><jats:p>Our analysis indicates that forest growth is likely to be highly stimulated by increasing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration in forests with high fertility, in forests with nitrogen fixing plants, in those subject to fire or where nitrogen in wood is effectively removed from the biologically active cycle either through physical removal of stems in harvesting or through continued stem growth over long time periods. Forest growth is likely to be stimulated by CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration in both phosphorus‐ and sulphur‐limited forests provided nutrients in heartwood of trees are removed from the active nutrient cycle. Without this removal from the cycling system, however, sulphur‐limited forests should show little response to increasing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. In phosphorus‐limited forests without phosphorus removal, the response to increasing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> depends further on the equilibration state of the large pool of unavailable secondary phosphorus. Considered over periods of centuries during which the secondary pool has equilibrated, growth of phosphorus‐limited forests is likely to be only weakly stimulated by increasing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration. However, over shorter periods, increasing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration should lead to a substantial increase in productivity.</jats:p><jats:p>In general, it can be concluded that systems that are more open with respect to nutrient gains and losses are likely to be more responsive to increasing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration than systems where the amount of available nutrients is less variable. In more open systems, operation at a lower internal nutrient concentration as a result of increasing atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration can lead to reduced nutrient losses per unit carbon gain. Our analysis shows that the effect of increasing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on forest growth can differ substantially between forests due to interactions with a range of factors that affect nutrient supply. The response of a particular forest to increasing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration can only be predicted if the main factors controlling nutrient supply and growth in that forest are understood and incorporated into an assessment.</jats:p>",
