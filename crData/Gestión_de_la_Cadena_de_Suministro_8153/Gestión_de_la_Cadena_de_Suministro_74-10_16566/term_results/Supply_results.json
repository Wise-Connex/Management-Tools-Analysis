As now developed, TERA is a computerized simulation model of energy supply, demand, and prices, with special emphasis on the gas industry. TERA incorporates data on all fuels and electric energy in different market sectors for each census region of the U.S., including factors that influence the energy industries-demographic, economic, technological, environmental, regulatory, legislative, and competitive.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>TERA has been developed to assist the AGA staff and member companies in developing long range planning studies, policy positions on issues facing the gas industry, and responses to the many questions being asked about the future of this industry. TERA is helping to answer such questions as the following.What producer prices for natural gas will be required to reverse the 6-year reserves decline being experienced now, and when could this reversal occur?How much will natural gas demand be reduced as producer prices increase?What impact will supplemental gas supplies have on total supplies, demands, and consumer prices for gas?What effect will environmental regulations have on gas prices, demands, and supply schedules?What effect will various pricing and supply scenarios for competitive fuels have on the supply and demand for natural gas?</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>TERA is now answering these types of questions and showing how the answers vary under the influence of changing input variables.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

In the United States, this is partly because the Public Health Service has discouraged such a practice. However, are there sound scientific reasons to support such a decision or is it purely a matter of psychological reason? Are the treatment technologies available today able to achieve the integrated closed system at a reasonable cost, yet without risking the public health? Are there some extra precautions that must be taken in practicing the direct reuse for the drinking purpose? These questions are discussed in this article. Current available technologies for advanced waste treatment are briefly reviewed and the treated effluent qualities obtained by the authors and others are used as a focal point of discussion on the feasibility of practicing the closed system. For this purpose, the treated effluent qualities are compared to the “Ranges of Promulgated Standards for Raw Water Sources of Domestic Water Supply” which have been used by the Public Health Service and several state regulatory agencies.</jats:p>",
