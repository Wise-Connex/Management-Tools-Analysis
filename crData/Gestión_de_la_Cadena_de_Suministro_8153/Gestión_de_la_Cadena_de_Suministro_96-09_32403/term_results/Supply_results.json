The results show that (allowing for the women's wage rate, her non‐labour income, her age, and the presence of children) labour supply is higher when subsidized day‐care supply is higher. However, after including variables that reflect social norms the effect of day‐care supply on female labour supply, though still positive and significant, becomes much weaker.</jats:p>",

Several methods were used to throw light on the situation. In order to find out if foreign suppliers were preferred to domestic suppliers librarians were interviewed about current practices and procedures and data from international request forms were compared to the union catalogue. International request forms were analysed in order to draw a picture of the material needed from abroad and to reveal potential gaps in the national collection. Suggests that national characteristics of users’ needs for library material should be taken into consideration when planning national information provision. A citation analysis based on references from dissertations was carried out with the aim of detecting such characteristics.</jats:p>",

It shows that current technology cannot satisfy fully the expectation and that such systems will challenge many well‐established cultural aspects and infrastructures of organizations. The views expressed are based on the experience of the author who worked for 18 months on a project for the British Library, codenamed DiSCovery (now called <jats:italic>Inside</jats:italic>).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> On the basis of calculations using regional and country food balance sheets, dietary surveys from Pakistan and India, and amino acid composition data, it is proposed that the essential amino acid lysine may be relatively lacking in many areas of the world where diets heavily based on cereals are consumed. By combining food balance sheet and gross national product data, it can be demonstrated that as wealth increases, not only are more food energy and protein available, but there are also major changes in the pattern of foods selected. When dietary and health data are stratified by gross national product, the poorest countries, with a combined population of nearly 3,000 million, have the highest proportion of their protein originating from plant sources. These are also the countries with the lowest life expectancy and the highest mortality rate among children under five years of age. Rich countries, in contrast, obtain much of their protein from animal sources. Such different dietary patterns of the rich and the poor lead to very different daily availabilities of lysine Although large differences also exist for all other essential amino acids, the difference is considered to be nutritionally significant only for lysine The coefficient of variation (CV %) in lysine content in some 100 dietary calculations was more than three times the average CV % of the other essential amino acids. The amino acid compositions of animal, pulse, and cereal proteins are also sufficiently different from each other to allow food group data to be used to predict the lysine value of diets. Dietary survey data from both India and Pakistan showed wide intra-country variations of lysine availability. Average lysine values were low in both countries and would indicate a considerable risk of inadequate levels of intake in many subsections of the population. Strategies to alleviate possible global problems of low lysine supply must include improving dietary diversity as well as consideration of cereal nutrient fortification. </jats:p>",

In this paper we estimate a female labour supply model on data for married couples and use it to simulate the effects of a switch from the 1985/86 progressive individual personal income tax system to one allowing full income splitting. We analyze distributional outcomes and, at least as far as female labour supply is concerned, change in the excess burden of the tax system. The impacts depend upon the way in which the policy is made revenue neutral. We consider two tax replacement scenarios. We quantify the impact on female hours of work and investigate how welfare impacts vary by household characteristics.</jats:p>",

Due to intense global competition and the secrecy surrounding countertrade, little data is available regarding the scale and scope of this trading practice. This article updates the findings of a government survey performed in the mid‐1980s and compares several parallel statistics from the earlier and later surveys. The combined information traces a pattern of American involvement in countertrade during the past decade.</jats:p><jats:p>This study also examines countertrade's impact on the supply function by considering the placement of reciprocally purchased goods — a task most frequently assigned to purchasing. The influence that counter‐traders’ experiences may have on their choice of disposal options is explored through analysis of the more recent survey's data. The findings indicate that a majority of U.S. firms use reciprocal goods in their own operations. A number of future research directions are suggested as a follow‐on to this study to provide additional detail regarding how countertrade affects the supply function and the supply base.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Quantitatively estimating functional reserve of blood supply to the legs in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) remains a clinical issue. This study was designed to investigate the regional blood supply to the legs in PAOD patients during exercise by use of thallium 201 (<jats:sup>201</jats:sup>Tl) whole-body imaging in comparison with transcu taneous PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (tcPO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) measurement. </jats:p><jats:p> Thirty-three patients with PAOD and 10 subjects without PAOD (control) performed an incremental cycle ergometry (CE), while tcPO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was continuously registered on the involved calf. In the last minute of exercise, 2 mCi of <jats:sup>201</jats:sup>Tl was injected intravenously and the <jats:sup>201</jats:sup>Tl whole-body images were taken immediately (stress) and four hours (redistrib ution) following stress with a dual-head camera system. Regional blood supply (RBS) (%) was calculated from the geometric mean counts of the region of interest divided by the total counts of the whole body. </jats:p><jats:p> The performance of PAOD patients was reduced in doing CE, and tcPO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fell distinctly in PAOD patients (from 51 to 19 mmHg) whereas it increased in controls (from 57 to 67 mmHg). The RBS in PAOD patients was obviously reduced in comparison with that of controls. While in controls the RBS of the calf (3.1%) at stress did not differ from that at redistribution (3.4%), in PAOD patients the redistribution RBS (2.8%) increased as compared with that of stress (1.5%). There was a hyperbolic relationship between stress RBS of the calf and the velocity of tcPO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fall in PAOD patients during exercise test (velocity of tcPO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fall = -0.032 + 0.39/RBS, r2 = 0.54, P &lt; 0.05). </jats:p><jats:p> In conclusion, the RBS determined by <jats:sup>201</jats:sup>Tl whole-body imaging is comparable to the tcPO<jats:sub> 2</jats:sub> measurement in differentiating patients with PAOD from subjects without PAOD during exercise. Regional <jats:sup>201</jats:sup>Tl uptake reflects regional blood supply in PAOD patients. There is a hyperbolic relationship between the RBS derived from <jats:sup>201</jats:sup>Tl whole-body imaging and tcPO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in PAOD patients during exercise, implying that in a critical ischemia the lower the RBS is, the more steeply the tcPO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> decreases. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>A previously described model of digestion in cattle fed sugarcane diets was applied to predict nutrient supply to the host animal from dietary intake, to indicate pre-experimentally the suitability of various supplements to enhance the milk production of dairy cattle in the tropics fed sugarcane–based diets. Potential milk production was calculated according to simulated energy and lipogenic, glucogenic and aminogenic nutrient availability. The addition of small amounts of urea (10 g/kg sugarcane fresh weight) improved microbial efficiency and degradation of substrates in the rumen, but further increases could only be achieved by supplements containing rumen degradable protein. The simulated level of absorbed amino acids was low in comparison with the level of absorbed energy and glucogenic substrates. This low amino acid availability was the factor most limiting milk production on sugarcane diets and supplements which increase the amino acid availability in the gastrointestinal tract are recommended. At increasing supplementation or intake levels, and once amino acid requirements were met, an increased absorption of energy and long chain fatty acids could enhance milk production. These suggestions should be evaluated experimentally in order to improve the model and ultimately, to result in an improved system to evaluate feeds, based on the supply and utilization of individual substrates.</jats:p>",
