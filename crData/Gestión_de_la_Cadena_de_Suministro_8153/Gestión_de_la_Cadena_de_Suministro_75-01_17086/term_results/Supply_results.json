Croix a récemment soutenu qu'Athènes poursuivit une politique d'impérialisme naval, mais qu'il y eut une raison très particulière pour expliquer celle-ci : la nécessité d'importer une part grandissante de l'approvisionnement en blé - ce qui «mena presque inévitablement à l'impérialisme naval». Un examen attentif de la question ne confirme cependant point pareille thèse : l'histoire d'Athènes montre qu'il est possible de faire remonter l'impérialisme athénien au moins aussi loin que Solon, époque où l'approvisionnement en blé n'entrait pas en ligne de compte. Il est également démontrable que Corinthe, qui s'approvisionnait en blé importé pour une part probablement plus forte qu'Athènes, ne s'engagea pas dans une politique d'impérialisme naval. La nécessité d'importer de fortes quantités de blé ne permet donc pas de mieux comprendre les causes de l'impérialisme athénien.</jats:p>"

Sorghum was grown to boot stage in nutrient solution with eight Mn levels from 0 to 4,000 µg Mn/liter under greenhouse conditions. Sorghum growth and Mn concentrations in vegetative tissues were dependent on Mn supply in nutrient solution. Mn concentrations of blades 1 (flag‐leaf) through 5 in basipetal order were related to plant growth but blade 1 was the most sensitive tissue in relating Mn concentration to plant growth. The critical Mn levels for blades 1, 2, and 3 were 10, 10, and 15 ppm, respectively, while critical levels for blades 4 and 5 were 32 and 60 ppm, respectively. Blade 1 is suggested as the leaf to sample at boot stage for evaluating the Mn status of the plant. Zinc concentration in blade tissue increased at Mn concentrations below the critical Mn level. Copper concentration remained relatively constant within a wide range of Mn concentration and Fe concentration decreased at low Mn supply levels.</jats:p>",

However, there is a differential loss and shift of enzyme activity pattern in the three types of muscles. The extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and diaphragm show a decrease of ratios of glycolytic to aerobic-oxidative enzymes. This shift to a more oxidative type of metabolism is not observed in the soleus muscle. Decrease of enzyme activities is least marked in the diaphragm muscle. Biochemical analysis shows a trend to levelling out of metabolic differences between the different muscle types. This trend of ‘dedifferentiation’ is most marked when comparing EDL and soleus, least marked when comparing EDL and diaphragm muscle. The histochemical analysis shows a shift from the original mixed to a more uniform pattern of muscle fibres in the EDL and soleus muscle; this levelling-out of differences between enzymatic activities of different muscle fibres is not observed in the diaphragm muscle. Preferential atrophy and loss of ATPase activity in type II muscle fibres in the soleus muscle and the occurrence of ‘type grouping’ are further characteristic features of senile muscle change. The findings show general (i.e. loss of enzyme activities) and differential trends of biochemical and histochemical enzyme changes in different types of muscles.</jats:p>"

With one conventional blood donation every second month the storage iron was found to be significantly decreased after four blood donations both when placebo and oral ferrous iron in doses of up to 2000 mg were given over a period of two weeks after each blood‐letting. The iron state in donors given 2000 mg was superior to that in donors given 1000 mg, and better in the latter group than when placebo was given. A moderate increase in the total iron‐binding capacity could be discerned in subjects treated with placebo or only 1000 mg iron after each donation, but no changes in serum iron or haemoglobin were noted. A smaller series of 13 donors was also investigated after six donations and was found to show essentially the same pattern in the iron state variables as after four donations. When the interval between donations was four months and 2000 mg ferrous iron was given over two weeks after each donation, all variables including the amount of bone marrow iron and the desferrioxamine test remained unchanged in ten subjects after four donations. Two subjects showed a moderate decrease in the stainable bone marrow iron, but it did not disappear completely.</jats:p>",

Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), and to a less extent Mitchell grass (Astrebla elymoides), showed a much larger yield response to increasing phosphorus supply than mulga grass (Thyridolepis mitchelliana). Mitchell and mulga grasses had much lower relative growth rates than buffel grass. Mulga grass required a lower external phosphorus concentration for optimal growth than Mitchell and buffel grasses; this was attributed to its superior system for absorbing and transporting phosphate from low concentrations, but was not associated with any yield advantage, yield being related more to the photosynthetic than to the nutritional characteristics of the plants. Differences between species in their external phosphorus requirements for growth and their distribution in semiarid Queensland are discussed.</jats:p>"

Seven of them were given 20 mg and ten 100 mg iron as ferrous carbonate once daily throughout the study. Before the first and after the fourth and sixth blood donations they were examined with regard to packed red cell volume, serum iron, total iron‐binding capacity and stainable bone marrow iron, and a diagnostic iron absorption test was performed. Ten conscripts receiving no iron and giving no blood but comparable to those in the test groups with regard to age, exercise and diet served as controls. The stainable bone marrow iron was found to become stabilized at a level with reduced but still perceptible amounts when 20 mg iron was given, and at a level with somewhat greater amounts when the daily dose was 100 mg. Both levels were lower than before blood donation in most subjects, and the negative iron balance was also reflected in the diagnostic iron absorption test. When a healthy person loses 3.5 mg iron daily, supplementation with a 100 mg tablet per day is therefore insufficient to maintain the iron stores at their previous level. The decrease in storage iron is not progressive, however. When the storage iron is reduced, iron absorption seems to be stimulated sufficiently to establish a balance at a reduced storage iron level.</jats:p>",

The non‐linear relationship between pressure loss and flow along a pipe makes the problem of minimizing the reduction of loads also non‐linear. An iterative linear approximation technique is therefore adopted. When the question is formulated as a problem in linear programming, the constraints include nodal pressures as well as loads. It is shown how the number of these constraints may be reduced.</jats:p>",

RS610), the assimilate supply was varied by increasing or decreasing radiation and carbon dioxide supply; the potential grain storage capacity was altered by spikelet removal; and the transport system was reduced by incision of the culm. Plants grown at four population densities in the field were manipulated to increase (by removing neighbouring plants) or decrease (by shading) the supply of photosynthates during grain filling. These treatments affected grain size and thus yield. Removal of some of the spikelets at three-quarter anthesis resulted in a significant increase in the size of those grains remaining at maturity. From anthesis onward, a reduction in the capacity of the transport system in the culm had no significant effect on grain yield. These results are interpreted as evidence that grain yield is not limited by the storage capacity of the grain, or by the transport system involved in moving material from the stem to the grain. Treatments which altered the demand for assimilates by the grain, relative to the supply, did not affect net photosynthesis. Dry matter produced in excess of grain requirements accumulated in other plant parts, including the root. Potential grain size was influenced by interspikelet competition operating within 1 week after three-quarter anthesis.\n\n*Part II, Aust. J. Agric. Res., 22: 39-47 (1971).</jats:p>"

A further pot experiment showed that at rates greater than 24 kg P ha-1 luxury consumption occurred. The critical phosphorus concentration for the plant was estimated to be 0.26 per cent. The available (0.01 NH2SO4 extractable) soil phosphorus concentration corresponding to this critical tissue concentration was 25 p.p.m. Beyond the 2-leaf seedling stage, the seedling depended increasingly on external phosphorus for growth. Under conditions of phosphorus deficiency, phosphorus absorption rates were insufficient to maintain tissue phosphorus at the concentrations necessary for healthy growth, and relative growth rates were low. In the presence of phosphorus, absorption and growth rates increased. Maturity of phosphorus deficient plants was characteristically delayed but with little yield loss. The addition of phosphorus increased seedling growth rate, root development and drought survival. The depth of root penetration is considered to be the major factor responsible for survival.</jats:p>"
