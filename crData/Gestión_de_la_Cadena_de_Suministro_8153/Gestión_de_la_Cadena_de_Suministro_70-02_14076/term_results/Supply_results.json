      "abstract": "<jats:p>THE electrical supply system is designed to provide both 200 volt a.c. and 28 volt d.c. services for operation of the aircraft. Although electrical power is required for the operation of the auto‐stabiliser system, this is not essential for flight and the flying controls are non‐electric. The aircraft does not therefore, depend on the integrity of the electrical system for flight. Loads, such as undercarriage lowering selection etc., required to operate if a total generation failure has occurred, are all d.c. and are fed by the main aircraft batteries. As a further precaution basic flight and communication facilities can also be powered in an emergency from a standby battery which is not charged in flight and is therefore independent of any of the normal aircraft services.</jats:p>",

The portal vein, its branches, and their distribution are consistent as are major hepatic veins. The hepatic artery branches and major bile ducts have patterns which may be readily related to the divisional boundaries. The branches of the hepatic artery vary in number from one to five. Three branches were present in 64 of 100 specimens. A single gallbladder and cystic duct were found in each of 100 specimens. The common bile duct is formed from three (64%) or four (36%) major collecting or divisional ducts. When four divisional ducts are present, the right and left divisions of the liver are each drained by a single duct with two ducts draining the central division. The cystic duct may join either the right or left central divisional duct to form the common bile duct.</jats:p>",

Thoracic chemoreceptor impulses were recorded from the cervical vagus nerves, the nervous pathways in the thorax identified by cold blockade, and the blood supply to the receptors investigated by injection of drugs. Large, circumscribed aortic bodies were few, the majority of glomus cells being scattered in small groups along the vagal branches coursing on the walls of the pulmonary artery and aorta. Very few bodies were found in groups 1 and 2 at the right and left subclavian angles. The majority were in group 3, ventral to the aortic arch and pulmonary bifurcation and supplied by the ventromedial cervical cardiac branch of the left vagus, and in group 4, between the aorta and pulmonary artery, supplied by the recurrent cardiac branch of the right vagus. The arterial supply to the aortic chemoreceptors stemmed from the aorta and the brachiocephalic and left coronary arteries. In neither puppies nor adult dogs was there evidence of a supply from the pulmonary artery.</jats:p>",
