      "abstract": "<jats:p>This special topic forum (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">STF</jats:styled-content>) features four articles that focus on sustainability, which is generally defined as the ability to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Our own research of the 500 most cited studies on sustainability shows that scholars and managers often struggle with the concept and applications of sustainability. To some, sustainability is about environmental preservation, to others, it is about addressing societal needs, and yet for those who use a financial lens, sustainability is primarily about the economic bottom line. Then, there are scholars and managers for whom sustainability is synonymous with corporate social responsibility, ethical issues, shared value creation, and/or legal compliance. Naturally, all of the above are critical, and efforts in these areas should continue. But as we explain, none of these are sustainability per se, and to date, no firm is truly or fully sustainable. Also, most research and practice in sustainability follows a preservation view. We advance a new paradigm and evince that <jats:italic>sustainable practices</jats:italic>—whether in supply chain management or any other business activity—are a function of two inseparable principles: (1) they must enhance ecological health, follow ethical standards to further social justice, and improve economic vitality; and (2) they must prioritize the environment first, society second, and economics third. Our introduction to this <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">STF</jats:styled-content> elaborates on what sustainability is and is <jats:italic>not</jats:italic>, and it also summarizes the four articles in the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">STF</jats:styled-content>.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ilham Setiya Wardani, Saiful Manan in this paper explain that Utilization of power electronics components in the process of conversion of electrical energy has been growing from year to year. for controlling power from one form to another is very important and the characteristics of the equipment of power electronics has allowed it. DC-DC converters can also be called a wave DC inverter capable of producing symmetrical widely used and applied in industry and everyday life.In the inverter power supply are made using half-bridge converter topology. Half-bridge converter topology has several advantages that are easy to create and output a lot easier in the controlling. The process of switching at the half bridge converter using mosfet IRFZ44N and executed using ICTL494.In the design of the tool, using the supply is 12 Volt DC that directly goes to IC TL494 and frequency output that is generated directly toward the driver mosfet with the type BC327 used to mesaklarkan mosfet by means of on / off alternately to supply the power transformer intiferit to raise the voltage to 26 volt AC that will be rectified by using fast diode recofery MUR1560 to rectify the AC into DC voltage with the output voltage of +/- 26 volts DC. Keywords: power supply, inverter, TL494ReferencesBarkhordarian, V.

It is generally agreed that the development of innovation performance facilitates such sustainable management among inter-organization in supply chains. This paper presents a research model comprises five research hypotheses with four constructs, including transactional orientation, moral orientation, dynamic capability and innovation performance. The constructs are measured by well-supported measures in the literature. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze survey data collected from 260 manufacturing firms that were among the top 1,000 Taiwanese manufacturing firms of 2012 listed by Business Weekly. The results of the empirical study suggest that transactional and moral orientation is critical in ensuring the inter-organizational innovation performance as it promotes the dynamic capability in the process.</p>",

Mustard production is profitable at the farm level (Benefit Cost Ratio = 1.34) with no adverse influence of farm size on yield and profitability. Mustard farmers are also responsive to changes in market prices of inputs and outputs. Mustard price is the most dominant determinant of output supply and input demand. A 1% increase in mustard price will increase output supply by 0.62% and increase demand for mechanical power, fertilizer and labour by 1.06%, 1.05% and 1.01%, respectively but will decrease seed demand by 3.96%. The fixed factors have no role except land fragmentation substantially reducing seed demand. Policy implications include price policy to improve mustard price and tenurial reform aimed at improving land fragmentation and smooth functioning of the hired labour market in order to increase production and profitability of mustard in Bangladesh.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>The global shift in ecological movement has significant impacts on business operation of manufacturing firms that are located in developing countries. The intense pressure of being environmentally sustainable has caused Green Supply Chain Management (Green SCM) concept to emerge as an important corporate environmental strategy for manufacturing companies. Information technologies and systems have permeated in most business activities, in which, they extend important opportunities to resolve environmental issues. However, many researchers, including manufacturers and government bodies often disregard the green concept of information technologies and systems in minimizing environmental issues. A comprehensive review on Green SCM, Green IT and Green IS for sustainable environmental performance in manufacturing companies is presented using Input-Process-Output (IPO) Theory and Technological-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) theory. In bridging the research gap, a model is constructed to link the aforementioned constructs. Next, the paper reports on the development of survey questionnaire using cognitive interviewing strategies, followed up with semi-structured interview to investigate and obtain preliminary findings on the influential factors, green activities and performance outcomes from implementing Green SCM. Lastly, the finalized survey questionnaire was distributed to 60 ISO14001 certified manufacturing companies located in the region of Perak and Kulim. Out of 60 manufacturing companies, only 32 responses received as the dataset in analyzing for improvements in reliability, measurement error, and validity of measured items. The findings from this pilot study explain that internal and external factors have stronger influence over the implementation of green initiatives in supply chain with substantial outcome on environmental performance. The information technologies and systems being the physical resource, capability and backbone to run a business seamlessly are significantly recognized. But, the green component of IT and IS were poorly attended and disregarded to an extent in the process of greening the processes, operations or entire business. Therefore, further investigations are required in the main study to validate the findings obtained here and other possible association between the factors, practices and outcomes in realizing ecological improvements in the supply chain and firm itself.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this paper is to present different approaches and theories, which are linked with money and inflation. Many studies are made to provide a high relationship of money and inflation. The changes in money supply always have affected the macroeconomic indicators such as inflation, unemployment, economic growth, trades and have let the governments to conduct the necessary fiscal and monetary policies, in order to react in an efficient way to reduce uncertainty and to build a sustainable economy. The paper analyses the theoretical links of money supply with unemployment, trade and exchange rate, taxes and wages. The regression analysis is conducted based on the theories of money. The analysis and the empirical results for Albania showed that money supply has strong relationship with economic growth, interest rate and inflation, but money supply has a negative sign toward inflation, by arguing that the case of Albania is specific, because of lack of money supply from banking system and money in circulation outside banks. From the results, we found that all money supplied by the financial system is fully absorbed by the private sector and individuals, without causing an increase on the inflation level. This may be argued from the financial crisis that affected Albania and the reduction of production, consumption, unemployment and delayed payments from the government toward business sector. Furthermore, there are suggested monetary policies for increasing the supply of money, and fiscal policies for increasing the demand for goods and services. The supply increases by the demand side, which need to be stimulated by production sector through fiscal policies and government development programs</jats:p>"

This may be particularly true for organizations mitigating sudden demand spikes, or lacking internal expertise and bandwidth. However, little is known about what governance and social control mechanisms impact network success. Utilizing data from 14,644 projects, this research tests a theory of network governance specific to this new emerging e-lance economy by integrating transaction cost economics with the concepts of social controls. For transaction costs, findings indicate that higher average project values lead to more projects and more money being exchanged, but more bids leads to less monetary exchange. For social controls, restricting access by sealing bids and not disclosing budget amounts leads to less bidding, but not disclosing budgets is associated with more projects being posted. The authors further find that the best predictor of e-lance success across all measures is the number of projects posted in the prior time period.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To understand the dynamics of the manufacturer’s effort to reduce pollution in a supply chain consisting of manufacturer, retailer, and consumers, we analyze four cases according to consumer awareness of the pollution’s harmful effect, i.e., environmentally aware versus ignorant, and supply chain coordination, i.e., competitive versus cooperative. Applying differential games, we derive managerial implications: the most significant is that the supply chain coordination strategy becomes irrelevant to reducing the pollution, if the consumers are not environmentally aware or sensitive enough. It highlights the critical role played by the consumer awareness in curbing the pollution in the supply chain. In addition, we find the transfer price and the potential market size are important factors to determine each case’s relative effectiveness. Under a regular condition, where the transfer price from the retailer to the manufacturer is sufficiently high, the consumer-aware and competitive case can generate a better outcome in reducing the pollution than those with ignorant consumers. However, the opposite might occur if the transfer price is excessively low, giving the manufacturer little motivation to make an effort to reduce the pollution. For the cooperative supply chain, it is the potential market size that determines whether the consumer-aware case is better than the consumer-ignorant. In fact, it turns out that there is a stronger result, i.e., the feasibility condition enforces that the market is always big enough to make the consumer-aware cooperative case better than the consumer-ignorant cases. We further discuss managerial as well as policy implications of these analysis outcomes.</jats:p>"

Two theoretical frameworks are presented in this theoretical essay. The first one considers the organizational level. The second one is regarded to interorganizational relations. This study argues that actors might improve their results and increase joint performance through a strategic alignment along a supply chain. Besides, network features like positioning, structural holes and density might impact on joint performance achieved through this strategic alignment. Thus, this study suggests that Learning Orientation in a competitive environment might harm joint performance, considering that some actors might act opportunistically defending their knowledge acquisition. Future studies should be focused on issues like open innovation, opportunistic behavior and network structures.</jats:p>"

However, supply augmentation undertaken to avoid overdrafts can reduce the effectiveness of demand management policies if the two strategies are not carefully integrated. Such a result can stem from a type of moral hazard phenomenon by which consumers, aware of the increases in potential supply, discount the importance of conservation. This is illustrated by the case of Israel. Initial national-scale water-supply projects were followed by over-extraction, which, in turn, compelled implementation of wide-spread demand management measures to reduce consumption. With the recent advent of large-scale desalination in Israel, public perception regarding the importance of conservation has diminished and consumption has increased—this, despite periodic drought conditions and critically low levels of water reserves.</jats:p>"

Content analysis was used to identify and group significant demand and supply inflation factors and using RGT, objectively assess and generalize the results. Pair linear correlation analysis confirmed the significance for CPI inflation of the factors identified through content analysis, and both research methods reliably and effectively helped to identify factors for regression models of inflation. Content analysis revealed that the causes of inflation most often mentioned and traditionally regarded as significant in the economic literature are factors such as money and wages, capital, competition and monopolies, and so on. Pair correlation research showed the significance for inflation of supply and demand factors such as income distribution, income levels, taxes, saving, human capital and labour productivity as well as exports and imports – things which content analysis gave only average or little mention. Regression models confirmed and helped to concretize the significance for inflation of the identified demand and supply factors. The results of the research show that inconsistent monetary and general government expenditure policies reinforce private consumption and capital shocks. Note that human capital and employment, which changed little during the analysed period, did not show the large significance for inflation that they are commonly thought to have.</jats:p>"

We consider a company that must allocate limited inventory to different markets that open sequentially. To reduce uncertainty, the company receives advance demand information and updates forecasts about its markets each time it makes an allocation decision. We study the value and optimal use of this information. This research is motivated by an agrifood manufacturer that operates in several European countries. We develop the optimal policy under relaxed conditions and an efficient heuristic policy that performs close to optimally under general conditions. We derive structural properties of the model to gain managerial insights, and we derive the optimal policy in closed form for the case of markets with identical prices. We use numerical experiments to demonstrate that the value of advance demand information can be significant. The managerial insights of this study include the observations that in environments such as the one that motivated our research, early markets receive systematically less supply than late markets and that the value of advance demand information is greatest if the initial supply is close to the initial forecasts. </jats:p>",

The reliability of vessel integrity postinjury often drives us away from a local reconstructive option. With the advancement of computed tomography angiogram, it can not only demonstrate the continuation of major vessels but also helps to map the vascular supply at a perforator level. We hereby report an incidentally identified anatomical variant with dual dominant blood supply to the extensor digitorum brevis muscle from an extra branch of anterior tibial artery originated at midtibial level. This variant was picked up preoperatively by computed tomography angiogram and confirmed intraoperatively to be one of the dominant supply. We took advantage of this unusual anatomy by basing our reconstruction on this branch and hence spared the need to terminalize distal dorsalis pedis artery.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

Inter-members’ joint financing within a supply chain is one of solutions for SMEs. How about members’ joint financing of inter-supply chains? In order to answer the question, we firstly employ the Stackelberg game to propose three kinds of financing decision models of two cash-constrained supply chains with complementary products. Secondly, we analyze qualitatively these models and find the joint financing decision of the two supply chains is the most optimal one. Lastly, we conduct some numerical simulations not only to illustrate above results but also to find that the larger are cross-price sensitivity coefficients; the higher is the motivation for participants to make joint financing decisions; and the more are profits for them to gain.</jats:p>"

Three critical steps are identified along the supply chain: product management at the origination/destination port, product transportation and product processing in dedicated plants. Best management practices and coordination mechanisms are implemented by actors along the supply chain to ensure that the product maintains its <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">IP</jats:styled-content>. This translates into a higher degree of dependency among actors. Although <jats:italic>‘</jats:italic>formal<jats:italic>’</jats:italic> vertical integration through mergers and/or acquisition is rare, voluntary schemes require very tight coordination which is enforced through downstream‐driven technical requirements and process certification standards. Market uncertainty is also observed, as the future availability of non‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GM</jats:styled-content> crops could become scarce, raising input prices for downstream firms. Food processors and retailers that invested in the non‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GM</jats:styled-content> attribute as part of their brand equity are those at higher risk.

After establishing the level of performance, the evaluation studied factors that are correlated with a higher level of performance and sustainability, relative to both the original design parameters and thechanging needs of the beneficiary communities. The evaluation found that the performance level of the systems is very high. Virtually all the systems built under the program are in service. Moreover, the users and the sanitation boards are satisfied with the quality of service in terms of water quality and reliability. Eight to ten years after installation, only 4% of the systems are not in service, compared with the rate of 20% to 25% that would be expected based on available data from around the world.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, group decision-making methods and means of collection and aggregation experts and linear assignment method is used as a method of Multiple Decision Making to determine the ranking of risks. Ranking indexes were divided in two primary and secondary categories. The primary index is based on likelihood and impact of risks on the main objectives (schedule, cost, quality and scope) of supply chain activities with different weights. The second category of indicators includesocio-economic effects, environmental impacts, near the time of risk, exposure to risk, the confidence level of the estimates and the management of risk, risk reduction and risk discovering. Risks are ranked better using linear assignment method and according to various indices and are ranked more realistic.

The core understanding of this model was that candidate selection was an interactive process in which both selectors and aspirants affected outcomes that were organized in several sets of institutions. The model illuminates power in particular institutions – British political parties – and was designed to examine the various effects of the selection process. This contribution reflects on the model and puts forward ideas and arguments about what might be done differently, taking into account the theoretical and methodological innovations of the succeeding generation of scholars who have used the model. It also identifies remaining challenges for research on candidate selection and suggests that the supply and demand model is sufficiently flexible that it can still travel across national, system and party boundaries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Antibiotics are deployed in large quantities both in human and in veterinary medicine. Studies show that antibiotic residues occur in the environment (e.g. soil and surface waters). In some cases they were also detected in ground and drinking water. However, the degree of groundwater pollution by antibiotic residues from livestock farming is unknown. Therefore, the federal environment agency (UBA) supported a project that aimed to investigate near-surface groundwater samples in regions of high livestock density and high risk of groundwater exposure to antibiotics. By applying worst case criteria on existing sampling sites of our groundwater monitoring grid (high amounts of manure on site, high precipitation, low adsorption capacity of soils, high nitrate concentrations in ground water, etc.) adequate sampling sites were identified as well as relevant antibiotics (amount of application, water solubility, biological stability, etc.) by a literature review and contacts to local veterinary authorities. In total, groundwater at 48 sampling sites was selected for analyses of 23 antibiotic substances. Out of the 23 antibiotics, only three sulfonamides could be detected and quantified. With regard to the 48 sampling sites, at 39 locations no veterinary antibiotics were detected. At seven locations sulfadimidine and/or sulfadiazine was detected at low concentrations (&amp;lt;0.012 μg/L). Only sulfamethoxazole was repeatedly detected above 0.1 μg/L at two sites. Results show that translocation of veterinary antibiotics into near-surface groundwater in most parts of Germany does not occur above detection limits. Under unfavourable conditions leaching does occur but well below the limit values for pesticides (0.1 μg/L/0.5 μg/L). However, under some extreme conditions (to be identified by further research work) one antibiotic was present in groundwater above the pesticides limit values.</jats:p>",

Specifically, customers arrive sequentially during a selection phase, and one has to decide whether to accept or reject each customer upon arrival. If a customer is rejected, then a lost-sales cost is incurred. Once the selection decisions are all made, one has to satisfy all the accepted customers with minimum possible production cost. The goal is to minimize the total cost of lost sales and production. A key feature of the model is that customers arrive in an online manner, and the decision maker does not require any information about future arrivals. </jats:p><jats:p> We provide two novel algorithms for online customer selection problems, which are based on repeatedly solving offline subproblems that ignore previously made decisions. For many important settings, our algorithms achieve small constant competitive ratio guarantees. That is, for any sequence of arriving customers, the cost incurred by the online algorithm is within a fixed constant factor of the cost incurred by the respective optimal solution that has full knowledge upfront on the sequence of arriving customers. Finally, we provide a computational study on the performance of these algorithms when applied to the economic lot sizing and joint replenishment problems with online customer selection. </jats:p>",

These risks range from severe, prolonged supply chain disruptions, to critical stockouts, and to escalating costs due to last-minute implementation of the emergency procedures. When these risks come to fruition, the financial impacts can easily reach millions of dollars or more. This study introduces a new concept of intelligent preparedness—preparedness based on the ability to sense, capture, and analyze weather data and turn it into actionable insights. The fundamental difference between conventional preparedness and intelligent preparedness lies in the way in which weather big data are leveraged (or lack thereof) in managing weather-related risks. A case example of an early implementer is presented to illustrate the important role that data analytics play in enabling managers to take advantage of the weather big data in effectuating intelligent preparedness.</jats:p>",

The main goal of a potable water system upgrade is maintaining the standard and acceptable level of service after the occurrence of increases in the serviced population, asset ageing, and/or development of the serviced area. Defining the level of service varies by location according to the codes and regulations adopted by the water authority. In general, two main factors are notable in planning of WDS upgrade strategies: (1) the ‘level of service’ and (2) the ‘upgrade cost’. In the presented paper, a new index has been introduced to evaluate the level of service for WDS from a pressure point of view. The new index that is presented in this paper is named the ‘Pressure Index (PI)’, and incorporates a number of water connections for five different pressure regimes. As a case study, three existing water network systems in the Castlemaine township area, located in central Victoria, Australia, have been investigated and the relationship between the ‘upgrade costs’ and improvement in PI factors is presented.</jats:p>",

This paper traces the development of CSR initiatives and the incorporation of sustainability into the corporate culture and business model of a large global firm in the electronics industry. The process at this firm involves several distinct stages and extends over a period of more than ten years. The organizational and managerial factors facilitating the broadening and deepening of CSR penetration and the institutional barriers encountered are discussed. The importance of fitting CSR initiatives to a company’s core competencies is evident at this firm where their most successful programs, in both a business and societal benefits sense, have used the firm’s networking expertise to provide communication services and training in both developing and developed countries. At its current stage of evolution, CSR at the firm has achieved penetration into most functional areas and is a decision criterion for many operational and strategic decisions. The firm is currently extending its sustainability efforts to its supply chain partners across the globe collaborating with them to improve their performance and build their capabilities in CSR. However, the expansion into the supply chain has not been without its hurdles. The company’s sustainability programs are discussed in the context of the theoretical and empirical literature on CSR. Implications for other firms undergoing a similar evolutionary process are highlighted. The next stage in this firm’s evolutionary process of expanding CSR into its global supply chains is discussed in the terms of its potential and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To increase resilience in supply chains, we investigate the optimal design of flexibility in a backup system. We model the dynamics of disruptions as Markov chains, and consider a multiproduct, multisupplier supply chain under dynamic disruption risks. Using our model, we first show that a little flexibility in the backup system can go a long way in mitigating dynamic disruption risks. This raises an important and fundamental question in designing flexibility in the backup system: to achieve the benefits of full backup flexibility, which unreliable suppliers should be backed up? To answer this question, we connect the supply chain to various queueing and dam models by analyzing the dynamics of the inventory shortfall process. Using this connection, we show that backing up suppliers merely based on first moment considerations such as their average reliability or average product demand can be misleading. All else equal, it is better to back up suppliers with (1) longer but less frequent disruptions, and (2) lower demand uncertainty. In addition to such second moment effects, by employing the Renyi’s Theorem, we demonstrate that when disruptions are relatively long (if they occur), backing up the suppliers for which the expected wasted backup capacity is minimum provides the best backup flexibility design. We also develop easy-to-compute and yet effective indices that (a) guide the supply chain designer in deciding which suppliers to backup, and (b) provide insights into the role of various factors such as inventory holding and shortage costs, purchasing costs, suppliers reliabilities, and product demand distributions in designing backup flexibility.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent sociological work shows that pro-market neoliberal policies across advanced capitalist countries are due to distributional struggle between classes in the 1970s and 1980s. The orthodox monetarist view, alternatively, sees neoliberal reform as a nonpolitical attempt to end the stagflation crisis of the 1970s. From this perspective, monetary and fiscal expansions brought high inflation, and central bank discipline and government austerity is the solution; but the recent trend of low inflation despite accelerating money growth and government spending contradicts this view. Analyses of time-series cross-section data for 23 OECD countries from 1960 to 2009 support the thesis that the rise and fall of inflation is more about distribution of power between labor and capital than about monetary and fiscal discipline. Inflation in the 1970s originated from a strong working class and hurt capital more than it did workers, while neoliberal repression of workers’ power has kept inflation low from the 1980s onward. Disempowerment of labor created rising inequality and economic imbalances that fueled a financial boom underlying the global financial crisis of 2008. Re-empowering labor is a remedy to such imbalances and the subsequent deflationary pressure. </jats:p>",

This paper presents a detailed surface characterization of the adsorbent by studying pore size distribution and surface morphology. By combining the constituents in the right proportion, an adsorbent with a well-developed pore size distribution could be synthesized. The effects of various parameters on fluoride adsorption by SFAA are investigated. The adsorption capacity of SFAA is considerably higher than that of many adsorbents including activated alumina. More importantly, the adsorption capacity remains unchanged for the pH range of 1 to 9, which also makes it attractive for wastewater treatment. Besides a higher efficiency supported by the results of column studies, this adsorbent is economic as the sawdust constitutes 40% by weight of the total adsorbent. Kinetic studies indicate that fluoride adsorption on SFAA follows pseudo second-order model. Breakthrough adsorption capacity of SFAA is 1.21 mg/g, as compared with 0.41 mg/g for activated alumina.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Historical and archaeological evidence shows that ancient Hellenes had developed underground aqueducts since the prehistoric times. However, innovative methods of underground aqueducts were developed in Hellas mainly during the Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods. Since the well-known tunnel at the island of Samos, Hellas, was designed and begun its construction (ca. 550 bc) by Eupalinos of Megara (the first civil engineer in history), several underground tunnels (with and without well-like vertical shafts) were implemented in the country. The goal of Eupalinos tunnel was to transfer water into the town from a spring. This tunnel, representing the peak of ancient hydraulic technology, was dug through limestone by two separate teams advancing in a straight line from both sides of the mountain. Delivering fresh water to growing populations has been an ongoing problem since ancient times. Several underground aqueduct paradigms (e.g. Peisistration in Athens, Polyrrhenia in Crete), some of which are in use even today, are presented and discussed. After late Roman times and the Adrianic aqueduct a gap of about 1,700 years in construction of such hydraulic works is noted. However, a remarkable development of tunneling in Hellas appeared during the last 50 years due to the ‘cosmogony’ of the construction of infrastructure projects using modern technology, e.g. Evinos-Mornos aqueduct with 15 tunnels of 71 km total length and the diversion tunnels in Sykia to the Thessaly plain and Messochora of the Acheloos River of 17.5 and 7.5 km length, respectively. Also, very recently three small conventional tunnels and one tunnel boring machine (TBM) were constructed in Aposelemis aqueducts used for water supply of Iraklion and Agios Nikolaos cities in Crete. As a consequence, significant design and construction experiences were gained. Overall, it seems that underground aqueducts of modern societies are not very different in principle from those during antiquity.</jats:p>",

In the photocatalytic kinetics of the photodegradation, the BPA photodegradation rate constants were 1.67 and 1.08 h−1, respectively. The BPA removal rate satisfies pseudo-first-order kinetics. Results showed that photocatalysts doped with boron displayed greater photodegradation (88% BPA removal) than pure TiO2 (65% BPA removal). Experimental results indicated that B-doped TiO2 not only was an effective photocatalyst, but also had considerable mineralization effects. The recycling test revealed that the photocatalyst remained effective after 10 uses, revealing the stability and reusability.</jats:p>",

Several commercially available portable kits make it possible to carry out on-site water quality testing, but are usually costly and often require technical expertise to operate. In developing countries like India, presence/absence test kits like the H2S test kits are commonly used for routine microbiological water quality examination. H2S test kits require an incubation time of more than 24 hours and often gives false positive results. In this research work, we have developed a low-cost and sensitive test kit (ColiPAT) for the detection of coliforms including Escherichia coli in drinking water. The kit can detect very low contamination levels down to 2 coliforms/100 mL within 18 hours at 35 °C. The ColiPAT kit does not lose its sensitivity in the typical indoor temperature range of 27 °C to 35 °C. ColiPAT is also affordable and easy to perform so that local populace can conduct the test independently. This paper presents the results of sensitivity and specificity analysis of a ColiPAT kit and its comparison with the H2S test kits as standardized using Colilert method.</jats:p>",

Discolouration is observed globally, suggesting a common process despite variations in source, treatment, disinfection and network configurations. The primary cause of discolouration has been identified as mobilisation of particulate material from pipe walls and the verified Prediction of Discolouration in Distribution Systems (PODDS) model uses measurable network hydraulics to simulate this response. In this paper the cohesive properties of discolouration material are explored and it is hypothesised that in simulating the turbidity response, the PODDS model is actually describing the development and cohesive strength behaviour of biofilms. Applying this concept can therefore facilitate a rapid and simple assessment of DWDS biofilm activity. A review of the findings from PODDS studies conducted internationally is presented, focussing on the macro or observable aspects of discolouration. These are compared and contrasted with associated biofilm studies which consider discolouration material at the micro-scale. Combining the results from these (past) studies to improve the understanding of interactions between microbial ecology and discolouration are discussed with a view to DWDS operational strategies that safeguard and optimise drinking water supply.</jats:p>",

Lamk is a representative mangrove plant that can tolerate high levels of 1,2-DCA with a lethal dose 50 (LD50) of 34.67 mM. A concentration of 10 mM 1,2-DCA was chosen in the present study because it had no adverse effect on the plant. Using B. gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk alone could completely remove 1,2-DCA over four cycles of 1,2-DCA exposure. P. putida BCC 23535 alone could also remove 1,2-DCA but the efficiency was lower than B. gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk. The combination of B. gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk and P. putida BCC 23535 could completely remove 1,2-DCA within 6 days, which was more effective than the individual plants alone. P. putida BCC 23535 can be applied in 1,2-DCA contaminated water in groundwater which B. gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk can be used in above ground contaminated environments. Therefore, this study suggests that both B. gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk and P. putida BCC 23535 are alternative ways to treat 1,2-DCA in contaminated environments.</jats:p>",

Thus, in supplies for urban and rural consumption, water quality is one of the most critical parameters to verify. Well and/or open-water systems are easily liable to anthropogenic contaminations, the source of most water-borne epidemics especially in developing countries like Sierra Leone. This study analyses 10 representative well-water systems for 18 water quality parameters in Kakua Chiefdom of Bo District, Sierra Leone. The study notes that well-water quality parameters such as total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, electrical conductivity, coliform and nitrate (NO3−) are fairly high above safe drinking water standard. The incidence of coliform in the well waters is highest in April and that of iron (Fe2+) and nitrate is highest in May. The Dipha Street well is amongst the most contaminated and has the highest scores for TDS, non-faecal coliform and fluoride (F−). Correlation analysis shows an interesting bond among the water quality parameters, ranging from strongly positive (R = 1.0) to strongly negative (R = −1.0). Fe2+ is strongly positively correlated with most of the well-water quality parameters. Irrespectively, the use of contaminated water in domestic and/or agro-industrial sectors could pose various health risks and epidemic outbreaks of different intensities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The core idea behind sectorization of Water Supply Networks (WSNs) is to establish areas partially isolated from the rest of the network to improve operational control. Besides the benefits associated with sectorization, some drawbacks must be taken into consideration by water operators: the economic investment associated with both boundary valves and flowmeters and the reduction of both pressure and system resilience. The target of sectorization is to properly balance these negative and positive aspects. Sectorization methodologies addressing the economic aspects mainly consider costs of valves and flowmeters and of energy, and the benefits in terms of water saving linked to pressure reduction. However, sectorization entails other benefits, such as the reduction of domestic consumption, the reduction of burst frequency and the enhanced capacity to detect and intervene over future leakage events. We implement a development proposed by the International Water Association (IWA) to estimate the aforementioned benefits. Such a development is integrated in a novel sectorization methodology based on a social network community detection algorithm, combined with a genetic algorithm optimization method and Monte Carlo simulation. The methodology is implemented over a fraction of the WSN of Managua city, capital of Nicaragua, generating a net benefit of 25,572 $/year.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Soil erosion and sediment control is important in watersheds with planned dam construction. For an efficient implementation of watershed management practices, identification of critical areas is vital. Many studies have made an effort to identify and prioritize critical sub-watersheds. But very limited studies have been conducted to rank sub-watersheds in terms of their sediment yield contribution at the watershed outlet. Therefore, the goal of this study is spatial priority of critical sources areas in Taleghan dam watershed based on three methods: (1) SSY-S: specific sediment yield at sub-watershed outlet (sediment yield/area), (2) SY-W: sub-watershed contribution to the sediment yield of the main watershed outlet/reservoir, and (3) SSY-W: specific sediment yield contribution of sub-watershed to the main watershed outlet/reservoir. The results of sub-watershed and prioritization showed that sub-watershed 22 has the highest sediment yield at its own sub-watershed outlet and main outlet of watershed. Also, implementing conservation practices in a high priority area shows a decrease in sediment yield at watershed outlet. However, sediment yield at outlet of watershed decreased about 11%, 15% and 17% from baseline scenario in methods 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The results show that the SSY-W method was more effective at reducing sediments entering the reservoir of Taleghan dam.</jats:p>",

On this specified subject, all recent research has applied stochastic meta-heuristic algorithms to solve these sets of problems. In this study, the application of a novel deterministic physically inspired heuristic algorithm for minimizing the cost of pipe-sizing in the water distribution system (WDS) is investigated. In fact, the algorithm used in this research is the modified central force optimization algorithm to solve the water distribution network problem called CFOnet. The approach is applied to optimize the design of the Kadu and Khorramshahr networks. For this purpose, CFOnet method is programmed in MATLAB and interfaced with the hydraulic simulation model, EPANET. The obtained solutions in this study are compared with those stochastic methods in the WDS optimization literature. This comparison shows that CFOnet is more efficient in obtaining lower cost than other optimization methods for solving the two mentioned WDSs, while it enjoys the merits of a deterministic optimization method.</jats:p>",

Mansarovar saw an opportunity for the adoption of a sustainable supply chain model and in 2015 adapted one to meet their specific needs. The resulting Web+, where Mansarovar acted as the anchor company, is still in its pilot stage but results have been encouraging. The model was designed as a voluntary partnership to promote sustainability within supplier and contractor activities that are part of Mansarovar's supply chain with the support of a certified training/enabler organisation. Ten participants were involved and the seven successfully proposed sustainability projects are estimated to save $117,000 per annum due to the resulting reduction in energy, waste and agro-chemicals consumption and other social or organizational co-benefits. This indicates that sustainable practices are all the more important when oil price drops and are integral to hydrocarbon sector profitability in both the short and long term.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Supply chain has been discussed for many decades, however, previous researches have focused on the supply chain in general, in industrial fields or in developed countries. It is rare to find articles about supply chain in agricultural and fishing industries in a developing country like Vietnam. Moreover, there have been few researches using FsQCA in analyzing the factors affecting supply chain of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This research focuses on using FsQCA to analyze the weight of factors that influence a supply chain of an industry which is one of the key exporting industries in Vietnam especifically seafood industry. Findings show that Vietnamese producing-exporting seafood SMEs (VPESSMEs) do not have any clear supply chain structure and sufficient consideration into building an effective supply chain. The authors would like to draw up some limitations of the supply chain management of Vietnamese producing-exporting seafood SMEs (VPESSMEs) then offer some suggestions especially for the fishing and agricultural industry.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

A sub-pixel approach (algae pixel-growing algorithm) was used with 13 years of MOderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to evaluate changes in bloom extension, initiation date, duration, and occurrence frequency before and after a massive bloom event (2007). Results indicated that the conditions after this event changed, with a general delay in bloom initiation and a reduction in bloom duration. The environmental drivers of daily, monthly and inter-annual CyanoHABs dynamics were analyzed by detrended correspondence analysis, principal components analysis and redundancy analysis. This demonstrated that wind speed was the main driver for daily CyanoHABs dynamics, and CODmn, total phosphorus and water temperature were closely related to monthly CyanoHABs dynamics. For the year scale, Tmean and nutrients were the main drivers of CyanoHABs initiation date and duration, and meteorological factors influenced CyanoHABs frequency for the whole lake. Regular monitoring of CyanoHABs by remote sensing has become a key element in the continued assessment of bloom conditions in Lake Taihu, and nutrient reduction policies contribute to decrease CyanoHABs occurrence.</jats:p>",

We find that welfare reform induced many women to work but led some others to reduce their earnings in order to receive assistance. The bounds on this latter “ opt-in” effect imply that intensive margin labor supply responses are nontrivial. (JEL H23, H75, I38, J16, J22) </jats:p>",

It is considered that wide distribution of this bacterium is connected with its most significant constitutive property to form biofilms, and that this multicellular mode of growth, predominant in nature, serves as a protective mechanism against unfavourable environmental conditions. The work presented here examines the phenotypic diversity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa environmental isolates with respect to biofilm production capacity under different environmental conditions (temperature, pH, NaCl), production of virulence factors, and motility. The purpose of this work is to present the production of two quorum sensing-regulated virulence factors (rhamnolipids and pyocyanin), explore different motility tests (swimming, swarming and twitching) and discover potential relationship between assessed phenotypic features. Obtained results delineate environmental conditions coinciding with biofilm production and suggest a high correlation between rhamnolipid production levels and biofilm formation. Rhamnolipids affect motility competence, yet only the flagellum-mediated swimming motility has significant impact on the biofilm formation potential. Although it is challenging to demarcate a definitive, clear correlation between parameters tested, rhamnolipid content appears to serve as a link between the tested phenotypic factors.</jats:p>",

The current condition of water systems is caused by existence of a significant amount of sources of pollution and semi-arid climate of the region. And namely this aspect accents a problem of research of quality of drinking water in this region. Main reasons for unsatisfactory quality of drinking water are opened. Except the natural polluting factors, the anthropogenic activity on catchment areas of water objects associated with plowing of lands, use of herbicides and fertilizers, a construction of roads, bridges and gas and oil pipelines has a great influence on quality of water. The presence of these constructions produces an increase in concentration of pollutants, its accumulation along routes with the subsequent washout by drains of rain and thawed snow in water objects. Environmental stress is increased by cross-border transfer of harmful pollutants from Chelyabinsk region, the Republics of Bashkortostan and Kazakhstan. Surface water quality practically of all water objects doesn't meet standard requirements of economic and drinking and fishery appointment. This is due to fact that in most parts of the region there are no facilities for water purification and disinfection. In rural settlements technical condition of water distribution networks is unsatisfactory. There are no water disinfection systems and this fact often leads to the emergence of infectious diseases. The main actions in order to optimize the system of providing the Orenburg region population by standard quality drinking water and in sufficient quantity are offered.</jats:p>"

The data were analysed by a universal exponential formula based on an immune evolutionary algorithm, and later mapped with the Kriging interpolation method. The primary objectives were to assess the main parameters that influenced groundwater quality and the spatio-temporal variability of groundwater contamination over several years. The results showed that NO3−, NH4+, and TH were the main parameters that influenced groundwater quality. Spatially, groundwater was polluted in all urban areas to varying degrees, and the Jiangbei district was the most heavily polluted location. Temporally, the groundwater contamination status could generally be classified into four stages and showed the following pattern during 1980–2009: heavy – light – heavy – light.</jats:p>",

Biodegradable organic matter (BOM) that remains after water reclamation processes directly promotes microbial regrowth. In this study we propose a novel assay called the ‘bacterial growth fingerprint (BGF)’ to characterise BOM based on the maximum growth of bacterial strains, which is the extension of the conventional assimilable organic carbon assay for drinking water. Nine bacterial strains were selected from nearly 200 isolates from various reclaimed water systems. These selected bacterial strains exhibited unique substrate utilisation patterns. The BGF assay clearly reflected the difference in the quantity and quality of BOM between six different reclamation plants and the changes in BOM during a full-scale reclamation process. The information on BOM revealed by the BGF assay is useful to optimise the treatment processes or operational conditions for biologically stable reclaimed water.</jats:p>",

Limited research has considered, simultaneously, the numerous factors that contribute to sustainability – for example, social acceptance, water quality, and maintenance needs – of RWH. This research aimed to improve the understanding of factors influencing the sustainability of rainwater harvesting systems for domestic use (DRWHS) through examination of social, water quality, and technical feasibility components. We conducted 50 household surveys and 17 rainwater quality analyses in San Jose Xacxamayo, a rural, semi-arid community in Puebla, Mexico. Results showed that DRWHS are socially accepted primarily because of the presence of existing local skills and knowledge, as well as critical need for water. Results from most of the water quality parameters measured were within World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for human consumption, with the exception of pH, total coliform, and heterotrophic plate count, which required water treatment prior to consumption. Technical feasibility was the main barrier to the sustainability of DRWHS; highly seasonal rainfall and small roof sizes (averaging 70 m2) resulted in households unable to meet annual water needs. Increasing roof sizes and providing water treatment could ensure DRWHS sustainability in the studied community.</jats:p>",

The Group harnessed smartphone technology to develop a database that contains brand‐specific information on the nutritional composition of &gt;250,000 foods globally.

E.g. data from Australia were used to monitor the implementation of government sodium reduction targets. Comparisons of sodium levels over time exposed the limited progress in achieving the targets, with data presented at the individual company level. Data from India highlighted the incompleteness of nutritional labelling as another key issue in the field and was used to push government to better enforce existing labelling standards in the country. Data are also being used to fuel the FoodSwitch smartphone application, which allows consumers in Australia, NZ, the UK, China, India and South Africa to scan the barcodes of food items in‐store and be directed to healthier brands of similar products. If a product is missing from the database, app users are prompted to take 3 photos of the missing item. This alone has resulted in more than 700,000 photos being sent in by users to date, and a minimum of 300 new photos being submitted daily. These crowd‐sourced data are also used to help drive improvements in national food supplies. The app already has more than 760,000 downloads in Australia, NZ and the UK alone, with launches in the USA, Canada, Hong Kong and Switzerland planned for 2016.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>Smartphone technology has helped collect large amounts of information about the healthiness of the global food supply.

Thus, handling the transition of a single enterprise is not sufficient for strategic network leverage. Planning and managing across multiple enterprises is required, taking into consideration various cost items and budget constraints. In this study, a multi-period multi-partner cost-optimizing model is developed for network-level management of cloud transition for a SC. The model produces an optimal transition plan, indicating timing of the transition for each partner to obtain the maximum cost savings across network over a specified planning horizon. The model proposed is generic, flexible and customizable for different sectors/settings.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT The possibility to vary the energy matrix, thus reducing the dependency on fossil fuels, has amplified the acceptance of biomass as an alternative fuel. Despite being a cheap and renewable option and the fact that Brazil is a major producer of waste from agriculture and forestry activities, the use of these materials has barriers due to its low density and low energetic efficiency, which can raise the costs of its utilization. Biomass densification has drawn attention due to its advantage in comparison to in natura biomass due to its better physical and combustion characteristics. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of biomass densification in distribution and transport costs. To reach this objective, a mathematical model was used to represent decisions at a supply chain that coordinates the purchase and sale of forestry and wood waste. The model can evaluate the options to deliver biomass through the supply chain combining demand meeting and low cost. Results point to the possibility of an economy of 60% in transport cost and a reduction of 63% in the required quantity of trucks when densified waste is used. However, costs related to the densifying process lead to an increase of total supply costs of at least 37,8% in comparison to in natura waste. Summing up, the viability of biomass briquettes industry requires a cheaper densification process.</jats:p>",

Water consumption of various land use and cover classes shows similar seasonal dynamic trends. The spatial distribution of annual actual evapotranspiration (AET) shows low values in the Empty Quarter (231–438 mm/yr), and moderate values in the Eastern Province borders (439–731 mm/yr). Very high AET values were observed in irrigated croplands in the Northern plains, Hafar Al-Batin, the central coastal lowlands, and the southern coastal lowlands, where annual AET ranged from 732 to 1,790 mm/yr, representing the majority of the study area agricultural land. Evaporative behavior of land use-cover types indicated that irrigated cropland, which occupies 0.37% of the study area, has an average daily AET ranging from 9.2 mm/day in January to a maximum value in April (30 mm/day). Average annual water use by irrigated cropland is relatively very high and it is roughly 1,786.9 mm/yr, while water bodies, which cover 0.023% (121.2 km2) of the study area, also had relatively high mean AET (660.8 mm/yr). Overall, AET rates for irrigated cropland are much higher than for other land uses.</jats:p>",

This paper makes an attempt to examine the patterns of access to drinking water, identify and analyze the factors that influence households access to safe drinking water sources, and analyze factors determining the extent of households travel to fetch drinking water, and assess the effects of access to safe drinking water on human health in Bhutan, using the data from the Bhutan Living Standard Survey 2012 (BLSS 2012). For this, various methodological tools have been adopted such as logistic regression model, censored least absolute deviation model, and the propensity score matching (PSM) approach. The logistic regression results show that households with educated, younger, and male members are more likely to have access to safe drinking water. Wealthier households also prefer safe drinking water than their poorer counterparts. The PSM results suggest that households having access to safe drinking water have fewer stomach disorders and skin diseases, and are likely to incur less expenditure on medicine. Keeping these findings in mind, the paper suggests that the Bhutanese government should invest in water infrastructure, which may lead to a significant reduction in water-borne diseases and health expenditure.</jats:p>",

As an amorphous thermoplastic material, lignin has a relatively high glass‐transition temperature and also undergoes radical‐induced self‐condensation at high temperatures, which limits its thermal processability. Additionally, lignin‐based materials are usually brittle and exhibit poor mechanical properties. To improve the thermoplasticity and mechanical properties of technical lignin, polymers or plasticizers are usually integrated with lignin by blending or chemical modification. This Review attempts to cover the reported approaches towards the development of lignin‐based thermoplastic materials on the basis of published information. Approaches reviewed include plasticization, blending with miscible polymers, and chemical modifications by esterification, etherification, polymer grafting, and copolymerization. Those lignin‐based thermoplastic materials are expected to show applications as engineering plastics, polymeric foams, thermoplastic elastomers, and carbon‐fiber precursors.</jats:p>",

The role of suppliers’ performance is crucial in achieving quality, cost, service and delivery aims of a supply chain. The selection of suppliers is regarded as one of the critical issues encountered by purchasing and operations managers in a supply chain to enhance organization’s global marketplace competitiveness. Most of the supply chain models are rather complex problems. Consequently, it is impossible to propose systematic models to handle them. Therefore, in this paper a new integrated approach based on experimental design and computer simulation is proposed for supplier selection. The paper aims to discuss these issues. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – In this study, a simulation approach is implemented to determine certain equivalent of parameters values in a CLSC network design which cannot be computed through mathematical model.

The wind resources in three different cities were considered: Campinas (SP/BR), Cubatão (São Paulo/BR) and Roscoe (Texas/ USA). A wind power system connected to the grid and a wind isolated system - batteries were evaluated. The results showed that the energy cost ($/kWh) is strongly dependent on the windmill characteristics and local wind resource. Regarding the isolated wind system – batteries, the full supply guarantee to the simulated electrical load is only achieved with a battery bank with many units and high number of wind turbines, due to the intermittency of wind power.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Introduction</jats:title><jats:p>Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in North America. Specifically, lacunar infarcts – occurring within deeper cortical regions of the brain – account for up to 25% of all stroke incidence. These regions of the brain are supplied by short penetrating arteries (SPAs) that arise perpendicularly from their main arterial supply, such as the lateral lenticulostriate arteries which supply part of the basal ganglia. The penetrating arteries travel only a short distance before their systolic pressure must be reduced to capillary pressure. In contrast, the long circumferential arteries (LCAs) that supply the superficial cerebral cortex have a long course and oblique branching pattern, which permits a more gradual reduction in intraluminal pressure as the capillary bed is approached. This study compares the morphological design of the short vessels and the longer circumferential vessels to determine whether their structure reflects their different vascular pressure dynamics.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Objective</jats:title><jats:p>The objective of this study is to quantitatively assess the morphology of the SPAs and LCAs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>Histological sections from the cortex, mammillary bodies and brainstem were stained with Masson's trichrome and scanned with an Aperio ScanScope AT Turbo at 40x.

The ratio of tunica adventitia: tunica intima + tunica media is approximately 1.6 times higher for the basilar and rhombencephalic SPAs than the cortical LCAs. The ratio of luminal diameter: tunica intima + media is approximately 1.5 times higher for SPAs as compared to LCAs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>We have demonstrated a reliable quantitative method to assess cerebral arteries and have shown clear differences between the morphology of the SPAs and LCAs.

The aim of this study is to investigate the response of groundwater nitrate concentration in a public supply well to land-use change, discussing the effect of land-use change in tackling agricultural nitrate pollution in the aquifer. Six land-use scenarios were examined in predictive simulations of groundwater nitrate concentration. Groundwater flow modelling (MODFLOW) and mass transport modelling (MT3DMS), incorporating results from an export coefficient model, were used to predict groundwater nitrate concentration in the public supply well by 2025. Results from the quantitative comparison of scenarios revealed that the greatest decrease in nitrate concentration (35%) by 2025 in the public supply well was associated with the entire target zone being covered with forest, whereas a decrease dependent on the application of best agricultural practice achieved no more than a 20% reduction. It is concluded that the modelling framework constructed in this study is a useful tool for assessment of the impact of changes in land use and management on groundwater nitrate concentration in public supply wells.</jats:p>",

The mathematical model is associated with resultant documents, which makes it possible to get a modified set of documentation automatically when changes are introduced in the engine fuel feed system.</jats:p>"

The WPI includes five components (resources, access, capacity, use, and environment) and has 13 indicators; each indicator is assigned an equal weighting. The selected set of components and indicators was used to discuss the spatial and temporal variation of the water scarcity situation in the middle of the HRB for a 10-year assessment period. The results show that the water scarcity situation of the HRB is generally evolving in a positive way from 2001 to 2010. However, the WPI varied widely (from 24.6 to 66.5) at a spatial scale. The water situation was best maintained in Jiayuguan City, and it was most severe in Jiuquan City. These variations suggest that different cities require different policy intervention to improve the overall water situation. Overall, the WPI appears to be a reasonable approach to examine the water scarcity situation and help decision makers to better devise local policy.</jats:p>",

Previous studies have identified relationships between nutrient-limited growth and elemental ratios in large eukaryotes, but little is known about these interactions in small marine phytoplankton like the globally important Cyanobacteria. To improve our understanding of these interactions in picophytoplankton, we asked how cellular elemental stoichiometry varies as a function of steady-state, N- and P-limited growth in laboratory chemostat cultures of Synechococcus WH8102. By combining empirical data and theoretical modeling, we identified a previously unrecognized factor (growth-dependent variability in cell size) that controls the relationship between nutrient-limited growth and cellular elemental stoichiometry. To predict the cellular elemental stoichiometry of phytoplankton, previous theoretical models rely on the traditional Droop model, which purports that the acquisition of a single limiting nutrient suffices to explain the relationship between a cellular nutrient quota and growth rate. Our study, however, indicates that growth-dependent changes in cell size have an important role in regulating cell nutrient quotas. This key ingredient, along with nutrient-uptake protein regulation, enables our model to predict the cellular elemental stoichiometry of Synechococcus across a range of nutrient-limited conditions. Our analysis also adds to the growth rate hypothesis, suggesting that P-rich biomolecules other than nucleic acids are important drivers of stoichiometric variability in Synechococcus. Lastly, by comparing our data with field observations, our study has important ecological relevance as it provides a framework for understanding and predicting elemental ratios in ocean regions where small phytoplankton like Synechococcus dominates.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Identifying the subsurface profile for riverbank/bed filtration (RBF) using conventional methods such as drilled boreholes is usually labor intensive, costly and acquires only 1-D profiling. Hence, a 2-D ground resistivity method was used as an alternative to obtain a 2-D subsurface profile by extending to 200 m length at Kota Lama Kiri, Kuala Kangsar, Perak site area. Four resistivity survey lines (200 m each) with minimum electrode spacing of 5 m were executed at the site area. The Wenner-Schlumberger array protocol was applied for acquisition data process. The resistivity data were then processed and interpreted using RES2DINV software. The results show the approximate 2-D pseudo-section image of the subsurface resistivity distribution with different soil types. The interpretation of results reveals that the site area consists of two main layers: (a) sand and gravel (300–750 Ωm) from 0 to 10 m depth, and (b) weathered rock (0–350 Ωm) within 10 to 40 m depth. It found that the first layer (0–10 m depth) belongs to the alluvial aquifer type and has a relatively high permeability, thus suitable for RBF. This method is believed to be able to give great assistance for selecting the suitable area for RBF in the future.</jats:p>",

The e-tailer replenishes products from the supplier for private inventory and sends drop shipping requests to him for delivering orders to customers when private inventory is insufficient or stock out, whereas the supplier provides drop shipping service with a limited ability for the e-tailer. This paper proposes an algorithm to simulate the scheduling sequences of the e-tailer with the optimal threshold policy and mixture strategy in every scheduling unit and obtains the optimal threshold of private inventory for the e-tailer to achieve average profit maximization. The impacts of mixture of demand and lead time uncertainty are examined. The influence of high priority demand variability on the optimal threshold policy in two complex scenarios are also considered in this study. These results have an important guiding significance for the e-tailer who adopts the mixture strategy in e-fulfillment under complex operating environments.</p>",

KMnO4 pre-oxidation altered the molecular weight, hydrophobicity and proteins' categories insignificantly. However, the in-situ formed MnO2 showed better adsorption ability for the IOM and phycocyanin. The main enhanced removal mechanism was the adsorption of MnO2 formed from the reduction of KMnO4 and little difference existed between the IOM and phycocyanin.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study investigated the water supply sources in Old Umuahia semi-urban district in Abia State, Nigeria. Emphasis was on the quality and quantity of available water sources. Some socio-economic considerations such as family sizes, proximity of source, quality and quantity of water actually used per day as compared with quantity required per day were all evaluated. Water supply shortfall was hence evaluated and quantified. Different sources of water in use were evaluated. They include motorized boreholes, Springs, Streams, commercial water vendors and harvested rainwater. The study showed that the majority of residents had bread winners who were civil servants (48%) with an average family size of 5-8 people. Most people practice conjunctive water use of water combining more than one source with comparative advantages. 89% of the people depend on water boreholes for their drinking water supplies. Available hydrogeological data from the area were reviewed. The area was found to be underlain by a prolific aquifer capable of sustainably supplying the area. Water samples were collected from the different water sources and analysed for concentration of key physico-chemical parameters such as pH, Dissolve d Oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, totaldissolved solids, total hardness, chloride, salinity, total alkalinity, copper, iron, manganese, sulphate, chromium, colour and zinc. The results were compared with World Health Organisation (WHO) standards for domestic water supply. From the results, water in the area was found to be acidic with pH values ranging from 4.9 to 5.15 (mean value, 5.02). All the other physico-chemical parameters showed values that plot within the limit of acceptability of WHO standards except for two boreholes sources, two streams sources and samples from the commercial water vendors whose water samples indicated serious bacteriological contamination. Supplies from groundwater sources is of highest quality. Since the area is underlain by aquifers with excellent water yielding properties, the studyrecommended the development of water supply in the area mainly from groundwater sources. This will require additional hydrogeological studies to determine the number, location and depths of new boreholes to serve the domestic water demands of the inhabitants of the area. Existing four boreholes are grossly inadequate to meet and sustain the domestic water needs of about 8000 people who presently inhabit the area. Similarly, people should be discouraged from using the water from commercial water vendors for domestic purposes. This will drastically reducethe incidence of water-borne diseases in the area</jats:p>"

As the NNPS employs a per serving approach, a sensitivity analysis using different serving sizes, especially those derived from dietary intake surveys, could give a better estimation of the potential public health impact of the system. Applying the NNPS reformulation targets in other product categories and datasets should indicate the impact on changes in the food supply on a global scale.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Support or Funding Information</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>All authors were employed by Nestec SA</jats:p><jats:p><jats:table-wrap>\n<jats:caption><jats:title>Overview of the 6 included NNPS categories and their nutritional targets per serving.</jats:title></jats:caption>\n\n<jats:table frame=\"hsides\">\n<jats:col />\n<jats:col />\n<jats:col />\n<jats:col />\n<jats:col />\n<jats:col />\n<jats:col />\n<jats:col />\n<jats:thead>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:th />\n<jats:th>Nutrients to limit</jats:th>\n<jats:th>Nutrients to encourage</jats:th>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:th>NNPS category</jats:th>\n<jats:th>E (kcal)</jats:th>\n<jats:th>TF (g)</jats:th>\n<jats:th>SFA (g)</jats:th>\n<jats:th>AS (g)</jats:th>\n<jats:th>Na (mg)</jats:th>\n<jats:th>P (g)</jats:th>\n<jats:th>Ca (mg)</jats:th>\n</jats:tr>\n</jats:thead>\n<jats:tbody>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>Complete meals</jats:td>\n<jats:td>600</jats:td>\n<jats:td>23.3</jats:td>\n<jats:td>10.0</jats:td>\n<jats:td>37.5</jats:td>\n<jats:td>960</jats:td>\n<jats:td>18.0</jats:td>\n<jats:td />\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>Pizza as center of plate</jats:td>\n<jats:td>400</jats:td>\n<jats:td>10.5–17.8</jats:td>\n<jats:td>3.5–7.8</jats:td>\n<jats:td>5.0–10.0</jats:td>\n<jats:td>792</jats:td>\n<jats:td />\n<jats:td />\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>Soups</jats:td>\n<jats:td>200</jats:td>\n<jats:td>5.3</jats:td>\n<jats:td>1.5</jats:td>\n<jats:td>2.5</jats:td>\n<jats:td>792</jats:td>\n<jats:td />\n<jats:td />\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>Cold cuts &amp; spreads</jats:td>\n<jats:td>200</jats:td>\n<jats:td>7.0</jats:td>\n<jats:td>2.0</jats:td>\n<jats:td>2.5</jats:td>\n<jats:td>240</jats:td>\n<jats:td />\n<jats:td />\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>Yoghurts &amp; fresh cheeses</jats:td>\n<jats:td>200</jats:td>\n<jats:td>5.3</jats:td>\n<jats:td>3.0</jats:td>\n<jats:td>12.5</jats:td>\n<jats:td>240</jats:td>\n<jats:td>6.0</jats:td>\n<jats:td>280</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>Juice‐based beverages</jats:td>\n<jats:td>200</jats:td>\n<jats:td>3.5</jats:td>\n<jats:td>1.0</jats:td>\n<jats:td>0.5</jats:td>\n<jats:td>120</jats:td>\n<jats:td />\n<jats:td />\n</jats:tr>\n</jats:tbody>\n</jats:table>\n\n<jats:table-wrap-foot>\n<jats:fn><jats:p>Abbreviations: NNPS: Nestlé Nutrient Profiling System; E: energy; TF: total fat; SFA: saturated fatty acids; AS: added sugar; Na: sodium; P: protein; Ca: calcium.</jats:p></jats:fn>\n</jats:table-wrap-foot>\n</jats:table-wrap></jats:p></jats:sec>",

Biological oxygen demand (BOD), NH4, total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride and potassium have been used as markers of contamination from the leachates of animal carcasses. However, livestock manure and vegetable oils from compost are also a source of these markers. In this study, we propose arachidonic acid (C20:4) as a specific indicator of leachates from animal carcasses, and the presence of arachidonic acid in underground water is suggested to be a potential marker of contamination from the leachates of animal carcasses. Based on the specific fatty acid composition, the fatty acid profiles of the carcass leachates, livestock manure and vegetable oil were examined, and multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses of the fatty acids showed pronounced differences between the carcass leachates, livestock manure and vegetable oils in this study. MDS analyses of fatty acids can also be used as a potential indicator of contamination from the leachates of animal carcasses in groundwater.</jats:p>",

As a result, the local hydrological characteristics of the basin and the flood runoff and process have been changed. These changes in the basin characteristics make basin hydrological forecasting more difficult. In order to model and assess this situation, the TOPMODEL, which includes the dynamic soil moisture storage capacity (DSMSC-TOPMODEL), is used in this study to simulate the flood impact of hydraulic projects. Furthermore, the Bayesian method is used to evaluate model parameter uncertainty and assess the TOPMODEL's performance over the basin. Flood simulation results show that accuracy is significantly improved when the stock version of TOPMODEL is replaced with DSMSC-TOPMODEL, with the qualified ratio of forecasting runoff yield increasing from 65% in the former to 88% in the latter. Moreover, these flood simulations are more suitable for helping observers visualize the process.</jats:p>",

This literature is advanced by testing whether wanting to move into homeownership before the actual entry into homeownership affects individuals’ labour supply in couples. The empirical analysis is based on longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991–2008). Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to predict the labour supply of women and men separately. Labour supply changes associated with homeownership are found to mainly occur when individuals want to move into homeownership and prior to the actual entry into homeownership. When wanting to move into homeownership, women and men increase their labour supply, where women are more likely to take up work and men to increase work hours. For women, the association between wanting to move into homeownership and labour supply is moderated by regional house price changes. </jats:p>",

Challenges in hands-free implementation are presented and examples of some of the successes of the hands-free implementation strategy are highlighted. Hand injury data from 2011 to 2015 is analyzed to provide an overview of the progress of the hands-free initiative in the global supply chain operations. The introduction of the hands-free concept since 2014, which focuses on a three-pronged approach, in addition to the rollout of the Hi-5 Hand Saver concept which defines hands-free operations, will be evaluated qualitatively. Critical programs that support hands-free implementation, such as the Hands-Free Machining program, is reviewed with data relating to the hands-free machining effort used to evaluate the success of the program and in formulating the next evolution of the program. Significant improvement has been observed in reducing hand injuries resulting from machining operations as a result of the Hands-Free Machining program. The hands-free strategy has shown promising results with significant improvement in hand injury incident rates since its introduction. Sustainable hand safety performance can only come about with a holistic combination of hearts and minds, a competent workforce that works safely with their hands, thus providing viable and realistic solutions to working hands-free. The intense focus on hands-free has brought about a paradigm shift in managing hand injury risks in supply chain operations and serves as a worthy model for application in addressing hand injury concerns in other aspects of oilfield operations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Recently, market disruptions are more prone to emerging in supply chains. To investigate the impact of such a phenomenon on the performance of supply chain members and the entire supply chain, we consider a two‐tier supply chain that consists of one manufacturer (he) and one retailer (she). The retailer orders products from the manufacturer and then sells them to a market in the presence of a potential market disruption caused by a random event. According to the timing of the retailer's order, we study two types of wholesale price contracts, that is, the pull contract (the retailer orders only during the selling season and the manufacturer bears the full inventory risk) and the push contract (the retailer only orders before the selling season starts and bears the full inventory risk). We derive the equilibrium wholesale prices, retail prices, production quantities, order quantities, and corresponding profits under each contract, respectively. By making a comparison between these two types of contracts, we find that when the potential market disruption is severe, the pull contract performs better than the push contract for the supply chain, while the push contract is more attractive for the supply chain when the potential market disruption is relatively mild. Moreover, the manufacturer always prefers the push contract, and the retailer always prefers the pull contract. We also show that the pull or push contract with revenue sharing can still coordinate the supply chain with the potential market disruption.</jats:p>",

Покровскому – Фонтейну в количестве 65 наблюдений. Из них прослежены отдаленные результаты лечения в сроки свыше 3-х лет у 45 человек (II ст. – 27 пациентов, III ст. n=18). Средний возраст больных составил 63,3±5,8. Оценка результатов проведена в зависимости от исходной стадии заболевания. Эффективность лечения оценивалась следующими методами: 1. Определение качества жизни (физического и психологического компонентов здоровья) производилось в помощью русифицированной версии стандартного опросника SF 36; 2. Дистанция безболевой ходьбы (ДБХ) определялась при проведении тредмил-теста (скорость ходьбы 1 км/час, угол наклона 0°); 3. Сохранность конечностей; 4. Выживаемость больных. Результаты и их обсуждение Значительно улучшились показатели качества жизни через 1 год наблюдения с последующим сохранением положительного результата в течение 3-х лет у всех пациентов с II стадией ХОЗАНК. Среднее значение физического компонента здоровья (ФКЗ) при включении в клиническое исследование (КИ) составило 29,0±6 баллов. В течение первого года показатель возрос до 42,2±8. В дальнейшем отмечен дальнейший рост до уровня 47,6±9 к концу срока наблюдения. Психологический компонент здоровья (ПКЗ): исходно 34,2±4,0 балла, за первый год наблюдения увеличился до 52,9±5, а за 2 и 3 годы стабилизировался и достиг отметки 54,8±6. Среднее значение ДБХ - 159±123 м, через 1 год - 676 ±542, через 2 года 704 ±475, через 3 года - 654±415м. Сохранность конечностей на протяжении всего срока наблюдения составила 100%, выживаемость – 88,9%.У пациентов с III стадией ХОЗАНК исходное значение ФКЗ составило 22,3±1,3 баллов. В течение первого года показатель возрос до 31,4±9,3 и в дальнейшем отмечено его постепенное увеличение до 37,5 ±9,0 к концу 3 года. Изменения ПКЗ были более значимы. При включении в КИ - 25,2±4,3 балла, за первый год наблюдения увеличение до 36,2±11. За 2 и 3 годы данный показатель продолжил свой рост и достиг отметки 51,1±8,3 балла. Исходно среднее значение ДБХ - 31,5±25м, через 1 год - 200 ±107, через 2 года - 274 ±72, через 3 года - 271±63м. Сохранность конечностей за весь период наблюдения - 78%. В трех наблюдениях в течение первого года и в одном в течение второго года выполнены ампутации нижних конечностей на уровне бедра по поводу прогрессирования хронической ишемии. Выживаемость в этой группе составила 100%.Выводы Применение одного курса лечения препаратом на основе гена vegf 165 у больных с II и III стадиями ХОЗАНК по А.В. Покровскому-Фонтейну приводит к стойкому положительному эффекту у значительного большинства пациентов в отдаленном периоде до трех лет и не требует повторных курсов генной терапии. У 82% пациентов отмечено улучшение как физического, так и, в большей степени, психологического компонентов качества жизни; отмечено значительное увеличение ДБХ, повысилась их повседневная активность. У всех пациентов отмечена хорошая переносимость препарата и отсутствие побочных действий; зафиксирована стабилизация полученных результатов. Выживаемость составила 93,3%.</jats:p>"

Occasionally there is a high recruitment of juveniles in Kattegat/Skagerrak, without leading to the rebuilding of adult cod stocks despite reduced fishing mortality. In a biophysical model of egg and larval drift, we examined the potential importance of extant and historical spawning grounds for recruitment of cod in the Kattegat/Skagerrak seas using data of spawning stock biomass from the 1970s and from today's reduced stocks. The results suggest that Kattegat in the 1970s relied on largely locally retained (83%) larvae with little annual variation in recruitment. Kattegat also provided a substantial proportion of larvae recruiting in Swedish Skagerrak (72%). This is in contrast to present conditions where the Kattegat spawning stock has been reduced by 94%, and Kattegat only provides 34% of locally retained larvae and 30% to Swedish Skagerrak. Instead, the protected area in the Öresund and the Belt Sea are expected today to provide most larvae recruiting in Kattegat. Also, the inflow of larvae from the North Sea to Skagerrak and Kattegat can be significant although highly variable between years, with a positive correlation to the North‐Atlantic Oscillation index (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NAO</jats:styled-content>). The rebuilding of healthy spawning areas in the Kattegat may be key for restoring local cod stocks in both Kattegat and along the Skagerrak coast. This poses a management challenge if cod with local ‘Kattegat’ adaptations, e.g., in terms of egg density and migration patterns, are lost or reduced to non‐resilient densities.</jats:p>",

One of the primary tasks in reducing total supply chain costs is to understand where the costs occur in a supply chain and how each activity impacts the total supply chain costs. Most supply chains in construction usually involve multiple entities, each one in a different process. A rebar supply chain is one example where many entities are involved in different processes. The supply chain coordinator needs a supply chain cost model, which shows how each activity impacts all supply chain costs to reduce the total costs. The research suggests a supply chain cost model using time-driven activity-based costing. The proposed cost model was applied to a building construction project, followed by sensitivity analysis identifying critical activities. This method can be adapted to analyze other fragmented material supply chains in the construction industry. </jats:p>",

Depending on the context, a combination of supply and demand factors, community and institutional factors may affect household food insecurity and hunger. Our objective was to determine the degree of household food insecurity and hunger, and examine the contribution of associated contextual factors, in two rural communities of Ethiopia, namely Halaba and Zeway, located in two adjacent regions of the country (SNNPR and Oromiya Regions, respectively). A sample of 630 households were randomly selected from the two districts, and levels of food insecurity and hunger were measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and Household Hunger Scale developed by Food and Nutrition Technical Assistant project (United States Agency for International Development). Multiple classification analysis was employed to explore the effects of key demand (e.g. household size, livestock) and supply (e.g. land size, wealth) factors and community (geographic location) as well as institutional (participation in food security programs) factors on food insecurity and hunger. Household food insecurity was unacceptably high in both districts (95% in Halaba &amp; 67% in Zeway). Household hunger was 38% in Halaba and 18% in Zeway. Both food insecurity and hunger were significantly greater in Halaba (p&lt;0.001), indicating an effect of geographic location. Both supply and demand factors were significant in determining household food insecurity and hunger (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt;0.01); however, supply factors such as women's access to land, land size and wealth had greater influence than the demand factors. Levels of food insecurity and hunger in both communities were very high and of serious concern. We recommend increasing the food supply, and its subsequent accessibility, for households through enhancing women's access to land, improving income through savings and wealth accumulation, introducing more inclusive programs for women's participation and reducing household work‐burden by significantly enhancing productivity of cultivable land.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Support or Funding Information</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>The research was supported by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the Department of Foreign Affairs Trade and Development (DFATD), Government of Canada, through the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF).</jats:p>",

In a typical agricultural headwater catchment in the Chiba prefecture, Japan, the groundwater nitrate concentration showed an increasing trend, while for spring water, a substantial decreasing trend was observed during our monitoring period. Two key issues, (1) identification of multiple flow pathways and (2) evaluation of the residence time for different pathways, were emphasized to reveal the factors controlling the different patterns of nitrate trend. Three major flow pathways including vertical soil water flow (VF), lateral groundwater flow (LG) and deep groundwater flow (DG) along the upland-slope-valley were differentiated. Different timescales of three flow pathways were identified. The residence time of VF was calculated as 9–10 years based on the soil water budget equation and the apparent age of LG was estimated as 41 years by chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) traces. The increasing trend of NO3− in groundwater agreed well with the historical nitrate loading, and the decreasing trend of NO3− in spring was mainly influenced by nitrate behavior of LF, which substantially decreased due to reduction of nitrogen fertilizer loadings since 2000.</jats:p>",

Here we compared intraspecific body size and growth responses to predation against a backdrop of 2006 estimates of asymptotic mass and growth constants (i.e., von Bertalanffy parameters) across species. We show that intraspecific responses can be quite large relative to interspecific variation and confirm that the magnitude and direction of body size responses is variable. We then employed the supply–demand (SD) model of body mass evolution to explore how predator-induced changes in resource demand or supply could alter body mass. The SD model predicts that any combination of increasing or decreasing body mass and increasing or decreasing growth rate is possible when predation risk is increased, which is consistent with the literature. Finally, we use three case studies to illustrate how the interplay of resource supply and resource demand determines the actual body mass and growth rate response to predation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Maternal obesity is associated with shortened breastfeeding duration, but the mechanism remains unclear. A progression of research is pointing to waning insulin secretion in the context of insulin resistance as a strong contributor to low milk supply in mothers attempting to exclusively breastfeed. Metformin enhances insulin action, but it is not known if it improves milk production. Our primary aim is to enact a phase I/II double‐masked randomized placebo‐controlled trial (RCT) of metformin versus placebo to treat low milk supply in women with signs of insulin resistance. At baseline, all referred women receive standard guidance for increasing milk supply with breast expression, record 24‐hours of milk production, and are evaluated for RCT eligibility. If eligible, participants are randomly assigned to metformin or placebo. Specimen collection includes milk fat RNA at baseline and post‐treatment.

It has become so important that organizations have begun to directly manage the supply chain, appointing specific managers to perform this function. New challenges now include a focus on supply to determine the right time and place for product delivery. Some authors indicate a close relationship between Total Quality Management and the supply chain regarding its philosophical and operational goals and perspectives. Lee (2004) goes even further by indicating that only organizations that devise agile, adaptable and aligned supply chains will be able to continue competing in today’s environment. Therefore, observing and measuring the supply chain at all times is critical for today’s organizations. The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation of a tool called Supply Chain Value Stream Mapping (SCVSM) in order to thoroughly understand competitive priorities of volume and delivery (On-time Delivery (OTD)) for any supply chain in organizations.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– An exploratory case study was conducted. Two manufacturing company which have been established in Mexico with a robust supply chain for at least 20 years, were selected. The paper chronicles the implementation of SCVSM in both case studies.

Its development, refinement and applied in both case studies. The evidence shows that it is possible to apply the tool (SCVSM) to visualize the variables volume and OTD in supply chains. In consequence, this research has made a small empirical contribution to the theoretical field of supply chain quality management.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– This paper has the same limitations as all other case-study-based research, including analysis subjectivity and questionable generalization of findings. There may well also be a theoretical gap in the geographic region because the paper only analyzes two companies established in Mexico.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– Derived to describe both case studies on how to apply the SCVSM tool it may prove to be of value to practitioners and managers involved in the field.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is well documented that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with both muscular and vascular dysfunctions. Interestingly, although both peripheral oxygen (O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) transport and muscle O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> utilization capacity appear to be impaired in patients with COPD, it is still unclear which peripheral component of the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cascade actually limits overall muscle aerobic capacity. Therefore, purpose of the present study was to determine whether mitochondrial function <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> is limited by convective O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery or the intrinsic capacity of mitochondria to synthesize ATP in patients with COPD. To this aim, we combined phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<jats:sup>31</jats:sup>P‐MRS), near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and Doppler ultrasound, to examine the effect of superimposing reactive hyperaemia (RH), induced by a period of brief ischemia during the last min of exercise, on O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery and mitochondrial function in the calf muscle of 16 patients with moderate to severe COPD in comparison to free‐flow conditions (FF). Limb blood flow [area under the curve (AUC), FF: 2.5 ± 1.2 L; RH: 3.3 ± 1.0 L, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05] and convective O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery (AUC, FF: 0.46 ± 0.23 L; RH: 0.61 ± 0.21 L, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0.08) were increased in RH in comparison to FF. RH was also associated with significantly higher capillary blood flow (AUC, FF: 26 ± 14 L; RH: 37 ± 25 L, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05). However, despite an increased muscle perfusion and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery, the peak rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis did not differ significantly between conditions (FF: 28 ± 14 mM.min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; RH: 27 ± 9 mM.min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0.83). Taken together, these results indicate that an increase in convective O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery does not improve mitochondrial function in the plantar flexor muscles of the patients with COPD, thereby revealing that the peak rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis of these patients appears to be limited by the intrinsic mitochondrial capacity and not O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> availability.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Support or Funding Information</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>This work was funded in part by grants from the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI), NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (K99HL125756, PO1 HL 091830) and VA Merit grant E6910R.</jats:p>",

Living far from health center was associated with fewer repeated visits. Among supply‐side factors, good counselling skills (OR: 2–2.5) was the most important determinant of any service use, whereas longer employment duration and greater work pressure of health center staff were associated with lower utilization.

In this work, we propose a stochastic robust optimization model that handles multi‐scale uncertainties in a holistic framework, aiming to optimize the expected economic performance while ensuring the robustness of operations. Stochastic programming and robust optimization approaches are integrated in a nested manner to reflect the decision maker's different levels of conservativeness toward strategic and operational uncertainties. The resulting multi‐level mixed‐integer linear programming model is solved by a decomposition‐based column‐and‐constraint generation algorithm. To illustrate the application, a county‐level case study on optimal design and operations of a spatially‐explicit biofuel supply chain in Illinois is presented, which demonstrates the advantages and flexibility of the proposed modeling framework and efficiency of the solution algorithm. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 62: 3041–3055, 2016</jats:p>",

Practitioners/managers can apply this model as “a road map” for implementing SCQM practices. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – It is necessary to test the rationality of these models by using empirical studies in different contexts. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The integration of quality and supply chain management still remains limited in the literature. Therefore, it is necessary to have a more focussed approach in assessing QM issues within the internal and external supply chain contexts. This study concentrates on the practices which improve quality aspects of the supply chain, known as SCQM practices. Proposed research models in this paper not only fill out the voids in the literature, but also contribute with conceptual frameworks for theory building in SCQM and firm performance. The authors also expect that this research can offer a useful guidance for measuring and implementing SCQM practices as well as facilitate further studies in this field.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

A 55-kW MG was fabricated, and TF coils of a small fusion device were energized. The duration of the current flat-top was extended to 1 s which is much longer than those of conventional small devices (around 10–100 ms).</jats:p>",

The supply chain has four echelons with suppliers, plants, distribution centers, and retailers. The decision variables are the opening of plants and distribution centers and the flow of materials between the different facilities, considering a continuous review inventory policy. The conflicting objectives are to minimize total costs on the entire chain, and to maximize a combined value of overall equipment effectiveness from suppliers. Small‐ and medium‐sized scenarios are solved and compared with Pareto fronts obtained with commercial optimization software applying the epsilon‐constraint method. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic. The main contributions of this work are a new practical problem that has not been analyzed before, and the development of the evolutionary algorithm.</jats:p>",

Use of agriculturally marginal land avoids the food vs. fuel problems of food price rises and carbon debt that are associated with crop and forestland. Recent remote sensing studies have identified large areas of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> marginal land deemed suitable for bioenergy crops. Yet the sustainability benefits of growing bioenergy crops on marginal land only pertain if land is economically available. Scant attention has been paid to the willingness of landowners to supply land for bioenergy crops. Focusing on the northern tier of the Great Lakes, where grassland transitions to forest and land prices are low, this contingent valuation study reports on the willingness of a representative sample of 1124 private, noncorporate landowners to rent land for three bioenergy crops: corn, switchgrass, and poplar. Of the 11% of land that was agriculturally marginal, they were willing to make available no more than 21% for any bioenergy crop (switchgrass preferred on marginal land) at double the prevailing land rental rate in the region. At the same generous rental rate, of the 28% that is cropland, they would rent up to 23% for bioenergy crops (corn preferred), while of the 55% that is forestland, they would rent up to 15% for bioenergy crops (poplar preferred). Regression results identified deterrents to land rental for bioenergy purposes included appreciation of environmental amenities and concern about rental disamenities. In sum, like landowners in the southern Great Lakes region, landowners in the Northern Tier are reluctant to supply marginal land for bioenergy crops. If rental markets existed, they would rent more crop and forestland for bioenergy crops than they would marginal land, which would generate carbon debt and opportunity costs in wood product and food markets.</jats:p>",

The metal proportion of alloy-structured filler was also analyzed with the best Fe/C/Al ratio of 3:1:1. The regular Fe/C/Al multiple micro-electrolysis fillers were prepared using a high-temperature anaerobic roasting method. The optimum conditions for oil refinery wastewater treated by Fe/C/Al multiple micro-electrolysis were determined to be an initial pH value of 3, reaction time of 80 min, and 0.05 mol/L Na2SO4 additive concentration. The reaction mechanism of the treatment of oil refinery wastewater by Fe/C/Al micro-electrolysis was investigated. The process of the treatment of oil refinery wastewater with multiple micro-electrolysis conforms to the third-order reaction kinetics. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) used to analyze the organic compounds of the oil refinery wastewater before and after treatment and the Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–VIS) absorption spectrum analyzed the degradation process of organic compounds in oil refinery wastewater. The treatment effect of Fe/C/Al multiple micro-electrolysis was examined in the continuous experiment under the optimum conditions, which showed high organic compound removal and stable treatment efficiency.</jats:p>"
