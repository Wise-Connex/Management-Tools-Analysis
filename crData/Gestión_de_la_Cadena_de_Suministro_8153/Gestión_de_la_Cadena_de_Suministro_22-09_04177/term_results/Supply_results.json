      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The South African Schools Act No. 84 of 1996 states that all learners should be provided with a high-quality education and in this way lays a strong foundation for the development of their talents and capabilities. The education sector faces many challenges that undermine the quality of education, particularly in public schools. Unless these challenges are identified and addressed, learners’ education will continue to be impacted negatively.Objectives: This study investigated supply chain challenges in public schools in the uMzinyathi district and explored strategies for managing and addressing these challenges so as to benefit the public education sector as a whole.Method: The study is exploratory, and a case study approach was used. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 20 stakeholders in the Department of Education. The stakeholders were selected by means of a nonprobability purposive sampling method. The collected data were analysed using thematic analysis.Findings: The findings revealed that the main supply chain challenges centre around three themes, namely procurement, service delivery and logistics and demand. These challenges negatively impact on learners’ education.Conclusion: The contribution of this study is twofold. Firstly, it adds to the existing body of literature by identifying the challenges experienced in the country’s public education sector, and secondly, the findings and recommendations could be useful in order to address the supply chain challenges faced by public schools for stakeholders in the South African public education sector.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: For the last 20 years Zimbabwe has been dependent on humanitarian aid. The country is in a desperate condition, with millions of citizens leaving to reside in neighbouring countries. These Zimbabweans are providing and sending food, necessities and cash to relatives in the country using largely informal humanitarian supply chains (HSCs). The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was disastrous causing more hardship.Objective: This case study explores how informal HSCs played a significant role in the Zimbabwe humanitarian aid initiative and the impact of COVID-19 on these supply chains.Method: A mixed method design was used to collect qualitative data through personal interviews with Zimbabweans in South Africa. Additional quantitative data was obtained from humanitarian reports, Zimbabwe government reports as well as other publications. These were used to present the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and specifically how support was provided through informal HSCs from outside Zimbabwe.Results: Through the case study the devastating effect COVID-19 had on a large component of the food insecure and suffering population of Zimbabwe is vividly illustrated. The closing of national borders prevented any food and other necessities, sent by diaspora from South Africa, reaching relatives.Conclusion: The results of this case study show the effect COVID-19 had on the humanitarian aid from relatives in South Africa. All the aid to Zimbabweans completely stopped for an extended period as these informal HSCs were completely broken because of the COVID-19 pandemic and 2 years later they remain disrupted.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The digitalisation phenomenon has significantly transformed and advanced the adoption of blockchain technology in organisations. The fourth industrial revolution has been the main driver of digital transformation in organisations to gain a competitive advantage in their respective industries. Therefore, studies on blockchain adoption have gained a relative pace over the recent years but there is limited literature focussing on the supply chain and logistics industry. The study fills the gap as it explored factors that affect the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chain and logistics.Objectives: The primary research objective of the study was to explore the factors that affect the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chain and logistics. The study explored the technological, organisational, and environmental factors that affect the adoption of blockchain technology in the supply chain and logistics industry.Method: The study conducted a content analysis of peer-reviewed articles published between 2013 and 2021 on the factors affecting the adoption of blockchain technology in the supply chain and logistics. The article used a quantitative study to explore factors affecting blockchain adoption using the Technology-Organisational-Environmental (TOE) framework as the theoretical lens.Conclusion: In conclusion, the study revealed that Asia, Europe, and America contribute more research on factors affecting the adoption of blockchain technology between 2013 and 2021. In addition, the results suggest that technical factors (security, complexity, and cost), organisational factors (management support), and environmental factors (competition, IT policy and regulations, and support) affect the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chain and logistics industry. The study contributes to the body of knowledge on factors affecting the adoption of blockchain technology in the supply chain and logistic industry.</jats:p>"

Globalist pressures to move manufacturing out of the US and further centralise control over the decisions made in the supply chain are an enemy that must be stopped if the US values the sovereignty of the nation, the purpose of the supply chain’s work and the future of supply chain businesses. Luckily, advances in manufacturing technology favour a decentralised approach that prioritises localisation, customisation and reduced waste. This approach would be more likely to achieve the reported economic aims of the globalist agenda, without requiring US businesses to cede decision-making power to plutocrats or submit to inferiority in productive capacity under a globalist vision for the future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Global supply chain shocks are nothing new; history is littered with examples of abnormal demand patterns or supply disruptions, with the recovery from COVID-19 being the most recent. This paper explores strategies for building resiliency into supply chains by investing in capabilities to absorb demand and supply shocks or create the ability to respond quickly and effectively to devastating supply chain events. Each supply chain is unique and may require a blend of strategies, depending on the infrastructure required to produce the products and distribute them throughout desired markets. With specific case studies and theoretical approaches, this paper provides a framework to utilise when planning for business continuity and supply chain resilience. It is shown that many resilient design principles can be embedded in day-to-day processes without too much effort, while for other more critical products more robust strategies must be planned. The core goal of this paper is to outline the differences between absorb and respond strategies and identify what type of strategy is better for what situation. Both authors have theoretical and practical experience developing plans for supply chain disaster recovery and optimising the investments needed to enhance resiliency and preparedness. Utilising this approach to supply chain design, building absorb capacity or responding rapidly to major disruptions, and by leveraging their collaboration with supply chain partners, companies can give themselves a competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

If there are more urban groundwater ponds of fresh water, their prioritization may help in planning allocation of human, technical, organizational, and other resources. Multi-criteria analysis and optimization, as a part of the decision-making process, can help in achieving the tasks. The possible approach is to use the fuzzy version of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and tackle this uncertain and imprecise process. Fuzzified AHP can be combined with fine-tuning mechanisms which emulate the optimism-pessimism behavior of decision-maker(s) and simulate their attitudes towards risk. The fuzzy decision-making (FDM) approach is presented for the evaluation of three groundwater ponds for freshwater supply in the city of Novi Sad, Serbia. The complete problem hierarchy is treated and a parallel control mechanism, the standard (crisp) version of AHP, is employed to assure a more convenient and reliable environment during the judgments performed by the decision-maker. Results encourage further research in the subject area.The applicability of the approach is considered relevant to other uncertainty-related problems.</jats:p>",

EATs trait origins widespread destruction and inflict in the adoption of EAA if not managed amicably, unless, the enterprise accentuate the importance of the 4th Industrial revolution with careful planning to deal with the aftermath and mitigate the inspirations instinctively. Thus, the logistics of EAA adoption is one of the main activities in information technology (IT) that requires meticulous knowledge in algorithms for a successful SCM.Objective: The principal objective of this study is to determine whether EATs affect the adoption of EAA for SCM in SMEs and to identify gaps and institute state of the art in research for future studies.Method: This study adopts a descriptive research method with the use of 310 respondents targeted at both SME owners and managers, sculpted over quantitative research. Based on the analyses of data, the linear regression model is executed. As a result, the author realised that ‘EATs affect the adoption of EAA’ as a dominant research focus of these studies. In this study, the response EATs as a primary influencer of the adoption of EAA, considered on linear regression model for attainable SCM. In practice, SMEs should link EAA to new technologies, enterprise capabilities, objectives and strategies, as well as the existing culture and performance philosophies.Results: The SMEs’ success in SCM activities is dependent on employees’ perceptions, attitudes, motivation and learning abilities that could ease the narratives on the adoption of EAA.Conclusion: These results provide the following comprehensions for future research: applying simplicity by getting them on board, introducing EAA through different channels of learning, building a coalition of willing mindsets, motivating its purpose and celebrating small progress. The research provides a profound understanding relevant in the contextual background to SMEs to adopt EAA for SCM that depends on the enterprise resources (ERs) acquisition and\\or availability.</jats:p>"

Assosa town in Ethiopia faces serious water scarcity problems due to rapid population growth and urban expansion. This study aims to model the water demand of Assosa town using a forecasting model. Four scenarios were developed: population growth, living standards, water loss reduction, and a combination of these. The water demand and unmet demands for each scenario were evaluated. Results show that the demand for water and supply will vary significantly if the present state continues. In the base year (2018), the overall water demand is 2.07 gigalitres (GL) and the unmet demand is estimated as 0.096 GL. The water demand grows to 3.71 GL under the reference scenario in 2035. The combination of population growth and improved living standard scenarios is observed to impact greatly on water demand. The total water demand of this scenario was estimated to be 7.14 GL latterly in the projection period and the unmet demand would grow to 5.2 GL. The results confirmed that improved water management approaches are needed in the town to ensure the sustainability of water resources in the long term and outline proper water utilization policies.</jats:p>",

The accuracy of time-series predictions is critical for the performance optimization of every supply chain. This article suggests a method based on state-space modelling (SSM) for structured time series forecasting. Technology and advance implementations of decision support systems (DSS) have improved considerably. DSS has been used as a more restricted functionality of the database, modelling, and user interface, although technical advances made DSS even more effective. Web development has facilitated inter-organizational decision-making support systems and has resulted in many innovative implementations of current technology and many new decision-making technologies. The study of multiple configurations shows that the SSM and DSS are ideal for solving the problem being studied; in particular, the DSS guarantees appropriate prediction errors and a correct computational effort to provide adequate customer order plans.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The number of disasters affecting the world has climbed dramatically over the previous decade, from around 220 per year in the mid-1990s to around 350–400 per year now. The rising frequency of natural calamities encouraged the author to conduct a study on humanitarian logistics (HL) and its role in mitigating the consequences of any disaster incidence. Thus, this study aims to outline the issues and challenges affecting HL in disaster relief.Objectives: The purpose of this study is to emphasize the critical role of HL in disaster management and to identify the issues that humanitarian organizations (HO) face while managing their logistics and supply chains during disaster relief operations.Method: The study employed a qualitative approach to investigate the problems affecting HL and supply chains by conducting a literature analysis on disaster management/disaster supply chain. The literature related to HL was reviewed, analyzed, and accordingly, the findings are presented.Results: The results of a thorough evaluation of the basic and contemporary literature on HL identified various challenges, reinforcing the necessity for additional research in HL operations to better the present situation. Additionally, it will lay the groundwork for various stakeholders such as humanitarian/non-profit organizations, governments, and policymakers to plan and develop appropriate solutions.Conclusion: As natural disasters occur often throughout the world; it is critical to handle logistical operations properly and efficiently during disaster relief operations. While none of the disaster situations can be prevented, their impact can be minimized by adequate preparation and response during humanitarian logistical operations.</jats:p>"

All stakeholders and entrepreneurs worldwide have a common understanding of information technology's importance to support business activity in a rapidly changing era of customer preference. Today, many believe in a production process transition, which subsequently affects the supply chain flow in general, fearing overuse and inefficiency from upstream to downstream. Thus, this article proposes supply chain efficiency and effectiveness management using decision support systems (SCE2M-DSS). This conceptual framework uses an intelligent decision support system for the supply chain's proactive capacity planning under uncertain conditions. An intelligent decision-making support system is designed with reinforcement learning (RL) to validate the conceptual framework. The application of decision-making methods developed initially focused on product development and service production.</p>",

Therefore, the precision of the optimal productivity model is necessary to improve SCM's effectiveness. A factor often ignored is that transactions of certain goods are assembled within an enterprise as dynamic structures of various distribution ratios. Regardless of such structure, optimal model productivity is often produced; however, the productivity model's optimal precision can be enhanced by taking it into account. This focusses on strategic thinking and planning, where various process improvement mechanisms are developed. Therefore, in this study, data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been utilized to enhance supply chain efficiency and effectiveness management.

Therefore, the management of technogenic risks in energy systems related to critical infrastructure and, first of all, in thermal energy systems of thermal power plants and thermal power plants, the failure of which can lead to the impossibility of living in the specified territory or object, carrying out economic activities there, loss of life or significant material damage is important and relevant. In order to justify the use of reversible water supply systems of thermal power facilities to increase the reliability and safety of their operation, a generalized algorithm of optimal quality management during water purification was proposed in order to minimize technogenic risk for any water purification system. The analysis of the obtained results showed that the generalized algorithm of optimal quality management during water treatment in order to minimize technogenic risk for any water treatment system can be obtained in the case of using the following methodology: drawing up a structural and functional block diagram of the water treatment system; analysis of technological modes affecting quality; technical and economic analysis of the values that limit the values of the regimes that give minimal pollution; obtaining mathematical expressions that reflect the dependence of the amount of pollution and the amount of restrictions on specific technological modes; entering data into the computerized control system, the input port of which is supplied with the current value of stiffness, at the output of the water treatment plant, from the output port of which the specific values of the technological modes supported by the control bodies of the water treatment plant are taken.</jats:p>"

This was used to handle the fuzzy parameters involved in the problem. A classical optimisation algorithm, the generalised reduced gradient combined with branch-and-bound embedded in LINGO 18.0 was applied to calculate the optimal decision. Numerical experiments were conducted using some randomly generated data with four suppliers, four raw materials and six review times.Results: Results provided the optimal decision for the given problem, that is, the number of raw materials to be ordered from each supplier at each review time, as well as the corresponding number to be stored in the warehouse.Conclusion: The proposed model successfully solved the given problems and thus can be used by decision-makers to solve their order allocation planning and inventory problems.</jats:p>"

Supply chain risks typically limit profits over the overall expense of the supply chain. In the supply chain design practices, the volatility of demand and limitations of levels are essential concerns. In this paper, a swarm intelligence-assisted supply chain management framework (SISCMF) has been proposed to increase profit and improve logistics performance. Due to the simplicity of design and rapid convergence, swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms are widely used in most supply network design fields and efficiently solve large-dimensional problems. A significant increase in resolving these problems has been seen in particle swarm optimization and ant colony algorithm. The simulation result suggested the operational cost (92.7%), demand prediction ratio (95.2%), order delivery ratio (96.9%), customer feedback ratio (98.2%), and product quality ratio (97.2%).</p>",

In previous studies, less attention has been given to the process of knowledge transfer and therefore, this paper highlights the significance of the process of knowledge transfer in supply chain processes. Enhanced supply chain networks have better performance when knowledge sharing is present, and it is important to identify and eliminate any supply chain complexity to improve the supply chain processes. Methods: A systematic review on the literature has been conducted to critically identify and evaluate the factors of supply chain complexity which impact knowledge transfer. Findings: The findings highlight the key benefits of effective knowledge transfer in supply chain systems by identifying risks associated with supply chain networks. Conclusion: The balanced power of facilitating knowledge transfer in supply chain processes helps in supply chain partnerships and reduces the supply chain complexity.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply chain agility concept has been identified as one of the most important issues in the supply chain management literature. However, despite the popularity of the concept, many concept attributes are largely unexplored. The mediating role of the operational capabilities, in particular the supply chain responsiveness, in the link between the supply chain agility and the improvement of the supply chain performance, is a field that is lacking in research. This research aims to deepen the theory by addressing this gap in the supply chain agility literature. The data for this study were collected through a field survey from a final sample of 131 respondents from manufacturing companies in Morocco. An online questionnaire containing items measuring constructs of interest was developed. The theoretical model was evaluated using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that supply chain agility has an indirect and positive impact on supply chain performance in the presence of supply chain responsiveness. In addition, the results provide empirical evidence for a full mediation of supply chain responsiveness in the link between supply chain agility and supply chain performance in an uncertain environment. This study demonstrates why careful consideration should be made when deciding what dynamic capabilities should be developed and, therefore, what operational capabilities will be generated or renewed. Companies that successfully build this relationship benefit in terms of improving the performance of both the global supply chain and its members, enabling them to achieve sustainable competitive advantages.</jats:p>",

Other objectives were nutrient utilization, microbial nitrogen supply and rumen fermentation pattern. Eighteen Nellore rams were randomly divided into 3 groups consisting of 6 animals each in a completely randomized design. Three complete feeds were formulated using maize, broken rice and jowar along with sorghum stover as roughage at the ratio of 50:50 (Concentrate: Roughage). Dry matter, organic matter and crude protein digestibility coefficients were higher (P &lt; 0.01) in complete feed with jowar grain while, the ether extract digestibility was highest in complete feed with maize grain but the crude fiber was lowest in complete feed with broken rice. The hemi cellulose was lowest (P &lt; 0.01) in complete feed with broken rice while the digestibility coefficient of cellulose differed significantly (P &lt; 0.01) and it was highest for complete feed maize grain. The digestible crude protein differed significantly (P &lt; 0.01) in all experimental diets however, the complete feed with jowar grain was highest. The nitrogen intake (g/d), faecal excretion and total nitrogen excretion were lowest (P &lt; 0.01) in complete feed with broken rice while, the nitrogen balance (% absorbed) was highest (P &lt; 0.01) in complete feed with jowar grain. The crude protein intake (g/d) was lowest (P &lt; 0.01) in complete feed with broken rice whereas, the total digestible nutrient intake was significantly highest (P &lt; 0.01) in case of complete feed with jowar grain. Metabolizable Energy intake (Mcal/d) was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) highest for complete feed with jowar grain. The dry matter intake (g/ kgw<jats:sup>0.75</jats:sup>) was lowest (P &lt; 0.01) in complete feed with broken rice while, total digestible nutrient intake (g/ kgw<jats:sup>0.75</jats:sup>) was lowest (P &lt; 0.01) in complete feed with maize grain. ME intake (g/ kgw<jats:sup>0.75</jats:sup>) was highest (P &lt; 0.01) in jowar grain complete feed when compared with complete feed with broken rice and complete feed maize grain. The daily calcium and phosphorous intake and balance were comparable in all experimental diets. Cereal grain feeding did not affect ruminal pH while, the ammonia nitrogen and total volatile fatty acid (mmol/100ml) differed significantly (P &lt; 0.01) among dietary treatments. It is concluded that jowar and broken rice are suitable for substuting maize grain in complete feed.</jats:p>"

They build on the presence of economically mineable mineral commodities that will undergo several steps until they are finally being used as consumer products. Trustworthiness into the transparency of a supply chain is of increasing importance, both to upstream and downstream companies. Any deviation from best-practice and quality standards in mining, processing and production is critically looked at by consumers. Therefore, certification systems and proof of origin concepts have emerged within the past years, aiming at providing transparency to supply chains. The analytical proof of origin for mineral raw materials could be beneficial to certification schemes in several ways. It represents the least corruptible method of provenance analysis as it relates directly to the chemical composition of the raw material. Other methods, such as documents, tracers, or barcodes, can be outmanoeuvred in one way or another.</jats:p>",

The southern cities of the country confront the scarcity of fresh and improved water for drinking and sanitation. The study aims to investigate the demand for improved water service among city dwellers and the potential revenue for the water supply authority. The study surveyed 100 households in Khulna city by administering a simple random sampling method. The single-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation method revealed that years of schooling, household income, and excessive time in water collection positively affect willingness to pay (WTP) for improved water service. The households are willing to pay US$ 5.05 per month on average for enjoying improved water service, which in turn produces annual revenues of US$ 4.26 million, overriding the current level of revenue by 2.5 times. Additionally, the water supply authority is incurring around US$ 2.14 million of revenue loss annually which can be recovered by supplying improved water to the city households. This study suggests that the government may be able to address the fresh and improved water scarcity in the urban territory by capturing and utilizing the potential revenue efficiently through removing the structural barriers.</jats:p>",

The term could be believed to be accurate as all aspects of the supply chain have been observed to be influenced by the swan (customers with panic/regulated buying, suppliers with hoarding, inventories witnessing bullwhip effects). The current study, therefore, offers a novel explanation by linking various actors of green supply chain management and how the interplay of those actors can influence the supply chain and overall firm performance post COVID-19.</p>",

Moreover, the increase in Scottish emigration overseas marked the final ages of the Empire and Scotland's natural increase in population. The chapter looks into the legacy of the Second World War and the Battle of Britain. In relation to the Scottish National Party's effort to establish a separate Scottish state, the constitutional instability of Scotland gradually developed over the last fifty years despite being a product of the postwar reconceptualization of Great Britain.</p>",

Besides the volume of sand stored, the water storage and supply capacity of the sand dam depends principally on material properties including hydraulic conductivity (K) and the specific yield (Sy). In this study, the water supply capacity of a sand dam, applied in South Korea with a modified scheme, was analyzed. Imported sand materials were placed in three layers, and perforated drain pipes were installed to abstract the water to a collection tank. Using a Modular Finite-Difference Groundwater Flow (MODFLOW) model, the drain pipe discharge related to aquifer properties and supply capacity of a sand dam was evaluated. Using the model, the productivity of the sand storage with several cases of inflow conditions was assessed. For the period from 9 March 2020 to 16 May 2022, the results of calculation of water supply for the installation and operation of new sand dam are as follows. Regarding the actual inflow condition, compared to the average water supply of the existing water intake source, the sand dam installation increased water supply by 61.6%, and the sand dam installation showed an effect of improving the water supply by 36.0% for the minimum water supply. The calculated water supply for the condition where the inflow was reduced by 50% showed an effect of improving water supply by over 70% on average due to the installation of the sand dam. The findings would be a benchmark for future expansions of the scheme in related places, and management and maintenance of the system.</jats:p>"

The results obtained made it possible to identify indicators of digital transformation of land reclamation for 2020 in the context of the federal districts of the Russian Federation. In the process of scientific and practical analysis, the features of information and technological security of subordinate affiliates were suggested. In particular, the article analyses the availability of equipment of industrial firms with operating systems, office programs, electronic reference systems and software that effectively implement and manage the processes of digital transformation in the reclamation of the agro-industrial complex of the Russian Federation. The purpose of the study was to identify the features of the information space of the reclamation industry. This, in turn, will allow us not only to identify the most successful indicators and directions of digitalization of the industrial space of the Russian Federation, but also to show problems and risks that hinder the achievement of the goals of development of a single digital space of the agro-industrial complex of the Russian Federation. The following research methods were used: theoretical and logical method, method of system analysis and situational analysis, statistical methods of processing and generalization of research results. The results of the study are as follows. Based on a systematic analysis of the modern information space of the reclamation industry, the most important sectoral indicators of the readiness of subordinate institutions for digital transformation were identified. The conclusions drawn made it possible to identify and assess the features of the digital space of the territorial structure of the reclamation industry, to describe the features of information space of affiliates of the reclamation industry of the Russian Federation.</jats:p>",

Currently, there are no scalable methods for tracing construction sand distribution without direct observation. We examined sand “fingerprinting” as a potential tool to trace construction sand supply-networks from “source to sink” in a case study from Texas, USA. Both natural bulk major element and optical petrography fingerprints are preserved through construction sand processing and transport such that sand can be tied back to its original mining source even at the final point of distribution. Additionally, we developed an image analysis model called sandID that is ~90% effective at determining the original mining source of sand in the study area. Our results demonstrate that sand fingerprinting, has untapped potential to support traceability and certification schemes and to support monitoring and enforcement in areas where there are concerns about illegal, illicit or simply unknown construction sand sourcing.</jats:p>"

A land information infrastructure is a collaborative and coordinated initiative aimed at providing land information from different organisations, such as municipalities, government departments and private companies, to diverse user communities. A land information infrastructure is complex, spanning information streams through many organisations and technical systems, and presenting challenges for managing and monitoring the production of land information. In the manufacturing field, a supply chain refers to the stream of activities from the initial source to the delivery of end products to customers, and supply chain management is directed at optimising the creation of the products of such a chain. The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model is widely used for analysing supply chain processes in order to quantify and improve product and service delivery, and it has also been applied to geographical information supply chains. In this study, the SCOR model is applied to the supply chain processes in a South African case study of a land information infrastructure focusing on the production of cadastral information products. The supply chain comprises a land developer, a land surveying firm, the Surveyor General’s and Deeds Offices, a geospatial data vendor and the end customer. This supply chain is mapped and analysed using supply chain mapping and the SCOR model, and based on this, the complexity of the land information infrastructure is revealed. The study shows that supply chain management and the SCOR model can be used to analyse, monitor and manage the production processes of land information within a land information infrastructure.</jats:p>"

This is expected to change as civil society activism and new legislation increase the risk of litigation and reputational damage to supply chain partners. To deal with and combat modern slavery in the supply chain, a theory inspired social supply chain management framework consisting of indicators and countermeasures of modern slavery in the supply chain is developed. The framework is refined in a qualitative expert interview study. The theoretical framework is then evaluated by a multimethod empirical analysis that includes a multicase study based on publicly available supply chain data from 6000 media articles and company websites as well as a quantitative empirical study based on survey data from 280 corporate sustainability experts operating in global supply networks. The results show that economic, political‐legal, social, and environmental factors have a significant impact on contemporary slavery in the supply chain. The study also motivates supply chain partners to use preventative and detective measures to reduce the probability of encountering modern slavery actions in their supply chain. Theoretical and managerial implications are drawn from the findings, pointing to a holistic approach to combatting modern slavery in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hierarchically organized businesses have been dominating our economy for centuries. We follow this structure for so long now because it is very efficient to allocating resources, performing coordination activities, and building relationships. However, potentially disruptive technologies such as Blockchain Technology (BCT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to transform the centralized agri-food supply chain networks (SCN) into decentralized digital ecosystems, which will impact business processes and workflows alike. Still today the traditional agri-food SCN is characterized by a pyramid-hierarchic structure where decisions are being made by a central authority. It is typically headed by a focal firm which is responsible for the coordination of the network while determining the strategy and goals of the SCN. We investigated BCT use cases both in the agri-food industry and across several industries. Our literature- and use case-based research unveiled that supply chain use cases which have significantly higher operational implementations compared to their peers exhibit predominantly the following characteristics: they operate in a vertically coordinated ecosystem, they are dominated by a focal firm, and participation of suppliers is mandated by a central authority. The use cases displaying the mentioned characteristics have been found predominantly with consortium type of BCT platform implementations. As agri-food SCNs operate in vertically coordinated ecosystems we suggest that solutions such as provenance or traceability in agri-food SCNs should be implemented based on consortium BCTs as those seem to support best the traditional agri-food SCN structure.</jats:p>"

A sample of ten firms was purposively selected from the study’s population of twenty four consumer goods firms listed on the Nigerian Stock exchange. The study employed secondary source of data obtained from the financial statements of the selected firms and the data collected was analyzed using random effects model. Findings from the study showed that the coefficient of share capital is negative (−1.86262) and insignificant (p=0.7961&gt;0.05) and the beta value of short-term debt is positive (5.08662) and insignificant (P=0.1596 &gt;0.05). The coefficient of long-term debt is also positive (6.78568) and statistically significant (p=0.0298&lt;0.05) and the beta value of retained earnings is positive (3.55649) and insignificant (p=0.2617&gt;0.05) for the same firms in Nigeria. The study concluded that share capital has a negative and significant effect on the financial performance, while retained earnings, short-term debt and long-term debt have positive effects on the firms’ financial performance. The study recommended that the consumer goods firms in Nigeria should avoid financing their operations with share capital without taking remedial actions on it persistence negative effect on their performance and Nigerian governments should be formulating new industrial policies that will rebrand the local enterprises including consumer goods firms instead of insisting on their annual corporate tax increase.</jats:p>"

Specifically, we adopt a distribution‐free approach to study an ambiguity‐averse monopoly's joint price and production decisions given the random yield's mean and variance—arguably two of the most widely used and easy‐to‐estimate summary statistics. We derive for four models, which result from all possible combinations of the two strategies, closed‐form solutions of the optimal price and production decisions as well as the optimal profit. Through comparative analysis, we obtain several managerial insights based on the problem's parameters, including cost parameters, demand parameters, and supply variation. The firm can benefit more from pure emergency supply than from pure responsive pricing if the unit emergency purchasing cost is not larger than a certain threshold, and the strategic relation between emergency supply and responsive pricing also critically depends on the unit emergency purchasing cost as well as the type of distributional information we know about the random yield. We discuss how distributional information about mean and variance bridges the most and least variable situations of the random yield, thus establishing the gain and the limit of knowing variance.</jats:p>"

Importantly, reliable in-ventory and replenishment decisions for retail products depend on accurate demand forecasts. This allows retailers to enable better pricing and timely promotion plans while leading to huge cost reductions [1]. Often, retail promotions create demand irregularities for products. Customers may change their buying behavior by purchasing more products for future consumption (stockpiling), thereby increasing sales in the promotional period. Then, for a brief time, sales may fall below normal levels before gradually returning to normal levels. The period with a dip in demand is known as the post-promotional period [2]. Thus, a retail promotion has three distinct periods: (1) normal, (2) promotional, and (3) post-promotional, each with its own set of demand fluctuations</jats:p>",

However, a significant portion of produced food worldwide is damaged or wasted in the food supply chain. This study focuses on minimizing waste in the food supply chain by highlighting the importance of strategy, information systems, and network design in the food supply chain. The authors collected data from 211 respondents from 48 firms and analyzed it through structural equation modeling. It has been found that information system has great potential to minimize waste in the food supply chain. Moreover, strategy and network design significantly improve organizational capabilities to minimize waste in the food supply chain. The finding provides constructive insights to food companies to incorporate and operationalize recommended measures to minimize waste in the food supply chain so that the world can counter the food shortage and waste/damage problem and the Zero Hunger goal can successfully be achieved.</jats:p>"

This study performs a meta-analysis of the literature related to organizational and supply chain dynamic capabilities, which together constitute an ecosystem of capabilities that every organization should develop to improve performance. After an exhaustive review of 1203 articles aligned with the base theoretical construct of dynamic capabilities, the information was decanted from strict filters. This allowed to evidence the contribution of this construct in literature aligned with organizational performance, as well as to identify the contribution that can be made by other constructs aligned with the dynamic capabilities’ ecosystem. The findings show a theoretical relationship between both constructs, presenting how the supply chain dynamic capabilities constitute a specialization and differentiation of organizational dynamic capabilities. In addition, the study highlights their major contribution to developing competitive advantages and improving organizational performance.</jats:p>",

To estimate the determinants of job quality between men and women, we use the estimation of a multinomial logit model.\nThe results establish that the probability for women to hold a better job is lower compared to men. The only possibilities for women to benefit from good quality jobs are when they have managerial status and when they work in large companies. Inequalities in access to better quality jobs against them are more related to differences in unobservable characteristics than to differences in individual characteristics.\nJEL Rating: J16, J23, C25, C35</jats:p>"

This strategy determines the location of individual links in the chain (suppliers, producers, distributors), which affects the costs of logistics processes, including, in particular, transport processes. Currently, due to the rapid increase in fuel prices, the issue of energy consumption in the supply chains is becoming increasingly important. The aim of the article is to present the impact of the increase in fuel and energy costs on the costs of logistics processes and, as a result, on the profitability of different supply chain strategies. The profitability of changing from global to local sources of supply as a result of rising energy prices was especially taken into account. The article presents the results of interviews from enterprises carried out by the authors and the results of simulations carried out using a model developed by the authors. The need to conduct such research resulted from the existing research gap and the need to take into account contemporary changes and conditions. The research was conducted in a period of rapid increase in fuel and energy costs. Both the research conducted by the method of interviews, as well as the calculations and simulations indicated that despite a very large increase in rates for transport services, especially in maritime transport, it is still not profitable to relocate production from the Far East to Europe.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we investigate the supply chain management strategies and their possible effects on the business performance for an industrial cluster region in Izmir/Turkey. Four main supply chain management strategies of supplier integration (SI), customer integration (CI), internal integration (II), and information-communication technologies (ICT) are examined to determine the possible effects on business performance. Note that survey data are collected from the managers and lead engineers of each company within the investigated industrial cluster.

However, a significant and positive step has now been taken by many organizations for the betterment of the environment; thus, they are now focusing on the implementation of green supply chain management practices. Green supply chain management practices allow companies to achieve larger sustainability objectives and boost sustainability awareness. In Pakistan, environmental issues are top of the list for Karachi'. Therefore, this study aims to raise awareness regarding the utilization of GSCM in the FMCG industries in Karachi. This adoption is significant because there will be adverse effects on the environment, operational efficiency, environmental performance, economic output, and social output for these polluting agents. For this purpose, a detailed questionnaire was sent to the FMCs via mail, and the responses were noted and analyzed; meanwhile, considering five critical variables, the five hypotheses were devised to gauge their significance and importance in the implementation of GSCM. This research is useful for the owners of the FMCGs as they develop their strategies and prescribing behaviour for GSCM performance after this study.</jats:p>"

Accordingly, making effective supply chain decisions holistically while achieving sustainability goals has become a major challenge faced by the present agri-food systems. Thus, to address the challenge, a novel supply chain configuration addressing multiple supply chain decisions to reduce global warming potential (GWP) and post-harvest losses have been presented by taking the banana supply chain in Sri Lanka as a case study. In the proposed approach, farmers have been clustered based on their geo positions using K-Means clustering followed by route planning within clusters using a heuristics approach. Retailer points are catered by assigning to wholesalers optimally modeling as an assignment model and then route planning executed using a heuristic approach. The solution generated from the above approaches has been implemented on a simulation platform to calculate the overall supply chain performance including the transportation component, in terms of the net GWP, post-harvest losses, and lead time including routing operations. Simulated supply chain performance has been compared with the existing system and verified the performance of the proposed supply chain configuration. The suggested configuration has reduced the net GWP by 15.3%, post-harvest loss by 2.1%, lead time by 28.2%, and travel distance by 20.47%. The proposed configuration can be further improved by adding dynamic characteristics to the model.</jats:p>"

The present study was conducted with an objective of analysing the supply - demand projection and supply-demand gap of fruits in the state. It was found that the projected supply is much higher than the projected demand and the surplus continues up to 2050. However, the projected demand was found to be more than the projected supply in the later years when ICMR recommendation of consumption of fruits was taken into account. In addition to that it was also observed that the consumption of fruits is about 60 percent less than the ICMR recommendation. It is imperative to take appropriate action from the supply demand gap and to channelize towards export and value-addition of fruits through various schemes like Mission for Integrated development of Horticulture (MIDH), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) and Mega Food Park scheme of Ministry of Food Processing Industries.</jats:p>",

The focus of the research study is to determine the existing position of the Pakistani hospitality industry and the relevance of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM), and its impact on firm performance. The focus on the sustainable and green supply chain in the hospitality industry is a hot topic. Businesses can effectively manage the practices and procedures to achieve competitive advantage and economic benefits. The study incorporates a quantitative research design focused on deriving insights into the possible relationship and impact of the GSCM factors on the performance of Pakistani hospitality businesses. The sample size for the research is 150 participants, including people from management positions in different restaurants in Karachi, Pakistan. The findings from the research help to identify that GSCM is a critical part of a firm's strategic objective in Pakistan as the application of green purchasing, customer relationship management and eco-friendly product designs are found to have a weak to a moderate yet significant impact on the performance. The outcomes derived from the literature review help to identify that applying the policies related to mentioned factors helps offer a significant strong impact on businesses in the manufacturing and service industry. The results for the Pakistani industry show that waste management does not have any significant impact on performance which shows a contradictory outcome compared to the literature findings. The research also provides focused implications and future recommendations for businesses and research improvements.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mitigation and management strategies for extreme events become essential for the development and maintenance of society as these events become more frequent and intense. Drought management strategies have focused on structural measures, however, they are not sufficient to prevent water supply disruptions and economic losses. In this concept, adaptation plays the role of anticipating the adverse effects of extreme events and taking appropriate measures to prevent and minimize them. Thus,&amp;amp;#160; insurance is a valuable adaptation tool to reimburse unexpected losses and prevent financial damage from turning into long-term economic damage. We simulated indexed insurance for the Cantareira Water Supply System, responsible for providing water to 5 million people in the S&amp;amp;#227;o Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR). Our methodology comprises (1) characterizing the indexed variable, (2) calculating economic losses by event magnitude and, (3) estimating the premium based on low, medium, and high coverage levels. To find the optimal premium value, we generated 100 synthetic series of 30 years sample (3000 years) and assessed its losses probability. We found two years lag accumulated precipitation as the index variable and a daily direct loss of USD* 480,000.00 due to drought in the distribution reservoir. Our results show that each person should pay an annual amount of USD 0.43, 0.87, and 1.73 to obtain a drought coverage level for 3, 6, and 12 months (Low, medium, and high) respectively. These values correspond to 1.7, 3.4, and 6.7% of the annual fee paid by water users. The premium fee can be implemented in the water bills as a new strategy to pool the risk between users and prevent them from being exposed to surcharge fluctuations. As disruptions are difficult to remedy in a short-run basis, the index insurance has the potential to significantly reduce the costs of managing financial risk and disruptions. Given that extreme weather events will become more frequent and intense in the future, we recognize the critical importance of financial tools to mitigate losses as an additional solution for water resources management.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;* Data are in constant 2020 U.S. dollars (USD1.00 =BRL 5.15)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Research Methodology: To complete the study, we used structural equation modeling to test the relationship between port characteristics and port-logistics integration with port performance. Moreover, Statistical Package for Social Science is also used to filter indicators. Apart from this, the study was conducted in three dry ports of Ethiopia having a sample of 279 employees.  Results: The finding shows that port characteristics such as port infrastructure, port connectivity, and port privatization have significantly impacted port performance. Also, port-logistics integration has an impact on both port operational performance and port efficiency.  Limitations: The main limitation is that the study focused only on three dry ports of Ethiopia which do not include other dry ports in the country.  Contribution: Ethiopia suffered forced dependency on transit countries after a blooded war with Eritrea which resulted in customs delays at port. To reduce this, the study suggests that Ethiopia should coordinate in developing joint infrastructures, and formulating unfettered rules and regulations with its transit countries.  Keywords: 1. Port characteristics 2. Port logistics integration 3. Port operational performance 4. Port efficiency</jats:p>"

To further improve the response speed of output current, a predictive PI control algorithm of BP neural network is proposed to overcome the shortcomings of large computation and slow convergence in traditional BP neural network. A branch current prediction model of EAST fast control power supply is established. Based on linear PI control, the BP neural network structure is combined, and the current prediction model is used as the adaptive objective function. To simplify the calculation process of the processor and speed up the convergence rate, a piecewise linear activation function is adopted. The learning rate of BP neural network structure and the activation function factor of the output layer are adjusted in real time according to the error between the predicted current and the reference signal. The online predictive adaptive setting of PI control parameters is realized by the steepest gradient descent method. Simulation and experiments results show that the proposed control algorithm has faster dynamic response speed than the traditional PI control.</jats:p>"

Demand refers to the mobilization potential in a society for a protest event; supply refers to the opportunities staged by organizers to protest. Mobilization brings a demand for political protest that exists in a society together with a supply of opportunities to take part in such protest. The demand side of participation requires studies of such phenomena as socialization, grievance formation, causal attribution, and the formation of collective identity. The study of the supply side of participation concerns such matters as action repertoires, the effectiveness of social movements, the frames and ideologies movements stand for, and the constituents of identification they offer. Mobilization is the process that brings demand and supply together. Mobilization is the marketing mechanism of the social movement domain, and thus, the study of mobilization concerns such matters as the effectiveness of (persuasive) communication, the influence of social networks, and the perceived costs and benefits of participation.</jats:p>"

In this study, information sharing with suppliers is integral in improving supply chain performance, impacting the overall business performance. Trust as a mediating factor improves sharing of information, but it will not directly influence the enhancement of supply chain performance. The findings will help managers understand and evaluate the importance of information sharing with a supplier and its effect on supply chain performance and enable them to make better decisions that enhance supply chain performance. The study is conducted in a specified time frame which bound the research to a particular period. Geographical boundaries also limit the study as it determines the impact of the research on the pharmaceutical industry of Pakistan, located in Karachi. Organizations need to develop a system that promotes information sharing by investing in technologies that support exchanging information between partners.

Based on the implementation of China&amp;rsquo;s Green Credit Guidelines in 2012, this study uses panel data of Chinese companies from 2009 to 2019 to explore the influence of GCP on green technology innovation and the role of institutional supply in it. The results show that GCP is instrumental in promoting green innovation in heavily polluting enterprises, and the promotion effect is heterogeneous based on green patent types, firms&amp;rsquo; ownership, and regional financial development levels. Further analysis finds that the supply of environmental protection systems by local governments can strengthen the green innovation effect of GCP. However, the institutional supply of innovation has not yet released a promotional effect. This paper finds that green credit can be used as an environmental governance tool and provides inspiration for local governments to issue environmental protection policies scientifically.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

This quote is still very relevant in the current economic context and should challenge every organisation to continuously look for ways to improve its performance. Nowadays, however, supply chain teams are expected to play an increasingly strategic role in developing agility to rapidly meet changing requirements of customers, optimise costs and generate value for the company. In the automotive industry, the specific packaging of the vehicle parts represents an important asset: a huge volume of particular stillages and plastic boxes shared between different vehicles or powertrain plants, as well as outsourced parts suppliers. This requires strong management, because any packaging unavailability affecting one of the involved actors can lead to very negative effects such as production shutdowns, which translates to higher costs. This paper describes the way in which Dacia-Renault’s supply chain team has upgraded packaging management processes and implemented the latest technology and digital tools to optimise costs and bring end-to-end visibility to this specific activity.</jats:p>"

This study aims to understand the impacts of climate change on water supply systems and to facilitate adaptive actions. A premium database maintained by the Cleveland Water Division, Cleveland, Ohio, USA is analyzed. It contains 29,621 pipe failure records of 51,832 pipes over the past 30 years, representing one of the largest dataset in current literature. From the database, pipe failure rate models have been developed for water pipes made of different types of materials at different ages. The influence of climate (temperature and precipitation) on fragility of water pipes are obtained. Based on the developed climate-fragility failure rate models, the impacts of climate change on the water systems located in different geographic regions are evaluated by predicting the failure rate and number of failures in the water systems in the next 80 years (2020 to 2100). Climate models are used to predict weather under different climate change scenerios. The results demonstrate that the impacts of climate change on water supply system are likely complicated and are dependent upon factors such as the geographic location, pipe material, pipe age, and maintenance strategies. Water pipes in the cold regions may experience less number breaks due to the warmer weather and less servere winter, whereas those located in the hot regions may experience more failures associated with more corrosion. Different pipe replacement strategies are compared, which demonstrate the importance of considering the aging of water supply system in future maintenance decisions. This study enriches current understandings on the impacts of climate change on the water systems. The results will help water utilities to design climate change adaptation strategies.</jats:p>"

In this regard, the energy policy and regulatory incentives for promoting biomass-to-energy or bioenergy have been recently established. In this work, the updated statistics of biomass-derived waste and energy supply from biomass during the period of 2005–2021 were analyzed using national/official reports. It was found that the annual agricultural waste amounts in Taiwan ranged from 4.5 to 5.2 million metric tons, and about 80% of those were generated from rice-derived residues (rice straw and rice husk) and livestock/poultry-derived waste (manure). In addition, a decreasing trend was observed in the indigenous bioenergy supply, mostly from the solid-type biomass resources, including waste wood, rice husk, and sugarcane bagasse. In order to expand bioenergy diversification, the central competent authorities, including the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), Council of Agriculture (COA), and Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), have announced the relevant policies for bioenergy promotion under the authorization of acts. Among them, the Renewable Energy Development Act is the legal foundation for promoting bioenergy and its industry development through economic incentives like feed-in-tariff (FIT), installation supports (or subsidies), and electrical grid connection.</jats:p>"

It was due to variation in LMIS reporting schedule; number and types of tracer drugs being handled; and pharmaceutical storage capacity among levels of primary healthcare units. Logistics records and reports, service registers, physical observation, and interview of key informants were sources of data. The data were analyzed by using SPSS version 20. The result was presented in mean, percentage, and standard deviation. Qualitative data on public health supply chain challenges were collected from key informants using a semi-structured interview guide</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>The data were analyzed manually using inductive thematic approach and the result was narrated.</jats:italic>\nResults\n The study revealed that public health supply chain performance of primary health care unit in Gamo zone was low. Inventory management KPIs, LMIS report KPIs, and storage condition KPIs were below the national standard. Means of availability (64.8%±14.8%), stocked according to plan (16.5%±9.5%), inventory accuracy rate (65%±17.2%), and stock out rate (64.9%±9.8%) of tracer drugs in primary health care units deviate from ideal. Likewise, means of LMIS report accuracy rate (64%± 13.6%) and LMIS report completeness (80%±15) for primary healthcare units were lower than the standard. Only 81% of assessed primary health care units adhere to good storage practices. In general, public health supply chain performance decreases across the levels of primary health care units in Gamo zone. LMIS report quality; pharmaceutical distribution; storage condition; public transportation access; supply chain workforce training and motivation; budgeting and finance for logistics activity; and low management support were reported as prevailing challenges.\nConclusion\n  <jats:italic>Inventory management, LMIS reporting, and storage practices are areas where public health supply chain performance gaps identified</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>These lead to wastage and interruption of essential medicines, affecting the quality of healthcare delivery at each level of primary healthcare unit.</jats:italic></jats:p>"

The CM commits to the delivery time and the OEM determines the quality level and the selling price of the supply chain product. We present a three-stage Stackelberg game model and identify a Nash equilibrium solution for the decisions of the CM and the OEM. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to provide insights into the roles of the CM and the OEM. Our main research findings are as follows: The CM’s profit increases while the OEM’s profit first decreases and then increases (non-monotonic) as the committed delivery time sensitivity of demand increases. Interestingly, this study finds that the OEM’s profit decreases, whereas the CM’s profit first increases and then decreases (non-monotonic) in the unit production subsidy paid by the OEM to the CM. Our work shows that the high-quality and fast-delivery product policy is worthwhile in a quality-sensitive or delivery time-sensitive market, which leads to a triple-win outcome. Counterintuitively, a high production capacity is not always advantageous for the supply chain product, even for the CM.</jats:p>"

The behaviors of decision makers are often influenced by their psychological preferences, and loss aversion is one of the basic characteristics of human economic behavior. We research the supply chain coordination problem with capital constraint and loss-averse retailer in the case of stochastic production and demand. In order to address the loss aversion, a novel utility function is structured according to the theory of mental account. Under wholesale price contract, the optimal expected utility of supply chain under decentralized decision is smaller than that under centralized decision due to the retailer’s constrained capital. Based on that, a model is constructed by making revenue sharing contract act as the dual role of supply chain coordination and delayed payment strategy without seeking external financing or internal financing, and the contract conditions and optimal decisions of the coordinated supply chain are solved. Theoretical analysis indicates that when the contract parameters are properly selected, even though the retailer’s capital is constrained, the revenue sharing contract can not only coordinate the supply chain but also realize the arbitrary distribution of supply chain profits within a certain range. Finally, the change of decision variables and expected utility or profit with contract parameters is analyzed by several numerical examples.</jats:p>",

Foreign scholars and researchers have convincingly proved that the global value chain is an independent object for study in international commercial law.In recent years, the leading European legal systems have strengthened the protection of the most vulnerable participants in cross-border relations: workers, other individuals affected by the negative impact of global supply flows. In France, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, as well as at the supranational level in the EU, legislation regulating supply chains is developing. By assigning responsibility to large corporations for cross border violations committed in chains coordinated by them, foreign law is focused on solving socially significant tasks.From a legal point of view, the supply chain is a complex, multi-level system of contracts subordinated to a uniform economic goal. The dominant legal regulation of private relations within supply chains has a non-state origin and is formed by private entities, mainly large multinational corporations. To explain the legal effect of such global regulatory systems, the paper introduces the concept of a «transnational legal order» based on the mechanisms of private law. The transnational legal order, along with the formation of binding (contractual) ties between entities, plays a unifying — organizing and coordinating — role in supply chains. In addition, it creates a platform for the international dissemination of national norms of law, as well as «voluntary» standards and rules formulated in private, social and ethical practices that are not initially endowed with legal force. The contractual form of consolidation contributes to their legitimization. The paper justifies the emergence of a new direction of research in the framework of international commercial law — transnational supply chain law.The trends in the development of international commercial law include digitalization, environmentalization, socialization, industry fragmentation and extraterritoriality of regulation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Following the International Maritime Organization (IMO), in order to safeguard the realization of the Paris Agreement on climate protection, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have to be reduced by 50% by the year 2050. This objective shall be reached by decarbonization of maritime traffic, which is why ship operators currently increasingly search for alternative fuels. Moreover, since the start of the Ukrainian war in February 2022, this issue of alternative fuels has gained central importance in political agendas. A promising candidate for clean shipping that meets the IMO goals is ammonia since it is a carbon-free fuel. Ammonia (NH3) shows good advantages in handling and storage, and it ensures long sea voyages without any significant loss in cargo space for a reasonable price. Hence, ammonia has the potential to improve the environmental footprint of global shipping enormously. Induced by the introduction of stricter regulations in the so-called emission control areas (ECAs) in Northern Europe in 2015 as well as the renewed global sulfur cap, which entered into force in 2020, ship operators had to decide between different compliance methods, among which the most popular solutions are related to the use of expensive low-sulfur fuel oils, newbuilds and retrofits for the usage of liquefied natural gas (LNG) or the installation of scrubber technology. A change to ammonia as a marine alternative fuel represents an additional novel future option, but the successful implementation depends on the availability of NH3 in the ports, i.e., on the installation of the maritime NH3 infrastructure. Currently, the single German NH3 terminal with maritime access is located in Brunsbüttel, the western entrance to Kiel Canal. The distribution of NH3 from the existing NH3 hub to other German ports can be analyzed by the mathematical model of an inventory routing problem (IRP) that is usually solved by combinatorial optimization methods. This paper investigates the interrelated research questions, how the distribution of marine NH3 fuel can be modeled as an IRP, which distribution mode is the most economic one for the German ports and which modal mix for the NH3 supply leads to the greenest distribution. The results of this paper are empirically validated by data that were collected in several EU projects on sustainable supply chain management and green logistics. The paper includes a special section that is dedicated to the discussion of the economic turbulences related to the Ukrainian war together with their implications on maritime shipping.</jats:p>"

The governmental agencies produce these mainly at the national level to derive components related to the calculation of the gross domestic product (GDP). The national SUTs, however, do not capture the heterogeneity of regions within a country. The regional SUTs, on the other hand, are difficult and costly to compile. In the absence of regularly compiled regional SUTs, analysts typically resort to hybrid models based on mechanically updated tables with less extensive data requirements. However, the approaches currently available in the literature do not necessarily guarantee a consistent structure of the SUTs when there is a mismatch in spatial scale at which sectoral output data are available. Building on the multiregional generalized RAS, this paper proposes a modification to the structure of the benchmark matrix that guarantees the supply–use accounting balance as well as the identity of GDP by income and GDP by expenditure at the regional level in the projected matrix. As a result, the procedure allows for efficient production of regional SUTs appropriate for calculating multiplier effects from the national-level statistics.</jats:p>"

The provision that any economic entity in the economic system does not exist separately from the environment that surrounds it creates the need for the functioning and development of the organization to take into account the goals of the main stakeholders. The object of this study is unified heat supply organizations, acting as one of the participants in heat supply, which is legally responsible for the modernization and technological development of heat supply in a certain territory. The interaction of unified heat supply organizations with other economic entities and holders of interests necessarily influences the nature and intensity of modernization and technological development, and their innovative development. The purpose of the study is to identify groups of stakeholders whose interaction is important for the innovative development of unified heat supply organizations, as well as to determine their main goals and interests in order to be able to take them into account when developing a mechanism for managing the innovative development of unified heat supply organizations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study was the work of Russian and foreign researchers in the field of the concept of stakeholders and the stakeholder approach to management.

Blockchain is arguably a technology that can address these challenges and make a significant impact. To shed light on the impact of blockchain, we undertake a cross-discipline systematic literature review on blockchain and supply chains. This review focused on identifying blockchain’s current and proposed impacts on the supply chain at three levels: organisational, inter-organisational, and industry. The findings identified twelve core supply chain themes across pre-implementation, post-implementation, and emerging tensions associated with adopting blockchain. These findings extend knowledge by going beyond understanding blockchain and its application and articulating multi-levels of impacts. Based on our review, we propose future research directions. By providing an overview of the current impact of blockchain, the review also offers insights to help managers to make informed decisions around the implementation and use of blockchain in supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In developing countries, such as Colombia, the majority of the rural water supply systems (RWSS) emerge from the water needs of the community, in order to transit from manual water collection to piped systems. The communities usually construct their water supply system and assume the responsibility of the system. How big these system grow and how well these are maintained are key to how well these systems serve its communities. This paper explores whether the scale of a system, i.e. the size of the system and the number of water users, is an emergent property of the human-water system and that the maintenance of a RWSS depends on this emergent property. Key questions addressed here are: what factors control the scale of a system and how these factors affect the maintenance of the system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Eight RWS systems located in the rural area of two municipalities, Restrepo and the rural area of Cali in the Valle del Cauca province in Colombia, are investigated to compare and contrast the systems and associated factors such as location, occupation and income distributions of the communities. Nearly 900 households representing the population are surveyed. Even though the RWSS are located in the same region, water use efficiencies (indicator of system maintenance) are different from one system to another.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rarely, the distance from the RWSS to urban areas is considered to analyse how well a system is maintained. The results highlight that the locations of the systems, dominant occupation and income levels, as a result, &amp;amp;#160;of the communities play an important role because it determines the surplus that communities are able to muster to maintain as well as grow the systems. The surplus is less in remote areas compared to those close to the peri-urban areas while the maintenance costs are similar. As a result, factors are identified that affect the scale and water use efficiency of the studied RWSS in the Valle del Cauca province in Colombia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Building a flexible supply chain can enable the firms to manage their supply chains to adapt effectively to dynamic market demand changes and thus guarantee their accelerated growth in the future. In this vein, this study aims to address several important issues in supply chain management by considering two characteristics of blockchain technology (i.e., information transparency and security of blockchain technology) and exploring the specific conditions under which firms are likely to develop trust in supply chain management. Furthermore, we argue that such supply chain trust is vital to the success of achieving and increasing supply chain flexibility. In addition, we propose that top management teams’ digital leadership within the firms plays a vital role in moderating the contribution of each dimension of blockchain technology to supply chain trust. Using data from a large sample of 338 firms in China, we perform structural equation modeling to examine our conceptual framework empirically. Our results highlight and support the idea that blockchain technology’s information transparency and security influence the trust-building in a supply chain and supply chain flexibility and articulate the particular importance of digital leadership in explaining the contribution of different blockchain technology characteristics to trust-building. Our study advances the theoretical, empirical, and managerial analysis of critical factors to build trust and achieve flexibility in supply chains.</jats:p>"

Most existing literature on licensing decisions assumes that all firms engage in Cournot or Bertrand competition, while the type of mixed competition may affect the choice of the licensor. In this context, what decision will the licensor make faced with different mixed competitions? This paper studies the optimal technology licensing contract of a licensor firm engaging in different mixed competitions (Cournot-Bertrand or Bertrand-Cournot) with a potential licensee in a differentiated duopoly market considering one upstream firm (supplier) that provides key inputs. We find that if either the royalty or fixed-fee licensing is applied, the licensor favors royalty licensing under Bertrand-Cournot competition when the degree of substitution is small and prefers the fixed-fee licensing no matter under what kind of mixed competition as the degree of substitution increases. In the case of fixed-fee licensing, the result shows that the profits of licensors are the same under different types of mixed competition. Besides, fixed-fee licensing is not always the optimal choice for consumers, and they would prefer royalty licensing when the degree of substitution is very small.</jats:p>"

Due to significant lower operational and initial costs, the predominant configuration in DHN is a CHP+LSHP combination, where the LSHP is operated by internal power supply, provided by the CHP-plant. In a dynamic simulation based on aggregated data over the course of one year, specific CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-emissions are calculated according to the exergetic Carnot methodology, fulfilling the first and sec-ond law of thermodynamics. In order to determine and quantify the ecologic benefit of a generic sector integrated LSHP, the specific CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-emissions of the heat of the most common CHP-plants are compared to a LSHP operated by internal (CHP+LSHP) and external power supply (electrical grid and volatile renew-able energy sources (RES)). The analysis shows, that a generic LSHP operated by internal power supply out of every examined CHP-plant, seasonally independent generates heat with higher specific CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-emissions over the heat from the CHP-plant alone. In contrast, the heat provided by the LSHP operated with external electricity from RES, achieves 5 to 16-fold lower CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-emissions showing, that with growing share of power from RES in the electric grid, regulation to ensure that external power supply is economically feasible will be mandatory in order to achieve ecologic beneficial operation of sector integrated LSHPs.</jats:p>"

Transportation routes and vehicles play a critical share in the optimization of the energy spent in this system because it is considered a complicated case due to its high solutions possibilities. Also, part of these transport processes is considered reverse logistics, where the goods take the way back, starting from the customer. Using a metaheuristic optimization is usually a good way to increase operations efficiency and save time and energy, next to raising sustainability. Within this paper, the last mile supply system within urban areas focusing on the goods' delivery and collection tasks is presented. The model design is described, mathematical optimization modelling is detailed, and a case study to investigate the impact of using diesel and electric trucks on energy efficiency is solved. After an introduction and theoretical background that includes a brief literature review, the designed system and used methodology are described. The designed system incorporates cloud computing, real routes of vehicles, analysis of collected data, energy consumption optimization, and time windows. Also, a mathematical model is developed with the aim of optimizing the total energy consumption. Real thirty locations in Budapest in the VII district are described and used as a case study for finding the solutions of the optimized taken routes and energy consumption by the genetic algorithm for both diesel and electric trucks. In the end, the results are analyzed and compared against a random solution to clarify the presented optimization's effectiveness.</jats:p>"

We conduct simulation analysis based on the actual situation of China’s emergency supply chain development. The research results show that in the recognition period of the crisis, the government participates in emergency supervision and the retailer participates in emergency collaboration, but the supplier does not participate in emergency collaboration. However, in the containment period of the crisis, the government increases penalties, provides appropriate emergency subsidies, and improves the efficiency of emergency supervision, which are conducive to promoting the supplier’s participation in emergency collaboration. In the recovery period of the crisis, as the benefits of both the retailer and the supplier participation in emergency collaboration increase, the government will withdraw from emergency supervision gradually. Moreover, the weaker the risk of supply chain enterprises participating in emergency collaboration, the more reasonable the distribution of the collaboration benefits, and the more conducive to the spontaneous emergency collaboration of the retailer and the supplier.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the cleaning and further treatment of municipal wastewater, sediments are formed, which are extremely dangerous from a sanitary and hygienic point of view, poorly dewatered, have high humidity (over 90%), large volumes (up to 3% of wastewater consumption), contain organic substances, pathogens, heavy metals, etc. In Ukraine, at most wastewater treatment plants, sewage sludge is mostly piled up on sludge sites after minimal treatment. Effective processing and disposal of sewage sludge in order to reduce the negative impact on the environment, as well as the use of sewage sludge as secondary raw materials, is an actual, complex and urgent task. The key link in the existing process of treatment and disposal of sewage sludge is their dewatering. When designing facilities for the treatment and disposal of sewage sludge, advanced technologies should be used, the use of which is based on scientific and technical research. The article reviews the results of research on the intensification of existing mechanical methods of sewage sludge. One of the most effective methods of intensifying the process of dewatering sewage sludge is electro-dewatering, which involves the application of an electric field during mechanical dewatering of sludge. Electro-dewatering technology makes it possible to reduce the humidity of sediments to 20...40%, reduce the concentration of heavy metals and pathogens in sediments, etc. The purpose of this work is to study the possibility of electro-dewatering of activated sludge from secondary settling tanks of municipal wastewater treatment plants in Lviv. Empirical research methods were used. A laboratory scale has been designed for electro-dewatering of sewage sludge. Activated sludge with a moisture content of 98% was studied. It is shown that the effect of activated sludge dewatering, depending on the duration of its treatment, is an S-shaped curve that resembles a kinetic autocatalytic reaction with three periods: induction, main, and fading. The possibility of electro-dewatering of sewage sludge with a maximum dewatering effect of 60% has been proven. Therefore, it is proposed to carry out mechanical dewatering of city sewage sludge using an electric field.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The durability and reliability of operation of steel pipelines of water supply and sewage systems is determined in particular by the quality of their welded joints, which in turn depends both on the composition of the materials used in their manufacture and on the observance of welding technology. The composition of impurities of transported liquids, which can cause corrosive destruction of materials, also has a significant impact on the reliability of pipeline systems. These phenomena are especially important in hot water supply and industrial drainage systems, where the destructive influence of physical factors and the chemical composition of the environment can be decisive. It was found that the loss of strength of the pipeline is caused in particular by improper operation, under the conditions of which micro-flaws of welded joints of pipelines appear, which leads to their destruction. The results of examinations and experimental studies of the strength of welds of steel process pipelines are presented. An external inspection was carried out, determination of the structure and strength parameters of pipeline welds, layer-by-layer analysis of corrosion damage on their inner surface. It was found that premature destruction of welded joints of hot water supply pipelines and industrial sewage is caused by long-term operation in a stressed state. Under such circumstances, the uneven coarse-grained structure of the seam, the presence of non-metallic inclusions in the metal structure, and violations of the welding technology had a critical impact on the loss of strength. In order to increase the corrosion-mechanical resistance of welded joints of industrial pipelines, it is necessary to modify the surfacing metal of the weld to break down the structure and significantly reduce non-metallic inclusions, as well as to improve the technology of manual arc welding with coated electrodes, in particular, the root layers of welding seams.</jats:p>"

It was emphasized that the new approach to reporting is integrated reporting, which contains both financial and non-financial information, necessary for understanding the long-term prospects of the enterprise. Integrated reporting displays information on the following key parameters: an overview of the organizational structure and business model; the environment in which the company operates, including risks and opportunities; strategic goals and strategy for achieving such goals; corporate governance and rewards; activity indicators; prospects for the future. In our opinion, by analyzing the integrated reporting, the investor gets the most complete picture of the level of investment attractiveness of the business.

We set up a simple small open economy with two traded goods and non-traded medical care services. In the economy, there exists a constant rate of labourers who get ill health and must leave their jobs and thereby lose part of their income. But they can reduce the loss of working time and income by consuming medical services. There are two channels that consumption of the medical service affects the welfare of consumers: (i) consumption of medical service raises the state of health and increases utility, and (ii) consumption of medical service reduces the leave period of labourers and raises their wage income (labour supply-enhancing effect). We see that the above second effect makes the effective price of the medical service for the consumer lower than its market price and causes consumption bias towards the consumption of medical services. To introduce the above properties of consumption of medical service, we define the effective expenditure function of the labourers and examine its properties and conduct comparative static analyses. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL codes: F13, F22 </jats:p>",

Further, this DC voltage is given to the Forward converter where it is stepped down to 48V DC which is finally given to power-up the ventilator. The designing of both Boost and Forward converters is done and they are verified by simulating them in the MATLAB Simulink software platform.

Thus, the current study aimed to assess the public health supply chain performance of tracer drugs across primary health care units in the Gamo zone, SNNPR, Ethiopia.\nMethod\n A convergent parallel mixed-method was adopted. Quantitative data were collected from 46 primary health care units between April 01 and May 30, 2021. A stratified simple random sampling method was employed. Logistics records and reports, service registers, physical observation, and interviews of key informants were sources of data. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics such as mean, frequency, and percentages were used to present a result. Qualitative data concerning public health supply chain challenges were collected from key informants by using a semi-structured interview guide. It was analyzed manually using an inductive thematic approach and the result was narrated.\nResults\n The study revealed that the public health supply chain performance of tracer drugs across primary health care units in the Gamo zone was low. Inventory management KPIs, LMIS report KPIs, and storage condition KPIs were below the national standard. Means of availability (64.8%±14.8%), stocked according to plan (16.5%±9.5%), inventory accuracy rate (65%±17.2%), and stock out rate (64.9%±9.8%) of tracer drugs deviate from ideal. Likewise, the means of LMIS report accuracy rate (64%± 13.6%) and LMIS report completeness (80%±15) are below the standard. Only 81% of assessed primary health care units adhere to good pharmaceutical storage practices. In general, public health supply chain performance of tracer drugs decreases down the levels of primary healthcare units. LMIS reported quality; pharmaceutical distribution; storage condition; low access to public transportation; lack of supply chain workforce training and motivation; low dedicated budgeting and finance for logistics activity; and low support from management were reported as prevailing challenges.\nConclusion\n Inventory management, LMIS reporting, and storage practices are areas where gaps in public health program supply chain performance are identified. It leads to wastage and interruption of essential medicines, which affects the quality of healthcare delivery at each level of the primary healthcare units.</jats:p>"

As far as the contribution of the energy sector to the price formation of the other industries of the Greek economy is concerned, it is found that the energy sector mainly contributes to the price formation of industrial sectors.

The antimony industry chain is distributed among the major developed and developing countries around the world. With the development of clean energy technology, the demand for antimony in photovoltaic and energy storage fields will increase significantly. Considering the significant changes in the global demand for antimony products and the serious supply shortage, people should pay more attention to the supply risk of related products of the antimony industry chain. In this paper, we propose a new integrated index to evaluate the supply risk of antimony industry chain related products, including Herfindahl Hirschman index, global governance index, human development index, global innovation index, and betweenness centrality in complex networks. Meanwhile, seven commodities in the antimony industry chain are selected for empirical analysis from 2011 to 2019. The results show that countries with high supply risks of the industry chain upstream include Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. And, Australia, India, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam are with high supply risks in the midstream of the industry chain. Meanwhile, Canada, India, Japan, and Thailand are with high downstream supply risks. Some countries, like China, the United States, and Germany, play a core role in different sectors of the industry chain. International competitive relations of countries have caused a high supply risk of products related to the antimony industry chain. The supply risk of the antimony industry chain shows that countries must strengthen industrial division and cooperation to maximize their interests. It is suggested to take the country-specific measures to mitigate supply risks, including establishing national inventories of critical materials, overseas investment, strengthening the guidance of industrial policies, and accelerating infrastructure construction.</jats:p>"

Complex uncertainties caused by using outbound resources within co-design processes, financial challenges between the collaborating parties, and integrating outbound innovative designs with supply chain tactical planning problem are taken into account. To this end, a robust fuzzy-stochastic optimization model is proposed which can integrate the product design with the main activities of a multi-product supply chain. The proposed model is able to cope with different type of uncertainties including random, epistemic and deep uncertainties. Integrating the financial and physical flows, using a novel pricing mechanism, and considering the outside-in innovations in the product design process are the outstanding contributions of the proposed model. Furthermore, to cover both the short-term and long-term success criteria, ambidexterity of the studied supply chain is taken into account via two conflicting explorative and exploitive objectives. Results indicate the superiority of the presented model and its ability in supporting managerial decisions in the mid-term planning process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper proposes and tests a method for constructing modified functions of labor demand and supply, designed for the analysis of the economy at the macrolevel. Methodological difficulties in constructing these functions are determined by the fact that when considering the labor market at the macro level, in principle, there is no possibility to operate with a series of observations related to a single point in time. Due to this circumstance, it is proposed to define the functions under consideration as regression equations constructed on the basis of dynamic series. The argument of both functions is the average monthly real accrued salary. The value of the supply function is the level of economic activity of the population. This indicator can be interpreted as the amount of work offered for a certain wage by an average representative of the population group in question during the year, expressed in the proportion of a person/year. The value of the demand function is the labor intensity of production, calculated as a quotient of the division of the number of employed by the real gross domestic product. This indicator can be interpreted as the amount of labor demand expressed in person/years by employers producing real value-added products in a certain fixed (depending on the selected units of measurement) volume per year. The article briefly discusses non-paid factors affecting the values of the level of economic activity of the population and the labor intensity. The functions of labor demand and supply are constructed for the Russian economy on the basis of the official statistical information for the period 2001–2014. The modified labor supply function turned out to be linear, and was characterized by a very low elasticity over the time period under consideration. The modified labor demand function is defined as a decreasing power function. Based on the comparisons of the constructed functions, it can be concluded that employers who determine the demand for labor react to changes in wages much more intense than employees who determine the supply of labor.</jats:p>"

Many national and county governments are now developing adaptation policies and plans in response to climate change; however, many factors could stop, delay or divert these adaptation strategies if they are not adequately identified and addressed. Research on adaptation barriers is increasing as the need for climate change adaptation becomes evident, but studies regarding identification and classification of barriers into cartegories and establishing strategies for overcoming such barriers remain limited. This research identified barriers to adapting water supply management to climate change, classified them into cartegories and went ahead to establish strategies for overcoming such barriers in adapting water supply management to climate change in Nzoia River Basin. The study used a cross-sectional survey design and a qualitative technique since major sector players' perspectives are critical in deciding the path of climate change adaptation in the basin. Three counties were randomly selected from Nzoia River Basin for study with Busia representing the lower catchment, Kakamega middle catchment and Trans Nzoia upper catchment. The study was carried out from May, 2017 to September, 2017. Stakeholders were carefully selected and consisted of water and climate change expert decision makers, practitioners, managers, scientists, academia, technology adopters, etc.  Stakeholders were chosen based on their work portfolios or by other respondents' recommendations. Data collection involved questionnaires, in-depth expert-interviews, brainstorming sessions, focus group discussions, field observations and literature review. This study identified and ranked in order of priority the barrier clusters/cartegories for adapting water supply management to climate change in Nzoia River Basin as: Institutional and governance; Resources and funding; Leadership; Politics; Adaptation options/process; Science; Understanding; Technology/structural; Expertise; Attitudes, values and motivations of actors; Communication; and  Personality issues. Individual barriers are seen to be highly interconnected and interdependent, allowing for the discovery of leverage areas for actions to maximize barrier elimination. This study provides valuable information for the national and county governments as they strive to develop climate change adaptation policies and plans in the basin.</jats:p>"

Number of constant pressure supply lines, each providing unique pressure level, are routed to every actuator in the machine. Significant amount of the power losses related to conventional load sensing systems are avoided by enabling energy recuperation and reduction of total throttling loss. Pressure control of such multi-pressure hydraulic supply line can be realized using hydraulic accumulators, which are charged using conventional pump and logic valves. However, more advanced features are available if Digital Hydraulic Power Management System DHPMS is utilized. The DHPMS is in essence, a digital pump/motor/transformer with multiple outlets. Controller design of DHPMS in hydraulic bus application is described in the paper and simulation results show the system’s ability to simultaneously control the supply line pressures and input power of the DHPMS. By controlling the input power, the prime mover such as Diesel engine can be driven in optimal operation point or it can be even downsized. If electric motor is used as prime mover, smaller and therefore less expensive motor can be used.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, daily failure data measured coordinately in the water distribution system network in Gebze and transferred to the geographic information system (GIS) has been used. The data has been normalized through the min-max technique to scale it at regular intervals and develop the model prediction performance. In this study, certain meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation have been taken into account as model input for the first time. According to the increasing values of these two variables, it is observed in the model results that daily failure rates tend to increase. The expected model accuracies in failure rate prediction could not be obtained through the suggested ANN models. The higher prediction performances have been obtained through the STDM, a structure that enables visualization of the model results by making inferences. The STDM method is a significant alternative approach to determine the relationship of the variables on the failure and to predict the failure rate. It is predicted that the suggested STDM charts will contribute to the decision-makers, experts, and planners to determine effective infrastructure management. Also, investment planning prioritization will be able to reduce failure rates by interpreting prediction charts.</jats:p>",

Diverse water actors held different perspectives and perceptions of water supply quality and quantity because of their different power holdings and political and economic interests. The state actors seemed biased on their positive performance, demonstrating their satisfaction with the current water supply governance, while community, private sectors, and household water users instead showed their dissatisfaction with the quality and quantity of the current water supply system, but they stayed neutral about the water supply governance performance. The research showed the complexity and dynamics of water actors’ powers and interests in armed conflict areas. In addition, there is a lack of socio-technical and financial capacity for the investment and maintenance of water distribution and collection infrastructure and facility, as well as water quality and quantity monitoring and evaluation.

As a result, SMEs confront a variety of challenges, including fiercer competition, trouble accessing finance, underutilized marketing, a lack of superior resources, restricted access to suppliers, the emergence of new rivals, and a lack of preparedness for the unexpected. The supply chain management process takes these issues into account. It is anticipated that micro, small, and medium-sized firms (MSMEs) will play a crucial role in the development of the populace's economy. MSMEs are anticipated to be able to overcome poverty, the traditional development barrier. The goal of this study is to develop a better supply chain management plan that will benefit the residents of Medan, especially MSMEs, and help to lower the unemployment rate. This study uses a qualitative methodology. the collection of data through surveys and the use of website-based supporting materials. As a result, the study's findings show that Medan's unemployment rate has gone up. Many causes, including the rising number of high school graduates who don't pursue higher education, contribute to the rise in the number of unemployed people in the city of Medan. MSMEs thus contribute significantly to lowering the unemployment rate in the city of Medan. The growth of MSMEs is hampered by a number of problems, which prevent them from developing to their full potential. The lack of money, the employment of less labor, and poorly functioning marketing are some of the challenges faced by MSMEs. So in order to lower the unemployment rate, researchers apply a supply chain method.</jats:p>"

Yet, the impacts of anthropogenic mineral supplementation on community-wide wildlife nutrition, behaviour and subsequent impact on ecosystem processes remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the contribution of anthropogenic mineral lick provision to wildlife nutrient intake across a community of large mammals (&gt;10kg) in the southern Kalahari Desert. Based on predicted daily nutrient requirements and a faecal nutrient assessment, large herbivores appear deficient in phosphorus (P), sodium (Na) and zinc (Zn). For these nutrients, anthropogenic salt and mineral licks constitute an important (&gt;10%) source of nutrient intake helping to reduce or overcome requirement deficits. Larger-bodied species disproportionately consumed licks (p&lt;0.01), acquiring more nutritional benefits. A comprehensive assessment of animal body condition indicated that in general large herbivores display good health. However, bulk grazers, hindgut fermenters and females were more likely to display signs of malnourishment. We discuss how provisioning of anthropogenic mineral licks may be inflating large herbivore populations beyond the long-term carrying capacity of the reserve, with subsequent impacts for ecosystem integrity and herbivore population instability. Based on results presented here, it is clear that anthropogenic provision of mineral licks should be considered carefully by wildlife managers aiming to conserve or restore natural processes in conservation and rewilding landscapes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past twenty years, the plastic pollution problem in the water bodies has reached an alarming scale. The easy-to-use, light, waterproof material has the significant drawback, it is the very long decomposition period, which has led to the 368 million tons of plastic accumulation over the past 70 years, and the accumulation continues. Plastic environmental pollution is the urgent problem for the water bodies in Ukraine too. The source of plastic entering water bodies is primarily temporary waste landfills from which plastic is washed into rivers and lakes during rains, by wind and by flood. The rivers carry plastic throughout the river floodplain, polluting riverbeds and banks during the flood. In the work, the analysis of the world experience in the area of the plastic capture devices and the possibility to use these devices for the mountain rivers conditions in Ukraine was assessed. The peculiarities of the hydrological regime of the mountain rivers are the transportation of plastic during floods, significant water levels fluctuations, the danger for people being in the riverbed during the flood, high water speeds up to the 5 m/s, the large amount of litter, which in consists of the plastic, tree trunks, branches and other large debris. It was assessed the booms, trash traps and trash racks for catching litter in water outlets and temporary streams. Plastic collecting facilities such as floating boats, catamarans, and robots were not assessed, because their use during the flood is dangerous, and the small water depths in the rivers do not allow to use them effectively during the low water period. Devices for plastic capture for the mountain rivers should be autonomous, strong, have the big litter capacity, be ecological friendly, able to work with rapid water level change and under high water speed. Analysis of the existing devices shows that these requirements will be met by expensive segment. At the same time, it is known that the plastic capture in the water bodies costs in 10 times higher than the cost of collecting and sorting plastic in the populated areas. So, to solve the problem of plastic pollution in the water bodies by the expensive devices is not right way. First of all, in order to reduce plastic pollution in water bodies, it is necessary to create conditions to prevent plastic to get into the rivers, namely: voluntary limitation of the plastic usage, manufacture responsibility for the use of recyclable plastic, active informing society about the plastic harm to the environment and the necessity to collect and sort it.</jats:p>"

Quality less agricultural products are added to the market in day-to-day life which leads to usage of chemicals in the production process. These leads to the major issues that gives the impact on agricultural product’s quality as well as overall well-being of the consumers. Devices are needed to identify the quality of the food products which are highly demanded due to the lack of transparency in the recent processes. Henceforth Blockchain technology is evolving as a decentralized and secure infrastructure which could replace involvement of a third party to verify the transactions inside the system. The purpose of the proposed work is to implement a Blockchain based solution i.e. constructing a Decentralized Application (DApp) using Hyperledger Fabric framework to verify the food quality and the cause of the agricultural supply chain. A private permissioned Blockchain concept is chosen instead of a public Blockchain in the proposed work to ensure transparency and secure transaction by consenting any person to access the network. Smart contract chain code was instantiated for the deployment of Blockchain network. All the performers who are involved in the supply chain must be able to interact with the system to achieve the transparency. Transaction and queries related to a food product are validated by peers of the Blockchain network. A Barcode &amp; QR code-based scanning mechanism is used to indicate the customer’s satisfaction with their products. Transactions without third party gives Farmer’s reputation for their products. A unique DApp mechanism is used to identify each product within the food supply chain. Thus, the proposed system has been implemented as a prototype and validated using smart contracts.</jats:p>",

Monetary policy tightening acts to reduce the demand-driven contribution of inflation.

The most frequently stated problems are water supply scarcity and pollution issues in China's Yangtze River. What is not yet clear is the correlation between comprehensive water efficiency and its sub-stage efficiencies, water utility efficiency, and water governance efficiency. This study aims to investigate water utility and water governance together. This paper provides a fresh perspective on developing an improved DEA method called the SHAN model that evaluates and decomposes the comprehensive water efficiency to water utility efficiency and water governance efficiency for 30 cities in the Yangtze River Basin from 2005 to 2015. The SHAN model is a modified RAM Network DEA model with the extra consideration of Super SBM and undesirable output. A Tobit model will be adopted to analyze the relationship between comprehensive water efficiency and its sub-stages. This paper uses panel quantile regression to investigate the impact of the degree of opening and other efficiency determinants. The results show that the value of comprehensive water efficiencies in most cities along the Yangtze River Basin are lower than 1, as well as the water utility efficiencies and water governance efficiencies. The results indicate that the government should significantly improve water resource utilization and pollution problems. The findings also show that the degree of opening, population density, GDP per capita, urbanization, and industrial structure positively influence comprehensive water efficiency. Population urbanization lag has negative impacts on the comprehensive water efficiency. The Tobit regression results show that the water resource utilization efficiency and water resource management efficiency are 1.435 and 0.227, respectively. This result indicates that the water utility stage has a more significant effect on comprehensive water efficiency.</jats:p>",

The paper describes a specially developed power supply (input voltage 48 V DC, output voltage up to 50 kV) based on the conventional Full Bridge topology with two high-frequency high-voltage transformers and a 6-stage voltage multiplier. In order to avoid many problems caused by low coupling between primary and secondary windings of the transformers and the large parasitic capacitances of the secondary windings, a special quasi-resonant zero-current switching transistor control algorithm with variable switching frequency (dependent on output load) was developed. In the described method, the energy is supplied to the transformer in short pulses, when a pair of diagonal transistors of the full-bridge converter were turned on. Then, the freewheeling state is maintained until all of the energy stored in the leakage inductance of the transformer has been transferred to the secondary side, which means that the current in the primary windings drops to zero. This approach reduces energy losses, electromagnetic disturbances and prevents current distortion in primary winding.</jats:p>"

First, improving production process reliability and cost reduction are two main factors for enhancing economic sustainability. Hence, we introduced autonomated inspection and invested in ordering and setup costs. Second, reducing the carbon footprint in supply chains is the main pillar of their environmental stewardship, which is addressed by an eco-friendly and flexible production system in this study. Finally, an advanced single-setup-multi-delivery (SSMD) strategy is utilized to improve social aspects associated with human labor increase. For practicality, demand is considered as the selling price and is quality dependent. The sustainability enhancement is transformed as a term of profit; therefore, our model maximizes the total profit of the supply chain by optimizing a manufacturer’s and retailer’s decision variables. Numerical examples show that autonomation technology increases the system’s reliability by 64%, where eco-production reduces carbon emission by up to 16%, and the total profit increases by up to 25%. Moreover, the application of advanced SSMD reduces the transportation cost by up to 34%.</jats:p>"

When the motor is in rated operation and start-up and stop stages, the motor voltage operates within a reasonable range; Finally, the simulation model of on load voltage regulation technology is built by using MATLAB/SIMULINK software, and the feasibility of this technology is verified by different experimental settings.</jats:p>"

In order to realise the synergy of supply chain, the most important is to realise the dynamic synergy of information. Here we proposed a strategy to integrate system dynamics and multi-agent system modelling methods. Based on the strategy of supply chain information sharing and coordination, a two-level aggregation hybrid model was designed and established. Through the computer simulation analysis of the two modes before and after information collaboration, it is found that under the information collaboration mode, the change trend of order or inventory of suppliers and manufacturers always closely matches that of retailers. After the implementation of supply chain information coordination, ordering and inventory can be reasonably planned and matched, and problems such as over-stocking or short-term failure to meet order demands caused by poor information communication will no longer occur, which can greatly reduce the “bullwhip effect”.</jats:p>"

In this respect, BT applications take place in different types of supply chains. One of the areas where blockchain is used is the food supply chain (FSC). FSC is a general concept that also covers different types such as agri-FSC and cold chain. These supply chains need the advantages of modern BT for crucial reasons such as the products’ time-dependent nature and direct impact on human health. We evaluate the use of blockchain applications in the field of FSC in order to provide a deep understanding of problems inherent to the FSC and present insights to companies into developing and implementing their own blockchain-driven solutions to address the FSC performance challenges. As the FSC is a complex and dynamic system, where multi-stakeholders are involved, a systematic approach should be established to reveal the BT integration behavior of the FSC. An extensive literature review was conducted within the scope of the study. A critical review of the studies shows which BT applications are used in the FSC chain to drive supply chain performance, their application areas, and main problems in various aspects in the applications. Using the causal loop diagram (CLD) as a system dynamics approach, the interrelationship of causes and effects is visualized and prescriptive information is generated to guide researchers and practitioners in the field of new technology adoption in FSCs in general and BT integration in particular. This study is intended to encourage the use of BT in FSC applications.</jats:p>",

Then an integrated approach of Grey DEMATEL – ANP is proposed to analyze the adoption barriers to Industry 4.0 in sustainable supply chain management. The proposed method determines the cause-effect relationship among barriers, the strength of interactions, and the relative weights of critical barriers to Industry 4.0 in a sustainable supply chain. The results show that uncertainty about economic benefits, resistance to change, and lack of infrastructure and tools for Industry 4.0 in the Sustainable supply chain are crucial barriers to implementing Industry 4.0 technologies in SSC.

Results showed that the profit for the solid wood bed supply chain reached maximum under the CD model, followed by the SGII model, and then the SGI model, and the TLG model showed the lowest profit. A higher preference for low-carbon products can lead to lower demand for products and higher retail prices.

When the railway lines are supplied by DC networks, lower voltages are observed, and consequently, current values are often ten times higher than in AC networks. This is an operational problem, as high currents make it easier to overload the supply network. Based on a literature review, the authors show that the problem of running railway traffic when the capacity of the power supply network is limited (by the size of the permitted currents) is not well studied. The authors propose a method based on the Markov approach supplemented by classical theoretical vehicle traffic dynamics to improve the operational robustness of the rail transport system using DC power supply system. Each train run was parameterised in such a way that it is possible to determine the state that the train is in during the run, the transitions between states, and the determination of the probabilities of occurrence of such states. On the other hand, classical vehicle dynamics was used to assess the load generated by the train on the power grid. The proposed method—reduced to a function—was verified using a case study. The method of timetable reconfiguration proposed by the authors increased the operational robustness from 0.9454 to 0.9774.</jats:p>"

Recent events (e.g. Covid-19) have shown how fragile supply chains can be when assumptions for the design and management of supply chains are challenged. In addition, governments are striving for systemic changes towards more sustainability (e.g. European Green Deal). To meet the resulting requirements, the concept of circular economy and with it, circular supply chain management (CSCM) are gaining attention as they could contribute to building a sustainable and resilient system. The German wind energy industry, with its long track record, is a suitable application for further research on CSCM, as the industry operates predominantly in a linear system and relies on finite materials. Despite, research on CSCM for the wind energy industry is still rare. The aim of the paper is therefore to present conceptional ideas that enable an efficient design of a circular wind energy industry in Germany. Aspects from an organization, products and processes level of a CSCM are outlined.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Conventional wisdom holds that a central bank should tighten monetary policy after a surprise decline in labor supply to offset the inflationary effects of the decline. However, this policy prescription comes from models of monetary policy that abstract from labor force participation. We examine the policy implications of worker entry into and exit from the labor force. We find that cyclical changes in labor force participation call for a less restrictive policy response to a decline in labor supply. The less restrictive policy response is appropriate because policy tightening reduces the labor force and thus raises wage growth. The optimal policy response dampens the reduction in the labor force and brings about a period of higher inflation.</jats:p>"

Industries in MSME sector depends on the functioning of large processors as their support and contract manufacturers as well as on their limited market opportunities which they have developed. During pandemic both collapsed. With the drastic reduction in consumption expenditure and disruption in supply chain coupled with the severe cash crunch, MSME sector has suffered the most.

It is based on the previously obtained solutions of the system of differential equations describing the liquid movement with variable flow rate in pressure drainage pipelines that operate at the horizontal level of the groundwater surface. The analysis is presented in dimensionless form. The influence of the groundwater level slope on the calculation results is estimated using the value of the relative flow variation in the end section of the collector and the generalized parameter of the collector drain A, which takes into account its design and filtration characteristics. The obtained calculation formulas are quite simple and easy to use. The proposed method allows to determine the limits within which simplified dependencies for the calculation of drainage pipelines can be used, which are recommended for use at the horizontal groundwater level on the land reclamation site. At the same time, the error introduced into the calculations as a result of the adopted simplification is immediately determined. Corresponding graphs are presented in the paper to illustrate the obtained dependencies.</jats:p>"

This study attempts to synthesise the existing literature in this research area and summarise the findings regarding barriers, drivers, and social implications of using AI in SCM. Methods: The methodology used for this meta-study is based on Kitchenham and Charters guidelines, resulting in a selection of 44 literature reviews published between 2000 and 2021. Results: As a summary of the results, the main areas of AI in SCM were algorithms, followed by the Internet of Things (IoT). The main barriers to AI adoption in SCM are change management, existing technical limitations, and the acceptance of humans for these techniques. The main drivers of AI in SCM are saving costs and increasing efficiency in combination with reducing time and resources. The main social factor is human–robot collaboration. As a result, there will be a decreased amount of labour needed in the future, impacting many existing jobs, especially in low-income areas. Conclusions: Therefore, it is essential for organisations that implement new technology to start as early as possible to inform the organisation about the changes and help them successfully implement them. It is also important to mention that constant learning and improvement of the employees are critical for adopting and successfully using new AI tools. Before investing in new technology, a solid Return on Investment calculation (ROI) and monitoring costs and value are critical to transforming the business successfully.</jats:p>"

This study adopted a quantitative approach using a survey administered to 221 supply chain (SC) professionals through the professional networking website LinkedIn. The conceptual model was evaluated with the partial least squares-based structural equation model (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS. The findings showed that DT has significant positive impacts on SCP and CAD, and that SCP has a significant positive impact on CAD. Supply chain procurement plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between DT and CAD. The findings are useful for decision-makers investing in digitally modernising their SC processes. The study recommends starting the DT of an SC with procurement, as procurement is a complex process involving a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. The results show that digital procurement may be an SC game changer in a competitive market. The study provides initial guidelines for a transition from traditional to smart procurement (procurement 4.0). Despite the prevalence of studies on SCP, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how DT of procurement functions can lead to sustainable CAD.</jats:p>"

The cost minimization is done in terms of eliminating the power transformer and reducing power consumed by the ESP unit. Usually, transformers are used to boost the voltage level in conventional systems on its input side, which is replaced by a combination of a high-frequency converter along with a voltage multiplier in a modular arrangement. By interconnecting these modules, the suitable voltage is built-up easily. An intermittent pulse energized supply is developed by the proposed system to reduce back corona and to save energy consumption. The modular arrangement also increases the lifetime of converter switches, by reducing the switching stresses developed across them during its high-frequency operation and by reducing the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). The complete system is designed and analyzed using MATLAB SIMULINK. The obtained results are better than the existing methods used for generating intermittent energization, the THD is reduced to 35.78% and the voltage stresses also reduced to 1800 V. And a module is experimented and found that it is capable of producing 3 kV.</jats:p>",

The main purpose of this study was to estimate runoff employing Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and GA models using accessible, applicable, and easily available climatic data. The results of the two models were compared to provide an easy but reliable model to estimate evaporation. The models were utilized to estimate the runoff in Sivand river basin located in Fars province in central Iran. The results were compared considering a range of model performance indicators as mean absolute error (MAE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R2). According to the results presented, ANFIS with lower RMSE and MAE and higher correlation coefficient and NSE between the observed and predicted values provided higher accuracy in comparison to GA. Also, it was clear that using ANFIS, an increase in the number of membership functions and running cycles of the model decreased the error such that the results in the studied stations using were improved by 42, 44 and 11%, respectively by increasing the number of membership functions and run rounds. Also, it was observed that the nonlinear models performed better than the linear models when applying GA such that non-linearizing the model improved the results of the GA model in the three studied stations by 27.5%, 17%, and 9.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, considering RMSE amounts the best results from ANFIS were 23%, 54.6%, and 35.7% better than the best results from GA in the three stations, respectively. According to the results of the study runoff can be estimated appropriately by utilizing ony meteorological data and there is no need for more complex and interdependent data. A sensitivity analysis was conducted too by removing rainfall and evaporation parameters in two different scenarios. The ANFIS model showed the lowest sensitivity to the absence of those parameters especially evaporation in scenario 3 with RMSE = 0, 0, and −0.005 for Chambian, Dashtbal, and Tang Balaghi stations, respectively. The results of the study justifies using ANFIS employing only meteorological data to estimate runoff in areas when scant data are available.</jats:p>",

The impact of Supply Chain Innovative Practices (SCIPs) on customer retention in manufacturing SMEs is not well recognized. This paper aims to examine the extent to which manufacturing SMEs embrace SCIPs and their impact on customer retention. A simple random sampling technique and cross-sectional research design were used. Data were collected from 168 SME owners in Mwanza-Tanzania using a questionnaire survey to test the relevance of transactional cost theory in ascertaining the impact of SCIPs on customer retention. To determine the relationship between SCIPs and customer retention, Multiple Linear Regression was used. The study spotted e-supply chain, customisation, just in time, collaborative SC, reverse logistics, SC configurations, green supply chain, outsourcing and cross-docking as the most SCIPs adopted in manufacturing SMEs. The spotted SCIPs showed a positive link and significant impact on customer retention in Tanzania’s manufacturing SMEs. Only reverse logistics had a non-significant impact. SCIPs are important tools for customer retention. Therefore, all actors along the supply chain of manufacturing SMEs should aim at adopting SCIPs to improve performance, satisfy and retain customers. The study enriches the literature by documenting the role of SCIPs in customer retention in manufacturing SMEs.</jats:p>",

Numerous cases of food fraud, contamination, and adulteration are daily reported from multiple parts of India, suggesting the absolute need for an upgraded decentralized supply chain model. A country such as India, where its biggest strength is its demographic dividend, cannot afford to malnutrition a large population of its children by allowing them to consume contaminated and adulterated dairy products. In view of the gravity of the situation, we propose a blockchain-enabled supply chain platform for the dairy industry. With respect to the supply chain platform, the dairy products of choice include milk, cheese, and butter. Blockchain is one of the fastest growing technologies having widespread acceptance across multiple industry verticals. Blockchain possesses the power to transform traditional supply chains into decentralized, robust, transparent, tamper proof, and sustainable supply chains. The proposed supply chain platform goes beyond the aspect of food traceability and focuses on maintaining the nutritional values of dairy products, identification of adulteration and contamination in dairy products, the increasing economic viability of running a dairy farm, preventing counterfeit dairy products, and enhancing the revenue of the dairy company. The paper collates the mentioned functionalities into four distinct impact dimensions: social, economic, operations, and sustainability. The proposed blockchain-enabled dairy supply chain platform combines the use of smart contracts, quick response code (QR code) technology, and IoT and has the potential to redefine the dairy supply chains on socio-economic, operational, and sustainability parameters.</jats:p>"

This article examines the previous literature on crisis management by identifying the types of crises that will affect a focal firm’s suppliers in the chain, and how those types of crises will affect the supply chain. We continue by adding response measures through creating modular design and modular innovation capability, which will not prevent the crisis but will drastically decrease supply disruption and thus decrease response time for the focal firm.

Chromatic graphs are used for the first time to assign groundwater pumping schedules. Assuming that a finite number of users pumps from a common aquifer, we examine the following three pumping scenarios: (a) all users pump simultaneously, (b) users pump during one out of two different periods, (c) users pump during one out four different periods. A computational code, based on Theis equation, is constructed to calculate the drawdowns and, subsequently, the energy consumption, for various well locations, numbers of wells, flow rates, pumping period durations and aquifers' characteristics. We use nearest neighbor graphs and chromatic graphs to represent the interactions of the well users. We compare the results obtained when chromatic graphs are used, to the optimum, which is obtained using genetic algorithms (GAs). Our results indicate that: (a) performance of chromatic graphs is good, (b) when two pumping periods are used, it is sufficient for each player to cooperate with their nearest neighbor and pump alternately. In typical cases, the energy consumption reduction can be around 10–40%. The benefit is even higher if four pumping periods are used.</jats:p>",

Yet leakage—when deforestation is pushed to other regions—may dilute the global effectiveness of regionally successful policies. Here we show that domestic leakage offsets 43-50% of the avoided deforestation induced by existing and proposed zero-deforestation supply chain policies in Brazil’s soy sector. However, cross-border leakage is insignificant (&lt;3%) because soybean production is displaced to existing U.S. farmland. Eliminating deforestation from the supply chains of all firms exporting Brazilian soy to the EU or China from 2011-2016 could have reduced net global deforestation by 2% and Brazilian deforestation by 9%. Thus, if major tropical commodity importers (e.g., the EU) require traders to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains, it could help bend the curve on global forest loss.</jats:p>"

Typically, all islands are characterized by their limited supply of freshwater, and their governments commonly rely on large-scale interventions to provide residents with potable water. The island of New Providence in The Bahamas is home to the capital city of Nassau and almost three-quarters of the country's population. New Providence has a long history of hydrologic interventions to supply domestic and industrial water. Historic groundwater sources have been over-extracted to severe levels of salinization, and some groundwater aquifers have not recovered after more than 8 years later. Fresh water was barged in from the larger Andros Island for ~40 years, which ultimately became insufficient to meet demand on New Providence. In addition to an aggressive Non-Revenue-Water (NRW) Program, desalination of ocean water <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> diesel-operated reverse osmosis plants has served as the primary source of potable water for the island. Present concerns have grown due to its contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. The Bahamas is also investigating alternative mechanisms for providing clean drinking water to the country, with Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) under consideration to co-generate clean energy in addition to drinking water. This article reveals that historic interventions to source drinking water for New Providence Island have proven to be unsustainable and ultimately have threatened the freshwater availability. Current efforts to investigate drinking water provision through OTEC are promising, particularly for the potential co-generation of energy and to promote sustainable development. This solution may be promising for other small islands where development is often challenged by water availability and sustainable energy provision.</jats:p>"

The lead time that the company has estimated is 168 hours; due to limited transportation, receiving orders has been delayed, especially in July 2020, which was 192 hours, and in March 2021, which was 144 hours. This study aims to determine the effect of lead time on inventory control of hijab label accessories at Paku Payung Club (PPC). Inventory control is one of the management functions that are very important to determine the level of inventory that must be maintained so that inventory does not run out of goods or otherwise experience excessive inventory. The research was conducted based on data on lead time and company control from July 2020 to July 2021. The research method used is an associative descriptive research method, then the type of quantitative data and ratio scale. Then it is processed using the classical assumption test, regression test, simple correlation test, coefficient of determination test, partial significant hypothesis test (t-test), and simultaneous hypothesis test (f test). The results show that there is an effect of lead time on inventory control at Paku Payung Club, with a correlation coefficient that has a powerful influence. This research is expected to be input for the Paku Payung Club business manager in production planning thus that the business can run effectively and efficiently.&#x0D;\nKeywords:  Lead time; Inventory Management; Inventory Control</jats:p>"

Cloud manufacturing is a way to standardize and increase the system’s reliability, and a fuzzy inference system is suited to deal with highly uncertain circumstances. A fuzzy inference system is integrated into a cloud manufacturing model to incorporate uncertainties related to Time, Quality, Cost, Reliability, and Availability in finding the optimum supply chain of manufacturers and service centers. The model is illustrated via a simulation in the manufacturing context. The proposed approach provides a tool to address the uncertainties and disruptions resulting from wide-scale crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

For this reason, they must be distributed within a specific time and require special equipment and facilities (e.g., refrigeration and dehumidification systems) throughout the entire chain from farm to fork to ensure slow deterioration and to deliver safe and high-quality products to consumers. Cold chains can last for short periods, such as a few hours, or for several months or even years (e.g., frozen food products) depending on the product and the target market. A huge amount of energy is required to preserve quality by maintaining the desired temperature level over time. The required energy is also affected by inventory management policies (e.g., warehouse filling levels affect the cooling demand per unit of a product) and the behavior of the operators (e.g., number and duration of door openings). Furthermore, waste entails the loss of energy and other resources consumed for processing and storing these products. The aim of the present study is to propose a quantitative approach in order to map the energy flows throughout the cold chain in the food and beverage sector and to evaluate the overall energy performance. The results of the energy flow mapping give decisionmakers insights into the minimum energy required by the cold chain and allow them to prioritize energy efficiency measures by detecting the most energy consuming stages of the cold chain. The implementation of a holistic approach, shifting from a single-company perspective to chain assessment, leads to a global optimum and to an increased implementation rate of energy efficiency measures due to the reduced barriers perceived by different actors of the cold chain.</jats:p>"

Togo is not an exception in this regard because some rural agricultural communities do not have access to water but rely on distance conveyance. Government is under constitutional obligation to supply water in rural areas to boost crop production off rain seasons especially. Can Government Water subsidy improve smallholder farmers&amp;rsquo; nutrition? This study, therefore, aims at investigating the impact of Government Water Supply (GWS) on the household of Kara agricultural region in Togo. A two-stage sampling procedure was employed to collect panel data during 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 cropping seasons. Different from previous studies, robust fixed effects regression is used to model the effect of government water subsidy. The core findings reveal that water subsidy improves farm household&amp;rsquo;s nutrition. The results also indicate that subsidized water influences available per capita calories per day, household&amp;rsquo;s months of good nutrition, and the probability of being well nourished from own production of cereals and legumes but has statistically insignificant effects on household annual consumption expenditure. The results provide several valuable insights from the policy point of view. A water supply subsidy program has a higher and better influence on the maximum good nutrition, bringing up the question of whether targeting households in the lowest food crops production percentiles give value for money to achieve the goal of sustainable nutrition. </jats:p>"

In this paper, we explain variation in transparency practices through a comparison of the four largest fast fashion retailers: H&amp;M, Inditex, Gap, and Fast Retailing. Drawing on cross-case comparison and within-case process tracing, we offer insights into why some retailers are more transparent than others. Our findings suggest that sustainability scandals are a necessary but insufficient condition for motivating firms to increase transparency in their supply chains. Scandals can be an important driver of increased transparency, but only when accompanied by support from senior management and alignment with domestic norms about appropriate corporate conduct. These findings contribute to the literature on transnational business governance, corporate transparency, and sustainable supply-chain management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Companies must shift from traditional supply chain management thinking to addressing or preventing increases in vulnerability, uncertainty, and unforeseen supply chain disruptions facing complex global supply chains. Systems with a large number of elements may be susceptible to nonlinear interactions, perturbation of which may lead to serious impacts. Thus, there is an increasing need to determine the importance of individual elements and how these elements interact. Published studies of supply chain resilience (SCRes) do not clearly determine the hierarchical structure of factors, and the understanding of interactions between factors remains fragmented. In this study, we proposed a cloud model-DEMATEL−ISM method to overcome the disadvantages of traditional DEMATEL−ISM integration methods. The MICMAC method (cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification) was also used to classify the enablers of SCRes based on driving force and dependence force. We tested these approaches by studying the new energy vehicle industry in China. The results suggest that companies trying to strengthen SCRes should focus on enablers at the base layer with a high driving force, particularly the enablers of social capital, restructuring, risk management culture, information technology application, trust and collaboration, information sharing, and learning capability..</jats:p>"

This paper aims to provide a methodology for prioritizing and assessing the energy efficiency measures for cold chains in terms of quality losses and specific energy consumption, distinguishing between technological, maintenance, and managerial opportunities. This analysis is based on the cold supply chain tool, developed under the H2020 project ICCEE (“Improving Cold Chain Energy Efficiency”) which focuses on a holistic approach, not looking only at the individual stages of the cold chain.

Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature on low-carbon supply chains, explores the current knowledge system, evolution trend of topics, and future research directions, and enriches the green economy framework. A systematic analysis was conducted using bibliometric and content analysis. Up to 1,811 articles from 2003 to 2021 were selected, discussed, and analyzed. This study found that the low carbon supply chain is a growing research topic. Some influential authors, the geographical distribution of articles, and subject categories in this field were also identified. Next, five clusters, which are logistics management, carbon accounting, driving forces, sustainability management, and barriers, were defined using exhaustive content analysis. The evolution trend of significant topics, mainly including global value chain, additive manufacturing, deterioration, and decarbonization, was explored. Finally, we proposed a future research agenda for low-carbon supply chains and further deepened the green economy’s knowledge structure.</jats:p>"

Empirical findings showed that credit to the private sector significantly impacts domestic investment in West Africa. It was also revealed that access to electricity significantly impacts domestic investment in West Africa. This demonstrates that funding for the private sector and adequate power generation improve the investment in any economy. The study concludes that financial deepening has a significant impact on domestic investment. The study therefore recommends that the management of banks should be encouraged to pursue policies that will deepen the efficient allocation of financial services for domestic investment in the region.</jats:p>"

The main interrelationships between structural and kinematic parameters of drainage pipelines when performing their hydraulic calculations using simplified formulas are analyzed. Numerical values of coefficients and exponents in simplified formulas for pipelines made of different materials were obtained. It was established that for all types of urban drainage (domestic, rainwater and combined), the values of the minimum allowable slopes of the pipelines practically coincide, depend only on their diameters and can be calculated according to the obtained empirical formula with the recommended numerical values of its parameters for pipes of different materials. The maximum allowable of minimum and maximum slopes, as well as the corresponding maximum waste water consumption for pipelines of different diameters and materials, are determined.&#x0D;\nNew approaches to hydraulic calculations of water drainage networks involves their execution according to a single methodology based on the proposed simplified formulas. Also, it involves the use of the obtained empirical dependencies to determine the minimum and maximum permissible slopes and the corresponding maximum marginal flows of wastewater and pipe diameters. The algorithm for the unification of hydraulic calculations when solving the optimization problem is considered. The effectiveness of the application of simplified power-law formulas of hydraulic calculations and empirical dependencies obtained on their basis for unification is shown. Carrying out hydraulic calculations of drainage pipelines using simplified power-law formulas allows not only to simplify the calculations themselves, but also to obtain additional dependencies between the structural parameters of the pipelines based on them.</jats:p>"

We model four scenarios with the capital constraints of the respective manufacturer and retailer using bank credit financing (BCF) and trade credit financing (TCF) approaches to address financing problems, and investigate the retailer’s willingness to share demand forecasting information. We find that TCF is an equilibrium financing choice for a capital-constrained supply chain. However, when a capital-constrained member chooses TCF, sharing demand information over the supply chain becomes more difficult. The interactions between the choices of financing approach and information sharing based on the game equilibriums, as well as the conditions that encourage the well-funded member to offer TCF in the capital-constrained supply chains, have also been analytically explored and numerically verified. Additional managerial insights are provided for discussions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background. Student life is often accompanied by changes in eating behavior. Adopting a balanced and varied diet and healthy eating habits can promote the health, growth and intellectual development of young people at different stages of life. According to the WHO, a healthy diet helps protect against all forms of malnutrition, as well as against noncommunicable diseases. The nutritional and energy intake must follow nutritional norms, for example energy intake must be adapted to expenditure. To avoid excessive weight gain, fat should not exceed 30% of total energy intake\nObjective. The goal of this study was to compare energy consumption, macronutrients and selected minerals in food rations consumed by students at university campus and at home.\nMaterials and Method. The subjects were chosen at random from among volunteer students from Hassan II University in Casablanca. A sample of 130 students (54 women and 76 men) aged 18 to 25, participated in this study. Anthropometric measurements were performed to assess general characteristics, and records of one-day food intakes at university and at the parental home were performed by 24-hour food diary, and as well as conducting face-to-face. Variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to check the normality of data.\nResults. In accordance with the body mass index classifications, 69.5% of male university students and 77.7% of female were in normal weight categories. The overweight classes were 25.1% and 5.6%, respectively, for men and women.\nAssessment of the energy and nutritional intakes of university and home meals shows that students consume more calories, protein, carbohydrates, sodium, potassium, and iodine at home than at university, but these contributions remain insufficient in relation to the RDAs. Students consume more fat, especially saturated fatty acids, at university than at home. More than half of students exceed the recommended daily recommendations for saturated fatty acids.\nConclusion. These results indicate that a university students’ diet is influenced by their behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge. Hence the importance of nutrition education, based on what foods to consume rather than what foods to avoid, a societal issue that requires a multidisciplinary, multisectoral and culturally appropriate approach.</jats:p>",

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is designed to construct the credit risk measurement model of supply chain finance. Considering the characteristics of SVM model, we select the clustering center based on K-Means clustering algorithm and the edge points far from the clustering center as training samples to train the SVM model. Experimental results show that compared with single SVM model, the overall classification accuracy of K-means-SVM model is increased by 7.2%, and the first type error rate is reduced by 5.0%, which verifies the superiority and effectiveness of k-means-SVM model applied to enterprise credit risk assessment under supply chain finance mode.</jats:p>"

The effect of type of acid, coagulant dose, time and pH on the coagulation characteristic were investigated. Synthetic turbid water was used for the tests. The coagulants were treated with H2SO4 (SSCBA) and HCl (HSCBA). A 6% m/v solid loading (S/L) of HSCBA reduced turbidity by 97.7% whilst an 8% m/v S/L of SSCBA reduced turbidity by 90.9%. Both coagulants exhibited hindered, transition and compression settling characteristics, however HSCBA had faster settling pattern. Turbidity reduction was best in the 6–10 pH range where there was over 90% turbidity reduction from an initial synthetic turbid water of 110 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). Both coagulants were tested against natural highly turbid river water, and it was shown that only the HSCBA could reduce turbidity from 1,644 NTU to 2 NTU over 100 min. It was also shown that an overflow rate allowance of 0.01 cm/s could achieve 90% turbidity reduction using HSCBA when type 1 settling used for empirical calculations. The use of HSCBA was also shown to result in an insignificant amount of residual pH, Fe, Cu and Zn in the treated water. This therefore makes the use of HSCBA favorable in that it does not change the chemistry of the treated water.</jats:p>"

Consequently, the question of whether government subsidies for remanufacturing process innovation will stimulate improvement in this area and thus affect the closed-loop supply chain is worth discussing. To answer this question, we establish a closed-loop supply chain model consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, taking into account both remanufacturing process innovation and government subsidy. This is done in order to explore the impact of remanufacturing process innovation on the closed-loop supply chain from the perspective of government subsidies. Moreover, the government subsidizes the manufacturer according to the improvement of remanufacturing process innovation levels. Specifically, we analyze the optimal decisions and the social welfare in two models—the benchmark model without government subsidy, and the government subsidy model. Our main findings are threefold. The optimal decisions of the two models vary with the proportion of new products’ production cost and remanufactured products’ production cost. The government subsidy for process innovation does not necessarily improve the profits of the manufacturer, the retailer, and the supply chain system. Moreover, there is a threshold; the government subsidy can hurt the retailer’s profits, and the retailer has no motivation to participate in the sale of new products when the government subsidy is below that threshold. The government subsidy for process innovation does improve overall social welfare and has a lesser environmental impact. The conclusions are also verified by numerical analysis.</jats:p>"

To ascertain such assimilative capacity of the river system, various water quality models (WQMs) were studied. Out of numerous WQMs, six models including QUAL2Kw, WASP, SWAT, SIMCAT, MIKE-11, and CE-QUAL-W2 were selected and studied on the basis of their development, characteristics, capabilities and strengths, model input, governing equations, application, assumptions and limitations. A comparison based on such a study showing input variables and data, assumptions and limitations, strengths, and specific characteristics has been carried out and tabulated. While the selection of a model is based on the problem for which the decision-making is to be done. Of all the models, QUAL2Kw and WASP have been found to be advantageous over the rest. For a complex river system, a single model may not work and in such cases, a combination may be tried. A model finally selected for a problem must be calibrated so as to have minimum errors and maximum accuracy.</jats:p>",

In an effort to better understand the mechanism behind nappe oscillation, an experimental investigation was conducted using a linear weir (1.83 m wide, 1.10 m in height, and 0.076 m in thickness) with four different crest shapes (rectangular, quarter-round upstream, half-round, and quarter-round downstream) at a wide range of unit discharge ranging from 8×10−3 m2/s to 36×10−3 m2/s. Using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques, differential pressure measurements, and water surface profiles, the influence of Weber number, angle at which the nappe hits the downstream pool (angle of impact), and nappe projection angle on the nappe oscillation are reported. No significant relationship was found between the Weber number and nappe instability. The results suggest that the nappe is stable for unit discharge between 20×10−3 and 24×10−3m2/s regardless the shape of the weir crest. Also, the stable projection angle is −17° for rectangular and quarter-round upstream weirs and −35° for half-round and quarter-round downstream weirs for the specific tested weir.</jats:p>",

This leads to an increase in the need to develop an immutable, trustworthy, transparent and accountable system, more advanced than PSC. The main loophole in the current PSC system is drug changes ownership over every transaction making it hard to trace before it reaches the customer. In the current system, nodes do not exchange information, manufacturing doesn't know what happens to the product, and visibility to regulatory authorities is near zero, recalls are complicated and costly. Problems like traceability, visibility, and security in the current drug delivery systems are explained in this review paper, and methods to solve them are elaborated in the same. Drugs produced by manufacturers can be traced from manufacturing to delivery to the patient and after the administration for survey purposes also. The proposed system will also make it possible to retrieve and store data of patients for future statistics.

The two scenarios are the brand owner opening showrooms (B) or e-tailer opening (E). the authors evaluate the impact of brand spillover, platform spillover, and offline experience spillover effects on the optimal choice to open showrooms. The results indicate that the conditions of brand owners opening showrooms for win-win are richer and more relaxed than the e-tailer. This requirement for spillovers reflects different motivations for opening showrooms. Moreover, regarding the inroad into showrooms, the brand owner and e-tailer should be cognizant of the trade-off between brand and platform spillover and willing to open showrooms in appropriate conditions.</p>",

Given Russia’s constant claims to our independence, it is clear that a guaranteed supply of drinking water to the population is as important a factor in its security as a strong modern army. Considering the existing means of emergency water supply and water treatment (imported water, mobile treatment plants designed to prepare existing water sources, pumping stations, etc.) we can conclude that the most secure and sustainable source of drinking water is groundwater. For better protection and access to water, even during street fights, it is proposed to equip local well water intakes with autonomous power supply, designed for 2.0-3.5 thousand users, with compact installations for water purification and disinfection. The organization of such a network has at least five problematic components: 1 — resource - the availability of the required amount of water, 2 — quality - the availability of drinking water sources; 3 — safety - sufficiently high protection of the water source from external influences; primarily from qualitative and quantitative depletion and targeted sabotage; 4 — financial and economic; 5 — energy supply. Separate water supply and sewerage networks for drinking and technical water should be introduced. The drinking water supply system should be arranged in the form of a well-protected local water supply, and domestic and technical water supply should be left centralized. Flow rates of drinking water intakes should be calculated based on human needs for drinking water per day: 1.5-2.0 dm3 for drinking plus 4-5 dm3 for cooking. It is proposed to use renewable energy sources for autonomous energy supply of boreholes. The experience of the Russian-Ukrainian war shows that all other options for drinking water supply to the population in conditions of military aggression are less protected, are unstable or temporary and have significant shortcomings. \n </jats:p>"

Ḥalāl supply chains can optimise British construction supply chains by promoting meticulous, qualitative and mutually reinforcing systems. The British construction sector has failed to overcome the inimical, inefficient, fractured and transactional attitudes (collectively, the “complexities”) pervading it and the supply chains beneath it. Construction SCM has been able to introduce change, but with limited profound effect. This is owed to its lack of human agency, proactive quality control systems, as well as other verification and assurance mechanisms. Introducing the Sharīʿa principles encapsulating ḥalāl food supply chains can offer the input needed to optimise current construction supply chains.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper adopts an integrative general review of the academic literature pertaining to the British construction sector, construction SCM, ḥalāl food supply chains, ḥalāl assurance and control processes. The extensive literature review is crucial because it will enable introducing “ḥalāl” to construction SCM, hence ḥalāl construction supply chain management (“ḤCSCM”). ḤCSCM will then be applied to one of the most recent British construction SCM systems to identify how ḤCSCM can complement existing systems.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The findings indicate that ḤCSCM can further alleviate the complexities thwarting the British construction sector on a supply chain level.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;div class=\"section abstract\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"htmlview paragraph\"&gt;Biomethane is a valuable alternative to fossil fuels, specifically in transport sector, contributing to “energy security” and “carbon neutrality”. Though at present, research has mainly invested in the automotive sector, the demand for alternative and low environmental impact fuels is growing. Hence, in the scope of energy transition, also in the agricultural sector machinery manufacturers have started developing the first solutions able to reduce the environmental impact of tractors. In addition, on-farm biomethane production would represents a great opportunity for the development of more “circular” systems producing renewable energy from “residual biomass” (e.g. livestock effluents, agricultural waste). Under this framework, the TOBIAS project, launched in 2020 and funded by the Piedmont Region (North-western Italy), is aimed to investigate the development and application of a biomethane supply chain for agricultural tractors engines. The project involves both industrial and academic partners: FPT Industrial, the project-leader, focusing on development and industrialization of the engines; STC srl, providing support to R&amp;amp;D; DIMSPORT srl, integrating engines and biomethane fuel systems; Torino Crea Engineering srl, specialized in the construction of special vehicles; Hysytech srl, skilled in gas treatment and recovery; CNR-STEMS, focusing on the assessment of the system sustainability and promoting the advancement and dissemination of knowledge and technologies. The project will lead to the development of two biomethane-powered prototypes, one wheeled and one crawler. The development will consist of: i) vehicle and engine components design; ii) engine construction and testing to identify optimal operating conditions; iii) tractors configuration for the use of compressed or liquefied biomethane; iv) field-tests to determine vehicle performance (power, torque, consumption, etc.) in real conditions; v) demonstration of the specialized biomethane-powered tractors while performing agricultural operation in a vineyard and on-farm refueling. In the present contribution, project framework, preliminary results and future implications are discussed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

The A Vuong is a large reservoir in Vietnam serving multiple purposes, including power generation, flood control, and downstream water supply. First, different flood control storage capacities (Vpl) are investigated, and the best one is chosen based on the criteria of power output and the reservoir's ability to fill up after each regulation cycle. That option is for Vpl to be 50, 30, and 10% of the active storage capacity in September, October, and November, respectively. The study also proposes new operating rule curves with various scenarios of different beginning water levels, ranging from 368 m to 380 m. The average lines of the operating rule curves are also suggested for easier and more efficient operation. Recommendations for using this operating rule curve, as well as its advantages compared to the current one, are also discussed. The results show that the proposed operating rule curves provide much better performance compared with the current in terms of increasing the power output, with a 3.1% increase, while also protecting other water uses.</jats:p>",

Quantitative data were collected from 46 primary health care units between April 01 and May 30, 2021. A stratified simple random sampling method was employed. Logistics records and reports, service registers, physical observation, and interviews of key informants were sources of data. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics such as mean, frequency, and percentages were used to present a result. Qualitative data concerning public health supply chain challenges were collected from key informants by using a semi-structured interview guide. It was analyzed manually using an inductive thematic approach and the result was narrated.</jats:italic>\n<jats:italic>Results: The study revealed that the public health supply chain performance of tracer drugs across primary health care units in the Gamo zone was low. Inventory management KPIs, LMIS report KPIs, and storage condition KPIs were below the national standard. Means of availability (64.8 %±14.8%), stocked according to plan (16.5%±9.5%), inventory accuracy rate (65%±17.2%), and stock out rate (64.9%±9.8%) of tracer drugs deviate from ideal. Likewise, the means of LMIS report accuracy rate (64%± 13.6%) and LMIS report completeness (80%±15) are below the standard. Only 81% of assessed primary health care units adhere to good pharmaceutical storage practices. In general, public health supply chain performance of tracer drugs decreases down the levels of primary healthcare units. LMIS reported quality; pharmaceutical distribution; storage condition; low access to public transportation; lack of supply chain workforce training and motivation; low dedicated budgeting and finance for logistics activity; and low support from management were reported as prevailing challenges.</jats:italic>\n<jats:italic>Conclusion:Inventory management, LMIS reporting, and storage practices are areas where gaps in public health program supply chain performance are identified. It leads to wastage and interruption of essential medicines, which affects the quality of healthcare delivery at each level of the primary healthcare units.</jats:italic></jats:p>"

Based on the provincial panel data of medical and health services, this paper constructed an evaluation index system and used the two-stage nested entropy method to measure the MHSS level of 31 provinces in China from 2005 to 2020. Then we used the standard deviation ellipse, Dagum Gini coefficient, β convergence model, kernel density estimation and Markov chain to investigate the spatial distribution, regional differences, and dynamic evolution of MHSS. According to the results of these analysis, the conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) In general, the MHSS level in China showed a significant up-ward trend from 2005 to 2020. However, the MHSS level among different provinces showed a non-equilibrium characteristic. (2) Regional comparison shows that the eastern region had the highest level, and the central region had the lowest level. The eastern and central regions presented polarization, while the western region showed unremarkable gradient effect. (3) During the period, the overall regional differences, intra-regional differences, and inter-regional differences of MHSS level all showed convergence. (4) The economic development, urbanization rate, fiscal self-sufficiency rate, and foreign direct investment had significant impacts on the convergence. (5) The provinces with high levels had the positive spillover effect. The findings of this paper provide theoretical supports for optimizing the allocation of health resources and improving the equity of MHSS.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, due to the pandemic, several food organizations have been prompted to rethink their strategies for the future. Although the literature on FSC research in the COVID-19 era is increasing, no attempt has been made to summarize this stream of research using bibliometric techniques. This paper fills this knowledge gap and looks at the current scholarly discourse around the FSC and COVID-19. Applying bibliometric techniques, 287 journal articles were extracted from Scopus and analyzed to determine the temporal evolution of FSC research, the most productive journals, researchers, countries, and the most relevant keywords and publications. To construct a keyword co-occurrence network and categorize the relevant literature, we used the computer program VOSviewer. The findings demonstrate the rapid expansion of FSC research during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the top authors, publications, and nations for scientific output were also determined. Keyword co-occurrence network and detailed qualitative analysis both illustrate that FSC research revolves around six main themes: the impact of COVID-19 on the FSC and agriculture, FSC resilience, food waste and insecurity, fisheries and aquaculture, blockchain technology, and governance and innovation. This study represents the first effort to map worldwide FSC research in the COVID-19 era and draw on a comprehensive collection of journal articles and bibliometric approaches. It offers academics, practitioners, and decision-makers a snapshot of the state of the art in the FSC field and points to where further research is needed.</jats:p>"

The tools and methodologies proposed by the supply-chain risk management (SCRM) literature are mostly based on experts’ judgments, their knowledge, and past data. The expert evaluation-based approach could be partly or fully replaced by AI solutions, increasing objectivity, impartiality, and impersonality, reducing sources of human mistakes, biases, and inefficiencies in SCRM. However, the transition from BA to AI in SCRM is not a self-contained process; though attractive as a vision, it is not straightforward as a management or implementation process. The purpose of this research is to explore and define the conceptual grounds for transitioning from BA to AI in SCRM. The conceptual SCRM structure, its AI suitability, and implementation terms are defined theoretically based on a literature review. A single, in-depth business case study is employed to explore the theoretically defined terms of AI-based SCRM implementation. The proposed conceptual AI-suitable SCRM structure is defined by five principal building blocks: risk events, risk-event indicators, data-processing rules and algorithms, analytical techniques, and risk event probability forecasts. The study concludes that the business environment meets AI-based SCRM-implementation terms of data existence and access. Since data on risk events and negative outcomes are limited for machine learning, experts’ experience and knowledge might be utilised to build initial rules and data-processing algorithms for AI.</jats:p>"

The article considers the issues of food provision for the hard-to-reach areas of the Yakut Arctic based on the survey of the municipal authorities in the Arctic regions of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) on the current situation and problems of food supply. In general, the issues of ‘northern delivery’ are most acute for the hard-to-reach territories of Russia. The article is based on the results of the expert survey - representatives of the municipal authorities in 10 out of 13 Arctic regions of Yakutia. According to the empirical data, in most settlements and villages of the Arctic regions of Yakutia, there are such problems as a shortage and a narrow list of provided products, their low quality and high prices, lack of food control, insufficient number of vegetable stores and warehouses. Due to the high food prices, the most vulnerable groups are poor citizens, among whom families with children prevail. Despite the average indicators of the economic access of food, the transport access to food in the Arctic regions of Yakutia is critically low. In these areas, the cost of a food basket in the consumer basket, on average for a five-year period, turned out to be significantly higher than the average for the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The food market of the Yakut Arctic is very specific, primarily due to the peripheral geographic location and the underdevelopment of the transport infrastructure. Significant volumes of food deliveries with the participation of the regional budget can only affect the minimum prices of products. The situation is aggravated by the lack of a unified legal framework and organizational structure for hard-to-reach territories; therefore, ensuring their food security requires additional research and special management decisions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Every neighbourhood must have access to clean water supply. Disturbances in the water supply may have negative effects on both the economy and public health. Currently there are various methods of filing a complaint to the local water supply distributor. Improper management of these complaints lead to slow responses to affected area, causing displeasure among the users. The aim of the research is to design and develop a web-based Water Supply Complaint Management System to assist users to file complaints related to water supply issues. The system was also designed to assist local authorities or water supply distributor company to properly manage complaints to act quickly. User acceptance testing is used to evaluate the proposed system after it has undergone numerous functional tests. The system was developed using the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the waterfall model was chosen for the methodology. Thirty respondents from Sibu, Sarawak, were chosen to participate in the testing phase and were asked to complete questionnaires that were divided into four categories, including user interface satisfaction, ease of use, usability, and functionality. According to the results of the evaluation, most of the respondents gave positive feedbacks towards the overall functionality of the proposed system. Therefore, it is hoped that all features provided by the proposed system will benefit all users, particularly those who frequently have water supply related issues in their community.</jats:p>"

The Fuzzy Logic-based Proportional plus Derivative Controller (FLPDC) is tuned, by implementing an adaptive scheme, which provides desired control action according to the process parameter variations. The electrical equivalent model of the respiratory system is developed, and the model is validated with the help of a Spirometer and MATLAB System Identification Toolbox. To build up this model, the respiratory tract is well thought out into four sections: the nasal cavity, trachea, bronchi, and finally, the alveolar sacs. Each of these sections is represented as a series of combinations of Resistance, Inductance, and Compliance. The control capability of the proposed AFLPDC is investigated on the derived respiratory model. The supply of the desired level of supplemental oxygen by AFLPDC to the patients suffering from the diseases like Bronchitis and Emphysema during respiratory dysfunction is observed in the MATLAB SIMULINK environment without human intervention. The response revealed by AFLPDC is compared with the responses of the conventional PD controller and the Fuzzy Logic-based PD controller (FLPDC).</jats:p>"

Inputs of erroneous data into the prediction process may result in inaccurate forecasts. In this respect, we intend to include machine learning models in business decision-making by forecasting product backorders while giving decision-makers greater flexibility, process clarity, and precision. This research predicts product backorders using neural network and naive bayes algorithms. This study demonstrates how our approach forecast backorder products before actual sales. The methodology described in this study can be applied to anticipate backorders in different supply chain scenarios. Nevertheless, the current work encompasses a real-life case study to test the proposed technique based on data acquired from a known e-commerce business in Tehran, Iran. Indeed, these two algorithms were executed once the data preparation stages were completed. Present research carried out different performance metrics on the dataset to evaluate the efficacy of our proposed neural network and naive bayes models.

In this paper, a system dynamics model is developed to simulate the impact of the pandemic on the FDI. Results showed that the level of force majeure condition and also the level of flexibility are two important factors that impact on the FDI and other important variables of the supply chain.

In a few decades, with the advancement of modern wireless communication equipment, there has been an increasing demand for low-power and robust communication systems for longer battery life. A sudden drop in power significantly affects the performance of the VCO. Supply insensitive circuit design is the backbone of uninterrupted VCO performance. Because of their important roles in a variety of applications, VCOs and phase locked loops (PLLs) have been the subject of significant research for decades.

A tuning frequency range of 1.47–1.81 GHz is achieved, which falls within the L-band frequency range. This frequency range is achieved by varying the control voltage from 0.0 to 0.8 V, which shows that the proposed ring VCO is also suitable for low voltage regions. The total power consumed by the proposed ring VCO is 14.70 mW, a remarkably low value using this large transistor count. The achievable value of phase noise is −88.76 dBc/Hz @ 1 MHz offset frequency, which is a relatively small value. The performance of the proposed ring VCO is also evaluated by the figure of merit, achieving −163.13 dBc/Hz, which assures the specificity of the proposed design.

Its water supply, water disposal, waste disposal, reclamation of sludge reservoirs, equipment repair, cleaning of oil sludge reservoirs is provided by LLC «PromVodoKanal». The main technological personnel are wastewater treatment operators, process plant operators, pumping plant operators, chemical analysis laboratory assistants, commodity operators. Their work is associated with exposure to harmful and / or dangerous production factors. Objective. Search and substantiation of laboratory markers of early health disorders in workers of water supply facilities of petrochemical enterprises. Materials and methods. Hygienic and clinical laboratory studies were carried out among workers of the main occupations of the «PromVodoKanal» station who have contact with various harmful derivative factors. A complex of hematological and biochemical research methods was used in the work. Results. A comparative analysis of the frequency of occurrence of deviations of hematological parameters from the norm in all examined (occupational) groups was carried out. A laboratory study showed that hematological parameters are characterized by an increased content of hemoglobin, erythrocytes, and hematocrit. Changes in the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and thrombocytes count, were detected in every fifth worker. Over the years of work, the share of workers with high levels of glucose and cholesterol increases markedly, the correlation of which reaches from 0.90 to 0.97. Limitations. The article has limitations on the scientific study of working conditions, as periodic medical examinations are carried out by occupational pathologists. Conclusions. Red blood values are specific markers of workers’ health problems and require special attention during periodic medical examinations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigated barley output supply response determinant factors in Ethiopia. An ARDL bound test approach was employed as a method using secondary data from 1981-2020. The study demonstrated that barley output supply was affected positively and significantly by zero-order lagged seasonal rainfall and crop growing period temperature. The study supports the findings of researchers who reported that warming temperature followed by an increase in the amount of rainfall had a positive impact on barley output supply. The positive impact of temperature was induced because of a rise in the ocean and earth’s surface average temperature, causing more evaporation that increases overall rainfall while reaching over the highland areas. Studies confirm that ENSO and moist winds coming from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans influence the occurrence of rainfall in the western, southeastern, central, and northern highlands of Ethiopia. The study further exhibited that CSMRF and CGPMT had a positive effect on barley output both in the long-run and short-run, implying that climate parameters have minimal effect on barley production. Non-climatic variables demonstrated that both lagged and current year’s producer prices had a positive significant effect on barley output supply in both the long-run and short-run, implying that barley output supply is highly responsive to any price incentive strategies announced before re-allocation of the area towards barley cultivation. Conversely, the study explored that the use of fertilizer in first-order lag had a negatively significant impact on barley output supply in both seasons; implying that increased use of fertilizer in lagged periods may reduce barley output as a result of inappropriate fertilizer application by farmers. The results generated by this study are a useful addendum to the repository of knowledge on the elasticity of crop supply at an aggregate level, which can be used in designing strategies and measures for the mitigation and adaptation of climate change.</jats:p>"

Dari hasil pemetaan jaringan distribusi menggunakan Value Stream Mapping terdapat 4 alternatif aliran pemasaran rempah jamu di Kabupaten Sumenep. Dari hasil survey diketahui bahwa petani cabe jamu menjual cabe jamu kering ke tengkulak atau pengepul berkisar pada harga Rp. 65.000/kg sampai Rp. 67.000/kg. Karena panjangnya mata rantai pasok distribusi cabe jamu, produk akhir dari penjualan cabe setelah melalui proses produksi yang dilakukan beberapa pengusaha industry jamu sampai mencapai harga Rp.150.000/kg – Rp.160.000/kg sampai pada konsumen akhir. Dari alternatif yang ada, aliran yang memiliki nilai efisiensi pemasaran tertinggi (0.35%) dan Biaya transaksi terendah (Rp. 527/Kg) adalah alternatif aliran ke 2 yaitu ( Petani – Pengepul – Industri Jamu – Konsumen).</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the green agricultural supply chain, consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, who are both altruistic towards consumers. Such consumer-oriented altruism is different from the widely adopted enterprise-oriented altruism, which only measures the altruistic behaviors among supply chain enterprises. In the approach of game theory, the optimal operational decision is obtained, and thereby the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability are described rationally and attained, respectively. The impacts of consumer-oriented altruism on the sustainability of the green agricultural supply chain are analyzed and compared in a systematic way. A case study is carried out before drawing conclusions and managerial implications. The findings can be concluded as follows. Firstly, consumer-oriented altruism changes the operational performance of the green agricultural supply chain by enhancing the green level of agricultural products, cutting down the pricing decisions and marginal profit of each supply chain enterprise. Secondly, consumer-oriented altruism simultaneously facilitates each dimension of sustainability to different extents, and economic sustainability is promoted the most prominently, whereas environmental sustainability is improved the least. Thirdly, the retailer’s consumer-oriented altruism always improves each dimension of sustainability more than the manufacturer’s altruism does, and the advantage in the economic dimension is the most significant, while that in the environmental dimension is the smallest.</jats:p>"

If carbon emission is left unchecked, we will face terrible consequences. Closed-loop supply chain operation is an effective way to improve economic and environmental benefits at the same time. This paper attempts to study the decision-making and recycling channel selection of CLSC under carbon allowance and carbon trading policies. This paper constructs a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer and a third-party recycler, and uses the Stackelberg game-theoretic method to decide variables such as the product price and recycling rate of CLSC under three recycling models. Through the analysis and comparison of the manufacturer’s profit of and the carbon emissions in different models, the following conclusions are drawn. (1) When the manufacturer recycles WEEE, the supply chain obtains the most profit. (2) When the retailer recycles WEEE, the carbon emissions of the supply chain are lowest. (3) The manufacturer tends to choose the M model, which is the manufacturer recycling model. The T model and the R model have little difference in carbon emissions. For easier management, the government prefers to choose the T model, which is the third-party recycler recycling model.</jats:p>"

The respondents (mostly managers, supervisors, specialists, advisors, and officers) were drawn from all levels of the HIV/AIDS supply chain sector and work, the majority from national and state levels, with significant experience and workable knowledge of supply chain management. The study revealed that perception towards capacity-building programs and workforce skills in supply chain management reflects reality and entails a good understanding of the HIV/AIDS supply chain management system, mean ± standard deviation score (3.695 ± 0.889 and 3.455±0.643) on a Likert scale of 1-5 (5-point scale) respectively. Reliability analysis was carried out, and Cronbach’s alpha (α) showed the questionnaire reached acceptable reliability, α = 0.886 (perception towards capacity building programs), and less reliable, α = 0.071 (perception towards workforce skills) in HIV/AIDS supply chain management. Inferential analysis revealed that socio-demographic characteristics such as age, years of experience, and job title/rank influence the perception of workforce skills in supply chain management (P&lt;0.05).

This store purchases goods from suppliers for the inventory of goods to be sold without knowing the available stock. This makes the inventory of goods to be sold by the store uncontrollable. The store records incoming and outgoing goods and transactions manually using paper so that data can be lost. The Umi Nala Shop has more than 200 resellers but is inactive and has ten suppliers to supply the goods sold. The sale of goods at the Umi Nala Shop is still offline, where customers come directly to the Umi Nala Shop. Marketing is carried out through social media networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. In carrying out its business, it is necessary to pay attention to inventory management to provide for consumer needs and control inventory when there is a high demand for goods. For the store to compete, it is necessary to implement Supply Chain Management (SCM) to integrate suppliers, warehouse manufacturing, and storage so that goods are distributed in the correct quantity at the right time, to minimize costs and provide satisfaction to consumers. The purpose of this study is to build an SCM application that can make it easier for stores to find out the amount of inventory to ensure the availability of goods.

Output-Based Aid funds predetermined project outputs unlike the conventional way of funding inputs. It serves to ensure prudent utilization of funds by shifting performance risk to the organization mandated to deliver services; it also does so by linking outputs to the ultimate payments; hence transparency during project implementation. The study sought to examine the influence of project initiation, project planning, project implementation, and project monitoring on the project performance of Output-Based Aid funded Sabasaba urban water supply project. The study adopted value chain and resource-based theories. A predictive correlation design was used. The target population was 56 employees drawn from Murang’a South Water and Sewerage Company which is the implementing agency for Sabasaba water supply project. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from the respondents. The study results were analysed using SPSS.  The study found that the project initiation had a statistically significant influence on the project performance.  The findings revealed that a unit change in the project initiation would lead to 0.404 changes in the project performance holding the other independent variables constant.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Article visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/-counters-/edu_01/0943/a.php\" alt=\"Hit counter\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

This article, therefore, provides a classification of the current literature on the use of big data analytics and provides insight from professionals in the field in relation to this topic. A well-established set of practical guidelines was used to design and carry out a systematic literature mapping. A total of 50 primary studies were analysed and classified, chosen from a sample of 5, 437 studies after careful filtering to answer six research questions. In addition, a survey was prepared and applied by professionals working in the area. In total, 25 professionals answered a questionnaire with eleven questions, ten of which seek to explore the importance of big data analytics for the areas of the supply chain addressed in this work, and one intends to list the three areas where BDA can be more shocking. More than 60% of the studies are directly linked to the area of chain management; most studies performed empirical studies but rarely classified or detailed methodological procedures; almost 50% bring models to optimize some process or forecasts for better decision-making; more than 50% of professionals working in the area believe that the processes where big data analytics can effectively contribute are related to inventory and stockout management. This study serves as a basis for further research and future work, as it reviews the literature, pointing out the main areas that are being addressed and making a relationship with understanding these areas in practice.</jats:p>",

Agriculture is the foundation of China’s national economy, and the Party Central Committee has always insisted on solving the “three rural issues” as the top priority of the work of the whole party. However, China’s agricultural foundation is weak, and the problem of unbalanced supply and demand structure of agricultural products still exists in agricultural development. With the development of blockchain, the application basis in the agricultural value chain has been established. At present, the research on the application of agricultural value chain financing is still in progress, but it is still in the initial stage. The integration of agricultural finance blockchain is low, and there are a series of problems. Extending blockchain technology to the financial area of agricultural value chains can help overcome the information barriers to traditional agricultural value chain financing and improve access to information resources for traditional agricultural value chains. The high cost of these value chains and inadequate financial management mechanisms remove bottlenecks in financing agricultural development. In this paper, we study the operation model and revenue distribution model of agricultural value chains using blockchain, analyze examples, and finally identify the basic elements of agricultural value chain financing based on sectoral chain technology. It provides theoretical support for the financing decision and production decision of each member of the agricultural supply chain, and it is hoped that the content and conclusions of the study can provide methodological reference and theoretical guidance for agricultural supply chain enterprises.</jats:p>",

The factors affecting labor supply can be divided into two main categories: internal factors, such as the features of households or individuals, and external ones. The average birth rate in Russia does not provide the full picture, since the regions are characterized by great differentiation. To take the latter into account, the absolute increase was calculated and the quartile grouping of regions was carried out. It should be noted that for all regions, a negative dynamic of absolute increases in birth rates persists. The aim of the work is to systematize internal factors influencing individual labor supply, and, with the factors taken into consideration, provide a microlevel assessment of the probability of an individual's economic activity. Methods.To study the influence of individuals’ sociodemographic characteristics on labor supply, the authors used pooled data of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey - Higher School of Economics (RLMS-HSE) for the 1994-2020 time period. Modeling was performed for the following demographics: (1) working-age able-bodied people; (2) student youth; (3) pre-retirees. Results.The results of the regression modeling revealed labor supply determinants for the selected population groups. Individual labor supply exhibits gender differences. A statistically significant negative effect on women's labor supply was found. The impact of secondary and vocational education differs significantly from that of primary education and has a positive effect on individuals’ economic activities. Family relations and children under 18 serve as constraining factors for individual labor supply. Regarding economic individual characteristics, a positive correlation was confirmed between individual labor supply and people’s incomes, as well as peculiarities of labor supply in specific fields of activity. The empirical outcomes show that the key external factor determining labor supply in Russia is the birth rate, which is declining both nationally and in all individual regions of the country. A negative trend in this process is the growing inequality among the regions, as well as the clustering of territories with low birth rates. The modeling results revealed the determinants of the probability of being economically active, which include settlement type, gender, age, income, education, occupation, presence of children, and marital status. Conclusion. The findings of the study are scientifically relevant for understanding labor supply decisions in Russia and formulating the policy in this area. Firstly, more attention should be given to disadvantaged groups. Secondly, if the gap between the opportunities of different social groups in the labor market continues to grow over the long term, it will impede sustainable economic development. Therefore, there is a need to regulate the labor market and protect the labor rights of vulnerable populations.</jats:p>",

However, if not coupled with quantitative results, this may be overestimated. The present paper proposes a general method used in the specific case of deep environmental evaluation of a swimming goggles distribution. The results are compared to the consumers’ perceptions, collected and analyzed from questionnaires, and the remaining product lifecycle stages, assessed through the life cycle assessment (LCA). The design and prototyping phases take place in Italy, the goods are manufactured in Asia, and further commercialized worldwide. The environmental analysis enabled the identification of the most impacting lifecycle phases. Results highlight that for small products, with a simple use phase like the goggles, the distribution phase retains a small percentage of the overall environmental impact; thus, it is reasonable to simplify the modeling of the supply chain by selecting a limited number of significant scenarios. This work proves how important is to quantify and rationalize the environmental impacts of a complex system. The end of life and transport phases are perceived as high impacting, but the life cycle assessment analysis reveals that the materials and manufacturing phases retain the highest impacts and are the first that should be improved. Consequently, proper dissemination, cooperation, and communication strategies should be carried out by the goggles brand toward suppliers and stakeholders; the company is now studying how to replace virgin materials with recycled content to lower the environmental impact without hampering the product’s performance.</jats:p>",

An escape room training experience was used to allow participants from minority communities, emergency response planners, and policy makers to engage each other in a collective learning experience.

The results showed that high information asymmetry between company management and shareholders encourages managers to reduce dividend payments for the purpose of providing company capital and production activities. Furthermore, the existence of institutional ownership supports managers' policies and prefers that company profits should be used to supply capital, not be distributed to shareholders. This finding is consistent with the pecking order theory and also implicates the need for a corporate governance system to be improved to give better protection to the investors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The article identifies and summarizes ways to solve the problem of excess money supply on the eve and during the monetary reform. Evaluation of the effectiveness of solving this problem was carried out using a wide range of criteria (economic, social, propaganda-psychological, international and military-political). In general, in this aspect, the topic has not been previously studied enough.\n\nMaterials and Methods. The study has been carried out on the materials of the central archives, collections of published documents and statistics, as well as on the data of the central periodical press, works and memoirs of the top Soviet leadership. Taking into account the interdisciplinarity of the topic, a set of methods has been involved: general scientific and special scientific. The main methodological principles of this study are historicism, scientific objectivity, consistency, principles of dialectics.\n\nResults. In the course of the study, the issue of the post-war reduction in the money supply and putting money circulation in order has been characterized. When considering the implementation of the monetary reform, the desire of the state to be able to strengthen control over the movement of cash in new money has been traced. The solvent demand of the population was limited, which in turn allowed the state to more easily ensure the saturation of the consumer market. Carrying out the exchange of money, together with the abolition of the card system and the reduction in retail prices, mitigated the negative social effect from the loss of part of the savings by the population.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion. Before the monetary reform, measures were taken to withdraw money from circulation. As a result of the reform, the cash supply decreased by more than three times. It can be seen from the survey data that, having carried out exchange measures, the state was in no hurry to immediately issue a sufficient amount of new money into circulation, leaving room for maneuver to regulate the volume of money supply. Despite the obvious confiscatory and contradictory nature of the monetary reform, it can be stated that its main financial and economic goal was achieved – it was possible to successfully solve the problem of post-war stabilization of monetary circulation and ensure the transition to a stable peaceful economy.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the present research aims to determine the causality among the crucial drivers of resilient and sustainable supply chain management (RSSCM) in construction projects. Based on the literature review, 12 enablers of RSSCM were shortlisted. Using the systems thinking (ST) approach, this article portrays the interrelation between the 12 shortlisted resilience enablers crucial for sustainability in construction projects. The causality and interrelationships among identified enablers in the developed causal loop diagram (CLD) show their dynamic interactions and impacts within the RSSCM system. Based on the results of this study, agility, information sharing, strategic risk planning, corporate social responsibility, and visibility are the key enablers for the RSSCM. The findings of this research will enable the construction managers to compare different SCs while understanding how supply chain characteristics increase or decrease the durability and ultimately affect the exposure to risk in the construction SCs.</jats:p>"

To ensure food safety, a system is needed to make it easier for consumers to trace the origin of beef. This study discusses the infrastructure design of an information technology (IT) based beef supply chain traceability system. The design is carried out with a systems approach, where system requirements are identified based on the characteristics of the supply chain. The system modelling concept uses Unified Modelling Language (UML) and Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram combined with the Computer Based Information System (CBIS) concept to design a traceability system in the beef supply chain.

Therefore, collaboration of third party logistics (3PL) and fourth party logistics (4PL) companies were analyzed using a survey and the inductive organizational gap-analysis. The supply-chain companies of the 3PLs asked for better quality information from client factories for improving logistics. They also needed online information for improving the quality control of logistics provided by their subcompanies. In addition to the quality, all companies (3PL, 4PL, clients) will need new information technology for synchronizing supply-chain operations efficiently. In this respect, the findings show how 3PLs want to adopt 4PL’s coordination mechanism for creating advanced collaboration on triadic relationships of the companies. This knowledge can be used by industry in engineering the 3PL and 4PL towards franchise-provided multiclient supply chains; cloud-service applications of collaboration groups for synchronizing wood-harvesting and transportation operations are especially important in the future. Implications of this background theory for practice are discussed mainly from perspective of decentralized wood procurement.</jats:p>",

This place stands out for the predominance of the water element in several structures of the villa, highlighting the balneum and the large natatio, one of the largest known in Roman Hispania. The records of the initial excavations that took place since 1967 do not allow the establishment of clear functionalities of the villa. The University of &amp;Eacute;vora, owner of the site, conceived an action plan for the requalification and enhancement of the archaeological site. One of the tasks aims to investigate using Applied Geophysics. This work analyses the landscape directly related to the villa, given that it is in the flooded area of a river, with a Roman containment dam. It is uncertain whether the water supply comes from this structure or other nearby springs. The use of ground-penetrating radar, combined with unnamed aerial vehicles, all integrated in a geographic information system, allows us to know the location of underground water connections and create a topographic model with high resolution. Considering all the information, we propose a model for the water transport inside the villa and estimate the location of the water supply.</jats:p>"

Selected methods of descriptive statistics, substitution calculation and descriptive and comparative analysis were used to compile the numerical data. In the summary, it is concluded that the main market factor contributing to the reduction of the country’s physical self-sufficiency in plant protein is the progressive globalisation processes that are seen in Poland both in the sphere of feed production and in pig rearing. It was also recognised that European Union policy measures such as the “Agricultural Green Deal” strategy could result in an increase in the volume of domestically produced protein crops in Poland, which would increase the country’s security of supply of plant protein for feed purposes. It was also stated that in view of the ineffectiveness of market-based measures in developing protein crop production in the country, the government could intervene to introduce a plant protein indicator target to activate the market for this raw material.\n\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In view of increasing supply chain disruption events, for example the China–United States trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia–Ukraine war, the complexity and dynamicity of global freight management keeps increasing. To build a resilient and sustainable supply chain, industrial practitioners are eager to systematically revamp the freight management decision process related to the selection of carriers, shipping lanes, and third-party logistics service providers. Therefore, this study aims at strengthening decision-making capabilities for global freight management, in which an industrial blockchain-based global freight decision framework (IB-GFDF) is proposed to incorporate consortium blockchain technology with the Bayesian best-worst method. Through the blockchain technology, pairwise comparisons can be conducted over the international freight network in a decentralized and immutable manner, and thus, a secure and commonly agreed-on pairwise comparison dataset is acquired. Subsequently, the pairwise comparison dataset with multi-stakeholder opinions is analyzed using the Bayesian best-worst method in order to prioritize the selection decision criteria related to carriers, shipping lanes, and 3PL service providers for global freight management. To verify the methodological feasibility, a case study of an Australian agricultural supply chain firm was conducted to support the development end-to-end (E2E) supply chain solutions originated from Australia. It was found that port infrastructure, ports of call and communication effectiveness were the major criteria for the selection decision, which can be emphasized in future global freight collaboration. In addition, an immutable and append-only record of pairwise comparisons can be established to support the visibility of time-varying stakeholders’ preferences.</jats:p>"

Sustainable water supply systems should provide an adequate quantity and quality of water for a given demand without compromising future capacity to expand that volume and superiority. Water frameworks in the realm of sustainable progress must not include exploitation of water in the strict sense, but must include frameworks in which the use of water is generally required. Water is accordingly at the center of climate change adaptation as it is the central link between the climate system, mortal society and the environment. For Somalia, water is the mainstay of social, economic, and environmental growth and component. Nevertheless, the increasing pressure on water and the associated disaster is a growing problem. Somalia is a water scarce country with just 411 cum of renewable freshwater per capita (as of 2017 [01]) (World Bank, 2020). This is a glaring decline over time from 2,087 cum in 1962 [2] (ibid.) and far below the initial figure of 1,000 cum per capita per time advocated by UN. In the face of rapid population growth, the deteriorating superiority of groundwater resources due to overexploitation, overpopulation, and pollution poses an additional challenge. In addition, these threats are exacerbated by climate change, which has manifested itself in alternating waterfalls and water scarcity. As the mean periodic water decline is projected to increase by 1%, 3%, and 4% by 2030, 2050, and 2080, respectively [3] (using the 1981-2000 reference period) (FGS, 2015), and combined with increasing variability, more severe failures and cataracts are expected in the coming years. Climate change, environmental degradation, and the increasing struggle for scarce water, strained rangelands, and other natural reserves are the main causes of insubstantiality, degradation, risky poverty, and food insecurity.</jats:p>"

This is magnified by hazardous products that can contaminate the environment, such as lead, as well as the people involved in their production processes. Through an exploratory study of multiple cases, we analyzed the Brazilian lead-based vehicle battery chain by investigating two main manufacturers, two recycling companies, and eight distributors/retailers. The aim of the study was to analyze the relationships between the actors in the lead acid battery chain and identify the mechanisms that induce recycling programs, and to propose an explanatory framework. The results indicate that although the sustainability strategies of OEMs are implemented by regulatory mechanisms, the impacts of these strategies cascade among all agents in the supply chain, promoting a convergence between actions and relationships between actors from the perspective of the triple bottom line, highlighting variables for each dimension (economic, social, and environmental). The study contributes to the consolidation of the triple bottom line concepts in the lead acid battery production chain and presents managerial implications for sustainability management.</jats:p>"

In this regard, the need to continuous investment in logistics system maturity assessment and development has been identified. This research article analyzes existing maturity assessment models for business systems, summarizes these models, and discusses their potential transformation under the influence of digitalization. The importance of evaluating maturity levels is highlighted through existing research but emphasizes that merely identifying maturity levels is insufficient, as improvements are necessary following the evaluation. Moreover, existing models that evaluate maturity levels need to improve accounting for industry-specific contexts and provide specific quality indicators rather than focusing on the description of maturity levels. The article aims to develop the theoretical and methodological foundations for the logistics system maturity in integrated supply chain evaluation and provide a framework for organizations to identify areas for improvement with the Logistics 4.0 paradigm. The article's hypotheses suggest that improving such factors as digital transformation, supply chain integration, organizational culture, strategic alignment, human capital, workforce development, partnerships, and collaborations can enhance the maturity level of logistic systems, leading to improved supply chain performance, but some barriers and challenges need to be overcome with the fourth industrial revolution achievements. The mutual influence of the described hypotheses highlights three key areas for evaluating logistics maturity: the level of formalization within the integration process, the maturity of individual participants, and the utilization of opportunities provided by the fourth industrial revolution. The interpretation of integrated logistic system maturity level has been given.  The article provides a comprehensive interpretation of the maturity level of integrated logistics systems, which are proposed to identify based on the developed hierarchical model of fuzzy inference. Under the fuzzy model, indicators for assessing different aspects of logistic maturity have been offered, and response scenarios to maturity assessment results have been developed.</jats:p>"

Three channel power structures (vertical Nash, manufacturer Stackelberg, and retailer Stackelberg) and three pricing sequences (simultaneous pricing, manufacturer pricing early, retailer pricing early) are considered. Counter-intuitively, under the manufacturer Stackelberg structure, the retailer has a first-mover advantage and retailer-pricing-early achieves Pareto optimality. In the other cases, the manufacturer and the retailer have a late-mover advantage. Under the vertical Nash structure, both parties may get into a prisoner’s dilemma. Extending the basic model to dynamic pricing, we found that the first mover of sequential pricing has better stability. The retailer Stackelberg structure has better stability than the vertical Nash structure and the manufacturer Stackelberg is the most unstable power structure. To avoid the negative impact of equilibrium price instability, the vertical and horizontal price matching mechanisms are proposed and the effectiveness in improving stability is proved.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Contrary to developed countries, developing countries have been observed to have an increased reliance on a diversity of water supply options to meet their daily demands, where formal supply systems are incapable of fulfilling the daily needs of consumers. In filling a demand-supply gap, informal supply systems are increasingly being associated with issues of long-term sustainability, higher consumer cost, and inequity. Emerging formal-informal dynamics in developing countries require a thorough understanding of complex human-water interactions for policy direction, in order to best support the advancement of urban water sustainability. Accordingly, system archetypes offer a platform to explain the behaviors of complex systems. This paper identifies common system archetypes that define urban waterscapes in the developing world. In this way, Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) are used to present relationships and identify common archetypes that define the complexity of urban water supply systems in Hyderabad, Pakistan. These archetypes include ‘fixes that fail’, ‘shifting the burden’, ‘limits to growth/success’ and ‘growth and underinvestment’. These archetypes demonstrate that increases in formal infrastructure capacity and the number of informal suppliers to increase supply reliability are symptomatic solutions, restrained by financial and technical resources, and thus have unintended consequences. Further, a number of policy instruments are discussed as leverage points to achieve financial sustainability of formal systems. This paper emphasizes the need of a policy framework for informal supply system in national and regional water policies to ensure its service reliability as a short to medium term solution.</jats:p>",

The study is based on a sample of complete financial statements from 2011 to 2018 from the agro-food organisations. The authors prove that the retail sale sector generates high shareholder value. Contrary to that, the wholesale sector´s shareholder value deteriorated over the respective period owing to reinforced capital intensity measures, resulting in low profitability. A special case is primary agricultural production, where the low shareholder value is offset by public transfers influencing all value drivers either directly or non-directly. These constantly changed, both in the single sector and financial supply chain, thus concluding the latter is dynamic in its nature. The primary agricultural production (Agro) faced specific conditions due to significant public transfers in the form of subsidies etc., thus influencing non/directly all shareholders´ value drivers and consequently reducing the originally expected vulnerability. The authors have found that the shareholder value is not generated and distributed evenly within the Czech Agro-Food supply chain; therefore, the “scissors” are expending in favour of the Retail sector at the expense of the others, especially of the Agro sector.</jats:p>",

Taking inventory strategy into account, the optimization model of distribution node location and the node importance evaluation system are developed. The planning of cold chain supply inventory for cross-border e-commerce is studied based on an optimized management inventory.

The study was conducted using primary data collected from SME management personnel from the three countries. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data using a 5-point Likert scale. The data was analyzed using multi-group Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results of the study indicated that supply chain management practices and operations adopted by the small and medium enterprises in Thailand, Slovakia, and Poland were invariant. The environmental sustainability elements in SCM and the social aspects of sustainability in SCM have positively influenced SCM practices in all countries. The study recommended that SMEs in the countries should consider adopting the factors that support SCM, operationalizing the SCM through enhancing the capabilities of the end-user, and vitally taking into consideration the environmental sustainability elements in SCM, such as environmentally-friendly production processes, taking action towards waste management, and adopting production processes that inhibit the emission of harmful substances into the atmosphere by encouraging the implementation of policies that foster the use of renewable energy sources in production.</jats:p>",

The value is 74 basis points if their suppliers experienced a CDS up-jump event. The corresponding three-day CASC values are –36 and –38 basis points, respectively, for firms whose customers and suppliers, respectively, experienced an extreme CDS down-jump event (a favorable credit shock). These effects are approximately twice as large for adverse credit shocks originating from natural disasters. Credit shock propagation is absent in inactive supply chains and is amplified if supply chain partners are followed by the same analysts. Industry competition and financial linkages between supply chain partners, such as trade credit and large sales exposure, amplify the shock propagation along supply chains. Strong shock propagation persists through second and third supply chain tiers for adverse shocks but attenuates for favorable shocks. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental and processing contaminants generated by both spontaneous and anthropogenic incomplete combustion processes of organic matter. Contamination of PAHs in vegetable oils can result from several factors and processes, including environmental contamination, oil processing, and migration from food contact materials. The determination of PAHs in edible oil presents a challenge because of the complexity of the matrix. Since PAHs are present at lower levels than triglycerides, it is necessary to isolate the compounds of interest from the rest of the matrix. To this purpose, a new purification approach based on a double solid-phase extraction (SPE) step followed by high performance liquid chromatography–fluorometric detector (HPLC-FLD) analysis was developed. The method involves a first purification step by using a 5 g silica SPE cartridge, previously washed with dichloromethane (20 mL), dried completely, and then conditioned with n-hexane (20 mL). The triglycerides are retained by the silica, while the PAH-containing fraction is eluted with a mixture of n-hexane/dichloromethane (70/30, v/v). After evaporation, the residue is loaded on a 5 g amino SPE cartridge and eluted with n-hexane/toluene (70/30, v/v) before HPLC-FLD analysis. The focus was the evaluation of the contribution of the various phases of the pomace oil supply chain in terms of the heavy PAHs (PAH8) concentration. Data collected showed that pomace contamination increased (by 15 times) as storage time increased. In addition, the process of pomace drying, which is necessary to reduce its moisture content before solvent extraction of the residual oil, appeared to significantly contribute to the total heavy PAHs content, with increases in value by up to 75 times.</jats:p>"

Through synthesising and integrating the extant research, the study develops a taxonomy of types of inter‐organisational justice in SCRs (i.e., relationship overall justice, relationship dimensional‐based justice, event overall justice and event dimensional‐based justice). The review also identifies and discusses three main themes (and subthemes) of the existing research, including antecedents (i.e., governance mechanism, governance design, breach of contract and relationship power), outcomes (i.e., attitudinal, behavioural and performance) and boundary conditions (i.e., relationship and environmental) of inter‐organisational justice in SCRs.

With transaction costs theory as our lens, we examine how international geographically and culturally distant purchasing and supply management (PSM) teams control emerging economy suppliers with formal management controls. We use interview survey data on 339 international customer-Chinese supplier relationships using supplier perceptions of the extent to which performance measurement and monitoring practices are used by their primary customer in the purchase reorder decision and control. The results demonstrate that the cultural and, to a lesser extent, geographical distance between the customer and the supplier is associated with more extensive use of formal management controls. Also, we find the relationship between geographical or cultural distance and the importance of performance measurement is strengthened for suppliers of complex components.</jats:p>",

The NMDB precipitation results from weather systems ranging from thunderstorms to larger scale events. The larger scale events exhibit high seasonal and annual rainfall variability. To detect attributes shaping the NMDB precipitation patterns, and hence net water inflows to the vast Darling River catchment area, numerous (45) possible attributes were assessed for their influence on rainfall trends. Four periods were assessed: annual, April–May (early cool-season), June–September (remaining cool-season), and October–March (warm-season). Linear and non-linear regression machine learning (ML) methods were used to identify the dominant attributes. We show the impact of climate drivers on the increasingly dry April–May months on annual precipitation and warmer temperatures since the early 1990s. The NMDB water supply was further reduced during 1992–2018 by the lack of compensating rainfall trends for the April–May decline. The identified attributes include ENSO, the Southern Annular Mode, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and both local and global sea surface temperatures. A key finding is the prominence of global warming as an attribute, both individually and in combination with other climate drivers.</jats:p>"

Perennial Ryegrass, Common Sainfoin, and Lucerne are not attractive crops for the supply chain of renewable gases. The earned revenue is too small to cover the costs of cultivation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Enterprise competition has been transformed into chain-to-chain competition, and green development is imperative under the promotion of policies. Horizontal cooperation between green and non-green manufacturers provides a new direction for the supply chain to improve its core competitiveness. This paper develops competition and cooperation models between two manufacturers for the green and non-green supply chain under two-way government intervention to explore the impact of manufacturers’ horizontal cooperation on decisions and profits of supply chain members. In particular, for a situation without cooperation, we consider a Stackelberg game between two manufacturers. Model solutions and numerical analysis have shown that: 1) Cooperation among manufacturers can not only improve their own profits, but also strengthen environmental welfare. However, cooperation will damage consumer surplus. 2) When consumers are more sensitive to product prices, manufacturers’ cooperative behavior is not conducive to retailers, but with the improvement of consumer environmental awareness, retailers will gradually support their upstream cooperation. 3) Under the simultaneous implementation of government subsidy and punishment strategies, whether green consumption can be promoted is related to the adjustment factor of government subsidies, while the relationship between the green level floor for subsidy and product greenness is affected by the adjustment factor of subsidies and manufacturers’ cooperation. 4) The impacts of fierce price competition and green level competition on supply chain members are opposite; when the price competition is moderate or the green level competition is weak, the manufacturers’ cooperation is also beneficial to the improvement of retailers’ profits. This provides ideas for the development of green supply chain, and provides a reference for the implementation of two-way government intervention policy.</jats:p>"

Although various gas plasma instruments have been developed, studies on prion inactivation using gas plasma instruments are limited. Among them, the hydrogen peroxide gas plasma instrument, STERRAD® (Advanced Sterilization Products; ASP, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Irvine, CA, USA), is recommended for prion inactivation of heat-sensitive medical devices. However, STERRAD® is not a plasma sterilizer but a hydrogen peroxide gas sterilizer. In STERRAD®, plasma generated by radio frequency (RF) discharge removes excess hydrogen peroxide gas and does not contribute to sterilization. This is also supported by evidence that the instrument was not affected by the presence or absence of RF gas plasma. However, recent studies have shown that other gas plasma instruments derived from air, nitrogen, oxygen, Ar, and a mixture of gases using corona, dielectric barrier, microwave, and pulse discharges can inactivate scrapie prions. As inactivation studies on prions other than scrapie are limited, further accumulation of evidence on the effectiveness of gas plasma using human-derived prion samples is warranted for practical purposes.</jats:p>"

Third-party logistics service providers (3PLSP) are identified in such a way that they can help a firm fulfill its targeted objectives. The choice of 3PLSP must take into account broad selection criteria that are pertinent to both current and future needs. Various modelling techniques have been applied to evaluate and select 3PLSP. For the evaluation and selection of 3PLSP in the given set of situational requirements, a set of different selection criteria has been set up. This paper screens 191 articles from the Scopus database and finds 132 articles spread over two decades from 2001 to 2022 (30 July 2022). The 132 filtered articles are further assessed using bibliometric analysis, qualitatively and quantitatively. The identified research articles are studied and analyzed according to different bibliometric parameters, using MS Excel, VOSviewer version 1.6.17, and Biblioshiny 4.0. It has been found that the top five countries engaged in research are India (36%), Turkey (13%), Taiwan (12%), China (11%), and the USA (10%). The top three journals with the most research publications were International Journal of Logistics Systems and Management, Benchmarking, and Expert Systems with Applications. The three research methodologies most often used to solve 3PL selection problems were fuzzy-based, AHP, and TOPSIS. Numerous studies of theoretical models have applications in real-world situations. The developed selection models have high applicability in the automobile industry, agricultural industries, marine products, etc.</jats:p>"

In this modern medical era, vascular anatomy of the human hand has clinical importance in medical, surgical and radiological sciences. The intention of the current study is to determine the variations which occur as the radial artery branches thus making a contribution to the arterial supply of the index finger and the thumb. The study design was descriptive case series, carried out in the Department of Anatomy in King Edward Medical University from December 2018 to May 2019 on 30 cadaveric limbs. Vivisection of the cadaveric hands was performed following Cunningham’s Manual of practical anatomy. The origin and the course of RA, UA and MA were dissected and identified with further exploration of the blood supply of the index finger and the thumb. All details were entered in a predesigned proforma, and the dissected limbs were photographed. Data was analyzed to find the frequencies of superficial palmar arch as well as the arterial supply of thumb and index finger were also expressed in frequencies. Great variation was observed in the arterial supply to palmar aspect of index finger and thumb. Main contributing artery being radial artery in majority of cases through its common palmar or proper palmar branches arising from SPA or SPBRA. Ulnar artery and median artery were also observed to be supplying these areas in 6.6% and 3.3% cases respectively. The median artery when present was replacing the radial artery on palmar aspect of hand. The dorsum, however, was supplied by the princeps pollicis and the radialis indicis branches of radial artery in all the cases. We concluded that in about 1/3rd (11/30 are incomplete SPA) of our studied sample, arterial supply of the index finger and the thumb is highly dependent on radial artery and should any damage occur to it, vitality of these useful structures will be compromised.</jats:p>"

Owners and managers of Small and Medium Sized Businesses made up the observational unit. Using a stratified random selection approach, 97 respondents were chosen from the target demographic. &#x0D;\nFindings: According to the study, e-tendering had no appreciable impact on the performance of small and medium enterprises in Cape Town, South Africa. However, the performance of small and medium enterprises in Cape Town is significantly impacted by e-sourcing. E-invoicing also has a big influence on Cape Town's small and medium enterprises' performance. Additionally, e-payment has a big impact on Cape Town, South Africa's Small and Medium Enterprises' performance. &#x0D;\nConclusion: E-tendering has a marginally beneficial impact on Cape Town SMEs' performance. However, the majority of SMEs do not have an online system for managing supplier contracts that simplifies the tendering procedure. &#x0D;\nRecommendations: Small and medium-sized businesses should adopt and use e-tendering, according to the study's recommendations, to streamline the procurement process and reduce associated expenses. Additionally, small and medium-sized businesses should switch to electronic invoicing to save money on the costs of printing, storing, and shipping paper invoices. The report also suggests that all small and medium-sized businesses implement e-payment to boost productivity by increasing payment efficiency and lowering mistakes associated with cash transactions. Additionally, small and medium-sized businesses should use e-sourcing since it expands their access to a wide range of suppliers and speeds up the contract award process. </jats:p>"

However, the compensatory effects of P supply and planting density on maize (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.) growth and P use efficiency remain unknown. In this study, we conducted pot experiments of approximately 60 days to determine the effect of P supply, i.e., no P (CK), single superphosphate (SSP), and monoammonium phosphate (MAP), and different planting densities (low: two plants per pot; and high: four plants per pot) on maize growth. A similar shoot biomass accumulation was observed at high planting density under CK treatment (91.5 g plot<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>) and low planting density under SSP treatment (94.3 g plot<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>), with similar trends in P uptake, root morphological traits, and arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization. There was no significant difference in shoot biomass between high planting density under SSP (107.3 g plot<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>) and low planting density under MAP (105.2 g plot<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>); the corresponding P uptake, root growth, and P fraction in the soil showed the same trend. These results suggest that improved P supply could compensate for the limitations of low planting density by regulating the interaction between root morphological traits and soil P dynamics. Furthermore, under the same P supply, the limitations of low planting density could be compensated for by substituting MAP for SSP. Our results indicate that maize growth and P use efficiency could be improved by harnessing the compensatory effects of P supply and planting density to alter root plasticity and soil P dynamics.</jats:p>"

However, the low quantity of flushed sediment remains a drawback of pressure flushing. Experimentally, the present study used inclined plates upstream of the bottom outlet to increase the flushed sediment in pressure flushing. The variables included the plate width (B), the angel between the vertical line at the outlet center and the normal vector of the inclined plate (α), radial distance of the inclined plates from the orifice center (R), and outlet discharge (Q). The results showed that the flushed sediment significantly enhanced; the quantity of flushed sediment for B = 6.3 cm, α = 60°, R = 8.5 cm, and a Q = 8.34 L/s was 19 times as large as that in the reference test (i.e., without plates). Furthermore, the length, width, and depth of the scour cone in the presence of inclined plates were 3, 2.3, and 3.3 times as high as those in the absence of the inclined plates. Also, equations were developed to predict the volume and dimensions of the scour cone in the presence of inclined plates based on the experimental data. Finally, the importance of the variables was determined using a sensitivity analysis method. Between all considered parameters in this study, the plate distance from the outlet was found to have the highest effect and the plate inclination the lowest effect (three times) in increasing the flushed sediment through the orifice.</jats:p>",

By sorting out the stable conditions of each equilibrium point, the causes of the gap between supply and demand are analyzed to explore the coupling mechanism between financial means and market regulation. At last, a numerical case of actual background is applied to verify the rationality of the conclusions. The study found that: (1) The combination of government financial subsidies with the market mechanism is based on subsidies to ECEs. (2) The best time for the government to reduce financial subsidies to forest farmers is when the carbon quota is tightened and more industries are included in the carbon trading system; the best time for the government to reduce subsidies to ECEs is when the carbon quota tightening policy dominates. (3) The reasons for market imbalance in the early and late stages of forestry carbon neutralization mechanism development are different.</jats:p>"

Over the past decades, membrane technology has become very popular in providing potable water for mankind. However, old technologies (such as reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration) which are highly energy intensive are still very common in water treatment industries. In this review, the capability of low energy consumption membrane distillation (MD) technology is reviewed with emphasis on material development and energy requirement. We begin by reviewing the history of the MD process, configurations, module types, membrane materials, material fabrication methods, material properties, material modification techniques, application, and energy requirements. Factors which influence the performance of MD – both design and operating conditions – are then extensively discussed. Furthermore, we report desalination and wastewater treatment as the hottest areas of application where MD has gained significant interest. Membrane hydrophobicity and fouling resistance are identified as pivotal areas where improvement in MD performance is being sought. We then discuss various industries where MD is presently being applied. We conclude by highlighting the energy requirements of MD and identify solar energy as a renewable energy resource which could meet the energy requirement of MD technology. It is hoped that this review paper will foster interest in and provide insights on material development for membrane distillation application.</jats:p>",

The silt deposits have proven to be a good ameliorant for agricultural lands, provided they are of satisfactory quality. Bottom sediments, especially their fine alluvial fraction, accumulate various compounds and trace elements, including heavy metals. Analysis of the content of iron Fe, manganese Mn, cobalt Co, chromium Cr and determination of the integrated level of contamination of bottom sediments did not reveal their toxic contamination in the area of the village Kleshnivka and the village Petrykivka. Determination of \"geoaccumulation indices\" by G.M. Mueller allowed to classify the sediments of the Chaplinka River as unpolluted, and the man-caused load on the hydroecosystem as low. In compliance with the recommendations on the content of Mn grades in the soil cover of the obtained fifth Igeoclass, which provides heavy pollution and significant man-caused load on the hydroecosystem. To characterize the processes occurring in the hydroecosystem of the Chaplynka River, the bottom accumulation coefficient was calculated. The assessment of the ecological status of hydroecosystems revealed an overwhelming ecological emergency. There is a significant threat of deposits of iron Fe, manganese Mn in bottom sediments. Despite the low risk of contamination of bottom sediments with chromium Cr, the risk will increase due to the rather variable chemical composition of surface waters, and hence the possibility of an ecological crisis for the hydroecosystem. The sanitary condition of a small river could be improved by restoring its hydrological regime. The decrease in the efficiency of dredging works is related to the regulation of the regulation of the riverbed. In the vast majority of cases, hydraulic structures are not provided for or do not correspond to the current level regime of watercourses.

Blockchain technology (BCT) can facilitate coordination, but the cost and other hindrances have limited their application in disaster relief operations. Despite some studies, the existing literature does not provide a nuanced understanding of the application of blockchain technology to improve information alignment and coordination.

This task is responsibility of the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME), which has as challenges the implementation of renewable energy projects that allow diversifying the national energy matrix. For this reason, this paper proposes a support framework for multicriteria decision-making in the electricity supply of non-interconnected rural areas for the Colombian Caribbean Region. The multicriteria method of the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) was used, which allows the incorporation of a fuzzy triangular scale to improve the imprecision in the judgments made by experts. A hierarchical structure with 6 renewable energy alternatives, 4 criteria and 16 sub-criteria was designed, which allowed the implementation of a paired comparison survey that was answered by 10 experts from the region. The results obtained show the relevance of all alternatives, which is evidenced by a percentage difference of less than 5% between all the options. The best alternative was solar PV (20,27%). Regarding the criteria, the most relevant were economic (39,6%) and environmental (30,8%). The most relevant sub-criterion was the renewable fraction, related to the possible reuse of equipment (20,2%).</jats:p>"

The article shows that existing mathematical models of traction and external power supply joint operation have sounding limitations. These limitations almost exclude the possibility of their practical use. At the same time, when projecting a new electrification, it is required to choose the most efficient external power supply scheme. At the exploitation of existing electrified sections, the necessity arises to assess equalizing current value during repairs in external power supply networks and to adopt a decision on changing power supply and sectioning schemes. Corresponding model is required to solve these tasks. Methods: Analysis of existing mathematical models and computer programs for joint calculation for traction and external power supply networks. Development of three-phase PU-generator models on the basis of EMF source behind an inductive resistance, development of three-phase and single-phase load models. Results: The article presents a description of a mathematical model implied to study the joint operation of 25 kV AC traction power supply systems and 110-750 kV power supply systems. The principles of building the model of three-phase and single-phase PU-generators on EMF source basis behind inductive resistance as well as the models of three-phase and single-phase loads are considered. Based on the given mathematical expressions, a computer model has been developed that allows analyzing the joint operation of three-phase external power supply networks and single-phase traction ones. The model is implemented in MATLAB-Simulink software package. Using this computer model, the influence of power flows through 110–330 kV network of Karelenergo and “FSK EAS” Public Companies on equalizing currents in the traction network of Knyazhaya — Idel section of Oktyabrskaya railway was analyzed. Practical importance: The reliability raise for traction power supply system operation at the expense of precise calculation of equalizing currents.

In this study, the project scheduling problem and the resource supply problem are regarded as a dynamic game system, with interactive influences and constraints. This study proposes a Stackelberg dynamic game model based on the engineering supply chain perspective. In this model, the inherent conflicts and complex interactions between the Multi-mode Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (MRCPSP) and the Multi-Period Supply Chain Problem (MPSCP) are studied to determine the optimal equilibrium strategy. A two-level multi-objective programming method is used to solve the problem. The MRCPSP is the upper-level planning used to optimize project scheduling and activity mode selection to minimize project cost and duration; MPSCP is a lower-level planning method that seeks to make resource transportation decisions at a lower cost. A two-layer hybrid algorithm, consisting of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is proposed to determine the optimal equilibrium strategy. Finally, the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method are evaluated through a case study of a large hydropower construction project, and management suggestions for related departments are provided.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Existing performance-measurement systems in the supply-chain literature have been designed for specific supply chains. Without a business-appropriate performance-measurement system, practitioners devise strategies that are neither scientific nor supported by data. The objective of this paper was to propose a performance-measurement system to support the enabling of supply-chain strategies. The proposed performance-measurement system (PMS), combining the Plan–Do–Check–Act cycle (PDCA) with the evidence-based management (EBM) concept, served as the basis for developing a procedural framework. The PMS was validated using the case logistics service providers (LSPs). The PDCA methodology was used to develop a structural framework for fourth-party logistics (4PL). In the Plan step, the research team identified the business problems of fourth-party logistics (4PL). In the Do step, the LSP literature was reviewed, to identify five performance dimensions (‘Service Quality’; ‘Social and Environmental’; ‘Inter-organizational Relationship’; ‘Financial’; and ‘Efficiency and Effectiveness’), and key performance indicators (KPIs). The 4PL management team participated in the finalization of the five performance dimensions and the 53 KPIs, which were used to propose a preliminary version of the structural framework for the 4PL. In the Check step, the data collected from 478 subcontractors of the 4PL were analyzed, using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, and were used to validate the proposed structural framework for the 4PL. The validated structural framework was further presented at an academic conference, and to the 4PL for feedback, and was used to formulate supply-chain strategies through brainstorming. The findings include a validated structural framework containing five performance dimensions and 32 KPIs. The research revealed that input performance (‘Service Quality’, ‘Social and Environmental’, and ‘Inter-organizational Relationship’) positively affected output performance (‘Financial’ and ‘Efficiency and Effectiveness’). Supply-chain strategies were further suggested to the 4PL. The validating case in this study demonstrated that the employed procedural framework (PDCA and EBM) was applicable, and could be used to derive a structural framework and supply-chain strategies for the 4PL. This study contributes to the literature, by proposing a PMS for supply-chain strategy development. The paper’s illustrative case provides a practical application of how to develop a performance-measurement system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>W zmieniających się warunkach funkcjonowania podmiotów gospodarczych istotną rolę odgrywa z jednej strony identyfikacja zasobów oraz obszarów o potencjale pozwalającym na wzrost konkurencyjność, a z drugiej zapewnienie stabilności i bezpieczeństwa procesów oraz ograniczenie niepewności i ryzyka. Szczególne znaczenie w tym zakresie ma budowanie więzi między partnerami gospodarczymi. Podstawą takich partnerskich relacji w łańcuchach dostaw jest współpraca polegająca na zaufaniu i podziale ryzyka. Należy jednocześnie podkreślić, że tworzenie takich relacji stanowi nie tylko wyzwanie, ale także dodatkowe źródło ryzyka. Celem pracy jest identyfikacja i ocena elementów ryzyka występujących w powiązaniach przedsiębiorstw w łańcuchach dostaw. Wiedza z zakresu ryzyka i potencjalnych zagrożeń stanowi podstawę tworzenia relacji z partnerami oraz budowania bezpieczeństwa przedsiębiorstw oraz łańcuchów dostaw. W pracy przedstawiono wyniki badań dotyczące kluczowych elementów ryzyka w relacjach przedsiębiorstw branży metalowej funkcjonujących w łańcuchach dostaw. Badania zostały przeprowadzone za pomocą autorskiego kwestionariusza ankietowego i obejmowały przedsiębiorstwa branży metalowej prowadzące swoją działalność na terenie Polski. Badane zagadnienia obejmowały takie elementy jak: ocena postrzegana roli monitorowania i ograniczania ryzyka w przedsiębiorstwach, identyfikacja kompetencji w obszarze analizy i oceny ryzyka oraz przygotowania na nieprawidłowości i zakłócenia w łańcuchach dostaw jakimi odznaczają się badane przedsiębiorstwa, identyfikacja wpływu elementów ryzyka w powiązaniach z dostawcami i odbiorcami na działalność przedsiębiorstwa, wykorzystywane metody ograniczania ryzyka oraz czynniki wpływające na wdrożenie zarzadzania ryzykiem w łańcuchach dostaw. Uzyskanie  wyniki pozwoliły na identyfikację roli ryzyka współpracy przedsiębiorstw w łańcuchach dostaw oraz istotnych czynników wpływających na jego redukcję. Podkreślono również rolę zarządzania relacjami z partnerami gospodarczymi jako istotnego elementu wpływającego na zapewnienie bezpieczeństwa funkcjonowania łańcuchów dostaw.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water/steam electrolysis is a key enabling technology for clean, low-carbon and sustainable production of hydrogen and will play a crucial role in future hydrogen economy. For high temperature solid oxide electrolytic cells, steam is the chemical feedstock. A stable and accurate supply of steam to solid oxide electrolytic cells is of vital importance to smooth production of hydrogen. In this study, we compare steam supply performance of two commonly used steam generators: steamer and bubbler. Our results show that bubbler with proper volume and fritted inlet gas tubing can provide more stable and accurate steam supply than steamer for laboratory use. We also provide the explanation for the unstable steam supply observed in steamer. Overall, we conclude that bubbler is generally a better choice for small-scale laboratory use (e.g., ≤50%H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O, ≤100 sccm carrier gas flow) to produce stable and accurate steam and steamer might be a better choice for higher steam contents and flow rates (e.g., &amp;gt;60% H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O and &amp;gt;200) encountered in large-scale testing and/or aggressive high steam conditions.</jats:p>"

The virus had several huge impacts on the global market, with different risk management approaches companies and global supply chains needed to adapt to the altered situation. During the second and third wave of the epidemic, several regions and countries were under lockdown for different intervals in order to stop the spread of the virus. Some countries entered lockdown for the first time, and many of them entered lockdown again, as when the first wave occurred. The economy of the Philippines is dependent on electronics-related industries, which faced extraordinary risks from different sources, and these industries suffered severe consequences because of COVID-19. Crucial automotive suppliers outsource their production facilities to the Philippines region, and the dominant semiconductor segments were heavily impaired due to the lockdowns. Electrification in the automotive industry and the spread of electric vehicles is becoming increasingly important due to rapid technological development. The economic shock caused by COVID-19 forced companies in this sector to diversify their supply chain activities in order to stay competitive, minimize the supply chain-related risks and to start recovery processes. The authors analysed the risks, position, opportunities, challenges, difficulties, reactions and solutions of a certain automotive supplier, which was heavily reliant on the Philippines, and Chinese suppliers.</jats:p>"

However, the impact of RO filtration of natural waters is severely hindered by biofouling. Formation of complex biofilms on RO membranes dramatically decreases output due to release of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by the microorganisms. We present a polydopamine-copper (PD-Cu) coating for RO feed spacer materials to prevent biofouling and enhance longevity of Cu ions. The following spacers were tested in a continuous flow bench scale RO system: (1) Polypropylene (PP) feed spacers coated with PD-Cu, (2) a pristine PP, control spacer, (3), a PD control spacer and (4) a Cu control spacer. Results showed the PD-Cu spacers exhibited higher Cu ion chelation, retaining 71 ± 2% more Cu ions compared to a Cu-only spacer after 13 h. In a stirring beaker, PD-Cu spacers lost loosely attached Cu ions until the optimum Cu concentration was achieved, approximately 30.6 ± 0.3% of total composition, within 6 h, and the remaining Cu ions bonded with PD covalently. In addition, PD-Cu spacers showed a 17.5% higher permeate flux and a 58% biofilm biovolume decrease as compared to a pristine spacer over 24 h.</jats:p>",

We analyze the impact of the change in the power structure on Japan’s macroeconomy, power sector, and industry by comparing the results of four scenarios. In our simulations, which are divided into two periods, shocks are introduced to the growth rate in real GDP, labor force, population, and Japanese zero-emission power supply; nuclear power, hydropower, wind power, solar power, and other types of power. First, simulations from 2011 to 2018 were performed to update the GTAP-E-Power database. Next, simulations from 2019 to 2030 were performed for policy scenarios with different growth rates of zero-emission power supply in Japan. The simulation results show that if Japan maintains the same growth rate of zero-emission power supply as that of the Sustainable Development Scenario of the World Energy Outlook 2019, the share of zero-emission power supply in 2030 will achieve the government’s target. The simulation results also show that an increase in zero-emission power supply has a positive effect on the Japanese trade balance.</jats:p>"

On one hand, planning is faced with the challenge of taking individual structural and social conditions into account when dividing up the districts. On the other hand, the routing of the mains of a pipe-based infrastructure (water supply) must be selected in the context of the entire area under consideration and integrated into a superordinate network layout. In this paper, a method that combines these contrasting approaches is presented. Potential district boundaries are identified based on existing infrastructure and development patterns, as well as considering the routing requirements of a piped drinking water supply. Thereby, social factors can be considered in the decision-making process. Subsequently, an area subdivision is performed by a recursive partitioning algorithm. The choice and combination of different compactness measures influence the shape of the districts and, thus, the spatial organization. The geodetic height is integrated into the algorithm via an admissibility condition, so that the subsequent development of a district can take place via one pressure zone. By means of variations in the input parameters of the zoning, different planning levels can be generated, which finally lead successively to the upgrading of an informal settlement area.</jats:p>"

Two types of brick-and-mortar stores are considered: self-owned and franchised. We first determine via game theory the optimal pricing and service decisions for the e-tailer and brick-and-mortar store when prices are uniform or nonuniform online and offline. The results indicate that webrooming benefits both the e-tailer and brick-and-mortar store when prices are nonuniform. For self-owned stores, the online market share and consumer traveling costs weaken the positive webrooming effect on the e-tailer’s profit when the price is nonuniform. For the franchised store, webrooming weakens the positive role of online market share and reinforces the negative effect of traveling costs for the e-tailer. The positive effect of webrooming on franchised stores in the case of nonuniform pricing is more significant than in the case of uniform pricing when online market share or traveling costs are lower. These results have important implications for management and should help e-tailers develop an omnichannel strategy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Our study is based on the establishment of normative indicators of the effect of negative pressure on the skin of the thigh. To do this, a group of healthy volunteers was examined – 35 people: 17 women and 18 men aged 19 to 58. The study was conducted on the clinical basis of the burn centre in 2020-2021. The local vacuum was created using a negative pressure device “AGAT-Dnepr” by applying a silver-containing polyurethane sponge directly on the front surface of the thigh. The pressure (P) – 110-160 mmHg has been applied for 30 minutes. Tissue perfusion was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry and thermal imaging research. Measurements were performed before vacuum, immediately after the end of the application of negative pressure, for three days at the same time at a constant temperature. According to the results of the cluster analysis, based on the effect of negative pressure on the thigh skin, patients with three types of reactions were identified – low, medium and high perfusion changes. The perfusion level of tissue volume per unit time increased the most rapidly: in the group of high perfusion by 45.56 (95% CI 42.09-51.96) PU; in the group of average perfusion – by 22.49 (95% CI 19.93-28.99) PU; in the low perfusion group – by 22.43 (95% CI 15.90-25.13) PU. The number of erythrocytes per unit tissue changed at a medium rate: in the high perfusion group by 57.77 (95% CI 53.05-62.48) AU; in the group of average perfusion – by 55.86 (95% CI 49.62-65.06) PU; in the low perfusion group – by 34.85 (95% CI 13.19-53.55) PU. Among those surveyed, 12 people were included in the low perfusion group (34.29%), 16 people in the medium perfusion group (45.71%) and 7 people in the high perfusion group (20.0%). Before VAC-action the ascending level of thigh skin temperature T1 ranged from 28.60 to 32.90°C and averaged 31.46 (95% CI 30.97-31.95)°C. Immediately, after the offset of the negative pressure the area of the fields of local skin temperature rise increased, the average temperature level ranged from 30.60 to 35.0°C and the average T2 was 33.59 (95% CI 33.16-34.01)°C. The temperature rise occurred on average by 2.13 (95% 1.72-2.54)°C, which corresponded to an increase of 6.77% with significant (p&lt;0.001) statistical differences. Only 1 examined had a slight decrease in the tem­perature of the thigh skin from 31.9 to 31.6°C, in the rest of the examined the rise was by 6.4°С maximally, from 28.6 to 35.0°С, there was a temperature rise by 2°С or more degrees among 9 people (25.71%). After 24 hours there was a rise in local body temperature among all examined (100%), after 48 hours – among 25 (71.43%), and after 72 hours – among 21 examined (60.0%). When choosing a donor site of the perforant flaps, we recommend relying on areas which will belong to the group of indicators with high perfusion. According to the analysis, the group of high perfusion will include patients with an initial average level of perfusion in the donor areas per unit time of 15.84 (14.47-17.21) PU, the number of erythrocytes per unit tissue – 58.73 (53.44-64.02) AU and skin temperature – 29.23 (28.65-29.80)°С; to the average according to F rates – 14.36 (13.0-15.73) PU, C rates – 45.37 (39.74-51.0) AU, T rates – 28.17 (27.74-28.60)°С; to the group of low perfusion, respectively, according to F rates – 12.38 (10.74-14.0) PU, C rates – 43.89 (40.18-47.61) AU, T rates – 29.79 (29.17-30.40)°С. In general, the effect of negative pressure contributes to increased perfusion and local microcirculation in tissues, as evidenced by dynamic infrared thermography: increased “hot” skin fields, increased temperature with a temperature gra­dient ∆T2.1=2.13 (95% 1.72-2.54)°C and for indicators of laser Doppler flowmetry – increase in perfusion by 2.42 times (p&lt;0.001).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In recent years, the ecological environment has been severely damaged and has evolved into a problem threatening human health due to the construction of the ecological environment. Therefore, studying the eco-environmental (ecological environment) issues in the process of the new eco-environment is of great significance to the comprehensive development of the region. The basic research framework of this article is to ask questions, analyse problems and solve problems. With the rise of e-commerce media platforms as the background, we use case studies and in-depth interviews to discuss the characteristics of the ecological crisis of e-commerce media platforms and analyse them in depth. This paper takes the new ecological environment as the research background, selects six major cities in the Central Plains as the research objects, and digs deep to find out the current ecological and environmental problems in the Central Plains. By citing the PSR (Pressure-State-Response) model, we construct the initial pressure and use the factor analysis method to determine the evaluation index model of the 16 sub-indices. Finally, we use the entropy method to standardise the original indicators. We determine the index weights, etc., to analyse the level of the ecological environment of the six cities. At the same time, this article evaluates the ecological environment in the process of the new ecological environment in the Central Plains. First, an evaluation index system is established, and then the evaluation index weight is determined to obtain the order of the ecological environment problems. According to the total score value of ecological environment quality, for different areas, comprehensive ecological environment zoning is proposed so that resources can be better and rationally developed and utilised. The ecological environment of mining areas is protected and improved to the maximum extent. At the same time, the mine ecological environment monitoring work plan is formulated; the construction of ecological restoration is proposed for areas (mine parks, geological parks, forest parks, and ecological parks). Through organisational structure adjustment and overall supply chain optimisation, relevant feasible solutions are proposed, and examples are given to illustrate the optimisation effects; the part summarises the significance of this research and the main existing problems and proposes future research recommendations. In the context of the new ecological environment, analysing the current situation of the ecological environment in the Central Plains, identifying the ecological and environmental problems in the process of the ecological environment, and proposing corresponding solutions based on the problems are conducive to the development of the new ecological environment in the Central Plains.</jats:p>",

The performance evaluation of supply chain management (SCM) is difficult and needs consideration of several important enablers. In such situations, the development of an SCPMS can facilitate understanding and integration among the SC partners. The SCPMS is influenced by many enablers that play a positive role; hence, the study of these enablers becomes significant. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify and rank the key SCPMS enablers. The identified SCPMS enablers were modeled using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and ranked through an interpretative ranking process (IRP). The SCPMS enablers were further categorized using MICMAC. The results show that “SCPMS awareness”, “top management commitment”, and “financial commitment towards SCPMS” must be controlled for sustainability as they are independent enablers. “Benchmarking”, “appropriate performance matrix”, and “employee commitment” were the three top enablers.</jats:p>"

The objectives of the study were to determine the environmental impact of the petrochemical complex and the level of damage caused to neighboring areas as well as to identify the wells most affected by pollution. Field surveys of wells and pollutant disposal sites were conducted in the study area and spatial analysis using the ArcGIS program was used. The results revealed the wells affected by pollution, the type of released pollutants, the extent of their spread and concentration, as well as the factories that produce the most significant percentage of contaminants. Interpretation of spatial information by GIS revealed that liquid chlorine, industrial salts, and ethylene, respectively, had the highest concentrations as pollutants for soil and groundwater, and don't comply with environmental standards. The study also revealed that the chlorine factory, soda, low-density polyethylene granules, and PVC factory are the most polluting factories in the surrounding environment.</jats:p>",

Following this concept, sustainable supply chain management has become the main concern of many studies. Among all the strategies to achieve sustainability targets in a supply chain, cooperating with third-party logistics companies has attracted lots of attention. By providing more sustainable and efficient transportation services, 3PLs can help all types of regular, closed-loop, and circular SCs achieve more profit, while they are still sustainable, at least in distribution and collection/recycling stages. This study investigates the sustainable multi-channel SC design problem in the presence of the government and 3PLs. To bring the present study closer to the real-world situation, the problem is modeled using an intuitionistic fuzzy uncertainty approach. Considering the government as the leader of the SC in two centralized and decentralized decision structures, game theory has been applied to model the game between players and obtain optimal decision values. For the first time in the literature, public awareness toward green activities of the players, emission reduction, uncertainty, and delivery time have been considered in this study. The results show the presence of a 3PL will reduce the delivery time and the amount of pollution. Also, the findings confirm that governments can control the players' activities and encourage them to apply green strategies using financial tools.</jats:p>"

This study examined the socioeconomic effects of seasonal domestic water supply among Kibaku People, Chibok Local Government Area, and Borno State, Nigeria. Random sampling was used to select 165 rural households and water samples for the study. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The significant water sources were hand dug well. The average trekking time to the water source was 10-101 minutes (24.8%). And the households require an average of 162 liters of water per day. The major causes of water scarcity include insufficient rainfall, increased sunlight intensity, pollution of water sources and increased population from the oral interview. About 60% of them stated water scarcity harms their socioeconomic activities as its time consuming (36.1%), causes long queues (48%) and causes conflicts at the point of collection (15.8%). However focus group discussions, interviews and personal observation, respondents believed drinking water is inadequate in Chibok. It was concluded that water available for household use is not sufficient. However, it is safe but contains some elements, not of the World Health Organization standard for good potable water. It is recommended that the community build a hub for water collection and distribution close to the village center. The government should provide water infrastructures to increase the potable water supply</jats:p>"

OBJECTIVE: To reduce the cost of the Da Vinci robotic surgical instrument supply chain. METHODS: Patients were selected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. Control group patients underwent Da Vinci robot-assisted surgery between January 2019 and June 2019 (control group). Patients who were operated with the same robot from July 2019 to December 2019 were selected as the experimental group (SCM group). The cost analysis and comparison were carried out to integrate instrument sets, working hours, workforce expenditure, and direct and indirect expenses. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the number of instrument packages was lower (4.5 ± 1.4 vs. 11.5 ± 1.6, P&lt; 0.001) and the personnel’s awareness of the instruments was higher (92.3 ± 4.2 vs. 83.4 ± 3.7, P&lt; 0.001) in the SCM group. The SCM group showed lower processing time per device (8.1 ± 1.6 vs. 44.2 ± 5.6 min, P&lt; 0.001) and lower costs per surgical instrument (RMB 11.5 ± 2.3 vs. 60.3 ± 10.2, P&lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: The application of the supply chain management can reduce the costs of robotic surgery, improve work efficiency and decrease the failure rate of instruments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This work intends to optimize residential landscape design and Supply Chain (SC) network systems. First, Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) intelligent assistance and genetic algorithm (GA) are used to study residential landscape design and its integration with SC deeply. Weight matrix interactions are employed to implement iterative inference for FCM. The functions are transformed to unify variables of different scopes. Subsequently, a weighting method is proposed to deal with the disadvantage of the simple average method being too general. In addition, the Hebbian learning algorithm is used to adjust the state nodes and the connection weights. Finally, according to the fitness function of the GA and logistic regression (LR) model, residential landscape design and SC are combined. The simulation experiment results show that the causal relationship analysis between SC networks under fuzzy cognition shows that the state errors of each specific situation are 0.21, 0.16, and 0.24, respectively. The total average error is 0.21 in the case of multiple iterations. The average error of the result vector under fuzzy cognition and the operation of the actual result is 0.20, 0.15, and 0.24, respectively, and the error value is much reduced. The simulation accuracy of the GA-LR method for residential landscape design is improved from 77% to 84.7%. The “kappa coefficient” is also improved to 82.3%. The conclusion shows that the weight matrix is used to analyze the high-quality performance of landscape design according to the specific situation of SC. For each specific case, FCM is effective in reducing errors over multiple iterations. Under the GA-LR method, fewer geographic location types and larger accuracy deviations can improve the simulation accuracy.</jats:p>",

Integrated optimization of the biogas generation system is essential for a speedy and environmentally friendly transition to sustainable biodiesel production. The dynamic environment of the energy market significantly impairs the decisions of the BG-SCND model; therefore, a hybrid solution approach using flexible programming and possibilistic programming is suggested. To verify the suggested model and approach for solving the problem, a thorough computational analysis of a case study is conducted. The case study findings demonstrate that considerable investment is necessary to attain social and environmental well-being goals and safeguard decisions against epistemic uncertainty.

A case is made for using an additional passive filter at the active part output of the hybrid filter under distributed generation. The optimal structure and parameters of such an additional passive filter are identified and proved. Based on the experimental research results, the mathematical and computer simulation models of the proposed hybrid filter for hybrid power supply were developed. The modeling and simulation results showed the efficiency level to be satisfactory and power quality to improve due to applying the proposed hybrid filter.

In order to ensure the quality and safety of agricultural products, suppliers and processors need to take their own quality measures to ensure the quality of agricultural products. Quality inspection departments need to strictly supervise suppliers and processors to ensure the implementation of quality measures by both parties. Within the supply chain, the decisions of these three stakeholders are affected by the initial intention, the cost of quality measures, and the penalty amount of the quality inspection department. Outside the supply chain, they are affected by government regulation and consumer feedback. This paper takes the stakeholders in the agricultural product supply chain as the object, brings suppliers, processors, and quality inspection departments into the evolutionary game model, brings the factors that affect the decision-making of these three stakeholders into the model as parameters to analyze the stability of the model in different situations, and then analyzes the factors that affect the decision-making of stakeholders through mathematical simulation according to specific examples. The results show that the enthusiasm of stakeholders to ensure the quality of agricultural products is most affected by the initial intention of each other and the cost of quality measures. At the same time, the punishment of the quality inspection department, the feedback of consumers, and the supervision of the government also play a good role in promoting quality.</jats:p>"

The membrane was manufactured via Non-Induced Phase Separation (NIPS) phase inversion of the polymer casting solution. The composition of ZnO was varied into 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3%. The results of the membrane synthesis were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), pure water permeability test, and selectivity test with a turbid meter. The hydrophilic properties of the membrane were analysed by measuring the contact angle, and the antibacterial characteristics were analyzed by the disc diffusion test. Analysis by FTIR showed the presence of a sulfone functional group (S=O) derived from polysulfone polymer and a methyl functional group (C-H) derived from PEG. SEM analysis showed that each variation of the polysulfone membrane had an upper surface structure that was close to the honeycomb structure. The pure air permeability test shows that the membrane is porous and able to pass through pure air. Selectivity test with a turbid meter showed that the membrane is selective to the feed stream that passes through it.

In this study, we assessed the extent to which afforestation can reduce the climate change impact on water resources by adding an afforestation scenario to the variables used to estimate the forest water yield. We applied the InVEST seasonal water yield model and constructed a data ensemble of the SSP5–8.5 scenario for this simulation. In the projection of future forest water supply according to the SSP5–8.5 scenario, baseflow and local recharge decreased by approximately 25%, and quickflow increased by approximately 47%, compared to the baseline period. Under the three reforestation scenarios, the future water supply from the forests showed significant positive changes. The baseflow increased by approximately 4%, 15%, and 28% in the reforestation scenario of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3, respectively. In a Level 3 scenario, most of the baseflow and local recharge, which had decreased owing to the impact of climate change, was recovered. The baseflow in Level 3 was 26,882 million m3 y−1, which was approximately 98% of that in the baseline period. The Taedong River and Chongchon River, which are the major granary areas in North Korea, were directly affected by the climate change. However, it was confirmed that the water supply in these areas can be increased through forest restoration. These results indicate the deterministic role of forest restoration in increasing the water supply.</jats:p>"

This data can be considered Big Data. The AFC data in its raw format, however, is incapable of supporting supply and demand analysis (e.g. studying bus occupancy rates). Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) can be used to analyse such data for that purpose. This paper discusses the development and calibration of a MATSim-based ABM to analyse AFC data for Cape Town's BRT system. It is shown that data-formatting algorithms are critical in the preparation of data for modelling activities. Furthermore, the development of appropriate ABM calibration parameters requires careful consideration in terms of appropriate data collection, simulation testing, and justification, which are discussed. The paper furthermore shows that the calibrated ABM can generate outputs such as bus on-board volumes, a system-demand overview, and even individual commuter path choice behaviour. Finally, a validation exercise shows that the model developed for this study is able to provide good estimates of on-board bus volumes (R2 = 0.85). It is, however, recommended that further research be conducted into studying agent path choices through simulation.</jats:p>"

In the majority of regions of the Russian Federation, quality of water taken from water sources and water supply systems is still unsatisfactory. As far as the extent of human impact on the environment goes, the Samara region is an ecologically unfavorable part of the Volga region. With the accession of the Republic of Crimea to the Russian Federation, the problem of water supply here has been intensified and the question of whether the drinking water corresponds to Sanitary Rules and Regulations 2.1.3685–21 and Sanitary Rules and Regulations 2.1.3684–21 arose. The purpose of the study is to analyze quality of drinking water supply in the regions of the Russian Federation. Drinking water samples taken from the centralized domestic water supply system in the Samara urban district and Republic of Crimea were analyzed using 20 sanitary and chemical parameters. Quality of drinking water doesn’t correspond to the requirements for oil products in all samples; the average value of this parameter exceeded the maximum permissible limit by 0.18 mg/dm3 in the Samara urban district and by 0.04 mg/dm3 in the Republic of Crimea, all the other parameters were within normal limits. However, during the comparative analysis quality of drinking water in the Republic of Crimea was insignificantly better than in the Samara urban district. Quality of drinking water is determined with the source of drinking water supply (surface and underground). Thus, to make the prepared drinking water normal, a respective water treating is necessary. Bad condition of water supply pipes can also produce a negative impact on quality of water obtained by a consumer.</jats:p>",

To illustrate the versatility of this approach, it is shown that not only insulin, but also glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1), nanoluciferase (NLuc), and the model biopharmaceutical erythropoietin (EPO) can be trigger‐inducibly released, even when using biologically inactive insulin as a carrier. The facilitating beta cells are engineered with a controllable TRPV1‐mediated Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> influx that induces the fusion of cytoplasmic storage vesicles with the membrane, leading to the release of the stored protein. When required, the growth medium is exchanged for saline solution, and the system is stimulated with the small molecule capsaicin, with a hand‐warming pack, or simply by using sunlight. Injection of insulin saline solution obtained in this way into a type‐1 diabetes mouse model results in the regulation of blood glucose levels. It is believed that this system will be readily adaptable to deliver various biopharmaceutical proteins at remote locations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The growing demand for sustainable practices within the energy sector has led to significant advancements in green logistics integration, aiming to reduce environmental impact while maintaining operational efficiency. Green logistics refers to the application of sustainable practices in the management of the movement of goods, including transportation, warehousing, and distribution, to minimize carbon emissions and energy consumption. In energy supply chains, the integration of green logistics practices is crucial to addressing challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and energy inefficiency. This paper explores the latest innovations in green logistics, focusing on their role in enhancing sustainability across energy supply chains. Key advancements include the use of renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, and alternative fuels for transportation within the supply chain. Moreover, the optimization of supply chain networks through data analytics and machine learning algorithms enables more efficient routing and inventory management, reducing waste and unnecessary emissions. The incorporation of circular economy principles, such as reusing materials and reducing packaging, further contributes to the sustainability of energy supply chains. Technological innovations, such as the use of blockchain for tracking carbon footprints, have also emerged as valuable tools for ensuring transparency and accountability in energy supply chain operations. These advancements not only improve environmental performance but also enhance cost efficiency, thus contributing to a competitive advantage for companies adopting green logistics practices. This paper highlights the importance of collaboration among stakeholders in the energy supply chain, including logistics providers, policymakers, and technology developers, to drive the adoption of green logistics practices. The integration of green logistics within energy supply chains represents a critical step towards achieving long-term sustainability goals, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting responsible resource management.</jats:p>"

According to the regional division of market entities, carbon emissions are allocated to regions and entities by using the Owen value method. In order to reduce the expected carbon emission of entities, an additional carbon price is added to the original quotation through the allocation results. Case studies are conducted based on the typical output characteristics of wind and photovoltaic power generation in the bilateral bidding market hourly. The results have validated that the proposed method can reduce expected carbon emissions in the power system by prioritizing zero-carbon and low-carbon generation units.</jats:p>"

There are several lumped and distributed methods available in the literature for estimating the ToC. However, these methods lead to significantly varied values. Therefore, it is imperative to choose an appropriate and best-suited method for estimating the ToC. This study analyses eight lumped approach-based and two distributed approach-based methods for estimating the ToC in an urban area of Gurugram, a satellite city in the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi in India. Considering the ToC obtained by the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) method as the ‘true’ value, the Carter method among lumped methods and the SWDM method between the distributed methods results in ToC values in agreement with the NRCS method. Furthermore, to study the impact of the underestimation or overestimation of ToC on drainage, the system is evaluated in terms of variation in flood volume, duration, peak discharge, and the time to peak for different ToC values. The simulations were carried out by setting the model in SWMM, and it was found that flood volume increases by 4.25 times and the duration increases by 7.25 times if the ToC is increased from 0.1 to 6.14 h. The results infer that ToC estimation methods significantly impact the design and performance of an urban drainage infrastructure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change is one of humanity’s biggest challenges. With reference to power grids, there is a strong need for decarbonization alongside for a substantial increase in renewable energy generation. Keeping in mind that renewable energy sources are volatile – solar and wind power are heavily weather dependent – it is necessary to ensure the balance between power generation and power demand in the European power grid at all times. Significant deviations in grid frequency or bottlenecks could lead to a blackout. This raises the need for flexibility in the power grid substantially. An option so far relatively little explored is to make use of industrial demand-side flexibility. With a share in the power demand of about 45 per cent in Germany, industry could contribute significantly to power grid stability. While technologies for industrial demand-side flexibility have been comprehensively explored by the scientific community and (prototypically) implemented in industry, this knowledge has not spread to a broader audience. To foster knowledge on industrial demand-side flexibilization, we developed an approach using a serious game called SynErGame, synchronizing energy supply and demand. Within two game modes, one perspective macro-oriented and the other industry-oriented, a player learns about the benefits and challenges of using demand-side flexibility options to stabilize a power grid. The paper first introduces the topic of flexibilizing industrial power demand. Secondly, requirements are derived and the game design is outlined in detail. Thirdly, the paper shows how to make the game accessible via browser or app on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. During ongoing use, SynErGame has proven particularly effective for audiences inclined to digital technologies, such as students.</jats:p>"

One of the most important tasks to ensure the sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the population of the Vladimir region is to provide it with high-quality drinking water. Due to the territory of the region to be partially associated with known hydrogeochemical anomalies of excess manganese content in groundwater, a hygienic assessment of the water of economic and drinking sources was carried out according to the content of this element. Materials and methods. The paper presents the data of own research of the Department of Biology and Ecology of the Vladimir State University named after A.G. and N.G. Stoletov for 2021. During this period, the authors of the work examined about 110 samples of water from the household and drinking centralized and non-centralized water supply of the Vladimir region. Water samples were taken in the largest settlements (these are district centers, regional cities and large district settlements) and from drinking water sources of individual farms located in the territory of the region in various districts. The manganese content in water was determined on the analyzer “Fluorat-02-5M” according to HDPE F 14.1:2:4.188-02. Results. The drinking water of the centralized water supply of the Vladimir region in terms of manganese content was established to meet regulatory requirements and be safe for the health of the resident population. In all samples of drinking water, the concentration of manganese is below 0.1 mg/dm3. At the same time, water from underground sources of non-centralized water supply has in some cases an excess of manganese (from 2 to 7 MPC), which is primarily due to the specifics of the geochemical composition of the water-bearing rocks of these territories. Conclusion in order to provide the population of territories using underground water with a high content of manganese, it is necessary to build local modular water treatment plants using modern methods of non-reactive de-ironing and demanganation and using effective modern equipment and filtering materials.</jats:p>",

Afterward, considering the trust level of blockchain-based traceability information and consumers’ preference to the blockchain-based traceability information, we revised the demand function, and three subsidy models were proposed and analyzed. Findings: (1) the varying subsidy will help the retailer, the producer, and the traceability service provider set lower prices. (2) Meanwhile, the varying subsidies offered to the blockchain-based traceability service provider and the producer will help the whole supply chain members obtain more revenues.</jats:p>",

Based on this, the theories and strategies of the interaction design between enterprise members and intelligent machines were put forward and tested by actual design. At present, air pollution, energy shortage, and other issues are becoming more and more prominent, and calls for energy conservation, emission reduction, strengthening corporate social responsibility, and reducing the impact of economic development on the environment and society are growing. Therefore, companies must rethink their strategies and adapt their supply chains. Based on limited resources, enterprise machines have traditionally acted as a tool or a communication tool for a person. Yet, at the same time as the economy develops, the direct interaction between human and machine gradually emerges, and the economic development of an enterprise is bound to contradict environmental protection and social responsibility. Therefore, for enterprises, in different periods, different priority strategies will be adopted for the three dimensions of economy, environment, and society. The results showed that the economic benefit has increased by about 30% or more, and the ecological pollution has been reduced by about 40% on the original basis. Under the action of a sustainable supply chain, consumer satisfaction tends to be full and can be maintained at about 97%. In this context, the comparative analysis of the strategic optimization of enterprises in the supply chain is the focus of this thesis.</jats:p>",

Especially in the case of rotary wings, they consume more energy than other UAV types as the motors need to spend a lot of energy to operate in order to overcome the gravity of the earth. The article aims to research power supply, energy consumption on UAVs, and a method of taking advantage of external energy sources to provide power for the operation of UAVs and discuss UAVs’ structure, categories, and control. Two experiments were conducted separately to evaluate the energy consumption of UAVs and the energy conversion from external energy sources to electrical energy. A test bench was designed to evaluate and determine the maximum efficiency using regenerative braking mode. The measuring device was manufactured to measure the necessary parameters to calculate the energy consumption and performance of the system. Experimental numerical results show that energy conversion from external sources is one of methods that can help increase the flight time of the UAV.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The importance of sustainability in supply chain management is growing worldwide. It is possible to find reasons for this using various phenomena that negatively affect humanity, e.g., climate change, scarce materials, supply disruptions, and complex fossil fuel dependency. Because of that, is extremely important to constantly look for new ways to systematically increase sustainability in enterprises and their logistics and supply chain processes by considering different stakeholders and influential factors. Therefore, this paper explores how different types of organizational culture and normative commitment impact sustainability and each other in business logistics and supply chains and develops a conceptual model to manage this challenge. Gaining new insights is valuable especially for managers to obtain better information on how to improve sustainability not just by integrating green technologies but mainly by changing culture, attitude, and perception in their enterprises. The research is focused on employees from global logistics or related branches in micro, small, medium, and large enterprises with the primary activity mostly related to manufacturing, transport, and storage. The findings are based on the questionnaire which was sent directly to 1576 employees from 528 enterprises. A total of 516 employees from enterprises that are mostly located in 34 countries responded to requests for participation. The results reveal statistically significant positive and negative impacts, e.g., clan culture has a positive statistically significant impact on the sustainable development of supply chains. Most of the connections to the eighth Sustainable Development Goal by the United Nations (decent work and economic growth) were also found, which was the enterprise’s highest priority with a share of 52.99%. A contribution to the theory development is gained using the developed model that considers both positive and negative statistically significant impacts studied.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most organisations in different sectors are implementing Supply Chain Management Practices (SCMPs) to create faster, more effective, and cost-beneficial relationships between business partners, to increase their Operational Performances.  Even though the firms use SCMPs, their knowledge regarding the effectiveness of these practices is questionable. The aim of this study was to identify the most influential SCMPs on the Operational Performances of the Sri Lankan manufacturing industry. As to the literature and due to the high level of applicability in the manufacturing sector, five factors; Supply Relationship Management, Customer Relationship Management, Information Sharing, Logistics, and Outsourcing of Services were selected to conceptualize the current study. The Operational Performance of a Manufacturing organization has defined as the performance related to the quality, cost, delivery, and flexibility to change the volume. This was a cross-sectional questionnaire based survey which is quantitative in nature and primarily concerned with the testing of hypotheses. A set of 37 close-ended questions used to collect data from 200 randomly selected organizations. However, due to the difficulties faced in the pandemic environment, the success rate was 58.5%. Results of the Correlation Analysis confirmed the relationships hypothesized according to the theoretical behaviour with positive relationships significant at a 1% level. The strongest relationship shows between Logistics and Operational Performances (0.832). Regression Analysis showed significant impacts of Supplier Relationship Management (β=0.276) and Logistics (β=0.261) on the Operational Performance. Customer Relationship Management, Information Sharing, and outsourcing were not showed a significant impact on the Operational Performance at the 5% level. The adequacy of the fitted model is 67% and the RMSE is 0.236. The residual analysis also ensured the accuracy of the model with normally distributed residuals, free of Multi-collinearity, and having homoscedasticity which emphasises the constant variance of the residuals. The findings emphasise that if the SCMPs is running at a righteous level, an organization can keep their Operational Performances at a higher level. However, only the Supplier Relationship and Logistic activities are the factors significantly influencing the Operational Performances of the Manufacturing sector in Sri Lanka.  Similar to the facts highlighted in the literature, the responses of the current study also showed a poor level of handling and utilizing customer feedback for the development of Sri Lankan organizations. Information sharing also showed a poor focus on integrating and enhancing the IT systems. The uncontrollable circumstances due to outsourcing the services lead to a poor level of operational performance at the finale. This research contributes to the existing Supply Chain Management literature by providing empirical evidence from the Sri Lankan manufacturing industry.</jats:p>"

It has long been argued that these distortions were a key explanation for differences in supply and productivity across countries, but the empirical evidence is limited. We revisit this issue using data on policy distortions across 63 countries for the period 1961–2011. We estimate the effects of differential changes in agricultural distortions across countries on supply and productivity. We highlight concerns in our analysis and previous work about endogeneity that biases the estimated effect downward—countries that lose comparative advantage are likely to increase support for agriculture. We address these concerns by including country and region‐time fixed effects, along with a rich set of controls. Overall, we find evidence that enhanced incentives through policy changes can increase the rate of production growth, with about half of the increase due to productivity increases. This result is strongest in Sub‐Saharan Africa where anti‐agricultural policies on exports were reduced and in Europe where pro‐agricultural policies on imports were reduced, driven largely by external pressure. Endogeneity appears to be strongest in Asia where countries have followed the typical pattern of raising support for agriculture during industrialization due to a rising farm‐urban income gap.</jats:p>",

Herein, two readily deployable flexibility solutions to balance demand/supply as an alternative to building additional thermoelectric reserves are proposed. How the transmission system OPERATOR can use the ancillary services provided by a flexible photovoltaic (PV) fleet (solar regulation) or PV/wind fleet (variable renewable energy (VRE) regulation) together with a suitable underforecast and proactive curtailment of variable renewable generation (aka, implicit storage) to reduce current and future Italian imbalances is shown. How these flexibility solutions can become even more effective when combined with a strengthening of the transmission grid is shown. The imbalance reduction achievable by 2030 through solar/VRE regulation strategies would be of the order of 20–50% with zonal balancing and 27–80% with nationwide balancing is found. Imbalance costs would remain comparable with the business‐as‐usual (thermal generation) costs. A proactive curtailment of 5–17% of the total VRE generation is the environmental cost of stabilizing the system using VRE plants, avoiding the construction of thermoelectric reserves.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Aims   To understand connectivity and patterns of larval supply in the eastern Australian spanner crab stock.     Methods   Lagrangian particle tracking methods were used to simulate larval transport around the key spanner crab fishing regions in eastern Australia.     Key results   Spawning off central Queensland (Qld) supplies a large proportion of recruits, supporting both the Qld and New South Wales (NSW) fisheries. Lagged larval settlement showed significant correlations to catch-per-unit-effort and the proportion of total harvest taken within the NSW fishery, providing evidence to suggest that the NSW fishery may be reliant on spawning activity in Queensland.     Conclusions   The Qld and NSW fisheries are highly connected and the broad-scale patterns identified by the current modelling approach could provide an indicator of potentially good or bad recruitment years, particularly as finer resolution, and refined reproductive biology knowledge on spanner crabs becomes available.

Simultaneously, customers have low-carbon preferences for environmental products. Thus, the enterprises’ strategic decisions and collaboration modes have changed. This article develops the Stackelberg game model to explore the impacts of CAT and customers’ low-carbon preference on the carbon emission reduction and promotion strategies in a retailer-led supply chain (such as RT-Mart, Walmart, Amazon, etc.). In this model, the retailer decides whether to promote environmentally safe products and the manufacturer decides whether to reduce CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. We find that carbon trading market price and customers’ low-carbon preference are key factors influencing the retail price, total carbon emissions, and social welfare. Interestingly, there is not always a positive correlation between customers’ low-carbon preference and social welfare. To achieve Pareto improvement of social welfare, manufacturers and retailers require co-optimization. Theoretically, our research enriches the research streams of the CAT policy and socially responsible operations of the supply chain. Moreover, managerial insights are provided for retailer-led supply chain stakeholders and emission reduction regulators, which contribute to enhancing the social and environmental benefits of the supply chains.</jats:p>"

When optimizing conflicting economic, environmental, and social performance objectives, it is difficult to select the optimal scheme from obtained feasible decision schemes. In this article, according to the triple bottom line of sustainability, a multi-objective sustainable supply chain network optimization model is developed, and a novel performance-oriented optimization framework is proposed. This framework, referred to as performance-oriented optimization framework, integrates multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms and entropy-weighted technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (EW-TOPSIS). The optimization framework can comprehensively evaluate the performance of overall SSCN by EW-TOPSIS and guide the evolution process of algorithms. In this framework, decision-makers can obtain the feasible schemes calculated by meta-heuristics and determine the optimal one according to the performance value evaluated by EW-TOPSIS. This article combines three performance evaluation strategies with four meta-heuristic algorithms, namely, non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-2), multi-objective differential evolutionary (MODE), multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), and multi-objective gray wolr optimization (MOGWO), for verifying the effectiveness of the performance-oriented optimization framework. The results validate that the proposed framework has much better sustainability performance than the traditional optimization algorithms and evaluation methods. Furthermore, the proposed performance-oriented optimization framework can provide managers with a special optimal scheme with the best sustainability performance. Finally, some research prospects are presented such as more multi-criteria decision making methods.</jats:p>"

It considered three types of switching costs: procedural switching costs, financial switching costs, and relational switching costs. Survey data were collected from 188 manufacturing firms and analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results revealed that, procedural switching cost was positively related to supply chain responsiveness, while the relational switching cost, the most important predictor, was negatively related. The relationship between financial switching costs and supply chain responsiveness was not significant. No significant direct relationship was found between supplier switching costs and supply chain responsiveness either, possibly due to a different set of intervening variables influencing this relationship. No significant impact was found on the price and product competition in the context of Sri Lankan manufacturing sector indicating that supplier switching costs do not play a significant role on these variables. Yet, there may be an influence from intervening variables due to internal organisational situation and external factors such as market conditions. Switching suppliers is not a big problem for some companies because they already have well-defined supplier networks with multiple providers for the same raw materials [1]. However, this differs based on companies’ relationships with suppliers (long-term or short-term contracts) and the availability of resource supplies [2].</jats:p>"

This study was carried out in addition to identifying the supply chain of sweet potato which is an important food crop in North Sumatra as well as being an additional reference in research that focuses on sweet potato commodities.This research was conducted in the area of Sei Beras Sekata, Sunggal, Deli Serdang. Respondents are actors in the supply chain, starting from farmers to consumers. The sample is determined through the snowball sampling technique because there is no sample frame. There were 29 informants in this study consisting of farmers, collectors, agents, traders and consumers.The research showed that there are three sweet potato supply chain lines, involving four marketing agencies. The first channel is a supply chain channel without intermediaries, meaning that farmers sell directly to consumers. The second channel is a channel with one intermediary, where farmers first sell sweet potatoes to retailers and then retailers sell to consumers. The third channel is the channel that has the longest chain, which involves collectors, agents, and retailers.</jats:p>"

To ensure the healthy development of the new energy vehicle industry and the security of supply of key mineral resources, it is necessary to accurately determine the supply and demand pressure of lithium resources and their sources. This study analyzes the lithium stock and flow at the end of the new energy vehicle chain by constructing a material flow analysis framework for the new energy vehicle industry and compiling a lithium resource flow table for the new energy vehicle industry, and the results show that 1) the supply and demand pressure on lithium resources in China is increasing year by year, and the external dependence of lithium resources has reached 75% in 2019; 2) China’s domestic lithium battery production and consumption accounted for nearly 70% of the lithium consumption in various industries, of which 60% of the lithium batteries were assembled on new energy vehicles, and the net outflow of lithium exceeded more than the lithium consumption of new energy vehicles in 2019. The lithium consumption of new energy vehicles was more than five times that of the previous year. Insufficient supply of domestic lithium ore, lithium inventory, and import and export are the key reasons for the pressure on lithium supply and demand in the new energy vehicle industry; 3) By the end of 2019, the cumulative scrap lithium batteries in new energy vehicles contain about 10,000 tons. The lithium accumulated in new energy vehicles has 26,500 tons. These results provide a theoretical basis for policy recommendations to ensure the healthy development of the new energy vehicle industry and to promote international cooperation in the development, utilization, and recycling of lithium resources.</jats:p>"

Most rooftop systems are behind the metre and cannot be measured by household smart meters. To overcome the challenges mentioned above, this paper proposes an online solar energy disaggregation system to decouple the solar energy generated by rooftop PV systems and the ground truth demand load from net measurements. A 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) deep learning method is used as the core algorithm of the proposed system. The system takes a wide range of online information (Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data, meteorological data, satellite-driven irradiance, and temporal information) as inputs to evaluate PV generation, and the system also enables online and offline modes. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing it to baselines. The results show that the proposed method achieves good performance under different penetration rates and different feeder levels. Finally, a transfer learning process is introduced to verify that the proposed system has good robustness and can be applied to other feeders.</jats:p>",

A high iron concentration and microbial contamination were observed in some KOTAKU boreholes, but the quality was better than that in the previous sources of the current KOTAKU borehole users. Twenty percent of the users spend more than 4% of their income on water due to bottled water and vended water for drinking and cooking. However, KOTAKU boreholes replaced that water for drinking and/or cooking, resulting in less water expenditure in low-income households. The average consumption was 134 L per capita per day (LPCD), which was higher than the target (60 LPCD) of the program. However, it was found that a highly intermittent water supply was the reason for household dissatisfaction rather than the amount of consumption. The program improved water supply; however, this study revealed the limitations of the water supply, namely, a lack of attention to continuous water supply and water quality.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The oil and gas industry plays a significant role in the economies of many countries today. Due to various factors, including oil price fluctuations, wars, sanctions, and many other instances, selling and supplying these products at low prices is necessary. As a result, the global economy may suffer as well. Supply chain management is one way to reduce the prices of these products. This study was conducted to identify supply chain management contracts in the oil and gas industry. The paper presents an application of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) for coping with uncertainty. We contribute to the literature by proposing a new hybrid MCDM method with gray numbers for ranking supply chain management contracts in the oil and gas industry. The results show that the factors for evaluating supply chain management contracts must be selected, and then according to these factors, the supply chain management contracts must be chosen. As a result, we provide our customers with the best deals and help oil and gas companies minimize their costs.</jats:p>"

This study aims to develop a new human capital framework that guides the logistics industry towards successfully implementing and managing Logistics 4.0 practices. The significance of this study is to utilize a new framework to shorten the gap between current basic logistics practices into Industry 4.0 practices. An integrative literature review technique was used thoroughly and reviewed and analyzed in order to create the Logistics 4.0 human capital development framework in a manner that satisfies the categories of logistics human capital. A combination of the business logistics management (BLM) framework and Industry 4.0 elements creates a new human capital development (HCD) framework in logistics and supply chains.</p>",

This study sets up a low-carbon collaboration evolutionary game model of the supply chain based on benefit sharing by introducing digital transformation. The equilibrium-point stability of the supply chain is then analyzed under two separate conditions—i.e., less and more government rewards and punishments compared to supply-chain agents’ strategic risk cost. Furthermore, based on the evolutionary game model, this study draws the system dynamics (SD) flow diagram to analyze the research problem quantitatively. The main results show that: (1) low-carbon benefit-driven effects promotes collaboration benefit sharing, thereby increasing the probability of low-carbon collaboration; (2) digital transformation is an essential regulator of low-carbon collaboration in the supply chain and can amplify the low-carbon benefit-driven effect; (3) collaboration benefit sharing can perfectly coordinate the vertical supply chain under low-carbon collaboration; and (4) government support and management are critical links in the low-carbon collaboration formation path of the supply chain. This research provides theoretical support for low-carbon collaboration in the supply chain under digital transformation.</jats:p>"

For the former schematic, the irradiation levels were carried out at 2 different locations, and for the later setup, the angle of inclination of the module was varied from 90° and 180° by using a single axis tracer At 90° tilted angle in Karawang test place at rest condition, morning experiment give the result of 5,69V on average while in Bogor the experiment gives 5,46V on average. At 180° tilted angle in Karawang test place at rest condition, morning experiment give the result of 5,49V on average while in afternoon experiment afternoon 3.026V on average. In Bogor test place morning experiment give solar panel 5,2V on average and 3,33V at afternoon experiment. In the electrical parameters of the module, the open circuit voltage, short circuit current, maximum power point voltage and maximum power point current decrease substantially with increasing slope angle, while the charge factor decreases somewhat gradually. Tests in both Karawang and Bogor in the afternoon and afternoon confirmed that the optimal tilt angle on cloudy on  with UV index between 1-2 in the morning and 3-4 in the afternoon on average is 180° tilted and directing the solar panel module at this angle will maximize the captured solar energy and thereby improve its performance.</jats:p>"

Indonesia has had high rainfall and temperature over the year because this country lies on the equator lines. Moreover, severe global warming occurs because of the depletion of the ozone which affects the inclement weather, air, and temperature over the years. Therefore, special equipment is required to obtain appropriate thermal conditions by controlling the temperature. This paper proposed the PI controller to maintain the temperature in their nominal values and its temperature stability is analyzed using pole placement. In this study, the system model is 1st order, called first order plus dead time (FOPDT). Pole placement is utilized to improve the output signal to obtain the gain of the PI controller. The gain of the PI controller obtained is Kp as 0.36095 and Ki as I as of 0.00072231. The percentages of overshoot and steady-state error are 29.98% and 1.5% for the Ziegler Nichols method while 1.28% and 0.26% for the PI Tunner, respectively.

The study objects conceived the possible factors that affect the stable isotopes’ composition in precipitation additionally to achieve information concerning recharge processes and estimate the groundwater recharge sources. In this study, four precipitation samples were collected at the study area for the 2020–2021 hydrological year. Thirty-two groundwater samples and one surface water sample from Lesser Zab River (LZR) were collected during the same period for two sampling seasons. The results of observed meteorological data show a very small amount of precipitation for the sampling year. This year is considered a dry hydrological year with total annual precipitation of 100.62 mm compared with the previous 40 hydrological years with total annual precipitation of 325.43 mm. The isotopic composition in precipitation was highly varied as it primarily depends on environmental conditions. The depleted values are recognized with the increasing precipitation amount, whereas the enriched values were the most affected by evaporation. Back trajectory analysis revealed that stable isotopes in precipitation are primarily influenced by air masses and moisture sources. The sources of the trajectory that came from the Mediterranean Sea, Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea would lead to variations in the values of precipitation stable isotope. Stable isotope values in groundwater showed that the samples for both periods are located between the East Mediterranean water line (EMWL) and global meteoric water line (GMWL) close to the local meteoric water line (LMWL) indicating that the groundwater recharge is mainly through precipitation. Groundwater recharges by an indirect recharge mechanism from the LZR, based on stable isotope similarity between depleted stable isotopes in groundwater and river water. The estimated groundwater recharge based on weighted oxygen isotopes is about 9.2% of annual rainfall infers that the recharge during the sampling year was very low. The low recharge value experiences dry weather conditions from low precipitation amounts besides increasing evaporation during the current study.</jats:p>",

We also use ordered logit models to examine which factors and quality indicators influence organic wheat quality ratings alone and when compared to conventional wheat. Study data were collected in the winter of 2020/2021 through two online surveys. Results show that both bakers and millers/distributors rated wheat quality and consistent quality from suppliers as very important and that they consider protein quality and content as primary indicators of quality. However, they differ in their ratings of organic quality, as bakers perceive organic wheat to be of higher quality than conventional wheat and millers just the opposite. There was also disparity in their importance ratings for other wheat quality indicators. This study provides pertinent findings on the perceptions and needs of organic wheat buyers across the supply chain. Study findings will be especially informative to organic wheat growers, breeders, and researchers seeking to improve organic wheat quality and yields.</jats:p>",

One way to solve this problem is to provide energy in the transportation sector in a sustainable way, by using renewable energy. An integrated renewable energy system has been implemented through an optimization model for the supply of electricity and hydrogen energy for road transportation. The proposed model is in the form of mixed-integer linear programming with two objective functions: planning costs and greenhouse gas emissions. The multi-objective model was solved using the linear weighted-sum method. In this article, three scenarios are developed, namely the business-as-usual scenario, the renewable energy scenario, and the renewable energy with energy storage system scenario. The business-as-usual scenario is used to analyze the supply of electricity and hydrogen by prioritizing the objective function of planning costs. The renewable energy scenario prioritizes the objective function of greenhouse gas emissions in the optimization calculation, but without an energy storage system. The optimization calculation with the renewable energy with energy storage system scenario prioritizes the objective function of greenhouse gas emissions by including the energy storage system. The proposed model in a multi-objective form is implemented in a case study of road transportation in the Province of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The results obtained indicate that the renewable energy with energy storage system scenario produces the lowest emission level of 56.55 Mt CO2 Equivalent, but with the highest planning cost of 192.13 x 109 Billion USD.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply-chain systems (SCSs) are an indispensable part of our daily infrastructures. Note that a small perturbation in a SCS can be amplified, eliciting cascading failures. It is of significant value to ensure a high resilience of SCSs. However, due to the complexity of SCSs, it is quite challenging to study their resilience under conditions of perturbations. In view of this, this paper presents a complex network perspective toward the resilience of SCSs. To achieve this goal, a complex SCS is modeled as a multilayer supply-chain network (SCN) with physical organizations being modeled as nodes and interactions among them as edges. A modeled SCN contains three types of nodes, i.e., suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers. An algorithm is proposed to construct a multilayer SCN. For each layer of a multilayer SCN, two kinds of networks, i.e., networks with Poisson degree distributions and networks with power-law degree distributions, are considered. For a given multilayer SCN, a ripple-effect network model is proposed to analyze its resilience under perturbations. Regarding the perturbations, two scenarios, i.e., random node failures and target node failures, are adopted in this research. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed network perspective, simulations on computer-generated SCNs are carried out. Interestingly, it is found that the resilience of SCNs under both random and target perturbations presents a discontinuous phase-change phenomenon, which indicates that SCNs are quite fragile under perturbations. It is further noticed that SCNs with power-law degree distributions are relatively more robust than SCNs with Poisson degree distributions. Although SCNs are found to be fragile, it has been discovered that denser interactions between different system organizations can enhance the network’s resilience.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the main goals of creating a wholesale electricity market in the Russian Federation was to reduce the prices for circulating electricity. The achievement of this goal was supposed to be due to the development of competitive energy market relations, equal access to electricity supply services to consumers among all participants of the energy market, transparency and structuring of the electricity pricing mechanism. Traditionally, the regions with the lowest prices for supplied electricity in Russia are the territories of the Siberian United Energy System, where the demand for electricity is provided by cheap hydro generation, which ensures the competitiveness of the Siberian economy and high investment potential in the industrial sector. The article presents an empirical analysis of the dynamic changes in the parameters of the total cost of electricity sold in the regions of Russia included various federal districts with a comparison of the cost of electricity in the Siberian Federal District regions with other territories of Russia, with the identification of key trends and features of changes. Analysis of the dynamics of changes in the components of the cost of electricity on various territories for the period January 2021 – March 2022 revealed a significant increase in the cost of electric energy and electric capacity. Their dynamics in some cases exceeds 30 %, and led to a significant increase in prices for electricity sold to all groups of consumers operating in the United Energy System of Siberia regions, and in particular on territories of the Krasnoyarsk Krai and the Republic of Khakassia. The presented article emphasizes the need to study the factors and pricing conditions affecting the change in price parameters for power supplied to consumers operating in the regions of the Siberian United Energy System, with the development of follow-up measures to manage the increase in prices for electricity (capacity) in these regions.</jats:p>"

This  study  conducted  a  thematic  analysis  using  the  ATLAS.ti  9  software.  The  findings  of  this  study  relating  to  the  demand-supply  mismatch  can  be  classified  into  three,  which  are:  i)  the  mismatch  between  industry  demand  and  TVET  programme  supply;  ii)  the  mismatch between  student  demand  and  TVET  programme  supply;  and  iii)  the  mismatch  between  institution  readiness  and  TVET programme supply. Following these findings, this study proposed a realignment of the TVET programme by taking  into  consideration  all  stakeholders’  necessities.  As  a  result,  the  demand-supply  will  be  balanced,  thus  increasing  the  employability  of  the  local  graduates.  It  is  beneficial  for  future  research  to  employ  an  appropriate  framework  of  alignment  when  examining  TVET  academic  programmes,  taking  into  account  the  needs  of  all  stakeholders to guarantee that TVET programmes remain relevant.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, the decision variables contained in the model include the product volume ordered by each supplier at each time for each product type and those stored in the inventory to minimize the total operational cost in the problem. The corresponding optimization problem was solved using a probabilistic programming algorithm via the LINGO optimization tool. The computational simulation showed the proposed model provided the optimal decision, and this means it can be used as a decision-making tool by industrial practitioners.</p>",

In fact, the families of the deceased had to assume the main responsibility for providing funerals for ordinary citizens. Funeral homes were replaced by handicraftsmen who provided separate funeral services as a source of additional income.

However, the traditional development of forestry is currently facing the dilemma of insufficient resource supply, rising labor cost, and a low return on forestry investment, which needs to be transformed into high-quality forestry development. The general view is that synergistic development is an important way to achieve high-quality development. Based on this, the strategic planning and behavioral choices of forestry enterprises under synergistic development are explored. With the objectives of minimizing cost and environmental impacts, and maximizing social benefits, a multi-objective sustainable closed-loop supply chain network planning model is developed to study a real case of a forestry supply chain in northeastern China. A robust optimization approach is used to deal with the relevant uncertain parameters, and a weighted generalized epsilon-constraint approach is applied to solve the multi-objective problem, based on which a GA genetic algorithm is used to solve it. Based on the synergistic development perspective, four different scenario assumptions and sensitivity analyses are made to examine the multi-objective calculation results in this closed-loop supply chain network, and then to analyze the strategic decisions and specific measures for forest industry enterprises to achieve high-quality development. The model results show that realizing supply chain synergy is an effective way to achieve efficient business development in the future. Managers should also establish an acceptable balance between sustainability dimensions while focusing on building a collaborative supply chain development model, where small economic benefits can be appropriately ignored to reduce the harmful effects of the production process on the environment.</jats:p>"

The methodology, divided into four steps, defines the criteria that allow identification of promising scenarios of biomass supply chains for commercial application of innovative technologies. The model set up a scoring procedure based on carbon emission avoidance, efficient resource exploitation and sustainability indexes. Applying the four levels of analysis (biomass availability, suitability analysis, regionalization and multi-criteria analysis), the cereal straw supply chains in four European districts (Scandinavian, Hanseatic, Central European and Mediterranean) have been identified and grouped in 18 biomass supply regional clusters (BSRCs). The clusters represent the most promising hotspots where biomass availability, logistics and feedstock requirements for a novel conversion technology meet. Central European and Mediterranean districts are those with the highest cereal straw bioeconomic potentials which allow mono-feedstock supply chains and relatively high capacity of a conversion technology at 200 MWth and beyond. Central Europe has an overall bioeconomic potential of 16.249 kt (232.359 TJ) distributed over 36 regions and organized in 12 BSRCs. The Mediterranean district has an overall bioeconomic potential of 3541 kt (50.630 TJ) distributed over nine regions and organized in four BSRCs.</jats:p>"

Problems have emerged with maintaining supply chains, maintaining production capacity, rising prices, difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components, financial liquidity, being cut off from eastern markets and the outflow of Ukrainian workers. Problems are also exacerbated by sanctions against Russia, which have caused price increases in energy raw materials, metals and food, as well as time and form of transportation. Entrepreneurs operating in the current realities are exposed to default, failure to pay on time, failure to meet obligations, changes in payment terms, setting new delivery schedules, negotiating insurance and credit terms, concluding and terminating trade agreements. Often the actions of other companies are not malicious, but are due to the fact of standstills and similar problems. Going to court is not the best solution due to the long time of hearings, costs and emerging mutual resentment.

Firstly, the working principle of the new double full bridge ZVZCS converter of beam power supply is analyzed, and considering the parasitic parameters and effective duty cycle of circuit components, the small signal equivalent model under two working modes is established. Secondly, combined with the system model and linear active disturbance rejection control theory, a double closed-loop controller is designed, which takes the second-order LADRC as the outer voltage loop and PI control as the inner current loop. Finally, the simulation and experimental results show that the designed controller has stronger robustness, anti-interference and better dynamic response speed than the traditional double closed-loop PI controller in load switching and dual-mode switching, and has a good development prospect.</jats:p>"

Network sections that feed the substations are a bottleneck in the traction power supply system. It is proposed to increase the efficiency by switching the connection of the windings of transformers of traction substations to the systems of external and traction power supply according to the typical star – delta scheme. Such a connection will ensure an increase in the speed of trains, a reduction in train succession time and losses of electricity, an increase in the quality of electric energy in the external power supply system and electric networks of the Far Eastern Directorate for Energy Supply (a structural subdivision of Transenergo, a branch of Russian Railways).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Discussion and conclusion. </jats:bold>Normalisation of the connection of four traction substations according to the feeding scheme is ensured by changing the phasing in such a way that the power supply of the two legs of one winding of the power transformer is transferred to two windings. Alignment of the current modules in the windings of transformers of traction substations makes it possible to reduce the voltage drop in the most loaded phase and, accordingly, increase the voltage in the traction network, which ensures an increase in the speed of trains and a reduction in passing intervals. Switching the power supply of the arms from one winding of the transformer to two reduces the loss of electrical energy in power transformers and the external power supply system. Reducing the current unbalance in the windings of the power transformer improves the quality of electrical energy in the system of external and district power supply. An increase in the service life of the power transformer is ensured by a decrease in the intensity of thermal wear of the insulation of the most loaded winding.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Disruption during Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for healthcare supply chain management in order to achieve effective delivery of health services. Though considerable efforts have been undertaken on managing the healthcare supply chain disruptions in India but there is a paucity of literature that documented the effect of supply chain disruptions in dental practices during a covid-19 pandemic. During a pandemic, the disruptions in production and distribution of dental products were seen in India. Indian dental market is largely dependent on imports and there is a scarcity of local production units. The main dental companies reported a significant decline in production during the first wave of Covid-19. The increase in demand for dental supplies was seen with a shutdown, shortage of labor, and scarcity of raw materials. Disruption rippled through the supply chain and this was caused by a large distortion in demand. This phenomenon led to the bullwhip effect. This bullwhip effect crisis led to increased costs in dental practices. Covid19 has shown a significant lack of resilience in the Indian dental healthcare supply chain. This study identified a few loopholes in the dental supply chain and suggested a way forward for managing the supply chain disruptions. It seems that there is a need for more comprehensive research on dental supply chain resilience from an Indian perspective to prevent disruptions, particularly in emergent situations.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the components of the sustainable supply chain in the food industry. For this purpose, in the first step, several studies and research backgrounds have been conducted by researchers to identify the effective index on sustainability in the food and agricultural supply chain. After reviewing the literature, general indicators of sustainability that affect the agricultural supply chain are specified. Next, by using the fuzzy DEMATEL method, the effectiveness and efficiency of these criteria in three economic, environmental, and social dimensions have been assessed. The results show that in the economic dimension, the use of high technology in the production and the presentation of various citrus forms by using intermediate and conversion industries is the most effective. Criteria for purchasing and using livestock manure instead of using chemical fertilizers have a very high level of effectiveness. In the environmental dimension, reducing or eliminating waste production using recyclable and environmentally friendly materials has the most significant impact. In the social dimension, the positive mental image of customers has a more positive approach to manufacturers who use a sustainable supply chain and has the most impact. The main achievement of this study is that the most important factor in sustainability is the citrus quality control of the agricultural supply chain.</jats:p>",

This article proposes a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model with targets for minimum total cost, reduction in environmental damage, and maximum social responsibility. In order to deal with the uncertainty caused by the dynamic business environment, a fuzzy robust programming (FRP) approach is applied. Furthermore, an efficiency-oriented optimization methodology, hybridizing meta-heuristics and efficiency evaluation, is proposed to solve the developed multi-objective model and functions as auxiliary decision-making. Data envelopment analysis is applied to evaluate the sustainability performance of feasible solutions and calculate their efficiency. The efficiency can comprehensively reflect the sustainability performance and guide the evolution process of meta-heuristic algorithms. A numerical case validates the proposed FRP model and efficiency-oriented optimization methodology. The results demonstrate that with the proposed methodology, decision-makers not only can obtain a set of efficient schemes but also can determine the optimal scheme with the best sustainability performance.</jats:p>"

We use UK longitudinal data to investigate within households both the labor supply and informal care responses of an individual to the event of an acute health shock to their partner. Relying on the unanticipated timing of shocks, we combine Coarsened Exact Matching and Entropy Balancing algorithms with parametric analysis and exploit lagged outcomes to remove bias from observed confounders and time‐invariant unobservables. We find no evidence of a health‐related Added Worker Effect but a significant and sizable Informal Carer Effect. This holds irrespective of spousal labor market position or household financial status and ability to purchase formal care provision, suggesting that partners' substitute informal care provision for time devoted to leisure activities.</jats:p>",

The present paper also aims to apply the response surface methodology for the evaluation of the effect of different parameters on the degradation rate. The optimum parameters were found to be 50 min of reaction time, 2.2 g/l of the ZnO catalyst mass, 30 °C, 280 V, and 80 mg/l of initial concentration under a constant ultrasonic treatment at 20 kHz and 260 W of power intensity. The elemental composition of the catalyst was as follows: Zn 25.18%, O 37.03%, Mg 3.20%, K 0.83%, Ca 4.05%, N 5.07%, Na 4.13%, Cl 3.43%, and Fe 0.32%. Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) confirmed the Zn–O bond stretching at 510 cm−1. The degradation efficiency of naphthalene was almost double when the ZnO catalyst was used. The naphthalene degradation rate was a first-order reaction. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results show that the quadratic model is suitable for the obtained data (P-value = 0.0001) and in an optimal process, performance conditions were set equal to 100%. Regression analysis with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.989) and the model F-value of 6.94 indicated the adequacy of the model. The reusability study revealed that ZnO as a catalyst sustained the catalytic activity over five cycles.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An automotive supply chain includes a range of activities from the concept of the product to its final transfer to a customer and subsequent vehicle maintenance. The three distinct stages of this chain are production, sales, and maintenance. In many countries, automobile records are not available to the public and anyone who has access to the central database or government systems can tamper with these records. In addition, used vehicle maintenance and transfer histories remain unavailable or inaccessible. These issues can be overcome by incorporating state-of-the-art blockchain technology into automotive supply chain management. Blockchain technology uses a chain of blocks for distributed transfer and storage of information, creating a decentralized data register that makes records of any digital asset tamper-proof and transparent. In this paper, we implement a permissioned blockchain-based framework for secure and efficient supply chain management of the automobile industry. We employed Hyperledger Fabric; an enterprise-grade distributed ledger platform for developing solutions. In our solution, the blockchain is customized and private in order to ensure system security. We evaluated our system in terms of memory cost, monetary cost, and speed of execution. Our results demonstrate that only 346 MB of extra memory space is required for storing the automotive data of 1 million users, thus rendering the memory cost negligible. The monetary cost is insignificant as all open source blockchain resources are employed, and the speed of record update is also fast. Our results also show that the decentralization of the automotive supply chain using blockchain can implement system security with minor modifications in the established configuration of the web application database.</jats:p>"

Based on a sample of US buyer–supplier pairs from 1982 to 2017, we find that DO benefits buyer performance, but not supplier performance. The results support the view that DO mainly provides greater control for the buyer. Furthermore, we find that the performance effects of DO are moderated by firm characteristics that engender dependence. The beneficial influence of DO on a buyer's performance is more pronounced when the buyer is more innovative or operates in a more competitive environment. Our examination of the effects of DO on the operations of suppliers and buyers finds that suppliers in buyer–supplier relationships (BSRs) with higher DO invest more in relationship‐specific assets (R&amp;D), provide more trade credits, and have lower gross profit margins. Buyers in BSRs with higher DO receive more trade credits and have lower cost of goods sold when the purchases of the buyer from the supplier make up a high proportion of the buyer's cost of goods sold. Overall, these results suggest that DO primarily benefits the buyer at the expense of the supplier, a finding that is consistent with the effects of bargaining and control power of the buyer. We discuss the implications of these findings for practitioners and for extensions to both relational and resource dependence theories.</jats:p>",

Developing effective nutrient management strategies requires improvements to nitrogen (N) mass balances, including the identification and quantification of previously unrecognized anthropogenic N fluxes. Using publicly available data, we establish that freshwater abstractions from both surface waters and groundwaters, alongside watermains leakage from public distribution networks, are responsible for significant nitrate‐N (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐N) fluxes across the contiguous United States. Nationally, freshwater abstraction temporarily retains 417 (min‐max: 190–857) kt NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐N yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, equivalent to 21% of pastureland N uptake and 2% of previous global abstraction‐N flux estimates.

Although generically the cost of tubulars could be ranging around 9-10% of the total well cost (based on PC Ketapang II Ltd. Operation), it is an integral part of the well that protects the company’s millions of dollars investment throughout the life of the well. As such, it is crucial to ensure company able to procure and utilize acceptable quality of tubulars for its operations to minimize potential operational risk, schedule and cost impact.Indonesia has many capable local mills that are certified by American Petroleum Institute (API) and recognized by the host authority as registered in Buku Data Kemampuan Nasional Industri Penunjang Migas Nasional Tahun 2021 by SKK Migas(1). However, the process and assessment result for these mills to be registered was not easy to be accessed to identify any gap with operator's standard. In order to support the aspiration by host authority to utilize local products, specifically to support the local pipe industries, the oil and gas operator as the investor shall also fulfil internal requirement to assess the pipe manufacturers in Indonesia, specifically. The assessment was conducted successfully and shows that the local mills in Indonesia have Quality Management System (QMS) and QAQC process that meets both international standards and company internal requirement. By having this assessment process, the potential risk can be minimized and local supply chain challenge can be mitigated to contribute in Indonesia Government’s aspiration towards 1 Million BOPD and 12 BSCFD target in 2030.</jats:p>",

These difficulties are perceived by households each time they fetch drinking water or try to get access to potable water for other household activities. This study aims to assess the problem of potable water supply in the Yaounde III Subdivisions’ neighbourhoods and the coping strategies developed by citizens to meet their needs. To achieve this objective, 300 households were selected and investigated based on purposive and systematic random sampling, particularly in the most densely populated neighbourhoods. We proceeded by identifying the different water supply sources of households for their various needs, and assessing the difficulties encountered in getting water and how they overcome them. Results reveal that in Yaounde III Subdivision only 34.33% of the households are supplied by the Cameroon Water Utilities Corporation (CAMWATER), while 65.67% rely on alternative water supply sources (wells, drillings and springs) without any pre-treatment. Among those connected to CAMWATER network, 46.6% do not have a regular water flow. Results also revealed that water sources were located at reasonable distances (less than 1 kilometre) and that 70% of households take less than 30 minutes to fetch water. Failure in water supply is mainly caused by the insufficient pumping capacity of the existing potable water treatment plants which lead to rationing and shortages, but also to rapid population growth and city extension not followed by the extension of the potable water distribution network. To fill the gap in water supply, it is imperative for public authorities to quickly achieve the project on water supply from the Sanaga River. Also, CAMWATER should extend its distribution network and improve its maintenance system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: Although it is well known that a reseller’s ability to hold strategic inventory under a short-term supply contract can potentially benefit both the reseller and a supplier, existing research on strategic inventory focuses almost exclusively on exclusive reselling environments. However, in practice, multiple suppliers often sell to the same nonexclusive reseller, and it is not uncommon for suppliers to ask for future commitments to order quantities from resellers in return for their own commitment to wholesale prices. We investigate how the possibility of strategic inventory influences competing suppliers’ choices between short-term transactional and long-term commitment contracts to a nonexclusive reseller. Methodology/results: Using a game-theoretic model, we consider the interactions between two partially substitutable suppliers and a single, nonexclusive reseller over a two-period horizon in which demand is deterministic. We demonstrate that in nonexclusive reselling environments, where more than one supplier sells its product through the same reseller, the use of strategic inventory under short-term contracts intensifies the price competition between suppliers. We show how this effect can be mitigated when one or both suppliers offer a long-term contract. Moreover, we show that long-term contracts can arise as an equilibrium outcome, particularly when products are more substitutable or holding costs are large. Managerial implications: By considering the interactions between two partially substitutable suppliers and a nonexclusive reseller in a multiperiod setting, we contribute to the literature on strategic contracting and long versus short-term contracts. Our research provides managers with a new explanation, beyond the need to encourage idiosyncratic investments or eliminate the possibility of hold-up, for why long-term contracts may benefit suppliers in practice, who face competition while selling through a nonexclusive reseller. </jats:p>",

The existing dwellings often require energy renovations to make them suitable for lower temperature heating. However, choosing renovation strategies that promote the transition to lower temperature district heating while improving energy efficiency and thermal comfort is challenging. This study aims to identify minimum renovation requirements for comfortably heating homes using lower temperature heat from district heating. Identifying minimum renovation strategies to prepare existing dwellings for lower temperature district heating would be vital in addressing the European Renovation Wave’s target of improving worst-performing buildings. For the same, the study uses a typical intermediate terraced house built before 1945 as a case study to investigate renovation strategies based on four levels of renovation intervention (no renovation, basic, moderate and deep). The impact of renovations on space heating demand and thermal comfort was tested with medium (70/50°C) and low supply (55/35°C) temperatures against key performance indicators (KPIs) using dynamic simulation.

Compared to other renewable technologies FLOWPs are complex structures that consist of extremely heavy components. FLOWP construction requires floaters, turbines (towers, rotors and nacelles), mooring and anchoring systems, dynamic inter array and export (offshore and onshore) cables, in addition to the electrical substations (offshore and onshore). The requirements in terms of heavy raw materials (cement, steel, etc.) should ideally be met by the local supply chain. This is particularly important given the consideration of local commitments in many seabed leasing rounds or for authorisation processes. There is a strong inter-dependency between the success of FLOWPs and the presence of a well organised and developed local supply chain. Local procurement of the goods and services for the construction and maintenance of the FLOWP would have a positive impact on the local industrial sector. However, there is a risk that the local supply chain will not make the necessary timely investment required to be able to meet the demand of materials and components to support local FLOWPs. This would be a loss for the local economy but also for the developers. Two approaches are discussed which may help mitigate such risk.</jats:p>",

The flower pollination algorithm performs the positioning function in the intelligent logistics system and supply chain management. Based on the research on the design of the intelligent logistics system and supply chain management under the EC and IoT, this thesis analyzes the positioning of intelligent logistics systems and supply chain management through the flower pollination algorithm. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is used to predict user information in the system of supply chain management information. Finally, the operation of intelligent logistics and supply chain management systems, the prediction model of supply chain management under XGBoost, and the change of supply chain management and material flow are analyzed. The results show that with the increase in the number of iterations, the optimized algorithm improves the comparison distance error by 53.57%, which has high accuracy and can meet the requirements of positioning and tracking of the intelligent logistics system and logistics status query in supply chain management. The waiting time of the intelligent logistics system is shorter than that of the supply chain management system, and the average waiting time of the system increases by 121.252 ms. The XGBoost model can well predict user information under supply chain management. After discussing the changes of the intelligent logistics system from 2018 to 2020, it is found that the operation efficiency of the supply management system is higher with the increase of the system operation days. The intelligent logistics system has a significant impact on the development of the logistics industry. This research gives a reference for establishing the intelligent logistics system and supply chain management system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative tool for enhancing transparency, traceability, and security within supply chain management, particularly in the renewable energy sector. With increasing global demand for renewable energy sources, the complexity of managing decentralized supply chains has grown, necessitating more robust systems for tracking resources, transactions, and ensuring compliance. Blockchain offers a decentralized, immutable ledger that ensures all transactions are recorded transparently and cannot be altered, providing a foundation for greater accountability and trust among stakeholders. In renewable energy supply chains, blockchain can effectively address several critical challenges, including the verification of the origin of materials, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries. This ensures that the sourcing of raw materials is done ethically, sustainably, and in line with environmental and social governance standards. Furthermore, blockchain facilitates real-time tracking of products from manufacturing to deployment, offering enhanced visibility and reducing the risk of fraud, theft, or errors. The integration of blockchain with Internet of Things (IoT) devices can further optimize the renewable energy supply chain by enabling automatic data recording and monitoring of the performance and condition of energy assets. This leads to improved asset management and predictive maintenance, thus reducing operational costs and increasing efficiency. Additionally, smart contracts powered by blockchain can automate and streamline transactions, reducing paperwork and delays, and ensuring compliance with contractual obligations. Overall, the application of blockchain in renewable energy supply chains holds significant promise in driving sustainability, reducing inefficiencies, and fostering collaboration between various stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, and end-users. By leveraging blockchain's capabilities, the renewable energy sector can build more transparent, secure, and efficient supply chains, contributing to a more sustainable energy future.</jats:p>"

Gap junction protein 26 (connexin26, Cx26) encoded by the <jats:italic>GJB2</jats:italic> gene, which is responsible for intercellular substance transfer and signal communication, plays a critical role in hearing acquisition and maintenance. The auditory character of different Connexin26 transgenic mice models can be classified into two types: profound congenital deafness and late-onset progressive hearing loss. Recent studies demonstrated that there are pathological changes including endocochlear potential reduction, active cochlear amplification impairment, cochlear developmental disorders, and so on, in connexin26 deficiency mice. Here, this review summarizes three main hypotheses to explain pathological mechanisms of connexin26-related hearing loss: potassium recycling disruption, adenosine-triphosphate-calcium signaling propagation disruption, and energy supply dysfunction. Elucidating pathological mechanisms underlying connexin26-related hearing loss can help develop new protective and therapeutic strategies for this common deafness. It is worthy of further study on the detailed cellular and molecular upstream mechanisms to modify connexin (channel) function.</jats:p>"

We sought to determine how species composition, climate, seasonality, and nutrient availability influence leaf toughness in two types of tundra in northern Alaska. We measured leaf toughness as force to punch for 11 species of Arctic plants in tussock tundra and dry heath tundra at 17 sites distributed along a latitudinal gradient. Rubus chamaemorus L. and the graminoids occupied opposite ends of the leaf toughness spectrum, with Rubus chamaemorus requiring the least force to punch, whereas one of the graminoids, Eriophorum vaginatum L., required the most. Leaf toughness increased with mean summer temperature for Eriophorum vaginatum and Betula nana L., whereas it declined with warmer temperatures for the other species. Toughness of mature leaves of Eriophorum vaginatum did not vary through the growing season but declined significantly after senescence. Application of N and P fertilizer in an experimental site decreased leaf toughness in three species but had no effect on four others. Leaf toughness of four out of five species in dry heath was greater than for the same species in tussock tundra, but there was no difference in community-weighted mean toughness between tussock tundra and dry heath. </jats:p>",

At the initial stage, the identification of supply chain events is done by doing interviews and brainstorming. Then, these events are portrayed in the supply chain map. Then, the risk identification stage used a rating scale to determine the level of likelihood and consequence based on three SCOR elements. There are 40 risk events in this study which are 13 risk events in the source section, 19 risk events in the make section, and eight risk events in the delivery section. Finally, it is necessary to calculate the value of the Risk Priority Index (RPI). The RPI is the basis of the risk mapping stage. The risk map will show the urgency to treat each risk event.</jats:p>"

Methods: A retrospective chart review was completed for a cohort of patients prescribed an oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and/or a statin. Data were categorized into 90-day-supply and less than 90-day-supply and on the minimum value for control determined by the CMS Star Ratings system. Adherence was defined by the Health Plan Quality Improvement Department as ≥ 85% of days covered. Clinical biomarker cutoffs were HbA1c (&lt;9% or ≥ 9%), BP (Systolic BP ≤ 140 mm Hg and &gt;140 mm Hg or Diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg regardless of SBP), and LDL (&lt;100 mg/dl or ≥100 mg/dl). Results: The analysis included 251 patients: 159 females (mean 64.9 ± 11.7 years) and 92 males (mean 61.5 ± 11.3 years). Patients with medications from multiple classes were included in more than one analysis. Adherence was statistically in favor of the 90-day-supply compared to less than 90-day-supply for all three classes of drugs. The clinical biomarkers were statistically not different for each drug group. Conclusion: A 90-day-supply was statistically greater than a less than 90-day-supply for CMS Star Ratings metrics, but was not statistically significant for clinical biomarkers for HbA1c, SBP, and LDL. </jats:p>",

The operation of such a system must be managed effectively for sustainable water supply to satisfy the growing consumer demand. This creates a need for intelligent systems for the purposes of operational management. In recent years, computing technologies have been applied to water systems to assist water utilities in addressing some of these problems. Unfortunately, previous ICT solutions have not been able to provide the necessary support for applications to deal with the dynamics of water supply system environments. With the increasing growth in technology, the water sector is moving to the full phase of digitalization to enhance the sustainability of systems. Thus, a new industrial revolution in the water context (Water 4.0) is being researched. This is referred to as Water 4.0, which offers better possibilities to enhance the sustainability of water supply system operations. This paper presents an overview of Water 4.0 and its applications in enhancing water supply system operations. Key features of Water 4.0 are discussed. Furthermore, challenges and future opportunities offered by technology for sustainable operation of municipal water services are discussed.</jats:p>"

The present study used the master-slave game model to analyze the dual-channel supply chain structure, where the manufacturer is the leader of the game, and the seller is the follower of the game. Based on the game analysis theory, the game order of manufacturer and seller is analyzed in the state of demand information sharing. The decision model of each member in the dual-channel supply chain is constructed, and the optimal production decision and product price decision under the demand information sharing between the seller and the manufacturer are determined by the reverse induction method. The expected economic benefits of both are calculated, respectively. The experimental results showed that the economic benefit of the model is higher than that of the traditional demand information nonsharing model, which could enhance the economic benefit of the manufacturer and the seller at the same time and alleviate the contradiction between the electronic direct selling channel and the traditional selling channel.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Continuous increase in energy demand has been tied to population increase and improved economic well-being of the people. As the world’s population continues to grow geometrically, energy supply has been a major concern, especially, since the last two decades. Nigeria is no exception to this and it’s even worse affected, because of its lack of adequate planning for its teeming population. From the present predicament of the country, it is obvious that other sources of energy generation mostly renewable - hydro-electric, solar, and wind which are more reliable and environmental friendly be explored as the dependency on the generated power using fossil fuel to the national grid has not helped in anyway. Hence, the need to explore other power alternatives, especially the renewables one. This study was therefore designed to investigate the potential of municipal water supply schemes in Osun State as a means of developing small hydropower plant using Okinni dam as a case study. Field survey was conducted through which key information about Okinni dam was obtained. The dam gives a conversion advantage with its water flow rate ranging between 7.71m3/s and 12.85m3/s based on the season of the year and also a height (head) above ground level of 20m. The collected field parameters were utilised in the standard hydropower equations. The results obtained from the analysis gives a theoretical all year round of 3.1MW of electrical power. Comparing this result with the minimum power demand of 2.1MW and maximum power demand of 3.7MW of the inhabitants of the Okinni town, the Okinni dam services, Ede water works and some residential building at Ede water works, would require a two daily operations whereby the load are carefully selected on 12 hourly bases (Day and Night). This study has thus established the potential and viability of the construction of a small hydropower (SHP) on Okinni dam which will improve the town’s commercial and industrial enterprise; hence, this project is recommended for construction.</jats:p>"

In addition, the ABC classification method is also used to classify items based on the level of usage. The results of this study are in the form of value limits for safety stock, minimum stock, and maximum stock. Then the priority item classification must be managed.

Understanding the channels through which conservation affects agricultural activities and livelihoods in these regions is key to designing effective policies and promoting sustainable development. To this end, we use labor supply data from Indonesia in 2007 and 2015 combined with a matching strategy to estimate the impacts of a national forest conservation policy, the forest moratorium, on local agricultural labor. Consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model, we find robust empirical evidence that the moratorium increased local agricultural employment and slowed structural transformation away from the agricultural sector. We provide corresponding evidence of decreased household expenditure due to the moratorium. Despite the moratorium, we find significant deforestation and forest degradation within the boundaries of the moratorium‐targeted areas, suggesting that increases in local agricultural employment may partly dampen the conservation policy's effectiveness. Our work offers new insights into evaluating existing conservation policies and designing future policies for Indonesia and other resource‐dependent economies that face similar challenges in balancing economic growth with conservation.</jats:p>",

We investigate the financial performance of agricultural commodities' supply chain amid external uncertainty shocks in both time and frequency dimensions. The wavelet techniques are employed for the analysis. Specifically, both the Windowed Scalogram Difference (WSD) and Wavelet Multiple techniques are utilized. First, the study finds from the WSD that disruption which we proxy with global economic policy uncertainty (GEPU) hurts all the agricultural commodities in the medium and long terms. For instance, we find high comovements between agricultural raw material (ARM) and GEPU. This is similar to the comovements between rice and GEPU. Additionally, high potential comovements between 2005 and 2016 in the medium and long term for fertilizer, maize, and possibly wheat with the GEPU are found. Generally, there seem to be fewer comovements between soybeans and the GEPU which is indicative of a resistance to shocks. Second, we find from the Wavelet Multiple approaches that most of the agricultural commodities are highly integrated, except rice. Findings from the study imply minimization of diversification, hedge, or safe haven benefits with regard to market conditions among the commodities. The findings have important inferences for policymakers, supply chain actors of agricultural commodities, and investors to extensively examine the heterogeneous and adaptive dynamics of the commodity markets. We advocate that supply chains of agricultural commodities must be borne with dynamic capacities to manage vulnerabilities in an uncertain environment, necessitating resilience capabilities to thrive in the long run. Also, investors should hedge against the portfolio risk present in these agricultural commodities. This study is the first to provide insights into the supply chain of agricultural commodities from a financial perspective through time and/or frequency analysis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Closed lakes and oceans are stratigraphically distinct systems. However, closed-lake stratigraphy is often interpreted using conventional sequence stratigraphic concepts which were generated for marine settings. As a consequence, lacustrine stratigraphy has long been vexing and applied on an ad-hoc basis. To remedy this, we present a novel, unified sequence stratigraphic model for hydrologically closed (endorheic) basins: the Supply-Generated Sequence (SGS) Model. This model was generated to interpret our outcrop-based correlation—the largest to date at ∼ 30 km—across the Sunnyside Interval member of the middle Green River Formation in Nine Mile Canyon near Price, Utah, USA. The SGS model is based on the fundamental sedimentological and hydrodynamic differences between closed lakes and marine settings wherein the relationship between water discharge and sediment discharge is highly correlated. The SGS model divides packages of genetic lacustrine strata by bounding correlative surfaces, conformable or unconformable, separating facies and surfaces associated with low clastic supply (e.g., carbonates, mudstones, or exposure surfaces) from facies characteristic of relatively higher amounts of clastic supply (subaerial channelized sandstones, subaqueous siltstones, and pedogenic mudstones). We use the SGS model to correlate regional sequences at a higher resolution than previous interpretations and find the greatest amount of clastic deposition occurs during periods of lake-level rise, indicating that the SGSs are characteristically transgressive. Additionally, this model removes the implicit and explicit base-level assumptions of previous sequence stratigraphic models while being agnostic to the source of increased sediment discharge and therefore generalizable to other closed lacustrine settings. We use the high-resolution supply-generated sequences (meters thick) to argue for a climatic origin of the cyclic Sunnyside interval deposits based on sequence durations (40–50 kyr), and aligning sequences with recognized early Eocene transitory hyperthermal event timing and their associated climatic shifts across the region, increasing riverine discharge of sediment and water.</jats:p>",

Innovation introduces supply-side vision, reforms educational theory structurally, and accelerates the transformation of classroom style. Let teachers and students leave the shackles of the classroom, learn from various sources of knowledge, and carry out personalized learning from their own areas of interest. The results show that (1) after data fusion, the credibility of ideological and political knowledge is 91%, which is better than other methods.

In the current scenario the demand and price of fossil fuels is increasing rapidly and availability also is not sufficient to the needs, an alternative identification to power generation is solar and wind energies. The purpose of designing an aimed, single switch boosted voltage and current suppressor (SS-BVCS) converter topology that interfaces both the wind and solar hybrid model. The method involves in the proposed chopper converter is derived by simply merging a switch and a pair of diodes and CLC filter which is used in realization of zero voltage switching for the main switch and a reversing diode to extract high voltage gain. The designed SS-BVCS converter topology can able to have a tight self-control on two power-processing paths. The novelty of the SS-BVCS converter module is designed to ensure maximum throughput, feeding to the load with high quality uninterrupted output, by boosting the DC voltage to a required amount and thereby supressing the current. Practical value obtained by the developed model utilizes both the sources for supply to the load individually or combined based on the extraction availability of the feeder. Also, the proposed SS-BVCS module delivers with efficient lesser component count and gaining maximum power from the harvest of green energy.</jats:p>"

This study has been carried out strictly following protocols and methodologies of the Water Framework Directive. The biological assessment took place in 2017 at 11 monitoring stations along the Drin River in Albania. Sampled specimens have been used to assess the water quality along the Drin River Basin through a set of indices’ calculations per each group of indicators. A total of 41 benthic invertebrate taxa were used to calculate the biotic indices, finding out only 3 monitoring stations with a good status of water out of 11 monitoring stations assessed in our study; water quality in 8 monitoring stations is classified as a moderate or poor status. Statistical analysis has been carried out to identify the trend of benthic invertebrates from one sampling point to another and the factors influencing the similarity between monitoring stations and benthic invertebrate families.</jats:p>",

Two primary challenges with the cap-and-trade scheme are determining the correct cap and carbon trading price in the carbon market. This paper presents a bi-level model to investigate these two challenges in the cap-and-trade scheme formed between multiple supply chains and the government. At the first level, the government minimizes the cap in such a way that the costs of the supply chains do not rise too much. At the second level, the supply chains minimize their costs according to their cap and trade the dedicated allowances. An exact and a heuristic method are developed to solve the bi-level model. The computational results on a set of randomly generated instances show the effectiveness of the presented heuristic. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the government should choose proper amounts of caps to balance costs and environmental benefits. </jats:p>",

Intermittency places a variety of burdens upon households, including inadequate quantities of supply at the household level, unpredictability of water utilities in making water available, and a disproportionate time burden on poorer households. For many intermittent water systems, the availability of water is controlled by valvemen who turn access on/off to various portions of their service area. Using this information, NextDrop sends notifications via mobile phones to customers as to when water is likely to be available. Although a pilot of NextDrop was successfully implemented in Hubli-Dharwad in India, NextDrop faced significant challenges when expanding to Bangalore. This case study investigates how a breakdown in the information pipeline, as well as corresponding human factors, prevented adoption of NextDrop in Bangalore. Specifically, randomized controlled trials found that valvemen sent reports of their activities to NextDrop only 70% of the time. Even when NextDrop passed messages onto customers, only 38% of customers reported receiving notifications, primarily because either the household “waiters” for water, usually women, did not have daytime access to the mobile phone registered with NextDrop or the notifications are buried under the many other solicitations and informational messages regularly received via SMS. Valvemen were further studied through observation and semi-structured interviews to understand their incentives for complying with NextDrop.</jats:p>"

The vulnerability of these networks increases because the design process does not consider the mitigation strategy of natural disasters. This region does not have any tools to estimate the infrastructure vulnerability for underground lifeline facilities, including WDN. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a framework to generate a Seismic Vulnerability Index for Water Distribution Network (SVI-WDN) for the Special Region of Yogyakarta which has been known to be exposed to many earthquake incidences. The framework presents a process to develop a SVI-WDN which consist of three steps. First step, to obtain the criteria, sub-criteria, their value range and the corresponding score for each value. Second step, to normalize the sub-criteria score. The third step, to obtain the criteria and sub-criteria weight by using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Lastly, the calculation of a vulnerability index for water distribution. Additional steps for visualizing the index are by generating a geographical information system map representing index value. Thus, this study presents a reproducible framework that can assist water authorities to prioritize the water distribution pipe segment which requires more intensive handling and maintenance.</jats:p>",

Attention is paid to the state of sanitary protection zones, a comparative characteristic of underground and surface sources of drinking water is given in terms of sanitary and epidemiological well-being. There is a decrease in the proportion of samples in the Primorsky Krai that are unsatisfactory in sanitary and epidemiological terms, due to the elimination of water sources that do not have sanitary protection zones along the region. In terms of sanitary and chemical indicators, the proportion of detected unsatisfactory samples taken from underground sources is higher than that of samples taken from surface sources. There is a lag in the provision of high-quality drinking water to the rural population compared to the urban population, and this gap is predicted to increase due to migration outflow to the urban environment and the postponement of the reconstruction of water supply systems. The leading role of surface sources in providing water supply to the largest number of the population of Primorsky Krai, the laboriousness of water treatment and transportation of water against the background of a reduction in the number of sources and centralization of water supply around more productive water sources are noted. The frequency of non-standard samples of drinking water in terms of microbiological indicators is included in the list of primary factors affecting the sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the region. In the Primorsky Krai, hydrogeochemical provinces were identified according to the increased content of manganese in the water and the physiological inferiority of drinking water. The importance of assessing the quality of drinking water, which has a significant impact on the formation of public health, is emphasized.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There are a huge number of harmonics in the railway power supply system. Accurately estimating the harmonic impedance of the system is the key to evaluating the harmonic emission level of the power supply system. A harmonic impedance estimation method is proposed in this paper, which takes the Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) as the main idea, and is dedicated to calculating the harmonic impedance when the load changes or the background harmonic changes in the traction power supply system. First, the harmonic voltages and currents are measured at the point of common coupling (PCC); secondly, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is established and optimized parameters are obtained through the EM algorithm; finally, a Gaussian mixture regression is performed to obtain the utility side harmonic impedance. In the simulation study, different harmonic impedance estimation models with uniform distribution and Gaussian distribution are established, respectively, and the harmonic impedance changes caused by different system structures in the railway power supply system are simulated. At the same time, the error is compared with the existing method to judge the accuracy and robustness of this method. In the case analysis, the average value, average error, standard deviation and other indicators are used to evaluate this method. Among them, the average error and standard deviation of this method are about one-fifth to one-third of those of the binary linear regression (BLR) method and the independent random vector (IRV) method. At the same time, its index is slightly better than that of the support vector machine (SVM) method.</jats:p>"

This research performed risk breakdown structure to identify risks, evaluated the risks using risk matrix 5x5 (MIL-STD-882B) and create risk mapping using the big picture approach. This research revealed that there are 15 risks involved in U-Hansa production process that can potentially disrupt the whole supply chain process of U-Hansa. Factors such as raw material shortage during the Covid-19 lockdown, insufficient production capacity and the limitation of machinery and equipment to support the production contributes to the noticeable risk potential in the overall U-Hansa supply chain network.

The monthly precipitation sequence is affected by various factors such as atmosphere, region and environment, and has obvious ambiguity, chance and uncertainty. CEEMD based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition can effectively reduce the reconstruction error of time series, and bidirectional long short-term memory (BILSTM) model can effectively learn long-term dependencies in time series. A CEEMD-BILSTM (complementary integrated empirical mode decomposition-bidirectional long short-term memory) coupled model is constructed to predict the monthly precipitation in Zhengzhou, and the performances of the LSTM model, EEMD-LSTM model and EEMD-BILSTM model are compared. The CEEMD-BILSTM model has a maximum relative error of 7.28%, a minimum relative error of 0.00%, and an average relative error of 2.68%, with an RMS error of 2.6% and a coefficient of determination of 0.97 in predicting monthly precipitation in Zhengzhou, which is considered a good accuracy of the CEEMD-BILSTM model for predicting monthly precipitation in Zhengzhou. The model is better than the LSTM model, the EEMD-LSTM model, and the EEMD-BILSTM model and has better fitting ability. It also shows that it has strong nonlinear and complex process learning ability in the hydrological factor model of regional precipitation prediction.</jats:p>",

Thus, when choosing between the green product and non-green product, consumers will anticipate the potential regret in the future and try to minimize it, and their purchasing decisions will be affected. This paper investigates the impact of consumers’ anticipated regret on the manufacturer’s and retailer’s optimal pricing and greening level decisions of these two kinds of products. By a game theoretic model in which the manufacturer is the leader, we derive the optimal wholesale price, greening level and retail price. Our analysis shows that the manufacturer and retailer can benefit or loss from consumers’ two types of anticipated regret in equilibrium. Furthermore, the green product’ optimal wholesale price and retail price, and greening level all decrease with green product-purchase regret but increase with non-green product-purchase regret in equilibrium. Interestingly, we also find that the non-green product’s optimal wholesale price and retail price are not affected by the consumers’ anticipated regret and the green product. This study provides retailers and manufacturers with new marketing management insights from the perspective of consumers’ anticipated regret behavior, and outlines the guidelines for them on invoking or mitigating consumers’ regret to increase profit or demand at the right time.</jats:p>",

Specifically, GDP fluctuations increase by 63.35% without the “indirect effect”, increase by 66.75% without the “direct effect”, and increase by 66.79% without both effects.

A mixed-integer non-linear programming model (MINLP) is presented to address the integrated VRP and M/M/C queueing system. The suggested model makes decisions about optimal routing, delivery time interval to customers, number of servers in traditional retailers, inventory replenishment policies, and retailers’ price. For the first time, this model considers two retailing channels simultaneously under different uncertainty, including demand, delivery lead time, service time, and delivery time interval to customers. The inventory model also follows a continuous-time Markov chain. The small-scale test problems are solved using GAMS software. Since the problem is NP-hard, this study conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance of 13 different metaheuristics. The ant lion optimiser, dragonfly algorithm, grasshopper optimisation algorithm, Harris-hawks optimisation, moth-flame optimisation algorithm, multi-verse optimizer, sine cosine algorithm, salp-swarm algorithm, the whale optimisation algorithm, grey-wolf optimiser, genetic algorithm, differential evolution, and particle swarm optimization are algorithms that were chosen for this study. Comprehensive statistical tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of these methods. Furthermore, the model is executed for construction material producers as a case study. Finally, sensitivity analyses were conducted on crucial model parameters; and managerial insights were recommended.</jats:p>",

Reducing 75% of basic medium (TAP) N level (0 g/L NaAc + 0.09 g/L NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>Cl treatment) could promote 21.57% total lipid content in comparison with the control (containing 0.38 g/L NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>Cl), but decrease 44.45% biomass and 34.15% lipid productivity.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a dual digital signal processor (DSP) controller suitable for unified power quality regulators and designs high-power-density switching power supply control system for promoting green environment. The overall structure of the system is divided into two parts, the power main circuit and the control circuit. In the main power circuit, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter is used to filter the input AC voltage and convert it into a stable DC voltage. A high-frequency inverter is used to invert the DC voltage into a high-frequency AC voltage to achieve harmonic control and reactive power compensation. In the control circuit, dual DSP controller is used to improve real-time detection, control of the output voltage, and current and driver temperature of the high-power-density switching power supply, while high-precision analysis and processing system collect different information and then achieve the power quality control of the switching power supply based on system software to keep this environment green. The experimental results suggest that the harmonic content of the experimental objects controlled by the system is reduced by 16.7% compared with the existing power quality control and the absolute error of the system is less than 0.02 V which improves the de-noising performance. The power generation systems require that the consumption of natural resources and renewable energy solutions can assist in saving the natural resources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Floating nuclear power plants contain sensitive loads of nuclear reactors. After equipment faults, fast and efficient power supply recovery should be realized. To realize the unified analysis of system topology and power flow distribution, a power supply recovery strategy based on Petri nets is proposed. Considering that systems of different voltage levels cannot be connected instantaneously, a two-stage power supply recovery mode is adopted. Emergency power supply is put in first, and then the whole network is reconstructed. In the network reconstruction process, load transfer is realized through switching the transformation to redistribute the load of each switchboard and adjust the power output of each power source. Corresponding to the Petri net model, the above process is similar to the dynamic transmission process of a token in each library by firing the transition. Therefore, the topological model of system is constructed based on the Petri net, and a power flow analysis is proposed through its dynamic updating mechanism. The objective function of the network reconstruction is established by integrating load recovery amount, switch operation cost and generator operation efficiency, and the optimal switching state combination scheme that satisfies the system constraints is obtained by the multi-population genetic algorithm (MPGA). Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide complete power supply recovery.</jats:p>"

With the introduction of e-procurement in the organization, the overall process can be less time consuming as well as it is also very much efficient in order to do all procurement related activities in a timely manner. In this research it has been analyzed that e-procurement is a key role in future for companies as there are many companies already switching their supply chain management process into e-procurement activities as it can be proved in the previous studies that shows how important e-procurement is on the supply chain management and its performance. Present studies attempt the best possibilities with the effect of e-procurement steps which are in practices in supply chain process in Pakistan and manufacturing sector. Through the help of SPSS software, we are able to find the impact of supply chain with e-procurement variables which has a positive impact on supply chain management and results are agreed with the findings of research. The results show that the four electronic variables of E-Procurement are essential factor which directly reduce uncertainty in supply chain functions increase supply chain activities and practices, fast moving process, fast moving supply chain order, fulfillment of orders with quick and improve supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The ongoing global transition to low- and zero-CO2 energy generation and transport will require more raw materials and metals than ever produced before in human history to develop the necessary infrastructure for solar and wind power generation, electric power grid distribution, and electric vehicle componentry, including batteries. In addition to numerous critical elements, this transition will also require increased production of a range of other metals. This includes copper, with increased production of this metal providing the minerals industry with enhanced opportunities to secure the additional supply of associated or potential by-product elements. These include tellurium, selenium, bismuth, and antimony (among others), some of which are already predominantly produced as by-products from copper anode slimes. This study examines the geologic origins of over 240 active copper mines and over 200 electrolytic and electrowinning copper refineries worldwide. Although porphyry copper deposits dominate the copper supply trend, significant amounts of copper are supplied from the mining of sediment-hosted, massive sulfide, volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS), and iron oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) mineral deposits. We integrate sources of copper concentrate with publicly available operational data for 32 copper electrorefineries to evaluate the geologic controls on the by-product supply potential of tellurium, selenium, bismuth, and antimony from copper anode slimes. These data represent some 32% of worldwide copper refineries and indicate that electrolytic refining of copper has the potential to supply ~777 t/yr tellurium, ~4,180 t/yr selenium, ~1,497 t/yr antimony, and 1,632 t/yr bismuth if 100% recovery of the by-product critical element proxies outlined in this study could be achieved. This is compared to current global production of ~490, ~2,900, ~153,000, and ~17,000 t/yr from all sources (rather than just copper by-products), respectively. Our analysis shows that there is no correlation between by-product potential and the amount of refined copper cathode production per year, but instead, the geologic origin of the copper concentrates is the key control on refinery by-product potential. This is exemplified by the fact that copper anode slimes derived from concentrates sourced from magmatic sulfide and VMS orebodies have an order of magnitude higher tellurium concentrations than those derived from porphyry deposits, reflecting the different abundances of tellurium within these mineral systems. These results are not surprising but demonstrate the possibilities for the development of robust proxies for by-product critical element supply potential using downstream data from copper (and potentially other base and precious metal) refineries. Equally significant, this study demonstrates the importance of downstream-up assessments of critical element potential as a complement to the more typical upstream-down deportment analyses undertaken to date. Finally, this type of approach allows the more accurate targeting of key parts of the metal supply chain with the capacity to increase by-product critical element production, rather than diluted or scattered approaches that assume that by-product metals are derived from one or two mineral deposit types (e.g., porphyry systems for the copper sector).</jats:p>",

While the continuity of power supply through the power system grid is impressionable from disturbances such as a short circuit. In addition, the rapid development of distributed generation (DG) technology triggers the industry to use DG technology to maintain power quality and support for industrial processes. This paper proposed the coordination of over current relay (OCR) considering distributed generation (DG) to provide an extraordinary protection system in an electrical system network.  The relay is coordinated with the other relay equipment to enhance the system more reliable, secure, and stable. To examine the efficacy of the proposed approach, the radial distribution system model is utilized in this paper where the DG is installed in bus 6. To compute the protection coordination index (PCI) and coordination time interval (CTI), the DG capacity is varied from 100 KVA to 1000kVA. From the simulation result, it could be seen that the installed DG that allowed in bus 6 was 900kVA because the CTI value reached convergence value as of 0.294 second for higher DC capacity than 900kVA. Moreover, the higher of DG capacity was injected to electrical system, the higher of PCI values was obtained.    </jats:p>"

Taking the eastern and central regions as research cases, this paper analyzes the actual situation of the collaborative supply of public sports services, and further explores the gap between urban and rural public sports. It puts forward the ideas and strategic paths for the innovative development of the collaborative supply model of public sports services. This research uses descriptive statistical analysis on the evaluation results of public sports service quality to examine the actual performance value of public sports service quality in various regions and uses the characteristics of different fitness of genetic algorithms to select the optimal supply and demand of public sports services in different regions. By analyzing the characteristics of insufficient supply and demand of public sports services in various regions, an optimal genetic algorithm model is constructed, and then combined with the scope of the study area and the number of people in the area, the genetic algorithm is used to continuously optimize until a set of optimal solutions appears, thus completing the optimal configuration of public sports services. The optimal path for the development of public sports in different regions is obtained, so as to promote the development of regional public sports. The study found that the satisfaction of sports funds in primary and middle schools in the east and middle is not very high, and the satisfaction with sports funds in middle schools is higher than that in primary schools, but only 50% of schools choose that sports funds are basically sufficient. The difference in satisfaction with sports funding in middle schools in the eastern and central regions is not obvious, and the satisfaction with sports funding in primary schools in the eastern region is higher than that in the central region. Judging from the amount of sports expenditures filled in by schools, 2000–3000 yuan per school year for primary schools and 4000–5000 yuan for middle schools are more common. Based on the calculation of 1,000 students in a school, the per capita sports expenditure is less than 10 yuan, which is very limited for sports training. This research will help to change the service concept and scientific decision-making and change the supply mode of sports public services. It will establish not only a vertical, complete, and horizontally smooth organizational structure and coordination mechanism but also a clear strategy for equalization of urban and rural sports public services.</jats:p>",

This study investigates the causes of the failure of reforestation projects in the North and Northeast departments of Haiti. Two questionnaires with closed- and open-ended questions were used for face-to-face and semi-structured interviews with local and non-local authorities, respectively. The test of proportions was used for the statistical analysis, where a result was considered significant when the p-value was less than 0.05. The results showed that 86.8% of the non-local authorities were used to participating in projects of reforestation in their localities. The lack of follow-up and participation of residents in decisions about the type of trees planted were the main causes of the failure of these projects. The interviewees were accustomed to cutting trees to produce charcoal (95.8%) and enlarging their gardens (70.8%). However, 90.0% of each category would invest in purchasing cleaner cookstoves and stop using charcoal if the government agreed to finance up to 50.0% of such a project. The findings of this research could help both the decision-makers and the Haitian government to understand the causes of the failures of reforestation projects in Haiti and adopt an effective way to reduce deforestation in the country.</jats:p>",

There are a large number of risk factors that affect its operational safety. Accidents that have occurred during operation have caused devastaing disasters to water diversion infrastructure. In this study, the failure modes for the operational risks of water diversion infrastructure are identified from four aspects, i.e.,environment, engineering technology, operation management, and society. A failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) risk poiorization model is established based on the fuzzy inference system (FIS). A fuzzy rule base is established according to IF-THEN rules, and the risk priority is calculated and ranked via FIS. Lastly, a case study of the Huixian section of the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project is carried out to verify the proposed method. The results show that the risks of rainstorms, floods, and foundation failure are regarded as high priority. The validity and applicability of the proposed method are tested via comparison with traditional FMEA. These findings provide valuable information for the operational safety of water diversion infrastructure.</jats:p>",

To fill this research void, we predict and show that the turnover of a country's top political leader (hereafter, “politician turnover”) increases policy uncertainty in the country, which drives multinational corporations (MNCs) to adjust their SC involvement there. We also identify three politician‐related contingency factors: the market‐friendliness of the successor relative to the incumbent, the length of the successor's political career, and corruption in the turnover country. In an analysis of politician turnover events from 2003 to 2018 and the global supplier‐customer relationships of US‐incorporated MNCs, we find that politician turnover causes MNCs to reduce SC involvement (measured as the proportions of an MNC's customers, suppliers, and the transaction volume that are located in the turnover country). The negative effect of politician turnover on SC involvement is exacerbated by corruption in the turnover country, mitigated when the successor has a long political career, and exacerbated when the successor is less market‐friendly than the incumbent; the effect becomes positive when the successor is more market‐friendly than the incumbent.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore circular and sustainable economies. A traditional chain transits to a dual-channel supply chain, extending its online channel for more customers, and keeping its offline channel so as to reduce resource utilization for sustainable business. However, there exists some conflict between offline and online channels, such as the showrooming effect (i.e., customers visit an offline store to experience products but then buy them online with a lower price). This work studies a three-echelon book dual-channel supply chain involving an author, an online publisher and an offline retailer. Based on Stackelberg game theory, it investigates the optimal pricing solutions and the optimal retailer’s service effort level with two copyright models and considers the showrooming effect based on either decentralized or centralized decision-making. Afterwards, it develops a cost-sharing contract to make them achieve Pareto optimality. Furthermore, this research studies the influence of the showrooming effect on the optimal decisions and the profits of each member through theoretical and numerical analyses. The findings show that a well-designed contract can lead dual-channel members to cut down the negative impact of the showrooming effect and realize the win–win situation. Finally, it proposes some managerial insights and possible directions for the future.</jats:p>"

We then analysed the potential of replacing food-competing feedstuff—here cereals, whole fish, vegetable oils and pulses that account for 15% of total feed use—with food system by-products and residues. Considering the nutritional requirements of food-producing animals, including farmed aquatic species, this replacement could increase the current global food supply by up to 13% (10–16%) in terms of kcal and 15% (12–19%) in terms of protein content. Increasing the use of food system by-products as feed has considerable potential, particularly when combined with other measures, in the much-needed transition towards circular food systems.</jats:p>"

While a stated aim of eMigrate is to protect workers from contract fraud, these practices persist. We explore the colonial genealogies of eMigrate to show that not only has it adapted repertoires of worker protection inherited from the British Empire’s indenture system, but that eMigrate risks facilitating conditions of unfreedom under the mantle of worker protection, much as the British imperial state did during indenture. We contend that recognising how legacies of indentured labour regulation persist through eMigrate has implications for contemporary campaigns for migrant justice.</jats:p>",

The basic aim of the research is to optimize the functioning of CLSC networks. For the above-said, two objective functions are made. The first objective is to minimize the cost of production and assembly expenses of the forward and reverse logistics. Secondly, an endeavour has been made to reduce the fixed costs associated with plants and retailers. For the sake of achieving two objective functions, two methods are employed: triangular fuzzy numbers and triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Among the two methods, triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers achieved the said objectives with greater optimization substantiated by statistics.

New-type agricultural business entities such as family farms, specialized cooperatives and agro-processing enterprises have become important vehicles of agricultural green transformation due to their comparative advantages in multiple aspects. Within the agricultural industrialization consortium, the motivation of new-type agricultural business entities to synergistically implement the agricultural green transformation strategy is affected by bounded rationality as well as multiple economic and social factors. Clarifying the mechanism of the above factors would be of benefit to promoting agricultural green transformation in developing countries. In this article, a tripartite evolutionary game model about the production and sale of green agro-products is constructed, and the influences of various factors on the evolutionary game process are analyzed, based on new institutional economics and new economic sociology. According to the simulation results, it is found that the proportional quality contributions of the agents, the intensification of consumers’ preference for green agro-products and the increase of social embedding cost are conducive to the system converging to the favorable evolutionary equilibrium at a faster rate. However, the increases of marginal costs, market risks and spillover effects would prevent the system from converging to the favorable evolutionary equilibrium. Accordingly, corresponding suggestions are put forward to support the effective supply of green agricultural products in the agricultural industrialization consortium.</jats:p>"

To concretize the circular economy implementation strategies, closed‐loop thinking requires innovation and adaptation. Circular supply chains (CSCs) are one of the key enablers in closing the loop by design or intention for value recovery and profit maximization. CSC is an emerging area, and the view of CSC where forward and reverse supply chain is seamlessly integrated with the overall aim to achieve system‐wide circularity is missing in the academic debate. By offering a cross‐functional perspective of CSC, this paper presents a CSC guiding framework to structure and understand the underlying complexities and highlight the crucial elements of the CSC implementation. Thus, this framework lays the basis for CSC within the systemic implementation of CE by closing the loop by design or intention. The framework categorizes the CSC into four building blocks, namely, systemic approach, main drivers, levels of decision making, and mechanisms to manage the full loop closure and minimize the inherent uncertainties of a complex system. The building blocks of the framework are synthesized from various streams of supply chain literature and recurring concepts in the circular economy literature. The CSC framework applicability is illustrated using two industrial cases that are transitioning towards the circular economy.</jats:p>",

The complexity of the supply chain system, the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, and demand uncertainty have made the triggering and propagation of supply chain brittleness complicated. In this study, a brittleness evolution model based on adaptive agent graph theory has been constructed. The parameters of brittleness evolution, including brittleness entropy and the vertex state value, have been quantitatively designed, and the brittleness evolution model in which the adaptability of nodes is considered and is not considered is constructed. A simulation algorithm based on the integrated scheduling model of the supply chain has been established. Finally, the practicability of the proposed model and algorithm is demonstrated via a case study of an electronic supply chain network. The results indicate that the proposed model and algorithm can effectively analyze the brittleness evolution law of the supply chain under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the evolution law of the vertex state, the brittleness entropy of the vertex, the global entropy of brittleness, the seasonal evolution law of the supply chain brittleness, and the evolution law of the brittleness behavior.</jats:p>"

Studies in psychology and behavioral sciences show that strategic consumers have a significant impact on firms’ profits. In this paper, dynamic pricing problems are considered to analyse the effects of strategic consumer double-entry mental accounting on firms’ profits. We first analyse the perceived values of consumers under different payment schemes in the regular selling period and the sales period from two channels. Based on this, we derive the optimal price and optimal profit. The results show that double-entry mental accounting of consumers has a greater impact on the retailer than on the manufacturer. To solve the loss caused by strategic consumers, it is recommended that the retailer lowers the price to stabilize the profit. The postpayment scheme is preferred by the manufacturer, but the high coefficient of pleasure attenuation would hurt the manufacturer. The general payment scheme is preferred by the retailer, but the high coefficient of pain buffering would hurt the retailer.</jats:p>",

Taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration of China as an example, we studied four ES supply-demand budgets: carbon storage, water provision, food provision and soil conservation from 2000 to 2015. Through the geodetector model, canonical analysis and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) model, the drivers of the ES supply-demand budget were explored. The results showed that the areas supplying high amounts of ESs in the northern region usually did not overlap those areas consuming intensive ESs, which were mainly distributed in metropolitan areas. The anthropological factors, including per capita gross domestic product (Per.GDP) and population density (POP.Den), were the dominant influencing factors for the imbalance between the supply and demand of carbon storage, water provision and food provision, which were mainly distributed in the central and southern regions of the study area. Geomorphological factors (ELE and SLO) were the key driving factors of soil conservation, which was mainly distributed in the eastern regions. In all, our findings could provide comprehensive information for decision-making and ES management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain technology, and pharmacoeconomics presents a transformative opportunity to revolutionize pharmaceutical supply chains, fostering equitable global drug access. Traditional supply chains are often plagued by inefficiencies, including limited transparency, suboptimal resource allocation, and susceptibility to counterfeit drugs, which exacerbate disparities in drug availability. This paper explores a novel paradigm where AI-driven analytics, blockchain's immutable ledgers, and pharmacoeconomic principles synergize to create adaptive pharmaceutical supply chains tailored to global needs. AI facilitates predictive analytics for demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and real-time decision-making, reducing wastage and ensuring timely drug delivery. Blockchain enhances transparency and traceability across the supply chain, ensuring the authenticity of pharmaceutical products and fostering stakeholder trust. Concurrently, pharmacoeconomics evaluates the cost-effectiveness of supply chain strategies, balancing affordability with accessibility. This interdisciplinary framework enables equitable distribution of essential medications, particularly in underserved regions, by addressing systemic challenges such as logistical inefficiencies, pricing disparities, and regulatory compliance. The proposed approach leverages AI to identify demand patterns and optimize supply routes, while blockchain ensures secure, verifiable records of drug production, distribution, and delivery. Integrating pharmacoeconomic assessments informs pricing models and reimbursement strategies that align with socio-economic realities, thus promoting affordability without compromising sustainability. Case studies from pilot implementations highlight the potential for reduced operational costs, enhanced drug traceability, and improved access to life-saving medications. By combining the strengths of AI, blockchain, and pharmacoeconomics, this framework offers a scalable, resilient, and adaptive model for pharmaceutical supply chains, addressing global health inequities. It underscores the importance of collaboration among stakeholders, including governments, healthcare providers, and technology innovators, in advancing healthcare outcomes. Future research should explore the ethical implications, technological scalability, and policy frameworks necessary to ensure the widespread adoption of this integrated paradigm.</jats:p>"

One of the supply chains most affected by COVID‐19 is food supply chains. Since the sustainable food supply chain processes are complex and vulnerable in terms of product variety, it has been negatively affected by the operational effects of COVID‐19. While the problems experienced in the supply chain processes and raw material constraints caused stops in production, the importance of new business models and production approaches came to the fore. One of the issues of increasing importance is the adoption of reverse logistics activities in sustainable food supply chains and increasing the resilience of food supply chains by integrating blockchain technology into processes. However, adapting blockchain technology to increase the resilience of reverse logistics activities in the food supply chain has advantages as well as risks that need to be considered. Therefore, it is aimed to determine these risks by using fuzzy synthetic evaluation method for eliminating the risks of blockchain adaptation for flexible reverse logistics in food supply chains to increase resiliency. The novelty of this study is that besides discussing about the benefits of BC‐T, it is to identify the risks it can create, to eliminate these risks and to guide the establishment of resilience in reverse logistics activities of SFSCs. According to results, the risks with the highest value among the subrisks are determined as data security risks. Data management risks are calculated as the risk with the highest value.</jats:p>",

Flooding can affect the quality of groundwater and surface water resources and can cause supply service interruption due to damaged infrastructures. A complete approach to address flood impact on WSS is required but not yet available, while only specific aspects were investigated in details. This work introduces a comprehensive tool named WAter Safety Planning Procedures Decision Support System (WASPP–DSS) developed in the context of MUHA (Multihazard framework for Water Related risks management) project. The tool is mainly addressed to small water utilities (WU) for supporting WSP development and is based on two main premises: 1) a correct approach for WSS risk analysis requires a multi-hazard perspective encompassing all the system components and different hazards; 2) other institutions in addition to WUs have to be involved in WSS risk analyses to harmonize monitoring and response procedures. The tool is here applied on risks associated to flooding and demonstrated for three case studies. The WASPP–DSS, tested by eight WUs, was found a potentially valid support for small WUs that must start drafting the WSP in a comprehensive way and can provide a common shared scheme. Improvements are desirable, as including a specific section to consider the issue of loss of water resources from reservoirs due to overflow.\n</jats:p>",

To quickly and accurately identify mine water inrush source, according to the hydrochemical characteristics of different aquifers in the Donghuantuo mining area, this paper systematically analyzes the hydraulic connection of the aquifers in main coal mining areas before and after mining activities. Four types of hydrochemical data were collected: No. 5 coal seam roof water, No. 8 coal seam roof water, No. 122 coal seam floor water, and No. 1214 coal seam aquifer water in the Donghuantuo mining area. In addition, based on the hydrochemical data, the parameter selection of LightGBM was optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and constructed the PSO-LightGBM water inrush source identification model. The recognition accuracy of PSO-LightGBM model was compared with LightGBM model, classification regression tree (CART) model, and random forest (RF) model. The results showed that coal mining activities would have a significant impact on the water quality characteristics of the roof sandstone fissure water of No. 5 coal mine. Mining activities had a certain impact on the accuracy of the identification model. In addition, compared with the four recognition models, PSO-LightGBM model had the highest recognition accuracy of 97.22%. It showed that the model had high accuracy, stability, generalization ability, and important reference value for the identification of mine water inrush source.</jats:p>",

Thus, a warehouse manager must have comprehensive knowledge of costs and cost triggers in the warehouse to be able to minimize costs while keeping customer satisfaction. One effective way to minimize warehouse costs is by conducting the cost analysis. Although PT XYZ is one of the biggest Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies in Indonesia applying one of the most comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning software, its existing warehouse management support system occupies only standard Microsoft Excel. One of its warehouses, located in West Java, is responsible for more than 147,000 pallets each day, and the warehouse manager still uses Microsoft Excel with limitations in displaying the required information, especially the information related to the Cost Per Case (CPC) in every activity. Therefore, a template or dashboard that can provide information related to CPC in the warehouse is urgently needed. Given the importance of cost monitoring in the warehouse of PT XYZ, this research aims to create a dashboard that can make it easier for companies to monitor warehouse performance from a CPC perspective. The methods used in data collection consist of several processes, namely interviews, observations, and literature studies. While analyzing the needs of dashboard creation, this research uses the PureShare method. Thus, the results are obtained in the form of a proposed warehouse dashboard that can be used by the company to conduct cost analysis by providing information related to CPC of every activity in the warehouse, where the information presented on the dashboard is in accordance with the company's needs.</jats:p>"

How to control and deal with decommissioned batteries and balance economic and environmental benefits has become an urgent problem to be solved. Considering the influence of uncertain interference factors, the dynamic equilibrium strategy of power battery closed-loop supply chain members composed of leading manufacturer, recycler, and cascade utilization enterprise was studied. (1) This paper describes the stochastic evolution process of cascade utilization effort level by using Ito process and constructs a stochastic differential game model of closed-loop supply chain dynamic system combined with cost-sharing coordination mechanism. (2) Based on the stochastic differential game theory, the optimal profit function of the participants is given, and the dynamic equilibrium strategy of each participant is obtained. (3) In order to grasp the statistical characteristics of cascade utilization effort level, the random evolution characteristics of cascade utilization effort level are revealed. (4) Combined with numerical example, the influence of relevant parameters on the dynamic system of power battery closed-loop supply chain is analyzed. The results found that with the increase of the proportion of manufacturer sharing the innovation cost of cascade utilization enterprise, the cascade utilization effort level will improve, the profits of cascade utilization enterprise and recycler will increase significantly, the profits of manufacturer will decrease slightly, and the overall profits of the supply chain will increase. The cost-sharing coordination mechanism is conducive to ensuring the steady development of the industry and effectively improving the utilization efficiency of industrial resources.</jats:p>",

Building diversified supply chains and monitoring the performance of suppliers are major mitigation strategies to counteract disruptions at an early stage. Supply chain risk management and monitoring of supply chains using big data analytics are getting increasing attention. The growing number of data sources has huge implications on the reporting of incidents that may disrupt supply chains. The data sources may stem from a variety of internet sources like daily media reports provided on websites, social media or specialist media, or they may stem from specific databases. The sooner this information is disclosed to stakeholders and analysed the better the preventive strategies generally are. Timely information prolongs the reaction time and may help to reduce the severity of an incident. This paper highlights a science-based real-time tracking analysis of risks in the mineral raw material markets for the period 2019 to 2021 using big data analytics provided by a commercial system. A set of data for 12 selected mineral raw materials was provided by the authors and analysed using more than 100 risk indicators from 14 major risk categories as part of a commercial big data system. The extracted information can have imminent value to identify supply shortages, production halts or price peaks at an early stage. The main question was to find out whether such big data analytics are precise enough to detect potential, globally relevant, supply shortages in mineral raw material markets in due time. The results of this paper show that using big data analytics can be a very effective tool to extract relevant information about supply sources and to react timely in case of disruptions or social or environmental mismanagement on the supplier side. However, the nature of big data sources suggests that the parameters of the applied models need elaborate configuration. Each raw mineral market has its own peculiarities in terms of volume, mode of transport, market concentration or countries of origin. These factors influence the relevance of the reported incidents. Furthermore, some incidents have a spurious or only minor connection to the individual markets. For these reasons, we conclude that only supervised models reap the most benefits in the monitoring of mineral raw material markets.</jats:p>",

In addition, two key factors, including an imbalance of government reward and punishment and a low degree of cooperation between manufacturers and recycling enterprises, have hindered the recovery and utilization of critical metals in power battery with the expansion of the power battery recycling market. A three-party evolutionary game model, including power battery manufacturers, third-party recycling enterprises, and the government, was constructed in this study to analyze the evolutionary stability of the strategy selection of each participant. Also, the influence of each factor on the three-party strategy selection and verifying the reliability of the results through simulation were also discussed. The results show that 1) both government incentives and punishments are beneficial for promoting cooperation between power battery manufacturers and recycling enterprises. The cost of cooperation will be the key factor affecting power battery recycling. 2) Increasing the probability of cooperation is an effective way to ensure the increase in income of both parties after cooperation. Further suggestions, including the establishment of a dynamic reward and punishment mechanism by the government and strengthening the cooperation to cope with the continued tight supply of critical metals by the manufacturers and recyclers, were also put forward in this research.</jats:p>"

The demonstration is done by evaluating investment strategies for a 38 Ml/d water treatment plant serving an urban area with approximately 75 000 inhabitants, where there is uncertainty with respect to future population growth, industrial production, external demand and the amount of rainfall due to climate change. It is shown that the quantification and comparison of the possible reductions in service and intervention costs over comparably long periods enables the optimal investment decisions – that is, the ones with the optimal trade-offs between stakeholders. Additionally, it can be seen that the used methodology enables the consistent and transparent consideration of (a) the concerns of multiple stakeholders, (b) the future deep uncertainty associated with key concerns and (c) the flexibility of infrastructure managers to make decisions in the future using new information. The methodology also ensures that managers have clear plans of action and considerable insight into the extent of required future financing. </jats:p>",

Here, we focused on the impact of hydraulic conditions on Mn accumulation in well chlorinated DWDS, particularly on the physical pathway (i.e., the attachment of particulate Mn to the inner pipe surface) and the chemical pathway (i.e., the autocatalytic oxidation of Mn2+ on the surface of accumulated Mn). Mn accumulation on epoxy resin, a typical lining material for distribution pipes in Japan, was observed in laboratory-scale experiments under different water velocity conditions. The results showed that Mn accumulation was significantly enhanced under higher velocity conditions, which was then fitted with the numerical models describing Mn accumulation by the physical and chemical pathways and the detachment. The rate constants for the physical and chemical pathways had a positive relationship with the flow turbulence in the investigated range, suggesting that hydraulic conditions in DWDS play an important role in Mn accumulation. Effects of Mn speciation and water characteristics on the accumulation process were also simulated under various hydraulic conditions. Based on the obtained results, appropriate countermeasures to control manganese accumulation were then discussed.</jats:p>",

An increase in the rheographic index is accompanied by an increase in the alpha- and a decrease in the delta-rhythm indices. In pubertal adolescents, an increase in the rheographic index causes a decrease in alpha rhythm and an increase in slow-wave delta oscillations in the frontal and occipital leads. Under short-term hypoxia, an increase in the brain filling with blood is observed. Under oxygen depletion (14%), despite the increase in pulmonary and blood minute volumes, tissue hypoxia develops in pubertal adolescents. It is especially evident in the early puberty, as there is even a decrease in oxygen consumption in adolescents aged 12–14. In adolescents with hypoxia cerebral blood flow increases.</jats:p>",

On the one hand, many studies have confirmed their indispensability, and on the other hand, they have been described as the most controversial elements of management that can lead to many conflict situations in an organization. The present study aimed to assess the attitudes of employees toward employee evaluation systems using the example of PWiK Rybnik (Sewage and Water Supply Rybnik). The municipal sector, and especially water and sewage companies, are characterized by an approach to the provision of services from a natural monopoly perspective. The above situation enforces in the sphere of management certain behaviors towards employees and may affect attitudes towards the employee evaluation system. This study assumed the hypothesis that employee attitudes toward the employee evaluation system are skeptical. A diagnostic survey method with a questionnaire technique was used to verify the hypothesis and answer the formulated research questions. The survey questionnaire consisted of 16 mixed questions, including four to collect anonymous sociodemographic information. The results of the conducted survey were subjected to statistical and descriptive analysis. Based on the analyses performed, it could be concluded that the employees expected constructive feedback from their supervisors, and traditional employee evaluation via a form was often viewed as its negation. Evaluations should also take into account social factors, as people are definitely more motivated and inspired by a constructive conversation than by a form presenting quantitative data.</jats:p>"

Two types of soil nutrient condition, type A: nutrient-limited and type B: nutrient-excess, were prepared as follows; type A is a low nutrient-containing soil without a replenishment of starved nitrogen and phosphorous, type B is a high nutrient-containing soil exceeding the recommended fertilization. Soil water was adjusted either at −30 kPa (sufficient) or −80 kPa (limited). For harvested tomato fruits, we examined primary and secondary metabolites using non-targeted mass spectrometry based metabolomics. The fruit production and leaf SPAD were greatly dependent on soil nutrient levels, by contrast, the level of lycopene remained unchanged by different levels of water and nutrient supply. The perturbation of metabolites by water supply was clear in the nutrient-excess soil. In particular, limited water supply strongly decreased primary metabolites including sugars and amino acids. We demonstrated that water stress differently shifted primary metabolites of tomato fruits in two soils with different nutrient conditions <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> non-targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. In conclusion, we suggest that the limited water supply in soils with surplus nutrient is not a recommendable way for tomato ‘cv.

This study simulates the evolution process of strategic selection for each supply chain link to set information nodes independently or collectively under the unconstrained government rewards conditions and punishments. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) When each link in the supply chain provides source tracing information independently, the vendor chooses to set up information nodes for the links with large information cost compensation coefficients. (2) When the vendor provides source tracing information cooperatively if the collaborative benefit is less than the cooperation cost, the information node will be set to the link with the large compensation coefficient. If not, information nodes will be set in each link. (3) Under the government incentive mechanism, enterprises are willing to cooperate. The punishment mechanism helps avoid situations where neither side sets up information nodes. The compensation coefficient is a prerequisite for mechanisms to work.</jats:p>",

Calves (87.2 ± 7.7 kg) were bottle-fed a cornstarch-based milk replacer (727 g of cornstarch daily) alone, milk replacer with added casein (154.7 g/d) or milk replacer with added glutamate (45.5 g/d) for 10 or 35 d. Prior to receiving treatments calves were fed a commercial milk replacer for either 12 or 15 weeks so that measures of organ mass and small intestinal length were collected at the same day of age. Measures of organ mass were achieved after calves were euthanized and digesta was removed. Duodenum was defined as the first 1-m caudal to the pyloric sphincter. Jejunum and ileum were defined as the cranial and caudal halves of the remaining small intestines. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Average daily gain was 68% greater (P = 0.02) for calves fed casein compared to control, but glutamate did not differ from casein or control. Mass of the omasum, abomasum, jejunum, ileum, heart, or kidney and length of the jejunum or ileum were not affected by treatment (P ≥ 0.18); however, additions of casein increased (P ≤ 0.05) mass of the rumen, duodenum, large intestine, liver, and spleen. Greater duration of treatment increased rumen, abomasum, duodenum, jejunum, large intestine, heart, liver, and spleen mass (P ≤ 0.05), but there was treatment by duration interaction (P ≥ 0.18). Interestingly, there was an interaction (P &amp;lt; 0.01) for jejunal and ileal length in response to treatment and duration. Length of each segment increased with duration of treatment for calves fed casein or glutamate but lengths decreased in calves fed control for greater amounts of time.</jats:p>",

Recent events (e.g. Covid-19) have shown how fragile supply chains can be when assumptions for the design and management of supply chains are challenged. In addition, governments are striving for systemic changes towards more sustainability (e.g. European Green Deal). To meet the resulting requirements, the concept of circular economy and with it, circular supply chain management (CSCM) are gaining attention as they could contribute to building a sustainable and resilient system. The German wind energy industry, with its long track record, is a suitable application for further research on CSCM, as the industry operates predominantly in a linear system and relies on finite materials. Despite, research on CSCM for the wind energy industry is still rare. The aim of the paper is therefore to present conceptional ideas that enable an efficient design of a circular wind energy industry in Germany. Aspects from an organization, products and processes level of a CSCM are outlined. These ideas contribute to the state of the art and inspire future discussions between researchers and practitioners.</jats:p>",

The study proposes to analyse three different scenarios of the Parmigiano Reggiano supply chain considering blockchain technology as an enabler for the use of other technologies such as RFID and the Internet of Things (IoT) and for the exploitation of the Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) strategy. The study is based on the evaluation of three agent-based simulation scenarios, a traditional \"as is\" scenario, a second \"to be\" scenario implementing emerging technologies including blockchain, and a third “to be” scenario that combines the second one with the VMI optimization strategy. The results show how the combined adoption of these technologies improves the procurement process and customer satisfaction. Findings highlight the impacts that the different scenarios have on the supply chain operations in a quantitative way and allows to evaluate the changes in supply chain processes. By employing emerging technologies, order management activities are more automated and time to order and lead time order preparation are reduced. However, to achieve these performances, other data capture tools such as RFID and IoT are needed. Finally, the introduction of the VMI strategy, when enabled by blockchain technology, improves the procurement performances and significantly reduces unfilled orders.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The agricultural domain in developing countries is mostly dictated by archaic rules based on traditions and inherited practices. With the evolution of digitalization and technology, it seems essential to apply new technologies to the agricultural field. Among the technologies to be exploited in agriculture, we mention sensors, IoT, WSN, cloud, blockchain, etc. We talk about smart agriculture in this case. In this paper, we propose a platform secured by blockchain for monitoring and securing production. This platform uses IoT connected sensors to track and save data. Our system is used to monitor the production process of olive trees. The goal is to track everything that enters and leaves our olive tree production from fertilizers, insecticides, and fortifiers to olives, trimming etc. The blockchain via its decentralized system allow a secure, irreversible, and clear monitoring. A dashboard allow us to highlight the changes while facilitating the work of farmers. Our prototype will be embedded via a Raspberry Pi 4 platform.</jats:p>",

Sustainable supplier selection and evaluation have become an acritical part of supply chain management.

Based on trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy numbers (TIT2FNs) and cloud probability dominance relations (PDR), manufacturers can make more tangible and environmentally friendly decisions in the SSSE process. In this paper, a SSSE indicator system is first established using the necessary economic, environmental, and social factors. The importance of the indicators described in linguistic terms is transformed into TIT2FNs, and the weight of each indicator is calculated. In order to prevent candidate suppliers from promoting performance maliciously, different weights are given according to the impact of the enterprise’s historical performance on the present. Finally, the cloud PDR method is used to determine the optimal sustainable supplier. A case study and analysis are provided to show the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

TiO2-SnO2 thin films have been successfully synthesized using the coprecipitation method and coated on ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) substrate by doctor-blade technique. The structure and morphology of the films were investigated by XRD and SEM respectively. The analysis of optical characteristics shows that the absorbance of TiO2 photoanode is in the wavelength range of 300-600 nm while SnO2 is in the wavelength range of 300-870 nm. The results showed that the synthesized film with SnO2 had a stronger anatase formation than the film with pure TiO2.

Hollow fiber membranes (HFM) operating in a closed mode in an H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-based MBfR often suffer from reverse gas diffusion, taking up space for the effective gas substrate and resulting in a reduction in the HFM diffusion efficiency, which in turn affects denitrification performance. In this work, we developed a laboratory-scale H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-based MBfR, which operated in a closed mode to investigate the dynamics of denitrification performance and biofilm microbial community analysis at different H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply pressures. A faster formation of biofilm on the HFM and a shorter start-up period were found for a higher H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply pressure. An increase in the H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> pressure under 0.08 MPa could significantly promote denitrification, while a minor increase in denitrification was observed once the H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> pressure was over 0.08 MPa.

First, the vibration acceleration response signal of overhead transmission line under breeze environment was simulated by Ansys simulation software. Then the variable modal decomposition of the vibration acceleration response of the transmission line is performed to obtain the intrinsic mode function corresponding to the vibration behavior of the transmission line. The Hilbert transform is used to analyze the intrinsic mode functions of each order, and the Hilbert spectrum and marginal spectrum of the intrinsic mode functions of each order are studied to extract the first six order intrinsic frequencies. Each set of intrinsic frequencies is input as a feature vector into a support vector machine optimized by the sparrow search algorithm for training to achieve the identification of broken strands in overhead transmission lines. This paper studies the inherent frequency changes and identification results of overhead transmission lines under two states of normal operation and broken 5 strands operation, and the test results show that the identification method based on VMD-SSA-SVM has good identification effect on broken strands of overhead lines.</jats:p>"

According to the study, it shows that the customer risk is currently at a moderate level, which will notably impair the supplier’s external financing ability. This phenomenon is more remarkable when the monetary policy is tightened with fierce competition in the industry. This paper unveils the economic consequences of customer risk spillovers from a supply chain, enriches the study of the generation mechanism of corporate financing constraints, and provides investors and regulators with empirical evidence to appreciate corporate financing constraints.</jats:p>",

Soil aggregation can help protect soil organic matter from biodegradation; it affects soil physical (aeration), chemical (water infiltration), and biological (microbial) activities. The integrated plant nutrition system (IPNS) and organic farming (OF) options have been contemplated as a sustainable strategy to sustain soil aggregate stability under adverse climatic conditions and a possible tool to restore degraded soil systems. Results suggested that the application of plant nutrients based on IPNS and soil test crop response (STCR) including mineral fertilizers and organic manure (farmyard manure: FYM) improved soil aggregate stability and mean weight diameter (MWD) under rice–wheat cropping systems. A long-term (19 year) cropping system (rice–wheat) experiment was examined to identify best nutrient management practices. Seven nutrient supply options were applied: organic, mineral fertilizer in combination with IPNS, IPNS + B/IPNS + C to improve soil aggregate stability and MWD after completing 19 cropping cycles of rice–wheat cropping systems. Results showed that significantly higher (+31%) macroaggregates were dominant in the surface soil layer than in the subsurface soil. The significantly highest macroaggregates were observed under OF (60.12 g 100 g−1 dry soil) management practices followed by IPNS options. The MWD was significantly increased (+17%) between surface and subsurface soil. Maximum MWD was reported with OF (0.93 mm) management practices followed by the IPNS + C (0.78 mm), IPNS + B (0.77 mm), IPNS (0.70 mm), STCR (0.69 mm), NPK (0.67 mm), and unfertilized control (0.66 mm) plots. Overall, results suggest that the adoption of IPNS options, such as organic farming (OF), RDF, STCR, and inclusion of pulses (berseem and cowpea), significantly improved all soil aggregation fractions in the soil system and also offered an additional benefit in terms of soil sustainability.</jats:p>"

Today, many parts of the world are facing the problem of water shortage and this problem cannot be easily solved. In addition to the proper use of water resources and preventing the loss of natural water, the establishment of regional water supply networks is effective in meeting the future needs of the people. A water distribution network (water supply network) is a set of interconnected pipelines used to transport and distribute water in a complex. In designing the water distribution network, factors such as the type of water distribution network, water pressure, water velocity, design flow, minimum pipe diameter, pipe material and many other factors should be considered. In this study, we have tried to design the water supply network of a part of Balikpapan city in Indonesia. The design method led to the determination of pressure values in the connection nodes, pipe diameters, flow rate and velocity in the pipes. All the existing criteria are considered in the design of the water supply network. Although this study has been implemented for a specific study area, it can be of great help to designers in designing the water supply network.</jats:p>"

Component outsourcing is an important element of SCM practices and is considered to be a multi-criteria decision-making problem (MCDM) in vendor selection processes. However, decision-making on the selection of vendors is crucial, as the outsourcing program is influenced by multiple technical and commercial criteria of vendors. Developing an Excel-based Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model for vendor selection therefore helps to simplify selection processes. In this paper, a Visual Basic Application (VBA) Excel-based AHP model was developed, which multiple criteria, sub-criteria and vendors and simultaneously compared with multiple main criteria, sub-criteria and alternatives for vendor selection. The model was validated with a case study of selecting a vendor for module components of body-in-white (BIW) in automotive industry as industrial application. As a result, vendor A is the best vendor since it has the highest overall score of 0.35206. Whereas vendor B is 0.239, vendor C is 0.126, vendor D is 0.146 and vendor E 0.135. In addition, the model is capable of resolving other MCDM problems.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the expansion of competitive markets, supply chain management has become one of the critical issues facing businesses. One of the advantages of sustainable competition for companies is to make supply chain activities more efficient and effective. This paper aims at an integrated closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) problem which is multi-objective, multi-product, multi-period, and multi-level with limited capacities and uncertain conditions of demand and return products. The proposed supply chain network consists of five levels in the forward flow. There are five centers in the backward flow as well. The purpose of this network is to determine the optimal number and location of facilities required in each period and the optimal amount of the transfer flow of products or raw materials through different transportation modes between facilities. In this proposed model, three objective functions are taken into consideration. The first one minimizes all the costs. The second objective function maximizes the quality of products. The third objective function seeks to minimize the sum of deviations from the ideal score of the principal component of each supplier. The data of this research are taken from Pishro Diesel Company. To solve the proposed problem, several methods and algorithms have been used, including unscaled goal programming, boundary objectives, three single-objective meta-heuristic algorithms (PSO, RDA, and TGA), and multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithm (MOGA-II). As the results show, considering products and returned parts in products, a simultaneous practice of forward and reverse supply chains leads to better product quality, less damage to the environment, and lower costs for customers.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, with the popularity of mobile aerial base stations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted cloud computing is essential for providing diversified service at areas without available infrastructure. However, it is difficult to meet the requirements of a number of IoT devices which distribute a large area through one single UAV cloud server, and thus multi-clouds have been applied in large-scale IoT environments. Due to the limited battery capacity of UAV, hybrid energy supply has been considered as an effective approach. How to allocate the computing resources and offload the tasks to the UAV-assisted clouds is a challenging task. In this paper, we study the trade-off between the energy consumption and system performance in a UAV-assisted multi-clouds system. Considering the transmission and execution cost, a dynamic optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the power consumption of UAVs with the constraint of queue stability is formulated, which is further decomposed into three sub-problems using stochastic optimization techniques. A collaborative task offloading and resources allocation algorithm (CTORAA) based on artificial intelligent (AI) technique is proposed to jointly determine task offloading and energy harvesting. We provide corresponding mathematical analysis showing that CTORAA can reach the arbitrary profit-stability trade-off. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to validate the efficacy of our algorithm.</jats:p>"

Indonesian demand for energy is also increasing over the time in line with its economic and population growth. The improved of global consciousness toward the sustainable environmental issues, has led in to the choice over an affordable source of energy with a less carbon footprint. On the other hand the natural gas supply and domestic production is depleting. At the current rate of consumption and assuming no new reserves discoveries, sooner or later Indonesia will have to face deficit in gas supply. This study, is first aimed to forecast the Indonesia supply and demand situation of natural gas in years to come, and then performing an analysis and assessment toward the availability and adequacy of the required infrastructures especially receiving terminals facilitating for gas import in anticipation of future deficit of gas supply in Indonesia. From which, it will be further analyzed, the geographical distribution of the demand and then potential short of supply in several regions and areas where the demand are most concentrated. Thus few basis System Dynamics scenarios of public policies were simulated for 30 years running simulation. System Dynamics model simulation has been well known as a powerful tool to represent a complex industrial problems such as national energy systems. The result is unveiled the fact that additional import receiving terminals and storage facility is required at certain areas where the deficits most likely exist, and most of them in fact are in Western Zone of Indonesian.</jats:p>",

Ample research has explored the implications for a South African fossil transition from a domestic perspective, but a lacuna persists in linking South Africa’s fossil regime to broader international finance flows, and particularly the role that actors from the “global North” should play in phasing out South African fossil fuels. This research finds that such institutions have exacerbated South Africa’s prospective stranded asset exposure, and by doing so, have accrued a Stranded Asset Debt (SAD)—as a supply‐side counterpart to the demand‐side climate debt, which they have also accumulated—perhaps to the tune of at least several dozens of billions of dollars. Although the Paris Agreement is flawed, it embodies language that can be leveraged to settle the SAD “bill”.</jats:p>",

China’s South to North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) is the largest IWDP in the world, with a complex relationship between upstream and downstream users of the water supply. Therefore, it is necessary to propose an applicable and unsophisticated cost-sharing method to deal with the complex relationship between upstream and downstream users. This paper proposes an improved cost-sharing method based on the continuity equation of water quantity and the balance equation of the project cost between upstream and downstream users. The fairness of sharing the joint cost between parties involved in the eastern route of SNWDP (ER-SNWDP) obtained using the proposed improved cost-sharing method is investigated by comparing its results with the existing cost-sharing method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can overcome the non-convergence issue of the existing sharing formula and reduce the differences between upstream and downstream users’ sharing costs. The improved method provides a cost-sharing strategy that is more easily accepted by both the upstream and downstream users than the existing estimation approach. Therefore, the proposed pricing approach can provide technical guidance for decision makers in the effective operation of large-scale IWDPs in areas with quasi water markets.</jats:p>"

However, credit risk is expanded, and even transmitted to the whole supply chain, due to their connection, so that it becomes more difficult to effectively identify the credit risk of SMEs. The purpose of this paper was to examine the factors affecting SMEs’ credit risk in the mode of block-chain-driven supply chain finance. This research proposed an entropy weight method to construct independent variables and used logistic regression to examine whether the financing enterprises, core enterprises, assets position under financing, blockchain platform, and supply chain operation have significant impacts on credit risk. The panel data, originating from CSMAR on fifty-six quoted SMEs, included eight core enterprises and twenty-six blockchain enterprises, between 2016 and 2020. The results showed that the financing enterprises, core enterprises, asset position under fi-nance, blockchain platform, and supply chain operation have significant impacts on SMEs’ credit risk when the confidence level is 90%. The financial status of financing enterprises can reflect the credit status of SMEs. Core enterprises give credit guarantees to SMEs, and the business transactions between SMEs and core enterprises affect the credit risk through the asset position under financing. Meanwhile, blockchain platforms can solve the problem of the information asymmetry of the par-ticipating enterprises in supply chain operations. At the same time, the supply chain operation is also an important factor affecting the credit risk. This conclusion provides a reference for the ap-plication of blockchains in supply chains, to reduce the credit risk. At the same time, the selected indicators were more comprehensive, which provided a strong basis for the subsequent construc-tion of a credit risk assessment model using key factors.</jats:p>"

We construct game models of a supply chain with different dominant types under a mixed carbon policy that embraces carbon cap-and-trade and carbon tax. Solving each dominant model, we derive the effective area and optimal threshold of the mixed carbon policy to guide LCT. We find that the selling price, market demand, and profit of the supply chain system are equal in different dominant models due to the mixed carbon policy, but when a company dominates the supply chain, its profit is higher than when it is a subordinate. In addition, the high-carbon manufacturers (HCM) will pursue LCT only when the sum of the carbon tax rates and carbon trading prices is within a certain threshold, and the subordinate HCM are more likely to be driven to pursue LCT. Therefore, the government should adopt a differentiated hybrid carbon policy, setting a high (low) carbon tax rate for the HCM in a dominant (subordinate) position.</jats:p>"

The first human civilizations thrived in places with an abundance of water, typically nearby large rivers as the Tigris–Euphrates, Yang Che and Nile. The invention and construction of hydraulic infrastructure came only later, in prehistoric times, triggered by the expansion of humanity in water-scarce areas. The ancient Greeks invented impressive hydraulic works and small-scale structures, some of which, such as cisterns, were still fully operational until the 20th century. We present a model that explains the use of cisterns in the water-scarce area of West Mani, which allows us to assess the potential of this traditional rainfall harvesting practice to support the modern water supply needs. To assess the system’s reliability, we employ a long-term simulation of a typical cistern system, using synthetic rainfall series from a stochastic model, and assuming variable water demand on a monthly scale. We show that a proper restoration of the cisterns could be sustainable as a complementary water supply source, decreasing the area’s drinking water cost and increasing the locals’ resilience against water shortages. In addition, we highlight the links between the area’s hydroclimate and its history and discuss the cultural merits of reviving and preserving this centuries-long practice.</jats:p>"

The wireless power supply integrates wireless power transfer, power management and energy storage functions. The PMUT array is used as a passive wireless power receiver, followed by electrical impedance matching networks and a voltage multiplier for efficient power transmission and rectification. The output power intensity of the wireless receiver reaches 7.36 μW/mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>with an incident ultrasound power below the FDA safety limit. The output power of the wireless power supply reaches 18.8 μW and a 100-μF capacitor is fully charged to 3.19 V after power management, which are sufficient to power many low-power implantable biomedical devices such as for neural electrical stimulation, biosensors and intrabody communication applications. The wireless power supply is implemented in a PCB with a diameter of 1 cm. With biocompatibility and CMOS compatibility of AlN thin film compared to commonly used PZT, the proposed solution paves the way for safer and ultraminiaturized wireless power supplies with further development incorporating all the functions on a monolithic chip in the future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cavern development is a viable source of land supply, which can provide solution space for a broad variety of land uses and preserve the valuable ecology and green environment at the ground surface.  While most of the caverns are purposely built to house various facilities, underground quarrying-cum-cavern development at suitable sites is a viable means of creating a valuable cavern land bank.  With thoughtful planning and prudent site selection, the operation of an underground quarry associated with concrete batching and asphalt production operations can be a self-financing or even profitable business in the short to medium term, while the cavern space created can be utilized for other strategic uses in the long term.  To take forward this initiative, the Civil Engineering and Development Department has completed a technical study to establish the technical feasibility and possible implementation arrangement of underground quarrying-cum-cavern development in Hong Kong.  A prototype reference design based on the site setting of the Lam Tei Quarry has been produced, considering factors including technical, operational and logistic considerations.  This paper presents the findings of the study, including the reference design and implementation model, and discusses the prospect of the underground quarry-cum-cavern development as a land supply means in Hong Kong.</jats:p>"

Uma estratégia para atender a essa expansão da demanda e reduzir a pressão sobre a produção de alimentos é minimizar o desperdício de alimentos. O objetivo deste trabalho é avaliar se a combinação de práticas operacionais e gerenciais nas etapas da logística e comercialização de frutas e vegetais estão associadas aos menores níveis de desperdício no setor atacadista. Foram analisados cinco produtos do grupo de frutas e hortaliças: alface, batata, laranja, mamão e tomate, vendidos por atacadistas da Central de Abastecimento de Alimentos (CEASA). Foram utilizadas a análise de componentes principais e as regras de associação para reconhecer a inter-relação das práticas que promovem a redução de desperdícios. O desperdício autorreferido de mamão e batata foi de 5,8%, para alface 22,5%, tomate 3,3% e laranja 2,2%. Foram identificadas treze práticas e comportamentos que explicam 100% da variância, e que estão associadas ao componente tecnológico e ao componente de comercialização. Com base nas regras da associação, a elevada frequência de oito práticas, como a prestação de serviços de apoio ao cliente e a utilização de câmaras frigoríficas, está relacionada com a redução do desperdício de frutas e vegetais.</jats:p>"

However, few ES bundle studies considered both the supply and demand sided. The objective of this study was to map ES supply–demand bundles to comprehensively analyze the ES tradeoffs in the Yangtze River Delta using cluster analysis, correlation analysis, hotspot analysis, and principal component analysis. We found that: (1) Both the supply and demand of ES are unevenly distributed with highly spatial autocorrelation. (2) There are significant tradeoffs and synergies between ES in terms of supply–supply, demand–demand, and supply–demand. (3) Four ES supply–demand bundle types were identified with distinct ES supply and demand relationships. (4) Land-use types, urban intensity, and climatic factors are the main social-ecological factors that distinguish the four identified clusters. The identified ES supply–demand clusters can support the main functional zoning of the Yangtze River Delta. Our results also suggest that land sharing is a more appropriate approach for the sustainable development of the Yangtze River Delta considering the balance of multiple ES supply and ES demand.</jats:p>"

Objetivo Este trabalho teve por objetivo quantificar e analisar a eficácia de uma campanha de intervenção por conscientização para o combate ao desperdício de alimentos em uma unidade de alimentação e nutrição. Método Foi estabelecido o índice per capita de resto-ingestão. A coleta desse dado foi realizada durante 25 dias, sendo 10 dias antes, 5 dias durante e 10 dias depois da campanha de conscientização. Resultados Houve redução da média per capita do resto-ingestão de 60,0 ± 14,9 para 39,3 ± 13,4; esse dado concordou com trabalhos existentes na literatura sobre o assunto. Pôde-se também contabilizar uma diminuição do custo financeiro médio em torno de 34,6%. Conclusão Constata-se com este estudo que a falta de conscientização dos comensais contribui significativamente para o alto desperdício de alimentos, pois foi notória a redução do desperdício por resto-ingestão após intervenção.</jats:p>"

This study estimates how paddy ecosystem elasticity and external human activity affect paddy ecosystem sustainable food supply. In particular, we analyzed how sustainable food supply is affected by three key domains of external factors—ecological factors, including the proportion of paddy Area (Are), per capita cultivated land area (Lan), and annual wastewater discharge per capita (Was); economic factors, including the agricultural economy level (Inv) and urbanization rate (Urb); and social factors, including the education of farmers (Edu) and rural medical level (Med). We use ANEV, or net paddy ecosystem services value per unit area, to assess the sustainable food supply, which not only represents the food supply quantity and quality, but also the sustainability of the food supply. Results from our panel and threshold regressions suggest that Lan and Urb have a threshold effect on paddy ANEV; Are, Was, Inv, and Edu have a linear negative correlation with ANEV; and Med has a positive linear correlation with ANEV. Based on our findings, we lay out a series of recommendations that may guide future formulation of policies on paddy ecosystem protection and sustainable food supply.</jats:p>"

RPA is a technology that enables organisations to automate rule-based and repetitive tasks in processes through the use of software robots. Instead of requiring time consuming process reengineering that leads to heavy investment on IT system transformations, RPA is able to perform such routine processes by running across systems. For an example, customer orders of a third-party logistics service providing company can be easily entered into internal warehouse management system using RPA. Therefore, RPA can be interpreted as a strategic tool which gives benefits such as improved productivity, improved data accuracy, improved compliance levels, reduced process execution time and costs. However, Nitin Bhatt [1] mentions that, nearly 30% to 50% RPA projects are failures. Accordingly, there are some other factors organisations must consider apart from technological know-how when taking RPA initiatives. This article intends to reveal such factors identified through an industry survey and interview sessions conducted with 12 industry experts who have at least three years of experiences in supply chain and RPA disciplines. Overall, fourteen factors were identified under three categories namely: Strategy; Process; and Organisation.</jats:p>",

The samples were analysed for physical parameters, major ions along with fluoride and uranium. The results were integrated with GIS to represent both seasonal and spatial variations of groundwater quality parameters, drinking groundwater quality index (DGQI) and irrigation groundwater quality index (IGQI). Results show that groundwater is alkaline in nature and largely controlled by the silicate weathering, ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes. However high nitrate concentration exceeding the WHO guideline suggests the influence of anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality. The average values of the major ions concentrations was found higher in pre monsoon season due to change in the recharge. The DGQI values of 6 samples in pre monsoon and 2 samples in post monsoon season falls under poor water quality. However, individual irrigation indices along with the combine IGQI indicate groundwater is suitable for irrigation in both the seasons. These results along with the seasonal and spatial variability map may help the decision makers in planning for better domestic and irrigation water supply.</jats:p>",

The e-platform usually acts as a product reseller or serves as an online marketplace. The former is referred to as a reselling mode where the order fulfillment cost is paid by the supplier, and the latter is named as an agency selling mode where the platform pays for the order fulfillment cost. Motivated by the industrial cases, three power structures are utilized to capture the veridical market pricing. We find that the platform and the supplier’s selling mode strategies conflict in a great majority of cases, except for the region in which both the platform agency fee and the order fulfillment cost are moderate. The players can coordinate by Pareto improvement, and the improved result shows that the optimal selling modes are a reselling mode in the fierce competitive supply chain circumstance and agency selling mode in the monopolistic circumstance or the mild competitive circumstance. Surprisingly, adopting a reselling mode is not only a better choice than adopting an agency selling mode in the fierce competitive supply chain circumstance, but this makes the supply chain obtain more of a payoff than in the monopolistic circumstance. Furthermore, it is worth noting that each player choosing an agency selling mode will result in a “prisoner’s dilemma” in the competitive supply chain circumstance, where both players can obtain more payoffs with a reselling mode. In addition, the willingness of platforms and suppliers to play the role of “reseller” is the strongest under the ps structure and the weakest in the ss structure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of sharing manufacturing, a three-echelon low-carbon supply chain has been established, consisting of the leader-shared manufacturing platform, the follower surplus capacity demander, and the surplus capacity provider. Furthermore, the differential game method is used to determine the best equilibrium strategy for the perfect trajectory of product emission reduction and the ideal profit of supply chain participants in three scenarios: decentralized decision-making, centralized decision-making, and decentralized decision-making based on a two-way cost-sharing contract taking into account the long-term and dynamic nature of emission reduction issues. We compare the three scenarios by using analysis and numerical simulation. The findings show that once the contract was implemented, supply chain members’ levels of effort, product emission reduction, and supply chain system profit reached centralized decision-making levels, achieving the dual Pareto improvement of economic and environmental advantages. The conclusions achieved may be used as a theoretical framework for decision-making by players in the low-carbon supply chain, as well as a collaborative approach.</jats:p>"

The dynamical FFSCS is divided into special predator category P(η), top-predator class Q(η), and prey population dynamics R(η). The computing numerical performances for three different variations of the dynamical FFSCS are provided by using the ANNs along with the Bayesian regularization approach. The data selection for the dynamical FFSCS is selected for train as 78% and 11% for both test and endorsement. The accuracy of the proposed ANNs along with the Bayesian regularization method is approved using the comparison performances.

The objective of this work was to identify the main morphological variations of the cells, filaments and thallus of the cyanobacteria Nostoc sp. LBALBR-2 submitted to ultraviolet radiation (UV-C) in microcosm systems. The cyanobacteria Nostoc sp. was subjected to four treatments: 1- control treatment in nutrient medium; 2- treatment in nutrient medium with exposure to UV-C radiation; 3- control treatment in medium without nutrients and 4- treatment in medium without nutrients with exposure to UV-C radiation. Optical density and chlorophyll-a analyses were performed to determine the growth of Nostoc populations and microscopic analyses to characterize the morphological development of the species. Lack of nutrients generated short trichomes with terminal heterocytes, scattered solitary akinetes and appearance of hormogonia. On nutrient medium the trichomes of Nostoc sp. showed predominantly the vegetative serial form. Cultures exposed to UV-C produced anomalous cells, thick mucilage, fragmented trichomes and hormogonia. It is concluded that Nostoc sp. LBALBR-2 grew well under eutrophication conditions and although it showed cell deformation it was resistant to UV-C radiation.</jats:p>"

But from the viewpoint of association members, they built their own apartments by themselves.\r\nAt the real estate reconstruction(Reconstruction members’ portion+general public sales portion), ① acquisition tax, value added tax and capital gain tax will be imposed as if members built their own apartment.\r\nFrom the viewpoint of preservative registration of real estate, the obligator of acquisition tax is the association member, accordingly, value-added-tax is not imposed on the association member. Also this real estate is not considered a transfer of ownership. Accordingly there is no capital gain tax because the newly built apartment considered the same as existing apartment.\r\n② An association tax will be imposed as if the member of reconstruction invests investment-in-kind by the existing real estate and buys a newly constructed apartment from the association(exchanging the existing old apartment and receiving newly built apartment). Accordingly the association will appraise the real estate property based on investment-in-kind and determine the value of land when the association sells a newly built apartment.(An association shall be taxed as a corporation entity) This existing real estate appraisal value is very important because the association tax (corporate tax) and dividend tax to the member of association will be determined by this appraisal value as tax basis for the gain on sale on the general public sale portion of real estate.\r\nThis kind of two different aspect generate a few issues of taxation on acquisition tax, value added tax, and capital gain tax etc.\r\nThis thesis presents a view of dual status position right on the association.\r\nThe association is the original acquirer of the apartments sold to the general public but the original acquirer is the association member for the member portion of real estate, and the role of association is permitting to use the association’s name to build the new apartment.\r\nGiven the dual status position right, the association can claim both positions: first as the supplier to the general public sale of newly constructed apart- ments, and second as the joint purchaser of real estate for the association members.\r\nThis thesis reviews issues and dual status position right in connection with reconstruction projects under the current tax law and suggests an amendment for the Restriction of Special Taxation Act, Corporate Tax Act, and Value-added-Tax Act.\r\nIf tax laws apply the following dual status position thesis, the grounded jurisprudence theory of acquisition tax, value-added tax and capital gain tax (original acquisition value of apartment for the member portion) will apply to the association tax. That means the theory of tax law will be consistent with the theory of that the member built</jats:p>",

The carbon reduction in prefabricated buildings has attracted increasing attention due to its importance to low-carbon and energy savings in the construction industry and achieving China’s “dual carbon” goal. Although research has been conducted on carbon reduction in prefabricated buildings, the use of cloud models for carbon reduction effect evaluation has not been explored. This study therefore aims to develop a cloud model-based evaluation of the carbon emission reduction effect for prefabricated buildings incorporating the characteristics of prefabricated buildings and the building supply chain. The developed model can support assessments of the whole life cycle phases of a prefabricated building. Firstly, carbon flow analysis is carried out from the perspective of the construction supply chain, and the carbon emission reduction effect evaluation index system of prefabricated buildings is established, which contains 5 guideline layers and 26 carbon emission reduction indicators. Secondly, the Continuous Ordered Weighted Averaging operator (C-OWA) is used to calculate the index weight calculation, and the cloud model is applied to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the carbon emission reduction effect. Finally, this model is applied to evaluate the carbon emission reduction effect in the case of a building. The case study validated the efficiency of the developed model. This study extends the knowledge of carbon emission reduction by addressing specific characteristics of prefabrication and the construction supply chain. This validated model will enhance the willingness to apply prefabricated buildings to reduce carbon emissions and achieve the “dual carbon” goal.</jats:p>"

We aimed to estimate the potential for expansion of this service considering the installed capacity in the country’s municipalities. From the data of June 2021 in the Cadastro Nacional de Estabelecimentos de Saúde (Brazilian National Registry of Health Facilities, CNES), three different scenarios of abortion provision provided by law in pregnancies resulting from rape were elaborated, and the percentage of female population of childbearing age living in the municipalities of each scenario was calculated by region. The first scenario included the municipalities with installed provision; the second, those with potential for provision considering the current regulations; and the third, those with potential for provision considering only the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the Penal Code of Brazil. The scenarios were composed of 55, 662 and 3,741 municipalities, respectively, and were home to 26.7%, 62.1%, and 94.3% of the country’s females between the ages of 10 and 49. In all regions, there was installed capacity to expand provision, both in light of current regulations and international recommendations.</jats:p>"

Due to the high permeability of the sand gravel medium, only infiltration deep runoff (IDR) and surface runoff (SR) occurred in the sand tank experiment. The increase in water released did not improve the effective recharge. The IDR accounted for 65–85% of the water released. After clogging appeared, the value decreased to 15–30%. More than 96% of suspended solids were deposited in the surface and upper areas of the sand tank, among which the sand gravel surface covered by the thin clay layer formed by suspended particles was the main cause of the change in the distribution of IDR and SR. A rubber dam can promote the conversion of high velocity SR to low velocity lateral shallow runoff (LSR) by 25–30% while increasing the deposition mass of suspended particles in the sand tank. The rationality of the sand tank model was verified by the numerical model, and the fitting degree between the simulated and the measured results was greater than 0.9.</jats:p>",

To this purpose, the result presented in this conference paper is a description of the constructive structure (climatic impacts, construction, piezo technology) of a “Piezoelectric Textile Facade” as well as test results on piezo tapes. This opens new possibilities in the context of the application of hook-and-loop fasteners, the energy supply of active sensor technologies as well as in the field of data acquisition and data management.</jats:p>",

In particular, sudden global public health events have brought a great test to the supply chain. How to make sustainable planning and preparedness and smoothly carry out supply chain operations and obtain sustainable firm performance in the complex market environment requires urgent attention from industries and academia. The different effects of supply chain operational capability and dynamic capability on the long-term performance and short-term performance of enterprises are still unclear; therefore, a model was established to discuss this. Based on the theory of dynamic capability, a relational model between supply chain dynamic capability, supply chain operational capability, and firm performance was constructed, a hypothesis testing method and Amos software were used to verify the set model, and the mechanisms of supply chain dynamic capability and supply chain operational capability on firm performance were discussed. The empirical results show that supply chain operational capability has a mediating effect on supply chain dynamic capability and firm performance, and supply chain dynamic capability has a moderating impact on supply chain operational capability and firm performance. The supply chain and its enterprises should cultivate and continuously improve the supply chain dynamic capability as soon as possible, so that in the face of emergencies, the supply chain operation capability can be reasonably configured to avoid damage, improve firm performance, and gain competitive advantages.</jats:p>"

Anatomical complexity is expected since the liver is developed by mergingof lobules with its separate blood supply. This makes a wide range of variations in the pattern of vascular arrangement and so reinforces the need for an accurate understanding of full spectrum of variations. This study aimed to investigate the variations in origin and distribution of extrahepatic arterial supply. Fifty volunteers (32 males and 18 females) aged 20–70 years were randomly recruited from the department of CT scan in Al Amal Hospital, Khartoum North, Sudan. The patients were already candidates for CT angiography with contrast for conditions other than hepatobiliary diseases. The reported data is related to those who accepted to participate in the study. Patients with history of hepatobiliary disease were excluded. 3D views of the scans were treated and the extrahepatic arterial tree was traced in a computer-based software. Key findings suggest that Michel’s classification was considered the standard template for description – 76% of them showed Michel’s type I classification. Types III and V constituted about 2%. About 4% of the cases were represented by types VI and IX. Other types of variations constituted about 12%. To conclude, although type I classification which describes the textbook pattern of hepatic artery distribution was significantly detected among the Sudanese population, other variants were to be considered since they are related to major arteries like aorta and superior mesenteric.</jats:p>"

The present study evaluates the supply and demand of ecosystem water provision services in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and simulates the spatial flow pattern and transmission mechanism of water provision services. Additionally, the study establishes dynamic and static water security indices and identify water security level to quantify the water resources security of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau under the changing ecological environment.

(c) From the perspective of ‘supply-demand-flow’ of ecosystem services, although the function of the water tower on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau has declined, it remained safe condition on the whole study area. The method of establishing spatial correlation between mismatched supply and demand of ecosystem services and evaluating regional water security based on ecosystem service flow constructed in this study presents the water security status and spatial distribution of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau more scientifically, providing a reference for water resource management in other regions.</jats:p>",

It is theoretically expected to be a business value add element in terms of capability and competitiveness in the supply chain ecosystem, which is fundamental in business success. But digitalization also has its own risks and challenges including expertise, capital, cooperation, incentives, and support from other economic units, such as other merchants and customer preferences. Failure in digitization can lead to mistrust and negative perceptions that may lead to effects the SME growth. Among the biggest digitalization challenges are for the rural micro-entrepreneurs (RME) who live in areas that lack digital support facilities and technological capabilities, such as a weak internet connection and native customer's desire to buy using online shopping platforms. This study will analyze the competitive level of RME businesses from a supply chain perspective. To analyze the impact of supply chain digitization (DSC), a mediator effect will be used. DSC will be applied in mediator effect to entrepreneurial supply chain towards the level of RME’s business competitiveness. The hypothesis of this study is DSC practice has a role on the growth of RME business competitiveness. Using the Partial Lease Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method, this study found that RMC’s efforts on business digitization do not have a significant impact on the development of business competitiveness. The hypothesis of this study was confirmed by the rate of P-value. While DSC mediator effect through variance accounted for (VAF) calculation found that there is low partial mediation (23%).  This paper proposes a further study on the elements of competitiveness and the desire for digitalization of RMC to be investigated, while the current need for a comprehensive DSC model of RMC particularly, in line with rural economic development issues in Malaysia.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Applications of plant growth regulators such as paclobutrazol (PAC) to grain maize frequently caused depressions in grain yield. This negative impact probably originated from treatments at an early growth stage during plant ontogenesis when the determination of potential kernel number coincided with time of regulator application. However, stability of grain yield itself is of high relevance, and it is also the key determinant for harvest index (HI) and the use efficiencies of water (WUE) and nutrients (NUE). Therefore, in a container experiment, the effect of delayed PAC application at growth stage V8 was tested with the maize ( <jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.) cultivars Galactus and Fabregas. Immediately after PAC treatment, differential N fertilization was introduced in order to meet the demand of the control plants (100% N), and with a supply of 75% N. With late PAC application (V8), grain yield depressions could not only successfully be avoided; moreover, in Galactus‐75%N, a significant increase in grain yield was achieved combined with an extended duration of pollen shed by 28%. Straw yield decreased less strongly after late compared with early PAC application, leading to small, but significant increases in HI for the maize plants with 75% N supply. An increase in PAC dosage combined with later application will certainly lead to stronger decreases in straw yield, but it will also enhance the risk for grain yield depressions, and thus, an overall stronger improvement of HI is uncertain. For the time around silking, remarkable improvements of WUE<jats:sub>grain</jats:sub> by 18% were achieved after delayed PAC application to Galactus‐75%N. After PAC treatment, significant increases in nitrogen‐harvest index (NHI) and thus N partitioning to grain were achieved for Fabregas and for Galactus‐75%N. Although luxurious N consumption did not occur, late PAC application showed neither an effect on N‐utilization efficiency (NUtE<jats:sub>grain</jats:sub>) nor on N‐uptake efficiency (NUpE). It can be concluded that it is a very complex task to achieve the right balance between PAC dosage, stability of grain yield and optimal N supply in order to avoid both, luxurious N consumption and N deficiency, and to achieve an improvement of NUtE<jats:sub>grain</jats:sub> of maize plants.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the research is to establish the criterion for assessing the pipeline operation efficiency and verify the accuracy of hydraulic design of metal pipes that have internal deposits.  Materials and methods. The authors provide calculated dependences to determine the values of the characteristics of the hydraulic potential of metal pipes having internal deposits. A specific case is employed to compare the characteristics of new pipes and pipes having different thicknesses of the layer of internal deposits. The percent discrepancy between pipe characteristics is provided.  Results. The authors recommend evaluating the accuracy of the hydraulic design of water supply and sewerage networks having internal deposits in reliance on the value of the operation efficiency coefficient for water supply or sewerage networks. The authors offer a formula derived to determine the value of the efficiency coefficient for the operation of water supply and sewerage networks having internal deposits on inside walls of a pipe. The authors suggest systematizing the hydraulic design of metal water supply and sewerage networks that are made of metal and have deposits on the inside of pipe walls by taking into account the thickness of the layer of internal deposits, characterized by the value of the network operation efficiency coefficient.  Conclusions. Systematization of hydraulic design of water supply and sewerage networks that are made of metal and have deposits on the inside of pipe walls allows for the acceptable accuracy of its hydraulic design that takes account of the actual value of the coefficient of efficiency of pipeline operation Kef, taking into account the value of actual thickness of deposit layer σact. In other words, systematization of hydraulic design of water supply and sewerage networks, having deposits on the inside surface of metal pipes, is based on the value of their efficiency coefficient Kef, that takes into account the actual hydraulic potential of pipes (pipelines) depending on the layer of internal deposits σact.</jats:p>"

Different from existing research on crowdfunding with symmetric thinking, this paper employs text mining and the QCA method to identify various configurations of crowdfunding success. Based on the data of the leading Chinese crowdfunding platform, JD Crowdfunding, this paper studies multiple configurations of the green supply chain, delivery time and funding goals of crowdfunding projects in the technology category. The results show that a crowdfunding project that adopts a green supply chain can succeed with a higher funding goal and longer delivery time, and a project without a green supply chain but with a lower funding goal is also a successful configuration. In addition, this study also explores the successful configuration paths of hedonic products and functional products in crowdfunding projects, respectively, and it finds that investors of hedonic products pay more attention to green supply chain management. These findings support complexity theory, deepen the understanding of the success of crowdfunding projects, and provide important management suggestions for fundraisers and crowdfunding platforms.</jats:p>"

The 0-1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model (0-1 MINPOM) used previously could only identify the location and release intensity for GCSs. Thus a 0-1 MINPOM was improved and applied to simultaneously identify the number, location and release history of GCSs. In addition, to reduce the time of calling the simulation model for iterative calculation, the deep belief neural network (DBNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM) and Kriging method were applied to establish an ensemble surrogate model of the simulation model to replace the simulation model for iterative calculation. The results show that compared with the three single surrogate models, the ensemble surrogate model has the highest approximation accuracy to the simulation model, and could save 99% of the calculation time when iterative calculation was performed in place of the simulation model. The improved 0-1 MINPOM could identify the number, location, and release history of GCSs simultaneously. The accuracy of identifying the number of GCSs was 100%, and the accuracies of identifying the locations and release history were above 95.12% and 83.51%, respectively.</jats:p>",

To achieve this goal, sustainable supplier selection (SSS) and order allocation (OA) are seen as the crucial activities in corporate management. In the process of SSS, the psychological behavior of decision-makers (DMs) could play a critical role in the evaluation results. Therefore, introducing it into the decision-making process may lead to decision in line with the actual situation. In the uncertain multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problem described by probability linguistic term sets (PLTS), the DMs can evaluate the criteria of each supplier based on his own preference and hesitation, which is useful to avoid the loss of information. For this reason, this study develops a novel multi-criteria group decision-making combined with fuzzy multi-objective optimization (MCGDM-FMOO) model for SSS/OA problems by considering the triple bottom line (TBL) in which includes economic, environmental and social factors. The proposed method includes four stages. (1) the best-worst method (BWM) and entropy weight method are utilized to assign the weights of criteria to obtain the comprehensive weight. According to the output weights, the an acronym for interactive and multi-criteria decision-making in Portugese (TODIM) approach is applied to rank the suppliers under PLTS environment; (2) a FMOO model that can effectively deal with uncertainties and dynamic nature of parameter is formulated for allocating optimal order quantities; (3) two novel approaches are utilized to solve the FMOO model in order to obtain the richer Pareto frontier; and (4) the final OA solution is achieved by technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Finally, the validity and practicability of proposed MCGDM-FMOO model are verified by an example and comparative analysis with other classical MCGDM methods.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this paper proposes a method for locating leak locations in a water supply network using temporal convolutional networks. First, a continuous sequence of pressure signals is input into the proposed network model. Then, we map it to two parallel outputs by the network model. In the first output, leak detection is performed as a multi-label classification task. In the second output, the location of the leak is determined using a regression algorithm. This paper tests the proposed network framework on benchmark networks. The results show that the network framework can obtain accurate leak locations and outperform the commonly used network frameworks.</jats:p>",

Switching the flow direction of the drip irrigation pipe can improve the flow velocity in the lateral, consequently washing up the sediment deposited in the lateral and flow channel of the emitter. Thus, this technology can reduce sediment deposition and prevent blockage of the drip irrigation pipe. To verify the effectiveness of the commutative flow technology, the drip irrigation experiment was conducted, and the unidirectional flow technology experiment was the control. At the end of the tests, the emitter average relative discharge (Dra) of the commutative and unidirectional flow drip irrigation pipes decreased to 92.8 and 62.9%, the emitter blocking rate was 7.7 and 35.9%, respectively; the total amount of sediment deposited in the commutative flow lateral was 37.5% of that in the unidirectional flow lateral. Compared with the unidirectional flow technology, the commutative flow technology could significantly mitigate the decline rate of flow discharge, and effectively reduce the emitter blockage rate and the lateral sediment amount. Thus, the application of the commutative flow technology in the drip irrigation field pipe network can improve irrigation quality and promote the development of muddy water drip irrigation.</jats:p>",

The results revealed that (1) there were significant pairwise correlations between SES, EF and its dimensions, and ADHD, except for a non-significant correlation between SES and regulation ability; (2) after controlling for preschool children’s age and sex, SES directly predicted preschoolers’ ADHD and EF partially mediated the association between SES and ADHD; and (3) among the EF dimensions, working memory and inhibitory ability significantly mediated the association between SES and ADHD, whereas the mediating effect of regulatory ability was not significant. These results suggest that SES can affect the ADHD of preschoolers both directly and through EF, especially through working memory and inhibitory ability. This supports the family stress model and family investment model of the relationship between SES and the development of children to some extent, and provides a reference for the early prevention of ADHD in children with low SES.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Food loss and waste have become an issue of global significance, considering their concurrent effects on the socioeconomic and environmental facet of society. Despite this domain gaining prolific attention recently, issues hampering the effective utilization of residues from fish processing usually go unidentified in developing economies such as India. This occurs mainly owing to fragmented supply chains, inappropriate handling, discontinuous cold chains, inadequate temperature monitoring and so on, affecting quality and causing underuse. Any researcher trying to understand the prospects of utilizing these fish processing co-streams in a developing economy with the vision of improving consumption, economic sustainability, reducing discards and promoting circularity faces a lacuna. The authors address this demand in research by identifying the validity of this domain both in the global and native research community by conducting a detailed review using bibliometric analysis and content analysis. Data from Scopus with 717 documents, comprising 612 research articles from 78 countries, 1597 organizations and 2587 authors, are analysed. Results signify (i) developing a focus on hydroxyapatite production, bio-methane generation, transesterification processes, biomass and the rest raw material generated from fish processing, and (ii) reduced research on supply chain-related aspects despite their considerable importance. To comprehend this deficiency, especially in the Indian stance, barriers hindering the utilization of generated by-products are identified, and recommendations for improvements are proposed. The results will provide the struts for a circular and sustainable supply chain for processed seafood in developing economies. </jats:p>",

A solution to this problem is to monitor the stabilized electrical supply voltages of the medical equipment. The net effect of the proposed protection is the automatic disconnection of the medical equipment from the alternating voltage network supplying the medical equipment. This disconnection must be done without using electrical switching devices that contain electrical contacts that can generate electrical sparks. This is because most of the time the medical equipment is placed in an area where pure oxygen or other combustible gases predominate. Therefore, only static relays are used in this case. The realized electronic module has been tested in the laboratory and is capable of automatic disconnection of any medical equipment from the 230 V~, f = 50 Hz AC power supply in the case of major faults, which can be caused by accidental overvoltage on the electric energy supply lines, accidental overtemperatures, transient overvoltage which are propagated during storms, etc. This study presents the transient phenomena that occur in the immediate vicinity of the monitored voltages range. Finally, a solution for simultaneous monitoring of four electric voltages and/or currents is presented.</jats:p>",

Five Eulerian path based design scenarios were derived using the C language program. The pressure and residual chlorine distribution pattern of five design scenarios and the existing small block network were simulated using EPANET and compared each other. Also, by comparing all scenarios construction costs, the economic feasibility related to initial investment cost was reviewed.Results and Discussion : Five Eulerian path scenarios with two or more closed pipe loops were suggested using the C language program checking out adjacency matrix. One of them(scenario 5) consists of 7 closed pipes that can supply water to all nodes even if the number of pipes is reduced by about 10, and an increase in residual chlorine concentration of about 0.01 mg/L can be predicted at each node. In addition, it is expected that the initial investment cost of Scenario 5 can be reduced by about 23%, compared to the initial investment cost of the existing small block.Conclusion : Therefore, by applying the concept of an Eulerian path to the design of a water supply pipe network, it is possible to economically eliminate meaningless pipes while maintaining the redundancy of water supply.</jats:p>"

Here, we investigated the impacts of N supply on the defense induced in maize (Zea mays) against the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). In the absence of herbivore attack or exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) application, N supply increased plant biomass and enhanced maize nutrient (soluble sugar and amino acid) contents and leaf area fed by S. frugiperda (the feeding leaf area of S. frugiperda larvae in maize supplemented with 52.2 and 156.6 mg/kg of N was 4.08 and 3.83 times that of the control, respectively). When coupled with herbivore attack or JA application, maize supplemented with 52.2 mg/kg of N showed an increased susceptibility to pests, while the maize supplemented with 156.6 mg/kg of N showed an improved defense against pests. The changes in the levels of nutrients, and the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) caused by N supply could explain the above opposite induced defense in maize. Compared with herbivore attack treatment, JA application enhanced the insect resistance in maize supplemented with 156.6 mg/kg of N more intensely, mainly reflecting a smaller feeding leaf area, which was due to indole emission and two upregulated defensive genes, MPI (maize proteinase inhibitor) and PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase). Hence, the optimal N level and appropriate JA application can enhance plant-induced defense against pests.</jats:p>"

Our results show that: for water users, the regulatory strategy of co-operational agencies affects the competition of water users, and the competition strategies among water users also affect each other. The economic benefits of water resources, water withdrawal costs, fine and honor value all affect the water resources competition strategy of water users. For co-operational agencies, the competition strategy of water users affects the regulatory strategy of co-operational agencies. The intensity of penalization and the regulatory cost have an impact on the regulatory strategy of co-operational agencies, but the amount of operation funds of co-operational agencies does not affect its regulatory strategy.

This paper proposes an advanced ecological baseflow computation-dynamic thematic evaluation service model by considering the ecological protection objectives. The method was applied to five key cross-sections of the Weihe River, and a set of recommended ecological baseflow values was obtained considering the connectivity, water environment, and water-sediment balance, which is in line with the actual requirements.

The theoretical value of ecosystem services (ESTV) is not suitable for determining ecosystem service compensation, posing challenges for integrated regional ecological development. A scarcity value model was used to analyze the influence of changes in supply and demand on the scarcity value of ecosystem services (ESSV) in the context of land-use change. The spatio-temporal distribution characteristics and trends of the ESSV from 2010 to 2020 were assessed in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomeration in China, and the driving factors were analyzed to provide theoretical guidance for horizontal ecological compensation across regions. The results show the following: (1) In the scenario that did not consider the impact of supply and demand changes on the scarcity value, the total ESTV decreased by 8.67% from 2010 to 2020, and high-value areas shifted to the west and south, whereas low-value areas shifted to the central and northern region and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Ringbelt. The ESTV was low in Shanghai and Jiangsu and high in Zhejiang. (2) In the scenario that considered changes in the supply and demand of ecosystem services, the ESSV increased from RMB 213 million in 2010 to RMB 1.323 billion in 2020; an increase of 521.13%. The scarcity value showed high variability within the provinces, with a larger difference between Zhejiang and Jiangsu and a smaller difference between Anhui and Shanghai. The ESSV was higher in counties with increased urbanization and high population density and lower in counties with slower economic growth and fewer people. (3) Regional ecological integration planning and management should be strengthened, and the ESSV might be considered as the reference standard for ecological compensation. The ESSV showed that spatio-temporal heterogeneity might guide the conversion from ecological resources to ecological capital and promote the regulatory role of market mechanisms to achieve horizontal payments for ecosystem services across regions.</jats:p>"

Global pork markets are becoming more competitive, riding the wind of the bilateral free trade agreement. The World Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) compiles prices for other major food categories but does not track changes in the imported pork prices in China. This study has filled this gap by designing the Imported Pork Producer Declaration Price Index (PPI_IPD). Using the well-known Producer Price Index (PPI) model, PPI_IPD is based on the data from Chinese customs import declarations, which has high reliability and reasonableness. For this reason, the index can help governments, enterprises, analysts, and others to conduct analysis for imported pork prices in China and avoid international trade risks. The findings show that proposed PPI_IPD is highly correlated with the Chinese domestic pork market and the pork price industry stock market.

Among the possible systems, a combination of different energy generation technologies is a viable option for local users, as long as energy storage is implemented. The presented paper describes an energy-economic assessment of an island system with a photovoltaic field, small wind turbine, wood chip gasifier, battery, and hydrogen circuit with electrolyzer and fuel cell. The system is designed to satisfy the electrical energy demand of a tourist facility in two European localizations. The operation of the system is developed and dynamically simulated in the Transient System Simulation (TRNSYS) environment, taking into account realistic user demand. The results show that in Gdansk, Poland, it is possible to satisfy 99% of user demand with renewable energy sources with excess energy equal to 31%, while in Agkistro, Greece, a similar result is possible with 43% of excess energy. Despite the high initial costs, it is possible to obtain Simple Pay Back periods of 12.5 and 22.5 years for Gdansk and Agkistro, respectively. This result points out that under a high share of renewables in the energy demand of the user, the profitability of the system is highly affected by the local cost of energy vectors. The achieved results show that the system is robust in providing energy to the users and that future development may lead to an operation based fully on renewables.</jats:p>"

This study proposes a novel method to calculate the scarcity value of ecosystem service (SESV) as a function of the temporal and spatial changes in supply and demand to divided ecological zones with differentiated land-use strategies. Then, it explores the changes in ESV and SESV in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region from 2000 to 2015. Firstly, the native ecosystem services value (NESV) and demand of ES in the BTH region were evaluated. Secondly, the spatiotemporal influence mechanism of supply and demand on ESV was analyzed according to the equilibrium price principle of supply and demand in economics, and a model for evaluating the SESV was constructed on the basis of supply and demand. Lastly, the ecological zoning method was proposed for of the BTH region. Result shows that the NESV in the BTH region was 2775.54 billion CNY in 2000, and it decreased to 2722.44 billion CNY in 2015. Taking into account the changes in supply and demand, the SESV in 2015 was 2884.85 billion CNY. Secondly, the NESV in 2000 and 2015 and the SESV in 2015 exhibited a gradual downward trend from north to south. Lastly, according to the changes in ecosystem service supply and demand and NESV/SESV in the BTH region, the ecological zones of the BTH region were divided, and differentiated land-use policies were put forward. The research can not only enrich ESV evaluation theories and methods, but also provide a scientific basis for the coordinated development of the BTH region and promote regional ecological civilization construction strategies.</jats:p>"

This study analyzed the mechanism of the effect of swine epidemics on nonlinear shocks to pig supply, and monthly data on pig supply from January 2012 to June 2020 were applied to study the threshold effect of swine epidemics on pig stock and slaughter in China empirically, using the index of swine epidemics’ width (ISEW) as the threshold variable. The results of this study were as follows: (1) The influence of the ISEW over 7 months on pig stock in China was divided into two ranges, and the pig stock did not change significantly when the ISEW was less than 0.25. Swine epidemics had a significantly negative impact on the pig stock when the ISEW was larger than 0.25. (2) The influence of the ISEW over 8 months on pig slaughter was also divided into two ranges. When the ISEW was less than 0.33, epidemics had a positive and significant effect on pig slaughter, while epidemics had a marked negative impact on pig slaughter when the ISEW was greater than 0.33. Based on these conclusions, this study proposed relevant measures for the prevention and control of swine epidemics.</jats:p>"

It is a huge challenge for the Chinese government to establish the aged service system to meet such a large demand in a short time. In its 14th Five-Year Development plan, to promote a more rational allocation of health services, the Chinese government plans to build a health service system for the elderly. Based on the aged service resource allocation model established in the previous research, this paper proposes optimization measures and improves the model. The second-order matrix sensitivity analysis is performed on 30 parameters in the improved model, and the influence law of parameters on the whole system under a different amplitude of variation is explored. The results show that the disability rate of the elderly population, the service capacity of aged service institutions, per capita disposable income, and other factors have a great impact on the balance between the supply and demand of aged service resources. Therefore, when formulating policies related to the allocation of aged service resources, we can focus on improving the health level of the elderly, increasing the investment of social funds in aged service, and improving people’s consumption levels, so as to further improve the aged service system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We created a subsurface drip irrigation (SDI)-specific variable flow emitter (VFE) that switches working stages automatically based on the inlet pressure (H) to achieve a step change in the flow rate. At working stage I (H = 0.1 MPa), namely the conventional water supply stage, the VFE provided a normal flow rate (qI) of 1–2 L/h for crop irrigation. At working stage II (H &gt; 0.1 MPa; exceeding the design pressure), VFE delivered a larger flow rate (qII). The larger qII facilitated water movement upward from the underground to the surface seedbed during the crop planting, thus ameliorating crop germination issues under SDI. We focused on the impacts of four structural parameters of the flow channel: tooth height (E), tooth spacing (B), tooth angle (A), and flow channel depth (D) on the qI and VFE-flow index (x) at working stage I. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were conducted along with a physical laboratory test to develop VFE using computerized numerical control (CNC) technology (accuracy = 0.05 mm). Nine VFEs were designed using an L9(34) orthogonal test. The combination of tetrahedral meshing with a six-layer boundary layer and the realizable k–ε turbulence model was found suitable for CFD simulations. The standard root-mean-square error (nRMSE) of the measured and simulated qIs was a minimum of 7.4%. The four parameters influenced qIs as D &gt; B &gt; E &gt; A, and the four factors influenced the xs as B &gt; E &gt; D &gt; A. Based on the numerical simulation data, multiple linear regression models were constructed for the qIs and xs with four parameters when H = 0.1 MPa. Aiming for the minimum x, the optimal combination of the flow channel structural parameters corresponding to different qIs was determined by the ergodic optimization algorithm. When qI was 1.5 L/h, the optimal structural combinations were E = 1.2 mm, B = 1.8 mm, A = 42°, and D = 1 mm. The VFE with a qI of 1.5 L/h was created by CNC technology. The relative errors of the measured and predicted qIs using the regression model were −0.19–6.31%, and their nRMSE was 6.76%. Thus, optimizing the flow channel structural parameters based on a multiple linear regression model and the ergodic optimization algorithm is a highly precise theoretical base for VFE development.</jats:p>"

It is essential to promote the development of the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) of power batteries effectively through government subsidies under the extended producer responsibility (EPR) regime. Combining the EPR system with the battery manufacturer as the leader and the vehicle manufacturer and the retailer as the subordinates, this paper constructs and solves four models of different CLSC subsidy objects and analyzes the pricing of power batteries by different subsidy objects by using the Stackelberg game, as well as the profit change and profit distribution ratio of each CLSC participant. The results of the study showed: (1) when the unit subsidy is limited, the government should subsidize all the CLSC subjects as much as possible. (2) When the government subsidizes the remanufacturing of power batteries, the recycling rate of power batteries is higher, and the benefits of the CLSC are better than those of subsidizing other actors. (3) The change in government subsidy objects will not affect the profit distribution ratio of CLSC, mainly because the subsidy not only improves the recovery rate, but also improves the profitability of each entity.</jats:p>"

For the laboratory scale, the PBRs operated at 900 µmol quanta m−2 s−1 and 35.5 ± 0.5 °C; the optimal CO2 flow rate was estimated at 3 mL CO2 per 1 L of suspension per minute, which corresponds to 1.5% CO2 in the GAM and an aeration rate of 0.2 vvm. These parameters, being scaled up within the pilot PBRs, resulted in a high specific growth rate (µ ≈ 0.1 h−1) and high specific productivity (Psp ≈ 1 g dw L−1 d−1).

As one of the three major staple foods globally, the quality and safety of rice affect human health as well as social development. To ensure the quality and safety of rice and reduce the flow of problematic rice, a multi-layer blockchain-based rice supply chain refinement supervision model MBRRSM (Multi-blockchain Rice Refined Supervision Model) is proposed from the information level. First, the characteristics of information flow in the rice supply chain are analyzed, and a classification table of key information is constructed. Second, the MBRRSM framework is designed. Based on a multi-party hybrid encryption algorithm, secure multi-party computing algorithm, multi-mode storage mechanism, and SPOP (Supervision Proof of Peers) consensus algorithm, a set of mechanisms is designed for the transmission, use, storage, and consensus of rice data in MBRRSM. Subsequently, the security and performance capabilities of MBRRSM are analyzed. Meanwhile, the SPOP consensus algorithm is analyzed. Finally, a prototype system is built based on MBRRSM and verified through exemplary scenarios in different usage situations. The results show that research on the refined supervision of the rice supply chain based on multi-blockchain can finely supervise all types of data in the rice supply chain, and provide a guarantee for enterprise users to safely transmit and use data with different privacy levels.

Factors affecting the generation of bacterial DBPs include the characteristics of bacterial materials, disinfection process, piping materials, and water quality. Among the major components of biofilms, proteins or amino acids have the greatest risk of DBPs. Among the commonly used disinfection methods, chlorine is more suitable for continuous disinfection of pipe networks than chloramine, but chlorine dioxide may be a better substitute in the future. Pipes with good biological stability, such as polyethylene (PE) pipe, should be encouraged to be used in water supply networks. Periodic removal of biofilms, reduction of organic matter and bromide ion concentrations, and maintenance of high flow rates are effective means to reduce bacterial DBPs. The control, removal and monitoring devices of tube wall biofilm need to be further developed and promoted. In the future, it is urgent to develop new disinfectants that are not easy to react with biomolecules and natural organic matter, and produce fewer or no by-products.</jats:p>",

However, there is still limited study on supply chain optimisation that focusses on specific ELV treatments. Therefore, this mini-review article analyses the supply chain optimisation for recycling and remanufacturing sustainable management in ELV. A total of 51 papers were reviewed from the year 2016 to 2021. The key topics in each article were assessed and classified into various themes, followed by the content analysis. The percentage breakdown for the six main themes are ELV recovery management system (37.25%), reverse logistic network design (29.41%), ELV economy analysis (15.69%), government regulation or subsidies (7.84%), ELV quantity forecast (5.88%) and ELV part design (3.92%). It can be concluded that ELV recovery management and reverse logistic network design are the top two key focusses of supply chain optimisation priorities that have been extensively applied to improve ELV development. The literature gap has shown that the study on remanufacturing in the ELV supply chain is minimal compared to recycling. The classification of ELV recycling and remanufacturing supply chain optimisation in this study will be beneficial in supporting real-life problem-solving for industrial applications. This study serves as a valuable reference guide to identifying more sustainable solutions in ELV management and promoting the critical focus area for academicians and industry players. </jats:p>",

Specifically, the lunar soil is loaded with Cu species and employed for electrocatalytic CO2 conversion, demonstrating significant production of methane. In addition, the selected component in lunar soil (i.e. MgSiO3) loaded with Cu can reach a CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 72.05% with a CH4 production rate of 0.8 mL/min at 600 mA/cm2. Simultaneously, an O2 production rate of 2.3 mL/min can be achieved. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our developed process starting from catalyst preparation to electrocatalytic CO2 conversion is so accessible that it can be operated in an unmmaned manner via a robotic system. Such a highly efficient extraterrestrial fuel and oxygen production system is expected to push forward the development of mankind's civilization toward an extraterrestrial settlement.</jats:p>",

Therefore, POM‐CaO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>@ZIF‐8 nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized and used as a mediator to develop an electrically enhanced CDT strategy. It is hoped that the simultaneous modulation of endogenous (the H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> generated by CaO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> NPs and GSH depletion by POM) and exogenous (Electric, E) stimulation enhanced Fenton‐like responses will lead to better therapeutic results. Such a treatment strategy has shown excellent tumor cell killing effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to propose more sustainable management of nitrogen use in wheat, considering the supply of full and fractioned doses with an estimate of technical, economic efficiency, and expected productivity. Two experiments were conducted, one to quantify biomass productivity and the other to evaluate grain yield. The experimental design consisted of a randomized block with four repetitions in a 5 × 3 factorial, for N-fertilizer doses (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 kg ha-1) and nutrient supply form [full condition (100%) in the phenological stage V3 (the third leaf expanded); fractionated (70/30%) in the phenological stage V3/V6 (third and sixth leaf expanded) and; fractionated (70/30%) in the phenological stage V3/R1 (beginning of anthesis)], respectively. The most sustainable management of nitrogen in wheat was obtained with the expected yield rate of 3 t ha-1 by manual fertilization, with nitrogen supplied in full dose at the V3 phenological stage.</jats:p>"

These excesses are interpreted as thermal emission from populations of small, hot dust very close to their stars (‘hot exozodis’), but such grains should rapidly sublimate or be blown out of the system. To date, no model has fully explained this phenomenon. One mechanism commonly suggested in the literature is cometary supply, where star-grazing comets deposit dust close to the star, replenishing losses from grain sublimation and blowout. However, we show that this mechanism alone is very unlikely to be responsible for hot exozodis. We model the trajectory and size evolution of dust grains released by star-grazing comets, to establish the dust and comet properties required to reproduce hot-exozodi observations. We find that cometary supply alone can only reproduce observations if dust ejecta has an extremely steep size distribution upon release, and the dust-deposition rate is extraordinarily high. These requirements strongly contradict our current understanding of cometary dust and planetary systems. Cometary supply is therefore unlikely to be solely responsible for hot exozodis, so may need to be combined with some dust-trapping mechanism (such as gas or magnetic trapping) if it is to reproduce observations.</jats:p>",

Substantial phenotypic variations were detected for all traits. N deficiency increased the root length and decreased the root diameter and shoot related traits. A total of 297 significant marker-trait associations were identified by a genome-wide association study involving different N levels and the N response value. A total of 51 candidate genes with amino acid variations in coding regions or differentially expressed under low nitrogen conditions were identified. Furthermore, a candidate gene ZmNAC36 was resequenced in all tested lines. A total of 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 12 insertions and deletions were significantly associated with lateral root length of primary root, primary root length between 0 and 0.5 mm in diameter, primary root surface area, and total length of primary root under a low-N condition. These findings help us to improve our understanding of the genetic mechanism of root plasticity to N deficiency, and the identified loci and candidate genes will be useful for the genetic improvement of maize tolerance cultivars to N deficiency.</jats:p>"

After data collection, recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to thematic analysis. The results highlighted that the standard operating procedures (SOPs), checklists, and government guidelines were available at different levels, except for community pharmacies. Timely delivery of quality products and services along with market reputation, experience, and authorization were the key criteria used for supplier selection and evaluation. Good inventory management, financial models, effective coordination, training, and skill development programs were identified as key factors responsible for an efficient supply chain process. Availability of vaccines, their appropriate temperature monitoring, and transportation are also highly compromised in Pakistan.

The results showed that the mesostable phase diagram of the ternary system was of simple type, and w(NaCl) and w(CaCl2) showed regular variation with temperature when w(NaCl) in the system was 15–28%. Moreover, the components of the four saline wastewaters (10% NaCl + 9, 10, 11, 12% CaCl2) with less salt content had a faster heating and a faster rate of evaporation of the liquid film in the evaporation tube. Based on the solubility in the experiments and simulations, it was concluded that NaCl crystals were precipitated at tube lengths of 718 mm, 942 mm, 966 mm, and 1,000 mm for four salt concentrations in the evaporation process by comparison, and the reliability of the predicted loci was also demonstrated by a falling film evaporation experimental setup.</jats:p>",

The most important systems for an athlete to limit his physical performance are the cardiovascular and muscular. That is why we emphasize on energy production in myocardial cells and myocytes. Energy production and energy exchange in cells is carried out by mitochondria, which are the main organelles of energy supply. Functional activity of these organelles is provided by the inner membrane, which contains components of the electron transport chain and ATPase. Physical activity requires ATP resynthesis, which is provided by different types of energyreleased reactions. An important part of our review reveals the analysis of data on the mitochondria themselves, which are key determinants of the functional state of the body’s cells during physical activity. Functional consequences of the changes in mitochondrial structure are of quite importance, especially associated with different configurations of mitochondria and mitochondrium − increasing the number of organelles and crystal density, normalization of the structural and functional state of the inner membrane and its protection from oxidative stress which is inherent in the intense physical activity. Oxidative stress and working hypoxia are a very common cause of further metabolic disorders, even before the formation of hypertrophy of chronic physical exertion, when you have to remove an athlete from the training process. In general, numerous metabolic processes in the myocardium, which are inherent in intense physical activity, undergo negative changes with further activation of athletes. One of the ways to correct energy deficiency caused by prolonged and intense physical activity should be the use of exogenous or endogenous substances involved in energy metabolism.</jats:p>",

In the study, we developed a numerical model describing contaminant migration through an inactive supply well that is pumped seasonally influenced by the regional groundwater flow field. The model was developed using the finite-element COMSOL Multiphysics software to estimate the potential threats to water quality. Major findings showed that a larger regional groundwater velocity results in lower concentration of contaminant. In addition, during pumping, a smaller recovery ratio inside the wellbore facilitates the deterioration of water quality in the deep aquifer. Furthermore increasing pumping frequency can effectively prevent contamination and improve the water quality in the deep aquifer. Similarly, higher pumping rate leads to a larger capture zone, which can significantly improve the water quality in the deep aquifer. The general conclusion is that the regional groundwater flow has a negative impact on the quality of groundwater extracted by seasonally pumping well.</jats:p>",

In a competitive environment, more and more AFSCs use blockchain-based traceability services (hereafter, BBTS) to improve the traceability level of agricultural products. The investment rules concerning BBTS and the coordination rules in an AFSC are vital issues for many firms who want to adopt BBTS. To explore these laws, we constructed two competitive AFSCs, each of which included a supplier and a retailer. Considering the new changes in consumers’ perception of product quality and safety after using the BBTS, the demand function was modified. Then we built the income functions of chain members under three situations of investment. The research found that: (1) the improvement of customers’ perceived quality by using the BBTS can increase their benefits; (2) when decision-makers want to invest in the BBTS, they should pay attention to consumers’ perceived quality safety factor for their competitive products; (3) when the investment cost is greater than its threshold value, two competitive AFSCs should invest in the BBTS together.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper deals with the efficacy of revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contracts in a dual-exclusive channel, in which each manufacturer announces a cooperative advertising policy, such as cost-sharing contract, revenue-sharing contract, or neither of them, to its retailer. Under such cooperative advertising schemes, two models are developed—one in which each manufacturer determines the sharing rate endogenously or exogenously under the Stackelberg game approach and the other in which each manufacturer and its exclusive retailer cooperatively determine the sharing rate under the Nash bargaining approach. Some counterintuitive findings suggest that the advertising coordination mechanism critically depends on parameters, such as the basic demand share and product substitution. Most notably, the higher sharing rate can lead the retailer’s performance to be worse, especially when the competition becomes fierce. Furthermore, the cost-sharing contract is more beneficial to the cooperative advertising mechanism than the revenue-sharing contract.</jats:p>",

The performance level of CSR is directly related to the profitability of the entire supply chain and its member enterprises. In the study, based on the utilization of the Shapley value method, by incorporating CSR elements, a preliminary model of profit allocation for four cooperative scenarios in the supply chain is constructed and modified to take into account the level of CSR implementation. Based on the modified model, the relationship between the performance level of CSR and the total profit of the supply chain and the member enterprises’ profit is analyzed. The study shows that the total profit of the supply chain is linearly and positively correlated with the performance level of CSR. In contrast, the profit of supply chain members has a nonlinear positive correlation with CSR performance. The impact of the whole level of CSR fulfillment on the profitability of the entire supply chain varies at different stages. Finally, the findings are discussed from the perspectives of the government, industry organizations, supply chain managers, and supply chain member enterprises, providing valuable references for the research and practice of comprehensively promoting CSR fulfillment in supply chains and realizing common prosperity.</jats:p>"

Cluster analysis is performed for multivariate data interpretation of the distribution of aluminium (Al) concentrations during 2019 at 19 water sampling points (2 DWTPs outlets and 17 points within the city water supply system). Although the concentration of aluminium in the outlet of the treatment plants differ significantly, both of them fall into the same cluster, as the concentrations during the year change in the same manner. The formed cluster of both the treatment plants and most of the studied sampling points indicate the mixed origin of the purified water and proves that the concentration of Al in tap water is dominated by the qualities and quantities from the different sources of the supplied water, rather than by the secondary processes in the network for areas with predominant steel and polyethylene pipes. A distinct exception are the areas with old asbestos cement pipelines where potential release of the metal from the cement affects the Al distribution in the water supply system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study analyzes the financing strategy of a two-echelon supply chain, consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, both subject to capital constraints. Specifically, the bank provides loans to the manufacturer, who then grants trade credit to the retailer. Based on the three-party game analysis framework of the bank, manufacturer, and retailer, this paper constructs a supply chain financing model under the information symmetry and information asymmetry structures, respectively; measures the maximum financing ability of the manufacturer; and discusses the influence of trade credit, moral hazard, and information structure on the manufacturer’s and bank’s strategies. The results show that under the trade credit situation, it is critical for the bank to provide loan to manufacturer who does not have moral hazard. The maximum financing capacity of the manufacturer is affected by the rate of return on moral hazard and the intensity of trade credit default. The increase of trade credit default intensity and risk exposure will lead to the increase of the interest rate of bank loan, and in the case of information asymmetry, the bank will often ask for a higher interest rate to deal with the information disadvantage. The strategy for the bank to make the credit line is more complex, and the degree of information asymmetry plays a positive moderating effect on the influence of trade credit on the credit line. Our findings provide implications for participants who implement financing actions to improve their financial performance and control the moral hazard and default risk along a supply chain. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main objective of this study is to demonstrate that opportunities to support the poor marginalised Roma communities (MRCs) by creating opportunities for their active participation in tourism development have been under-ultilised to date. In particular, the application of a pro-poor tourism (PPT) approach is an advantage that allows the cultural specificities of the MRCs to be exploited for their own development. A risk factor for successful implementation is the considerable differentiation within Roma communities. This study analyses the approaches of 65 municipalities of the Central Spiš region to the development of PPT as an option for poverty reduction in the MRCs in Slovakia. Based on the analysis of the local preconditions for tourism development, the specific potential for the development of Roma culture and the traditional economic activities, human resources, and the degree of segregation, we show that there is no universal solution that would be applicable in all communities. The limited possibilities to obtain relevant data determined the analysis options we used. Therefore, we used a mixed-method approach, in which we subjected the quantitative data to qualitative analysis based on interviews with the mayors of the communities being studied. Four assumptions were verified in the aforementioned way: (1) the MRCs in villages in the immediate vicinity of developed tourist centres show a higher level of activity in relation to their own development; (2) Roma who are active in small-scale farming will also be more active in maintaining other traditional craft activities, typical for Roma communities in Slovakia, forming the basis for the development of their own PPT product; (3) the activity of NGO’s focusing on the development of the local MRC’s is not a guarantee for the development of PPT activities in the villages; and finally that (4) the high level of segregation of marginalised Roma communities is a major obstacle for the implementation of PPT. This paper concludes with a typology of municipalities in relation to the preconditions for the development of PPT, which can be considered as a contribution to the discussion on the possibilities of a differentiated approach to PPT development strategies at the level of municipalities with the numerous MRC’s.</jats:p>"

The hydrogeology of these aquifers is complex and better understanding of the controls to aquifer transmissivity, alongside accurate borehole siting and appropriate design, is pivotal to the long-term performance and sustainability of water services in many countries. This study examines a substantial new dataset (<jats:italic>n =</jats:italic> 655) of aquifer transmissivity values across Uganda derived from previously unanalyzed pumping-test data. These data provide important new insights: weathered crystalline-rock aquifers are distinguished by pervasively low transmissivities (median &lt;2 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/d) in comparison to other areas in the tropics; highest transmissivities are observed in boreholes &lt;50 m deep, implying that drilling deeper boreholes does not typically improve supply success or sustainability in Uganda; and increased groundwater abstraction through the use of higher-yielding pump technologies will prove challenging in most areas of Uganda and limit their use for piped water supplies. This study highlights the scientific value of data held in drillers’ records, which remain unanalyzed in many countries but may provide useful insight and understanding of aquifer characteristics.</jats:p>",
