Customer-specific requirements (CSRs) add to the convolutions of a supplier’s quality management systems when producing components for the various motor manufacturers. The catalytic converter industry (CCI) forms part of the component supply chain in the motor industry. The CCI consists of a plethora of suppliers to produce the catalytic converter. This paper focuses on three of the five main suppliers, namely the ‘monolith substrate manufacturers’, the ‘coaters’, and the ‘canners’. Most OEMs required that critical and strategic suppliers should be ISO/TS 16949:2009 certified. ISO/TS 16949:2009 refers to an internationally recognised specification, specifically adapted for the motor industry. The specification indicates the minimum requirements and also makes provision for additional requirements known as CSRs that can be specified by the OEM.</jats:p>"

Since organisations have to determine which processes and relationships will best achieve this aim, the design of their supply chains is important. Supply chain design thus forms an integral part of SCM and embodies the supply chain's structure. Unfortunately, too many organisations allow the design of their supply chain to evolve into its current form instead of planning their supply chain design (SCD) efforts. The literature is vague on what SCD efforts constitute. This article consists of a comprehensive literature study in which an effort was made to bring more clarity on exactly what purposeful SCD efforts consist of, and some key questions were formulated that organisations could use as a guide in their SCD practices. From these critical questions a conceptual framework has been developed that can be used to determine whether organisations' SCD practices are aligned with organisational objectives. The conceptual framework was tested at two South African organisations to determine if it indeed can be be used to analyse the SCD practices of organisations.</jats:p>"

Outsourcing is an innovation as a logistics-related process that is perceived as new by the adopter. We will explore and analyse an outsourcing idea, its development and implementation, from an innovation perspective. The development is studied in a qualitative, long-term process study. The analysis draws on Hoholm’s (2009) model of innovation processes. It extends the applicability of this innovation model and its methodology of following the action into logistics and supply chain management (SCM) research. The outsourcing process is an innovation that develops in a rational way based on the incremental process because of its actor-network and simultaneous reflection. Interactions and confrontations come about because of involved contrary forces such as competing objectives. The model explains the practice of SCM innovation and increases the understanding of dynamics and complexity. The process study brings insights to cause-effect relations in the development of outsourcing that are consequential to innovative logistics and SCM.</jats:p>"

Sustainability of air transport, subject to these liberalisation effects, depends on efficient management information such as total-factor productivity, which necessitates comprehensive financial and operational information. Total-factor productivity in general, however, is not utilised by airlines as a key performance indicator since the measuring thereof is complex and regarded as tedious. Changes in air transport total-factor productivity can be measured in two ways. First, an index approach can be adopted that shows the proportional change in the inputs in relation to a proportional change in output. Secondly, a production function can be determined (econometric approach) that shows a change of productivity as a shift in the production curve. The research on which the article is based, exploited the theory, selection and application of an appropriate approach to determine changes of total-factor productivity of an individual airline to assist/support efficient decisionmaking by management.</jats:p>"

How oil and natural gas became strategic raw materials of world politics beyond being primary energy resources of the global economy was examined. It was found that discovery of rich oil and natural gas resources in the Central Asia and the Caucasus after the Cold War turned the region into a focus of interest of the global and regional actors. In this connection, perspectives of the global and regional actors about the Nabucco Project were examined.\r\nAs a result of analyses and evaluations, it was concluded that the Nabucco Project is a project that can significantly enhance Turkey’s geopolitical importance and make Turkey one of the key countries of the east-west energy corridor. </jats:p>",

Russia is one of the most important traditional suppliers for the EU and is trying to maintain its position in the future. Russia sometimes use energy as political tools as it seen in example of Ukraine Crises. So, diversification of energy resources of EU will provide more competitive energy supply and it strength energy security of EU. Therefore, EU needs to regional cooperation for energy diversification. Caspian region is energy rich region.  Therefore Turkey’s strategic location makes it a natural \"Energy Bridge\" between the major oil producing areas in the Middle East and Caspian Sea. This paper tries to examine costs and benefits analyzing between Turkey and EU aspects of energy cooperation. These costs and benefits analyzing also include projects that are under the construction or still project process. Turkey has some benefits from this process. Because pipelines that provide energy to Europe passes though Turkish boundary and Turkey collect transportation fee from these pipelines and also EU has support these project financially. This is also contains cost for EU.</jats:p>",

Outsourcing is an innovation as a logistics-related process that is perceived as new by the adopter. We will explore and analyse an outsourcing idea, its development and implementation, from an innovation perspective. The development is studied in a qualitative, long-term process study. The analysis draws on Hoholm’s (2009) model of innovation processes. It extends the applicability of this innovation model and its methodology of following the action into logistics and supply chain management (SCM) research. The outsourcing process is an innovation that develops in a rational way based on the incremental process because of its actor-network and simultaneous reflection. Interactions and confrontations come about because of involved contrary forces such as competing objectives. The model explains the practice of SCM innovation and increases the understanding of dynamics and complexity. The process study brings insights to cause-effect relations in the development of outsourcing that are consequential to innovative logistics and SCM.</jats:p>"

Based on a survey of a diverse group of supplier chief executive officers (n=70) and buyers in a focal organization (n=79), this study finds that African-American executives are less likely to perceive constructive dimensions of organizational culture, while Hispanic executives are more likely to perceive negative dimensions, while buyers perceive the culture as constructive for a culture of diversity.</jats:p>"

Document analysis was done and this was complemented by mini-case studies and semi-structured interviews and site visits. Mini-case studies of the operations of the World Food Programme, the International Red Cross Society and the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society, the World Health Organisation, the United Nations Children's Fund and the Zimbabwean Civil Protection Organisation in Zimbabwe are discussed. These clarify the difficulties and problems faced such as the lack of trained logistics personnel, lack of access to specialised humanitarian logistics courses and research information, the difficulty in using and adapting existing logistics systems in attending to humanitarian logistics and the lack of collaborative efforts that address the area specifically. This study seeks to use primary and secondary information to inform decision-making in humanitarian logistics with possible lessons for neighbouring countries, other regions in Africa and beyond. Activities on collaborative networks that are beneficial to humanitarian logistics are also suggested.</jats:p>"

Transport infrastructure such as highways, bridges, ports, airports and railways is critical in achieving economic growth. If the supply of these facilities does not keep up with rising demand, the cost of moving goods will increase, and there will be a downward pressure on profits and growth. Airports play a critical role in generating employment within an economy, creating wealth, contributing to the tax base, stimulating tourism and contributing to world trade. While the latter two are less easily measured, it is possible to determine a base impact that an airport has on an economy by measuring the direct and indirect gross domestic product, employment and taxation impacts. This study quantifies these for the three main international airports in South Africa.</jats:p>"

The study utilize an ordinary mechanism of WLS, namely the Wald model.The estimation resulted through the combination of ECM and WLS shows that the price of export goods/merchandises has a positive effect and is significant in the short-term. Yet, over the long-term period, the increase in export commodity price causes the decrease in export volumes. Meanwhile, the relationship between export volume and inflation is not significant, either in the short-term or long-term.  Foreign exchange interestingly has a positive and significant relationship with the export volume over a short-term period, but in the long-term it has a reverse effect, that is, it decreases export volume. Foreign investment has a positive and significant relationship with export volume in the long-term, the significance, however, weakens over the short-term period.The structural economic movement has a positive and significant relationship over a short-term period with export volume, but over long-term period the relationship is not statistically strong. Thus, the structural economic movement towards more on the growth of industry sector could stimulate the growth in export aggregately. This evidence provides further support on the Ignacy theory (1980) if it is applied on Indonesian international economy, especially for the period of 1983-1997.JEL Classification: C32, F14, O24Keyword: Weighted Least Square, Error Correction Model, Structural Economic Movement, Export Change</jats:p>"

Sustainability of air transport, subject to these liberalisation effects, depends on efficient management information such as total-factor productivity, which necessitates comprehensive financial and operational information. Total-factor productivity in general, however, is not utilised by airlines as a key performance indicator since the measuring thereof is complex and regarded as tedious. Changes in air transport total-factor productivity can be measured in two ways. First, an index approach can be adopted that shows the proportional change in the inputs in relation to a proportional change in output. Secondly, a production function can be determined (econometric approach) that shows a change of productivity as a shift in the production curve. The research on which the article is based, exploited the theory, selection and application of an appropriate approach to determine changes of total-factor productivity of an individual airline to assist/support efficient decisionmaking by management.</jats:p>"

In the formal division of powers, much of the authority to implement policies in this sector rests with state governments and the role of the national government is largely restricted to recommending broad policy directions. Since the late 1990s, with the diffusion of the reform agenda into this sector, the national government has taken a number of measures that try to intervene more confidently in setting policy agendas in the states. However, this intervention has not proceeded along expected lines and more assertive policy articulations have been made by different states. A host of factors, such as the proliferation of regional parties and the diverse political logics behind reform implementation in each state are behind this. Using the states of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in India as examples, this paper will develop a model of how water supply policy reforms are being transmitted.</jats:p>",

The rates of iron reduction and rates of iron supplied to the plants were well within the range of interstitial iron concentrations and rates of iron reduction found in the natural mangrove soils from which the seedlings were obtained. The responses of these species show that mangroves growing from seedling to sapling stage have a strong nutritional requirement for iron, and that there is a close relationship between plant roots and the activities of iron‐reducing bacteria. These results suggest that mangrove growth may be limited in some natural forests by the rate at which iron is solubilized by iron‐reducing bacteria. Such biogeochemical conditions have significant implications for successful recruitment, establishment, and early growth of mangroves.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a supply chain model is proposed with one risk-neutral supplier and one risk-averse manufacturer. The manufacturer has an opportunity to enhance demand by developing a new product, but both the actual demand for new product and the supplier’s wholesale price are uncertain. The supplier has an incentive to share risks of new product development via an advance commitment to wholesale price for its own profit maximization. The effects of the manufacturer’s risk sensitivity on the players’ optimal strategies are analyzed and the trade-off between innovation incentives and pricing flexibility is investigated from the perspective of the supplier. The results highlight the significant role of risk sensitivity in collaborative new product development, and it is found that the manufacturer’s innovation level and retail price are always decreasing in the risk sensitivity, and the supplier prefers commitment to wholesale price only when the risk sensitivity is below a certain threshold.</jats:p>"

Motor vehicle sales, correlated with economic trends and the economic empowerment of citizens, have and still are increasing at a faster rate than the supply of necessary infrastructure. As such, congestion, especially in the Gauteng area, has reached unacceptable levels during peak hours, necessitating the upgrading and continual maintenance of these roads and other national roads. The financial burden of upgrading and maintaining road infrastructure is enormous and, although the South African government makes contributions, an income from the road infrastructure is necessary to sustain quality infrastructure. However, a road-user paying approach, especially the structure thereof, should be acceptable to society in terms of economic efficiency and various means of equity. This article reviews the relevance of a road-user paying approach as applied in South Africa.</jats:p>"

This paper cautions against a myopic approach to such closures. Traditionally these decisions are driven by short-term profit motives realised through resulting core line densification. The research presented in this paper demonstrates the importance of 1) taking cognisance of potential branch lines flows; 2) considering freight transport externalities and road usage costs; and 3) understanding long-term demand, in informing closure decisions. The research results reveal considerable volume opportunities for branch lines which, if captured, will significantly reduce both the direct transport costs for this traffic as well as externality charges for the economy. This will therefore not only render rural economies more competitive but also enable the provision of more sustainable freight transport to these communities. The research approach will be of value to researchers in both developed and developing economies to inform the continuous debate regarding rail rationalisation and rail revival.</jats:p>"

There is an opportunity to consider a different model with less focus on aid and more on investment. In the transport sector specifically, investment decisions should be informed by a longterm optimal balance between different transport modes. The research presented in this paper highlights the significant cost reduction opportunities possible through the densification of rail freight, especially over longer distances, with concomitant implications for increased profitability for rail operators. The densification opportunity should also place a core focus on transport corridors being developed throughout the region. SSA countries themselves can play a critical role in unlocking this potential through, inter alia, simplifying regional economic communities and taking the lead in structuring agreements with the international community.</jats:p>"

Consolidation is taking place in the food industry, both in high‐income countries and in emerging economies, but the impact of concentration in global food chains on efficiency and rent distribution is more nuanced and complex than often claimed. We review the literature and extend it by developing a model which explicitly takes into account market imperfections and contract enforcement problems in supply chains. Increased competition benefits farms by improving contract conditions, but contract enforcement becomes more complicated.</jats:p>",

The research presented here points to the structural imbalance between road and rail freight transport as one of the key contributors to this state of affairs. Most long-distance corridor transport has been captured by road. However, long-distance transport is a market segment that is very suitable for intermodal transportation : rail is utilised for the high-density, long-distance component and road for the feeder and distribution services at the corridor end points. A market segmentation approach is developed to identify the corridors and industries that are natural candidates for such solutions, thereby paving the way for role-players and stakeholders to initiate a dialogue on the development of appropriate solutions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The power sector reforms that commenced in the 1990s led to the establishment of independent electricity regulators in more than twenty countries across Africa. The main purpose for these institutions was to create greater transparency in tariff setting and provide increased certainty for investors. At the same time regulators are charged with the protection of the interests of current and future consumers of electricity. During the initial stages of reform it was the expectation that the state owned incumbents that were traditionally vertically integrated would be unbundled and privatised. In practice there have been very few privatisations and what have emerged are hybrid markets where state-owned utilities remain dominant with independent power producers on the margin. In these markets regulation is a complex melting pot of incentivising the performance of state-owned utilities, attraction of private sector investment especially to fill gaps in generation capacity and making sensitive pricing decisions. Recognising that regulation is beginning to establish a track record, the African Electricity Regulator Peer Review and Learning Network, an initiative of the University of Cape Town, Graduate School of Business provides an opportunity for high level learning through the assessment of regulatory performance. We detail an assessment of regulation in Namibia where we find prices transitioning to cost reflectivity but question the sustainability of current arrangements in the distribution of electricity and the country’s long-term generation adequacy.</jats:p>"

Scholars and proactive companies have begun to create more sustainable supply chains. What has not been fully addressed is how organizations deal with short‐term pressures to remain economically viable while implementing these newly modeled supply chains. In this study, we use theory‐building through case studies to answer the question: how do organizations balance short‐term profitability and long‐term environmental sustainability when making supply chain decisions under conditions of uncertainty? We present five sets of propositions that explain how exemplars in green supply chain management make decisions and balance short and long term objectives. We also identify four environmental postures that help explain the decisions organizations make when dealing with strategic trade‐offs among the economic, environmental and social elements of the triple‐bottom‐line.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This paper intends to fill in this gap by looking a specific strategising process, innovation, at an international third party logistics (TPL) firm. Using strategy as a practice perspective, the paper describes and analyses how innovation emerges and evolves over time. Drawing on an in-depth longitudinal case study of an international TPL firm, this study shows that intra-organisational interactions as well as inter-organisational interactions are essential in the innovation process at logistics firms. The innovation process at logistics firms is complicated and includes both top-down and bottom-up processes. It is vertically decoupled and multidirectional. Innovation at logistics firms emerges as a combination of an ad hoc response to a customer request and a purpose-driven interactive process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the important streams of research in supply chain management is the coordination between suppliers and retailers by varying the lot-size and the purchase price and common replenishment epoch (CRE). But most of the CRE solutions either assume existence of a central planner who has all the information about the system, or assume that each participant of the computation shares all of his information with other participants. These solutions are problematic when the data is sensitive and the participants are reluctant to share their private information. The development and deployment of privacy preserving coordinating model in lot to lot supply chain based on common replenishment epoch could allow supply chain collaborations to take place without revealing any participant's data to the others, reaping the benefits of collaboration while avoiding the drawbacks. In this paper, we develop and apply secure minimum sum of multi-dimensional protocol to the problem of coordinating a single-vendor multi-retailer inventory system with a probabilistic demand which follows normal distribution, where the objective is to find a CRE policy for each facility in the system such that the total average ordering and inventory-related cost of the entire system is minimized.</jats:p>"

Um Unternehmen in die Lage zu versetzen, ihre Produktionssysteme auf diese Anforderungen einzustellen, entwickelt der Exzellenzcluster „Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries“ an der RWTH Aachen im Rahmen eines Unterprojekts eine Konfigurationslogik, die eine ganzheitliche und gleichzeitig detaillierte Beschreibung des Produktionssystems erlaubt. Dieser Artikel stellt das entwickelte Modell zur Gestaltung der Supply Chain dar. Als Betrachtungsgegenstand wird die distributionsseitige Lieferkette der Ersatzteillogistik gewählt, da deren Gestaltung und Betrieb eine der größten Herausforderungen der logistischen Planung ist. Die Ersatzteillogistik wird dazu in drei wesentliche Gestaltungsfelder aufgeteilt: Netzwerkdesign, Kooperationskonzepte und Bestandsmanagement. Im Fokus der Betrachtungen stehen die Interdependenzen zwischen den Gestaltungsfeldern und ihren Elementen, da sie häufig die Entscheidungsfindung erschweren.</jats:p>",

Has this course of action been at the expense of developing similar internal information‐based linkages? This research explores the specific roles of internal and external information‐based linkages in achieving improved operational performance. Based on a single case study that comprises a supply chain containing twenty‐four internal and fourteen external linkages this research develops a series of propositions. We find that the individual internal linkages may be useful for extending externally derived visibility, and for addressing to some extent, “structural holes” in the supply chain. Additionally, to extend visibility across the entire supply chain, organizations need to recognize the combining role of internal and external information‐based linkages. Finally we offer some thoughts for future research in this area.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The vast majority of energy consumed by these utilities is used to pump water and is a significant source of greenhouse emissions. Moreover, a large percentage of that energy is then lost in the distribution system through pipe friction, across control valves, and at customer taps. Energy loss is wasteful in systems requiring pumping. In gravity systems, it is a potential free energy source squandered. This article describes a simple approach for calculating the carbon footprint of the energy use in distribution systems and introduces a method for assessing distribution system efficiency. The new measure will enable the water industry to conceive and formulate optimized decisions for potential energy savings to reduce its carbon footprint, thus contributing to healthier air quality, minimizing environmental impacts, and improving water efficiency and infrastructure sustainability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The condition of Zimbabwe's roads has been declining due to insufficient maintenance and rehabilitation. Year on year, budget allocations have compared unfavourably with funding considered adequate to maintain highway networks and conduct modest construction work. Road infrastructure shortcomings have manifested themselves in the form of high vehicle operating costs and rampant potholes, leading to a decline in road safety and a deterioration of service levels for those who use roads to deliver goods or connect to international markets. In order to try and stop this vicious cycle of decline, the Government of Zimbabwe, on 8 August 2009, introduced a new policy of road-user charges, which involved the setting-up of 22 toll gates on the trunk road network. The overall objective was to raise revenue in order to close the funding gap, blamed for declining road quality. Although alternative methods of financing road maintenance have been debated for years, a generally accepted understanding is that road users should pay costs for road provisioning. This paper assesses the implementation of a road tolling system in Zimbabwe and describes matters relating to, inter alia, implementation strategy, initial performance outcomes and sustainability.</jats:p>"

Three ponds were filled with unpolluted water, while the other three received eutrophic water. Water quality and phytoplankton populations were analyzed fortnightly over a period of 110 days to coincide with the shrimp culture cycle. In ponds with eutrophic water, the cyanobacteria (nine species) were the dominant phytoplankton group (&amp;gt;90% of the total phytoplankton density), followed by the green algae (seven species) and diatoms (six species). Ponds with originally unpolluted water were dominated by the diatoms with 18 species, followed by the cyanobacteria (six species) and one species of green algae. Shrimp production in ponds with unpolluted water was significantly higher (4,877.4 ± 438.5 kg ha-1 when compared to 1,385.0 ± 243.8 kg ha-1 in ponds using eutrophic water. This study illustrated that initial water quality supply influenced the phytoplankton dominance, which in turn determined the aquaculture production in shrimp culture ponds.</jats:p>",

Setting a price for water services is a sensitive and controversial issue. Pricing water services below cost recovery can threaten the sustainability of the service and human welfare in the long term, while water pricing at full cost recovery often restricts access to water services for poor households, compromising their well-being. This paper looks at one of the approaches that policy makers use in an attempt to balance the trade-offs – cross-subsidisation. Lessons from the experience of implementing the cross-subsidy policy in Zambia are identified and discussed. This paper argues that while the objectives behind the cross-subsidisation policy are clear, the results from the implementation of this policy are, at best, unclear. The Zambian experience shows that for an indirect subsidy, such as cross-subsidisation (as opposed to a direct subsidy), to generate positive results, a careful consideration of the actual context in which the policy is to be implemented must be a precondition to its implementation.</jats:p>",

A review of the literature in this area suggests that innovation costs influence the pattern of adoption. There is, however, a lack of consensus about what these innovation costs entail. Based on a review of innovation literature in the area of information systems, this paper develops an integrative framework of inter‐organizational process innovation costs. The framework identifies six broad categories of costs (both tangible and intangible) that map onto different stages of organizational innovation: development and initiation costs associated with the generation of an innovation; switching costs and the cost of capital associated with the acceptance stage; and implementation and relational costs associated with implementation. The framework serves not only to organize the existing literature but also to provide the impetus for future research into the role that different categories of costs play in shaping inter‐organizational process innovation in supply networks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The world is in a continuous progress, as a result of which energy consumption and with this the release of gases with adverse impact show rapid increase. As a result of the survey conducted by the International Energy Agency, if the major economic powers do not initiate a change in their energy policy, the increase of energy consumption may as well reach 40 % by 2030. This increased energy demand is getting more and more difficult to fulfill with the fossil energy resources, which is to lead to an increasing significance of renewable energy resources. In Hungary, these energy resources are the best to provide with biomass growth. Biomass growth for energetic purpose can mostly be provided by energy plants, out of which “energy willow” (Salix viminalis L.) is outstanding with its high yield and with its excellent burning technology characteristics of its timber. The willow’s cropping technology is being established in our country. One of our tasks is to work out an adequate weed control plan. The professional and safe use of herbicides can increase the success of production. In our paper, we discuss the weed flora data collected on  treatments applied in the different fertilizer and compost. We started our survey in 2010. We examined twelve different fertilizer and compost treated areas. The dominant weeds were: Amaranthus retroflexus, Chenopodium album, Echinochloa crus-galli among annuals; Cirsium arvense and Agropyron repens among the perennials. </jats:p>"

However, there is continued non-compliance with these rules, particularly among drivers of personal vehicles on Kampala roads. It is likely that the actions of these drivers are influenced by individual or social perceptions and pressures (social norms). These social norms include injunctive norms (influences from people that drivers respect), descriptive norms (influences from other drivers’ behaviour) and perceived behaviour control (drivers exploiting available opportunities). The study explores the existence of these norms among drivers of personal vehicles and analyses the way the norms affect compliance with road traffic rules when moderated by road obstructions and control systems in Kampala, Uganda.</jats:p>"

This study analyses competitiveness at the external supply chain level as a driver of risks and provides a framework for mitigating these risks. The mitigation framework, also called the supply chain continuity framework, provides insight into six stages of the business continuity planning (BCP) process life cycle (risk mitigation management, business impact analysis, supply continuity strategy development, supply continuity plan development, supply continuity plan testing and supply continuity plan maintenance), together with the operational constructs: customer service, inventory management, flexibility, time to market, ordering cycle time and quality. The purpose of the BCP process life cycle and operational constructs working together is to emphasise the way in which a supply chain can deal with disruption risks and, consequently, bring competitive advantage. Future research will consider the new risk scenarios and analyse the consequences to promote the improvement of supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the mid-1990s a plethora of voluntary labour initiatives has been introduced in global supply chains that serve northern-based consumer markets. The chief aim of these new systems of labour governance is to establish minimum standards and conditions for workers employed in the production of goods for export. This concern for labour follows a period of market liberalism, a major shift in the regulatory position of nation-states and the globalization of business. Voluntary initiatives, which largely draw on the International Labour Organization (ILO) core conventions, include codes of conduct, certifiable standards and International Framework Agreements (IFAs). The article explores the effectiveness of these initiatives in a highly concentrated industry: the banana trade. The banana trade is dominated on the production side by three North American agri-businesses: Chiquita Brands International, Dole Food Company and Fresh Del Monte Produce. Yet these businesses are increasingly being directed by international retailers, particularly in the UK, where the four major supermarket groups command access to the consumer, and comprise Tesco, ASDA (owned by Wal-Mart), J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison Supermarkets. The continuing increase of retail buyer power within global supply chains, coupled with supermarkets’ intent to respond to demands for social responsibility in the chains that serve them, raises the prospect of better conditions for workers. However, the article argues that although some improvements have been made, while supermarkets continue to drive down costs to benefit consumers, workers ultimately pay the price. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the present study, the influence of various scenarios of supply ship collisions, namely, bow, stern, and also broad-side impacts on a jacket-pile-soil system, is investigated. In the previous study of ship impact on an eight-leg North-Sea jacket platform by Amdahl and other authors, the effect of jacket-pile-soil interaction was not considered. The collision points on the jacket structure are also taken as joints and midspan of leg, horizontal and vertical braces, namely, hard and soft impact points. The speed and the weight of the colliding vessel are also varied for typical supply vessels. Several supply ship collision analyses are carried out for bow, stern and broad-side impact scenarios on an eight-leg North-Sea jacket platform. It is observed that by taking into account the jacket-pile-soil interaction effects, particularly in softer clayey soils, the amplitude of displacement response after the supply ship impact at the deck level is increased due to yield in the upper soil layers. Contrary to this finding, less linear dynamic effects can be seen in the studied jacket-pile-soil system subjected to the supply ship impact. It can also be concluded that for a soft impact scenario, the dynamic effects in the global response of the platform located in the mainly over-consolidated (OC) clayey soil may be much less than those for a hard impact scenario on the same platform. For instance, for a brace impact at its midspan, a less significant dynamic effect has been observed than for a leg impact. The duration of impact in such cases is shown to play an important role in determining the dynamic influence of the platform response. The relative energy absorption of the platform is shown to be more for broad-side loading. It is shown that the global response of the jacket platform during the collision with a supply vessel might depend largely on the scenario of the impact and, to some extent, on the pile-soil behavior. It is found that for the bow and stern impact scenarios, the energy contribution of the local member dent or buckling might be more significant than that for the broad-side loading for which the global frame energy contribution and the overall inertia effect of the platform might be a dominant factor.</jats:p>",

Also, a multi‐dimensional conceptualization of supply chain structure, including transparency, dependency and distance, was synthesized from earlier research.

Increased transparency, as reflected in greater product visibility by the end‐consumer was related to increased use of supplier human rights, which in turn can help to protect a firm's brands. Organizational distance, as measured by the total length of the supply chain (number of tiers in the supply chain), was related to increased use of multiple supplier socially responsible practices. Finally, as the plant was positioned further upstream in the supply chain, managers reported increased use of supplier codes of conduct.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>As senior managers extend, redesign or restructure their supply chains, the extent to which social issues must be monitored and managed changes.

Finally, the link between supply chain structure and the adoption of supplier socially responsible practices is examined.

However, functional areas such as sales, marketing, finance, and operations traditionally specialize in portions of the planning activities, which results in conflicts over expectations, preferences, and priorities.

By drawing a distinction between the incentive landscape and the planning process, we identify process as a mediator that can affect organizational outcomes. Thus, organizations may be capable of integration while functions retain different incentives and orientations to maintain focus on their stakeholders’ needs. Through iterative coding, we identify the attributes of the planning process that can drive planning performance—information, procedural, and alignment quality—but also find evidence that achieving alignment in the execution of plans can be more important than informational and procedural quality. In addition to process attributes, we also identify social elements that influenced the performance of the planning process and place the information processing attributes within a broader social and organizational context.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This empirical relationship suggests that productivity will decline with global warming. Here, we explore the response of productivity to future climate change in the CCE using an earth system model. This model projects increases in nitrate supply and productivity in the CCE during the 21st century despite increases in stratification and limited change in wind‐driven upwelling. We attribute the increased nitrate supply to enrichment of deep source waters entering the CCE resulting from decreased ventilation of the North Pacific. Decreases in dissolved‐oxygen concentration and increasing acidification accompany projected increases in nitrate. This analysis illustrates that anthropogenic climate change may be unlike past variability; empirical relationships based on historical observations may be inappropriate for projecting ecosystem responses to future climate change.</jats:p>",

These oxygen depending mechanisms have to been considered for the optimization of neural cell culture conditions. In this study, we used a cell culture system with an oxygen‐permeable polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) foil to investigate the effect of oxygen on metabolism and survival of neural cell lines in vitro. Human glial astrocytoma‐derived cells (GOS‐3) and rat pheochromacytoma cells (PC12) were cultured on the gas‐permeable PTFE foil as well as a conventional non oxygen‐permeable cell culture substrate at various oxygen concentrations. Analyses of metabolic activity, gene expression of apoptotic grade, and dopamine synthesis were performed. Under low oxygen partial pressure (2%, 5%) the anaerobic metabolism and apoptotic rate of cultured cells is diminished on PTFE foil when compared with the conventional culture dishes. In contrast, under higher oxygen atmosphere (21%) the number of apoptotic cells on the PTFE foil was enhanced. This culture model demonstrates a suitable model for the improvement of oxygen dependent metabolism under low oxygen conditions as well as for induction of oxidative stress by high oxygen atmosphere without supplementation of neurotoxins. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

After acquiring sufficient contextual knowledge, academics can use operations research (OR) to adapt successful supply chain management best practices to humanitarian logistics. We present two cases of OR applications to field vehicle fleet management in humanitarian operations. Our research shows that by using OR to adapt supply chain best practices to humanitarian logistics, significant improvements can be achieved.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a free-electron model, an electron crossing a mathematical plane inside a conductor can be characterized by the energy components associated with its motion normal and parallel to the plane. These components define a two-dimensional “energy-space.” The “supply density” is defined as the electron current crossing the plane, per unit area of the plane, per unit area in energy-space, when the relevant electron states are fully occupied. For a bulk free-electron conductor, the supply density is the same at all points in energy-space and has been called the “Sommerfeld supply density” (zS). This is given by zS=4πeme/hP3, where e is the elementary positive charge, me is the electron mass, and hP is Planck’s constant. This result is often a convenient starting point for developing basic theories of electron emission. A simple proof of it is recorded here. For small electron emitters, it can be a poor approximation to assume that the supply density is constant in energy-space. Consequently, if an emitter is sufficiently small, then the emission will not be well described by the usual basic emission equations. Criteria for assessing what counts as “sufficiently small” are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The overuse of its currency processing operations by depository institutions (DIs) has motivated the Federal Reserve (Fed) to propose new currency recirculation guidelines. The Fed believes that DIs should play a more active role in recirculating fit (i.e., usable) currency so that the societal cost of providing currency to the public is minimized. The Fed characterizes the overuse by the extent of cross shipping, a practice in which the same DI deposits and withdraws currency of the same denomination within five business days in the same geographic region. The Fed's proposal encourages DIs to fit sort and reuse deposited currency through two components: a custodial inventory program and a recirculation fee that would be charged on withdrawals of cross‐shipped currency. Given the geographical network of the various branches of a DI, the extent of its participation in the proposed programs depends on a variety of factors: the nature of demand and supply of currency, number and locations of the processing centers, and the resulting fit‐sorting, holding, and transportation costs. The interrelated nature of these decisions motivates the need for an integrated model that captures the flow of currency in the entire network of the DI. Based on our work with Brink's Inc., a leading secure‐logistics provider, we develop a mixed‐integer linear programming (MILP) model to provide managers of DIs with a decision‐making tool under the Fed's new guidelines. Broadly, we analyze the following questions: (i) Over all typical practical realizations of the demand for currency that a DI may face, and over all reasonable cost implications, is there a menu of “good” operating policies? (ii) What is the monetary impact of fit‐sorting and custodial inventories on a DI? and (iii) To what extent will the Fed's new guidelines address its main goal, namely, a reduction in the practice of cross shipping by encouraging DIs to recirculate currency? </jats:p>",

Qualitative attributes, such as growth form, woodiness, and leaf habit can be used to approximate these alternative solutions. Here, we quantified the extent to which these attributes affect leaf trait values at a given resource supply level, using measured plant traits from 105 different species (254 observations) distributed across 50 sites in mesic to wet plant communities in The Netherlands. For each site, soil total N, soil total P, and water supply estimates were obtained by field measurements and modeling. Effects of growth forms, woodiness, and leaf habit on relations between leaf traits (SLA, specific leaf area; LNC, leaf nitrogen concentration; and LPC, leaf phosphorus concentration) vs. nutrient and water supply were quantified using maximum‐likelihood methods and Bonferroni post hoc tests. The qualitative attributes explained 8–23% of the variance within sites in leaf traits vs. soil fertility relationships, and therefore they can potentially be used to make better predictions of global patterns of leaf traits in relation to nutrient supply. However, at a given soil fertility, the strength of the effect of each qualitative attribute was not the same for all leaf traits. These differences may imply a differential regulation of the leaf economy traits at a given nutrient supply, in which SLA and LPC seem to be regulated in accordance to changes in plant size and architecture while LNC seems to be primarily regulated at the leaf level by factors related to leaf longevity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last two decades, Jordan has suffered a chronic water crisis, and is the tenth most water-scarce nation on Earth. Such water stress has been well illustrated in the case of Greater Amman, the capital, which has grown dramatically from a population of around 2000 in the 1920s, to 2.17 million today. One of the distinctive characteristics of the water supply regime of Greater Amman is that since 1987 it has been based on a system of rationing, with households receiving water once a week for various durations. Amman is highly polarized socio-economically, and by means of household surveys, both quantitative and qualitative, conducted in high- and low-income divisions of the city, a detailed empirical evaluation of the storage and use of water, the strategies used by households to manage water and overall satisfaction with water supply issues is provided in this paper, looking specifically at issues of social equity. The analysis demonstrates the social and economic costs of water rationing and consequent management to be high, as well as emphasizing that issues of water quality are of central importance to all consumers regardless of their socio-economic status within the city.</jats:p>",

First, the demand and supply of pregnancies should be studied within the theoretical framework of a market with economic incentives. Second, a theoretical model for the demand for abortion must incorporate the total market for children, which implies the market for pregnancy, abortion, and adoption. Third, there exist in the overall market for procreative goods and services certain unique characteristics that need to be carefully considered. Producers and suppliers within the procreative goods and services market have radically different price and cost elasticity functions and unique production asymmetries that create a potential net benefit for buyer and seller alike. The market for abortion and adoption, while seemingly related and similar, suffer from a fundamental disconnect, preventing a simple exchange of goods and services: abortion implies potential supply that does not flow to potential consumersthose seeking to adopt. Studying this market inefficiency will benefit from a two‐sided market analysis used in situations where an intermediary business must attract both producers and suppliers. There are two key findings. First, I find that the producer decision to supply the good depends primarily on exogenous preference formation and not on consumer‐provided incentives. Second, I find that the market would benefit from legal framework for a market clearing institution using the market for real estate as the blueprint.</jats:p>",

Twelve cows were supplied with 2000 mg of β‐carotene (20 g Rovimix<jats:sup>®</jats:sup>β‐Carotene containing 10%β‐carotene; DSM Nutrition Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan) by oral administration daily from day 21 before expected calving date to parturition. Fourteen cows (control) did not receive β‐carotene supplementation. Blood samples were obtained on days 21, 14 and 7 before expected calving date and on days 1, 7, 14, 21 postpartum. When the plasma progesterone concentration exceeded 1 ng/ml by day 21 postpartum, luteal activity was assumed to have been initiated. The result showed that serum β‐carotene concentrations in the β‐carotene cows were higher than in the control cows during the experimental period (p &lt; 0.01). The number of cows with the onset of luteal activity by day 21 postpartum was 9/12 in the β‐carotene cows and 4/14 in the control cows (p &lt; 0.05). Retinol, certain metabolic parameters and metabolic hormones concentrations did not differ between β‐carotene and control cows. In addition, serum retinol concentration in β‐carotene cows without luteal activity was lower than in β‐carotene cows with luteal activity (p &lt; 0.05), and serum gamma‐glutamyl transpeptidase concentration in β‐carotene cows with luteal activity (p &lt; 0.05) and control cows without luteal activity (p &lt; 0.01) was higher than in control cows with luteal activity. In conclusion, β‐carotene supply during the close‐up dry period may support the onset of luteal activity during early lactation in dairy cows.</jats:p>",

Cold periods were humid and brought prosperity and agricultural settlement to the desert fringes. The forecast based on this correlation is that the present global warming will cause the drying up of the Middle East. As in the past, this negative impact should be mitigated by using the groundwater resources stored from past wetter times. This will involve deep drilling, pumping and modern irrigation methods within the framework of a new policy of ‘progressive development’, which will entail the use of currently undeveloped natural water resources beyond that of present water replenishment. While the use of the one-time groundwater reserves is taking place, a master long-term comprehensive progressive development plan for the Middle East will be prepared. This plan will include the step-by-step development of other water resources such as treated effluents, desalinated brackish groundwater and desalination of seawater.</jats:p>",

The first set was performed at different surface tensions and with different kinds of surfactants (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and Tween‐80 [Uniqema Americas LLC, Wilmington, Delaware]), which were added into the contaminated aquifer of different media (particle distribution size = 0.25 to 0.5 mm and 5 to 10 mm). The results indicated that the air saturation in the aquifer increased rapidly at an early stage, then the increase of air saturation slowed down with the increase of airflow rate. The air saturation of medium sand increased with the decrease in water surface tension, and maximum air saturation was achieved at a surface tension of approximately 5 × 10<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> N/m (50 dyn/cm), which was considered to be the optimum surface tension for air sparging enhancement in the medium sand aquifer. The increase of air saturation in gravel was the result of the increase of foamability and foam stability. The second group of experiments is about the removal of chlorobenzene from the medium sand aquifer. The experiments indicated that chlorobenzene removal by SEAS was more complete and efficient than that of conventional air sparging technology. However, the increase of removal rate and the decrease of lingering concentration by SEAS was not significant, with a further decrease in the surface tension when the surface tension dropped to 5.04 × 10<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> N/m (50.4 dyn/cm).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>If the lines which connect the output terminal of a DCDC converter and the load are long, the voltage actually crossing to the load will change greatly due to the impedances of the lines, producing drops in voltage. In this paper, a separate terminal apart from the output terminal of DC-DC converter senses the voltage across to the load, and it leads it to the load. As a result, the voltage across to the load is adjusted so that it does not experience large changes. This method is called remote sensing. When the lines become long, the usual method of adjusting the voltage across to the load cannot sufficiently suppress changes in it. In this paper, a robust digital controller to suppress the change in the voltage across the load is proposed. Experimental studies using DSP demonstrate that this type of digital controller successfully suppresses it.</jats:p>",
