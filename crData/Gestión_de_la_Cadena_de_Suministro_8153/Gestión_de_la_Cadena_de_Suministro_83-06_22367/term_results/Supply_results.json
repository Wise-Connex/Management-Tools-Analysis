Both real wage rises and monetary restrictions appear to have contributed to the jump in unemployment in 1974–75, and since then the continuing high and rising unemployment rate is closely associated with the low growth rate of the real money supply</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sediment supplies and stream discharge together determine the patterns, over time, of suspended sediment loads in small streams. Most of the uncertainty in empirical streamflow‐sediment relationships can be attributed to changing supplies. Our transport model utilizes a power function of the form <jats:italic>C = aQ<jats:sup>b</jats:sup></jats:italic>, where <jats:italic>C</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> are sediment concentration and stream discharge, respectively. This expression was augmented with a variable <jats:italic>S</jats:italic> representing sediment storage in the channel system. The resulting supply‐based model was calibrated to concentration and streamflow time series data from four storm events in a small forested watershed in coastal Oregon. We also calibrated the model to data from a controlled reservoir release in Utah, during which streamflow was held constant for an extended period. In all cases the supply‐based model followed observed concentration time series more accurately than did a transport model based on <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> alone. We further enhanced performance of the supply‐based model by distributing sediment supplies <jats:italic>S</jats:italic> among several compartments which were accessed at different levels of stream discharge. Both the single‐compartment and distributed models demonstrate that a knowledge of sediment supplies can improve predictions of suspended sediment concentrations during storm runoff.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A model is described that incorporates the effects of forest fire on long-term equilibrium timber supply. Its form is a computer simulation that burns and harvests specified proportions of a hypothetical forest with a given yield curve of volume over age. The primary result is the extent to which the equilibrium maximum sustainable annual harvest is depresssed by fire. This depression is always greater than the volume killed on the burned area. On the other hand, when the annual area cut is somewhat below the optimum level, the volume of harvest is relatively insensitive to the amount of fire. The results imply that the real impact of fire in managed forests is properly judged by the effect of the harvest, not from data on area burned and volume killed. </jats:p>",

Specific information structures lead to aggregation methods which adjust for additive bias, differences in individual accuracy, and correlation among forecasts. As an application, we construct composite predictions of the weekly change in the money supply from forecasts made by twenty major securities dealers, for which high positive correlation is found to be a significant characteristic. Due to instability in the information structure, our methods cannot improve on the accuracy of a simple average in this case. However, they do capture information about the correlation among money supply forecasts which is not fully impounded in short‐term interest rates. Forecasts from our models accurately predict the direction of price changes for Treasury bills and Treasury bill futures after a money supply announcement.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The present study describes in detail the venous supply to the bovine cecum, ileum, and the proximal loop of the ascending colon. The cecum was supplied by branches from the cecal and accessory cecal veins. The accessory cecal vein was observed in the majority of the specimens examined. The cecal and accessory cecal veins were joined by 7–10 short oblique anastomoses. The ileum was supplied by the ileal branches of the cecal vein, and from the mesenteric ileal and first ileal (cranial mesenteric) veins. The ileal branches of the cecal vein formed a row of antimesenteric ileal arches in the ileal part of the ileocecal fold. The mesenteric ileal vein, in some cases, detached a collateral branch. The first ileal and the mesenteric ileal veins anastomosed on the ventral surface of the ileum. The initial loop of colon was supplied by branches from the ileocolic vein. In the majority of specimens, the common colic, a branch of the cranial mesenteric vein, supplied the first colic branch to the third part of the initial colon. In such cases, the ileocolic vein gave off only the second and third colic branches. However, in one case, the proximal loop of the ascending colon was supplied by three colic branches of the ileocolic vein and by the first colic branch of the common colic vein. In specimens in which the common colic vein was absent, the colic branches to the initial colon were all given off by the ileocolic vein. The third (or fourth) colic branch of the ileocolic vein and the first cecal branch of the cecal vein united on the lateral surface of the ileocecocolic junction to form an ileocecocolic arch. The veins on the medial surface of the ileocecocolic junction did not form an arch.</jats:p><jats:p>The colic and ileal lymph nodes were supplied by twigs from the colic branches of the ileocolic vein and first ileal vein of the cranial mesenteric, respectively. The small cecal lymph nodes seen only in the specimen from the calf were supplied by fine branches from the cecal vein.</jats:p>",

Proportionately greater increases in specific N‐absorption rate were measured in <jats:italic>D. flexuosa</jats:italic> compared with <jats:italic>H. lanatus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>L. perenne</jats:italic>. All three species exhibited large changes in root morphology (length : dry weight). In <jats:italic>D. flexuosa</jats:italic> such changes were confined only to those roots having direct access to N (+ N roots); in <jats:italic>H. lanatus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>L. perenne</jats:italic> this response occurred also in the rest of the root system (‐N roots). The proportion of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N transported to the ‐ N roots was greater in <jats:italic>H. lanatus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>L. perenne</jats:italic>. Increased transport of ammonium‐N to the shoot was found in <jats:italic>D. flexuosa</jats:italic> and, it is suggested, this stabilized the root: shoot ratio and maintained maximum relative growth rate. The smaller absolute N demand of <jats:italic>D. flexuosa</jats:italic> was such that responses to maximize N uptake, to confine to a greater extent the utilization of N to +N roots, and to maintain N supply to the shoot, ensured full compensation for the restricted N supply. The inherently higher N demands of <jats:italic>H. lanatus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>L. perenne</jats:italic> could not be met by increases in specific absorption rates. In addition, the transport of relatively greater amounts of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N to – N roots rather than to the shoot, and the consequent increase in root: shoot ratios prevented compensation from being achieved to the same extent.</jats:p><jats:p>Thus, the efficient utilization of dry matter and nutrient resources appear to be important factors enabling <jats:italic>D. flexuosa</jats:italic> to grow effectively under restricted conditions of nutrient supply.</jats:p>",
