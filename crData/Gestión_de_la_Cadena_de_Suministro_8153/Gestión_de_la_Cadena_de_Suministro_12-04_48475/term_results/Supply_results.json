      "abstract": "<p>As supply chains are becoming more dependent upon suppliers, the importance of using backup supply is receiving increasing attention. The objective of this paper is to develop a set of models to facilitate manufacturers/buyers’ decision as to when to use a backup supply if the main supply source is interrupted. The authors take a number of cost factors such as production, purchasing and inventory holding during the disruption cycle into consideration. The impacts of the duration and the magnitude of the main supplier’s breakdown are explicitly studied, and the effect of demand change during disruption is also examined. Numerical illustrations are given to show the applications of the decision-making models developed in the paper.</p>",

These maps emphasize the contemporary, physical reality of an area, the Holy Land, often seen through a romantic veil.

Of special interest on the map is the depiction of the city's water resources, important to future Crusaders.</p>",

As a consequence, relationships with suppliers are often highly volatile, instable and inapprehensible, which in turn causes turbulences with respect to reliability of deliveries. Following the design research paradigm, both practical and knowledge problems are considered by this paper. First, from a practical point of view, a new intelligent supply chain design for non-hierarchical manufacturing networks is developed, that pledges to improve the delivery reliability. Second, from a knowledge point of view, the underlying hypotheses that go along with this new design are validated using structural equation modeling. The results confirm several previously proposed assumptions, including the importance of an electronic procurement process as well as the use of incentive mechanisms for influencing a supplier’s delivery reliability.</p>",

While we can rely on a solid body of knowledge on the drivers and outcomes of customer loyalty, empirical insights into the interplay between different forms of customer loyalty in channels of distribution remain limited, ambiguous and void of theoretical explanations. Based on a nationwide survey of customers in a detail‐intensive industry in the Netherlands and drawing on information integration theory and balance theory, this research identifies a positive and unidirectional spillover effect from customers' brand loyalty to distributor loyalty. Hence, distributors can “free ride” on a brand manufacturer's investments in customer loyalty. From the brand manufacturer's perspective, the loyalty spillover can have positive or negative consequences, depending on the level of vertical competition among channel members. While the spillover increases end customers' loyalty toward the channel, it decreases the brand manufacturer's odds of keeping end customers when it comes to the contest between a brand manufacturer and its distributor.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Various market challenges have led logistics service providers (LSPs) to engage in horizontal cooperations with each other, while maintaining their general legal independence. As an idiosyncrasy, horizontal cooperations entail the opposing forces of competition and cooperation, also referred to as “co‐opetition” (Bengtsson and Kock 2000; Tsai 2002). This constellation facilitates the development of opportunism and conflicts, which raise the risk of relationship failure. Adequate governance mechanisms provide a basis to avoid failure and drive cooperation success. This paper focuses on the postformation cooperation management phase and identifies the specific effects that operational governance has on cooperation commitment and cooperation effectiveness. Based on survey data from 226 LSP cooperations, we show that both formal and social governance mechanisms have a substantial performance effect. In this regard, the results differ fundamentally from studies on vertical buyer‐supplier relationships. With respect to the specific setup of the cooperation, a differentiated view is provided. Results indicate that two types of cooperation complexity are of relevance: organizational complexity and strategic complexity. The former drives the relevance of formal control; the latter increases the relevance of both formal and social control for cooperation success.</jats:p>",

The resource‐based view of the firm is used to frame the direct effects of strategic supplier selection as the capability of a buyer to select a supplier with resources and expertise in a specified domain should enhance the buyer's performance capability in the “matched” domain (but not necessarily buyer performance in “unmatched” domains). Two supplier integration mechanisms — supplier partnerships and supplier development — are modeled as potential mediators, implying indirect paths. The research hypotheses focus on both direct and indirect effects for each of the matched domains, but do not posit relationships across different domains. For example, supplier selection for new product development capability should impact buyer product innovation (matched domains), but should not necessarily impact buyer quality capability (unmatched domains). The <jats:italic>direct</jats:italic> effects of strategic supplier selection on buyer performance are supported in each matched domain; however, the <jats:italic>indirect</jats:italic> effects through supplier integration are not significant for the matched domains. The results identify strategic supplier selection as a promising source of competitive advantage in the resource‐based view sense. In contrast, supplier development and supplier partnership do not provide performance benefits in a given domain <jats:italic>above those</jats:italic> arising from strategic supplier selection in the same domain; i.e., it is the nature of the resources selected that is key to competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Water supply systems (WSSs) are vital infrastructures for the well-being of people today. To achieve good customer satisfaction the water supply service must always be able to meet people's needs, in terms of both quantity and quality. But unpredictable extreme conditions can cause severe damage to WSSs and lead to poorer levels of service or even to their failure. Operators dealing with a system's day-to-day operation know that events like burst water mains can compromise the functioning of all or part of a system. To increase a system's reliability, therefore, designs should take into account operating conditions other than normal ones. Recent methods based on robust optimization can be used to solve optimization problems which involve uncertainty and can find designs which are able to cope with a range of operating conditions. This paper presents a robust optimization model for the optimal design of water supply systems operating under different circumstances. The method presented here uses a hydraulic simulator linked to an optimizer based on a simulated annealing heuristic. The results show that robustness can be included in several ways for varying levels reliability and that it leads to more reliable designs for only small cost increases.\n                        </jats:p>"

The Six Shooter was developed as asolution to the historical challenges of BOP emergency intervention. ROVtooling for subsea Blowout Preventer (BOP) intervention has been limited tosmall hydraulic pumps which require substantial amounts of time to operate BOPrams. With faster closing times recommended for emergency intervention, supplementary accumulated volume is required subsea. The Six Shooter can belaunched from a support vessel, IMR vessel or Rig, eliminating the need forcostly Rig or BOP modifications. The unit can be deployed onto a customdesigned mudmat or an existing structure.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>When deployed, the Six Shooter would allow a ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) ofopportunity to function and provide high flow (100 gpm) and pressure (5000 psi)to the BOP via a flying lead. At these flow rates, the industry standardspecifications of 45 second ram closures can be obtained.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Equipped with dual regulators, the output pressure of the Six Shooter can beselected with the turn of a ROV valve. Depending on the number of BOP functionsthat need to be closed during an emergency situation, additional units can beeasily added with standard high flow flying leads to increase the usablevolume. The subsea accumulators are constructed with materials that allowdependable and repeatable functioning over long exposures to a subseaenvironment.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Industry standards continue to become more stringent and require a secondarywell control system that can be accessed by the ROV, (Remotely OperatedVehicle) and is able to close critical rams in less than 45 seconds. ROV pumpsare not capable of producing the combined flow and pressures required, therefore a high pressure, high volume system is required. One option might bea complete secondary set of accumulators mounted to the BOP and controlledsubsea. However, there are restrictions on the weight of the BOP stack, andthis solution is not suitable in many cases.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Therefore, a modular independent accumulator system that can be launched andtemporarily parked on the sea floor during a drilling campaign is ideal. Thisflexibility allows the operator to forgo costly modifications to the BOP stackand drilling rig. Oceaneering has designed and built an independent subseaaccumulator system that can be deployed onto a subsea structure (mudmat, pile, existing structure, etc...) and connected to the BOP via ROV. The Six Shootercan override functions in the event topside communication is lost on the rig. This unit can be launched from a support vessel, IMR vessel, or Rig allowingany ROV of opportunity to function it. Closing times with this equipment canmatch the closing times of the original BOP stack design specifications. TheSix-Shooter module is constructed with materials that allow dependable andrepeatable functioning over long exposures to a subsea environment.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Corrosion in water supply networks is unwanted process that causes pipe material loss and subsequent pipe failures. Nowadays pipe replacing strategy most often is based on pipe age, which is not always the most important factor in pipe burst rate. In this study a methodology for developing a mathematical model to predict the decrease of pipe thickness in a large cast iron networks is presented. The quality of water, the temperature and the water flow regime were the main factors taken into account in the corrosion model. The water quality and flow rate effect were determined by measuring corrosion rate of metals coupons over the period of one year at different flow regimes. The obtained constants were then introduced in a calibrated hydraulic model (Epanet) and the corrosion model was validated by measuring the decrease of wall thickness in the samples that were removed during the regular pipe replacing event. The validated model was run for 30 yr to simulate the water distribution system of Riga (Latvia). Corrosion rate in the first year was 8.0–9.5 times greater than in all the forthcoming years, an average decrease of pipe wall depth being 0.013/0.016 mm per year in long term. The optimal iron pipe exploitation period was concluded to be 30–35 yr (for pipe wall depth 5.50 mm and metal density 7.5 m3 t−1). The initial corrosion model and measurement error was 33%. After the validation of the model the error was reduced to below 15%.\n                        </jats:p>"

However, laboratory DC power supplies, which are commonly used in many 3He neutron spin filters, do not have such stabilities. To attain a highly stable current with a common laboratory DC power supply for every 3He neutron spin filter, a simple feedback circuit has been developed to keep the output current stable up to 10−6. Such a highly stable current or voltage from a common laboratory DC power supply can also be used for various other research applications.</jats:p>",

Alternative power supply suchas wind power has a large potential to reduce the fossil fuel use, and therebythe CO2 and NOX emissions. Potential benefits with such a solution areinvestigated in this paper by considering a system consisting of fiveinterconnected oil platforms connected to a 100 MW offshore wind farm. Theplatforms are assumed to have a constant load, 147 MW in total. Two parallelgas turbines are still present on each of the five platforms, but the windpower always has first priority to supply the load. A one-year simulation hasbeen made using wind power data. Compared to the case without wind power, anoverall reduction in fuel consumption of 21–32 % was found, depending on theoperation strategy for the gas turbines. The gas savings yield revenues thatwere used to calculate the break-even cost for the wind farm investment. Arough estimation indicates that a wind farm investment cost smaller than 2.0M€/MW would make the combined wind/platform solution favourable compared withthe default configuration. As this calculation is highly dependent on a numberof parameters, a sensitivity analysis is conducted that quantifies thedependency between different parameters and the break-even wind farmcost.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>1 Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Offshore petroleum installations are largely isolated systems with a localpower supply consisting of local gas turbines (or other turbines based onfossil fuel). These turbines have low efficiency ratios (about 30 % on averagecompared to about 55% for a modern combined cycle gas power plant), and emitconsiderable amounts of CO2 and NOX [1]. Due to climate change concerns, thereis a world-wide focus on reducing CO2 emissions, and a tax on CO2 emissions hasbeen introduced in many countries as a means to reach this goal. The potentialfor reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 and NOX emissions throughelectrification of offshore platforms is large. There are two main alternativesfor electrification. One is to connect the platforms to the onshore powersystem via cables. The other alternative, and the topic of this study, is toconnect the platforms to alternative offshore power production in isolatedpower systems. A combination of these two main solutions is also possible. Themost realistic candidate for renewable offshore power generation today isoffshore wind.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper describes results from a (hypothetical) case study of multipleplatforms connected to an offshore wind farm. The focus of the study is tocalculate potential reductions in fuel use and emissions through introductionof wind power as supply to a system of multiple oil platforms. In addition, economic calculations with respect to the fuel savings and wind turbineinvestment costs are included to indicate the potential profitability inconnecting wind power to oil platforms. Finally, energy storage systems arediscussed as a further modification to the conventional offshore power systems. Storage can yield a more efficient fuel gas usage while at the same timeprovide a higher security of supply.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>A study with a similar focus has been carried out previously on a simplersystem with only one oil platform [2]. The same system as studied in this paperhas been investigated in two previous studies, focusing on control and powersystem stability issues [3] and on fuel saving [4], respectively. Otherstability studies on small isolated systems with wind turbines and oilplatforms are found in [5–8], and diesel-wind systems was investigated in [9,10]. An on-going real life demonstrator project where two 5 MW wind turbinesare connected to the Beatrice oil platform is described in [11].</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The systematisation of existing methods and algorithms that are used to optimise complex processes by linking stochastic discrete-event simulation and multi-objective optimisation is given. The two-phase optimisation method is developed based on hybrid combination of compromise programming, evolutionary computation and response surface-based methods. Approbation of the proposed method is performed on the multi-echelon supply chain planning problem that is widely distributed in industry and its solution plays a vital role in increasing the competitiveness of a company. Three scenarios are implemented to optimise supply chain tactical planning processes at the chemical manufacturing company based on using different optimisation methods and software. The numerical results prove the competitive advantages of the developed two-phase optimisation method.</jats:p>",

However, supply chain security (SCS) comes at a cost and increasing levels of protection have increasing levels of costs to the firm. So some firms engage in strategic initiatives to secure the supply chain (SC) while others do not; and each firm engages in varying degrees of activities to ensure SCS. Therefore, in this study, the researchers sought to explore what types of SCS strategies exist. The researchers analyze 162 responses to a SCS survey completed by executives from a broad range of firms and industries and identify three general SCS strategies: Advanced, Laggards, and Compliant. Implications for researchers and practitioners are presented.</jats:p>"

The real case study is conducted for a textile industry to illustrate the utilization of the proposed model for the maintenance strategy selection problem. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to make sure that the result of the proposed model can be acceptable. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to show the validity of the proposed model.

Since micropumps and their control circuitry consume a portion of the electrical power generated in fuel cells, fuel supply without micropumps makes it possible to provide more efficient and inexpensive fuel cells than conventional ones. The flow regulation valves in the present system maintain the constant fuel flow rate from the pressurized fuel chamber even though the fuel pressure decreases. They autonomously adjust fluidic resistance of the channel according to fuel pressure so as to maintain constant flow rate. Compared to previous pumpless fuel supply methods, the present method offers more uniform fuel flow without any fluctuation using a simple structure. The prototypes were fabricated by a polymer micromolding process. In the experimental study using the pressurized deionized water, prototypes with pressure regulation valves showed constant flow rate of 5.38 ± 0.52 μl/s over 80 min and 5.89 ± 0.62 μl/s over 134 min, for the initial pressure in the fuel chamber of 50 and 100 kPa, respectively, while the other prototypes having the same fluidic geometry without flow regulation valves showed higher and gradually decreasing flow rate. The present pumpless fuel supply method providing constant flow rate with autonomous valve operation will be beneficial for the development of next-generation fuel cells.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In many industrial sectors, the use of RFID in closed systems is evolving. To be implemented in global supply chains, all aspects related to RFID need to be standardised. By collecting, processing and distributing information efficiently, organisations should be able to improve the efficiency of their transport logistics processes, lower their operational costs, and improve their portfolio of logistics services. This case study describes the current perspectives, challenges and benefits of RFID applications in manufacturing industry. Automated, remote and wireless identification is a basic element in implementing efficient management systems in the supply chain. The most important identification techniques are barcode and RFID. Barcode is currently the most widely used method for the identification of parcels, but RFID is more suitable for automated identification for many different reasons including better readability and enhanced environmental durability. By reducing manual work and errors, RFID generates cost savings, increased productivity and efficiency of processes. There is a wide range of different RFID technologies that have varying reading ranges, protocols and data contents. There are two different approaches to using RFID tags and numbering the items to be identified. Recent standardisation developments have started to resolve the interoperability problems in the field of RFID identification.</p>",

This suggests that traditional supply chains have encountered limits to time‐based competition in which the cost of faster replenishment exceeds the benefits. This paper explores and quantifies those limits to time‐based competition in make‐to‐stock supply chains for functional products (products with stable demand over relatively long life cycles).</jats:p><jats:p>The marginal value of time is used to define the limits of time‐based competition in a supply chain, and we define it as the change in total inventory costs per unit change in supply chain lead‐time. To calculate the value of time, we develop a set of simple analytical expressions that apply to most standard reorder‐point inventory policies under deterministic and variable lead‐times. By not requiring optimal inventory policies and expressing the value of time in terms of the unit cost of the product, we obtain very general results that are essentially product‐free. We validate the analytical expressions using data from actual supply chains to simulate the inventory cost effects of changes in the lead‐time. The results show that the marginal value of time in a supply chain is surprisingly low; it generally falls within a range of 0.4–0.8% of product unit cost per week.</jats:p><jats:p>Our analytical models explain why there has been expansive growth in global supply chains for functional products. The key tradeoff in outsourcing is between reduced variable production cost and the increased inventory cost of longer supply chain lead‐times. The models show analytically that the incremental inventory cost is extremely small relative to the cost benefit. The growth in global supply chains with long lead‐times is cost, rather than time, driven.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Hence the risks for theft, untimely delivery and freight quality deterioration increase. There is hence a growing need to manage the security and efficiency of consignments from door to door. This paper describes the results of the Finnish national SCIE (Supply Chain Security and Integrity) project, which had as main objective the development of a holistic framework for the management of the security and efficiency of supply chains. A profound risk analysis was performed to find key vulnerabilities of the service and suitable monitoring technology. The security service was developed to deal with the vast amount of actors in the multimodal supply chain, accurate transport plan data reception and the identification of exceptional situations. The service concept was tested by monitoring and analysing steel product shipments from Finland to Central Europe. Advanced intelligent monitoring devices were attached to the consignments. These devices gathered and transmitted in real-time environmental, transport stress and location information. The paper will give an overview of the framework, service concept and the analysed results of a multimodal shipment from Finland to Italy.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Increasing emissions of greenhouse gases and increasing prices for fossil fuels have highlighted the demand for CO2 \"neutral\" renewable energy sources, e.g. short rotation forestry systems used for bioenergy. These systems might be vulnerable to changes in temperature, precipitation and occurrence of extreme weather events. To estimate success or failure of such short rotation coppices in a certain area we need regional climate projections and risk assessment. Changes of water supply patterns in two agriculturally extensively used regions in Central Germany (around Göttingen and Großfahner) with different climate conditions but both in the temperate climate zone are explored. The study is carried out under present conditions as well as under projected climate change conditions (1971–2100) using A1B and B1 climate scenarios downscaled for Europe. Analysis of precipitation bias shows regional differences: a strong bias in Göttingen area and a weaker bias in the Großfahner area. A bias correction approach, Quantile mapping, is applied to the ensemble results for both areas for winter and summer seasons. By using quantile regression on the seasonal Standardized Precipitation Indices (SPIs) as indicator for water supply conditions we found that precipitation is expected to increase in winter in all quantiles of the distribution for Göttingen area during the 21th century. Heavy precipitation is also expected to increase for Großfahner area suggesting a trend to wetter extremes in winter for the future. This winter precipitation increase could trigger runoff and soil erosion risk enhancing the severity of floods. Increasing winter availability of water could enhance local water supply in spring. For both areas no significant change in summer was found over the whole time period. Although the climate change signal of the SPI indicate mild dryer conditions in summer at the end of the 21st century which may trigger water shortage and summer drying associated with above–average temperatures in the future. Even though both study areas are close together Großfahner area was found to be the least affected one by changes indicating that small spatial scale differences matter. These developments were found in all examined simulation runs. This study highlighted the regional differences in the vulnerability to water surplus or deficit risks in a temperate system which emphasizes the need in impact studies to focus on proper consideration of local and regional environmental conditions as well as adaption and mitigation of management for agriculture.\n                        </jats:p>"

Based on the literature we use controlled experiments involving both student subjects and supply chain managers to test debiasing interventions that provide declarative knowledge, which is theorized to enhance the acquisition of procedural knowledge. We first investigate the effects of three debiasing components in a single‐echelon setting: knowledge of bullwhip, inventory position (IP), and use of a target order‐up‐to quantity. Experiment 1 (N = 1,608 decisions by 67 student subjects) using a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design for the three components finds that the conceptual understanding of IP is salient for efficient replenishment decisions. We next examine the effects of the components in a simulated, multi‐echelon, serial supply chain, which introduces the additional complexity of coordination risk. Experiment 2 (N = 3,072 decisions by 128 student subjects) using a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design finds that although subjects benefit from training components, there is evidence of cognitive overload with an increased quantity of information. Finally we test whether these debiasing components may be an effective training program for practicing supply chain managers who can be expected to have higher levels of procedural knowledge through experience gained in the field. Experiment 3 (N = 864 decisions by 36 supply chain managers) using a 2 × 1 design investigates the effects of an instructional training intervention which includes all three debiasing components and finds the intervention to reduce costs by 14%. We provide avenues for future research and successful practice.</jats:p>",

A manufacturer distributes a durable product through an exclusive retailer to an exhaustible population of consumers with heterogeneous reservation prices. In each period, the manufacturer and retailer in turn set wholesale and retail prices, respectively, and customers with valuation above the retail price adopt the product at a constant (hazard) rate. We derive the open-loop, feedback, and myopic equilibria for this dynamic pricing game and compare it to the centralized solution. Although in an integrated supply chain a forward-looking dynamic pricing strategy is always desirable, we show that this is not the case in a decentralized setting, because of vertical competition. Our main result is that both supply chain entities are better off in the long run when they ignore the impact of current prices on future demand and focus on immediate-term profits. A numerical study confirms that this insight is robust under various supply- and demand-side effects. We use the channel efficiency corresponding to various pricing rules to further derive insights into decisions on decentralization and disintermediation. </jats:p>",

Through analytical interrogation of existing literature and empirical evidence from Vietnamese case studies, two propositions are made to clarify the poor performance of CoCs. It is argued, firstly, that the extent of the control of MNCs over their subcontracting suppliers is misconceived and over-estimated because supply chains function more like networks than the hierarchies assumed by ‘principal-agent’ preconceptions. Conceptualizing such relationships instead as networks of conflicting political and economic imperatives amongst various sets of actors generates a second proposition derived from our case studies. The factory workers, their subcontractor employers, intermediary vendors and even the MNCs seeking CoC commitments, have convergent interests in violating key aspects of the codes and deceiving their auditors. The analysis evaluates the residual value of CoCs in light of these constraints and the options for improving labour regulation, with particular reference to the plight of disadvantaged women workers. </jats:p>",

However, in scholarly work, sustainability has often been dealt with in a generic fashion or from an anecdotal point of view. Further, research works examining CR on the one hand and sustainable supply chains on the other have been conducted separately. We undertake the multiple factor analysis of a CR rating database (Innovest) which reports longitudinal scores for both the social and environmental performance of 1198 companies in different countries and distinct industries, to demonstrate a strong relationship between CR and a sustainable supply chain. Our findings from exploratory analysis also illustrate the role of country of origin and industry in shaping CR behaviour, highlighting isomorphic as well as allomorphic trends for CR trough time.

This study aims to: (1) identify a comprehensive set of factors which may influence the location of VALS, (2) to analyze to what extent those factors influence location decisions, and (3) to distinguish the determinants behind the location choices for distribution centers and for the kind of VALS that will be developed in these distribution centers.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>In this paper, we will present a conceptual framework on the locations of VALS in view of the identifying determinants for assigning VALS to logistical centers. We argue that the optimal location of VALS is determined by complex interactions between the determinants at the level of the choice of a distribution system, distribution center location factors, and different logistical characteristics regarding products.</jats:p>",

Although the cash is kept in several nodes to service the demand of final customers, availability causes opportunity cost related with its investment options. When planning the inventory of cash that should be maintained across the network, transportation decisions are also expected to be made. Cash transportation has a high cost, associated with the high risk of theft. Increasing the inventory can reduce the need for transportation, but the opportunity cost can be very high. Moreover, the inventory is also related with the service level perceived for final customers; therefore because of low inventory some people are not able to make some transactions. The aim of this work is to find optimal decisions related with cash inventory and transportation across the network, trying to balance the cost of the service and the quality perceived for final users.</jats:p>",

While the critical thermal limits of water-breathing marine animals may be caused by oxygen- and capacity-limitation of thermal tolerance (OCLT), the mechanisms are poorly understood in air-breathing terrestrial insects. We used thermolimit respirometry to characterize entry into chill-coma in a laboratory population of fall field crickets (Gryllus pennsylvanicus). To detect potential oxygen limitation, we quantified muscle ATP, lactate and alanine concentrations in crickets following prolonged exposure to 0°C (a temperature that causes chill-coma, chilling injury and eventual death). Although there was a sharp (44%) drop in the rate of CO2 emission at the CTmin and spiracular control was lost, there was a low, continuous rate of CO2 release throughout chill-coma, indicating that the spiracles were open and gas exchange could occur through the tracheal system. Prolonged exposure to 0°C caused muscle ATP levels to increase marginally (rather than decrease as OCLT would predict), and there was no change in muscle lactate or alanine concentration. Thus, it appears that insects are not susceptible to OCLT at low temperatures but that the CTmin may instead be set by temperature effects on whole-animal ion homeostasis.</jats:p>",

We have developed a high temperature flow control system based on pressure measurements (HT-FCS) to control the flow rate of MO gas. Moreover, a liquid source control system that combines a HT-FCS and vaporizer was developed. Using this system, it was possible to control the flow rate of MO gas with high accuracy for extended periods.

Likewise, the implementation processes conducive to achieving significant impacts and constraints to program effectiveness are not well documented. This study examines the delivery and utilization of a therapeutic Plumpy'nut ration as part of the Ethiopia National Food by Prescription (FBP) Program. Quantitative monitoring data from FBP clinic sites were analyzed to examine the proportion of patients attending ART and FBP appointments and receiving drugs and nutrition rations. 130 male and female FBP participants and medical staff were engaged in focus group discussions using participatory methods at 8 FBP program health facilities to examine factors related to program participation, adherence, and perceived changes in health and nutrition status. Approximately 50% of rations were reportedly consumed by the HIV+ index patient. Pressure to sell and share rations, negative ration side‐effects, transportation difficulties, stigma, and additional burden on health workers emerged as constraints to efficient implementation. Attention to often under‐utilized monitoring data can enable the timely resolution of critical implementation bottlenecks, leading to greater program effectiveness.</jats:p>",

Simulating larval drift should help assessing the sensitivity of recruitment variability to early life history. An individual‐based model (IBM) coupled to a hydrodynamic model was used to simulate common sole larval supply from spawning areas to coastal and estuarine nursery grounds at the population scale in the eastern Channel on a 14‐yr time series, from 1991 to 2004. The IBM allowed each particle released to be transported by currents from the hydrodynamic model, to grow with temperature, to migrate vertically giving stage development, and possibly to die according to drift duration, representing the life history from spawning to metamorphosis. Despite sensitivity to the larval mortality rate, the model provided realistic simulations of cohort decline and spatio‐temporal variability of larval supply. The model outputs were analysed to explore the effects of hydrodynamics and life history on the interannual variability of settled sole larvae in coastal nurseries. Different hypotheses of the spawning spatial distribution were also tested, comparing homogeneous egg distribution to observation and potential larval survival (PLS) maps. The sensitivity analyses demonstrated that larval supply is more sensitive to the life history along larval drift than to the phenology and volume of spawning, providing explanations for the lack of significant stock–recruitment relationship. Nevertheless, larval supply is sensitive to spawning distribution. Results also suggested a very low connectivity between supposed different sub‐populations in the eastern Channel.</jats:p>",

However, reality shows that this is not the most usual situation, rather distributed supply chain decision making is. This paper proposes a framework to support modelling the decisional view of collaborative planning from a decision-making process perspective for both centralised and distributed situations. Along these lines, the framework assumes that the supply chain may be composed of one or several decision centres which aim to support every supply chain planning operation. Therefore, the main framework contributions are: consideration of decisions jointly with physical, organisation and information views; the spatial and temporal integration among the different supply chain decision centres; the definition of the macro level for “conceptually” modelling the collaborative planning process and the micro level for developing analytical models in all the decisional activities identified in the supply chains operations planning process. Finally, a brief overview of a real case application is also described.</p>",

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the international pathway of male and female athletes in different sports from the moment of their competitive debut, in order to determine how many international athletes at early ages competed or did not compete internationally as juniors and/or seniors. The sample included 395 athletes (soccer, volleyball, swimming and judo), born between 1974 and 1981, who could have competed in their national squads between 1988 and 2008. Results showed that only a third of international pre‐junior athletes reappeared as senior athletes, confirming the difficulties of predicting late success based on early identification and selection.</jats:p>",

The 5.95 m gravity core used in this study records paleoenvironmental changes during the last approximately 600 ka. Down-core variations in trace element, rare earth element, and Nd and Sr isotopic compositions reveal that sediment provenance varied according to glacial cycles. During glacial periods, detrital sediments in the southern Drake Passage were mostly derived from the nearby South Shetland Islands and shelf sediments. In contrast, interglacial sediments are composed of mixed sediments, derived from both West Antarctica and East Antarctica. The East Antarctic provenance of the interglacial sediments was inferred to be the Weddell Sea region. Sediment input from the Weddell Sea was reduced during glacial periods by extensive ice sheets and weakened current from the Weddell Sea. Sediment supply from the Weddell Sea increased during interglacial periods, especially those with higher warmth such as MIS 5, 9, and 11. This suggests that the influence of deep water from the Weddell Sea increases during interglacial periods and decreases during glacial periods, with the degree of influence increasing as interglacial intensity increases.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Studies of Indonesian construction supply chains have been in the early stage. Previous studies have described very well the structures of construction project supply chains. Moreover, one of strategies that have been considered by construction companies for gaining a competitive advantage is to reduce the cost of their supply chains. The research's objective is to identify the cost structure of construction supply chains in Indonesia and factors that could influence it. By knowing these factors, construction companies are expected to be able to determine strategic efforts needed for reducing cost of their construction supply chains. Two construction projects operated by a large construction company were explored as case-studies. Rebar material was chosen for this supply chains study. It was found that the cost of purchasing was very significant. Meanwhile, costs of transportation and inventory were insignificant. It can be concluded that efforts to reduce supply chains cost by reducing costs of inventory and transportation would not be effective. Therefore, factors that could influence the cost of supply chains are related to management of supply chains, such as procurement policy, material requirement planning, supplier qualification, selection process, contract, and supplier development. Santrauka Ankstesniuose Indonezijos statybų tiekimo grandinių tyrimuose labai gerai apibūdintos statybos projektų tiekimo grandinių struktūros. Be to, viena iš strategijų, kurias statybų įmonės nagrinėjo kaip galimybę įgyti konkurencinį pranašumą, buvo išlaidų mažinimas tiekimo grandinėms. Šiuo tyrimu siekiama nustatyti Indonezijos statybų tiekimo grandinių išlaidų struktūrą ir jai įtaką galinčius daryti veiksnius. Žinodamos tokius veiksnius, statybų įmonės turėtų sugebėti nustatyti, kokios strategijos leistų sumažinti išlaidas statybų tiekimo grandinėms. Atvejui tirti pasirinkti du statybų projektai, kuriuos vykdė stambi statybos įmonė. Šiam tiekimo grandinių tyrimui pasirinkta armatūra. Nustatyta, kad pirkimo kaina buvo labai svarbi, o pristatymo ir inventorizacijos išlaidos svarbiomis nelaikytos. Galima daryti išvadą, kad bandymas apriboti išlaidas tiekimo grandinėms, mažinant inventorizacijos ir pristatymo išlaidas, nebūtų veiksmingas. Taigi išlaidoms, kurios skiriamos tiekimo grandinėms, įtaką galintys daryti veiksniai yra susiję su tiekimo grandinių valdymu: pirkimo politika, medžiagų poreikio planavimu, tiekėjų kvalifikacija, atrankos procesu, sutarties sudarymu ir tiekėjų tobulinimo programa.</jats:p>",

Drawing upon the international mobility of foreign scholars and the spirit of the international medical graduate program, this article suggests a model to fill the demand in accounting doctoral faculty. The underlying assumption of the suggested model is that there is enough qualified international accounting doctoral scholars who are willing to work in the United States because of natural and artificial benefits, such as the existence of national innovation, knowledge‐intensive clusters system, favorable working conditions, and career and earning prospects. A 10‐week International Accounting Post‐Doctoral Program (IAPDP) is designed to prepare academically competent international accounting faculty to be qualified to work in the United States at AACSB International‐accredited institutions. A survey was employed to examine the viability of the proposed model. Our results indicate that qualified international accounting doctoral scholars are interested in the suggested model and the nondoctoral U.S. accounting programs will represent the major job market for these IAPDP graduates. This article should be of interest to accounting educators, business schools, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) International, and the American Accounting Association (AAA).</jats:p>",

This study utilizes full ingredient list and nutrition facts panel (NFP) data from Gladson Nutrition Database, and nationally representative food purchases from Nielsen Homescan 2005–2009. Of the 85,452 uniquely formulated foods purchased between 2005–2009 representing &gt;400,000 items in the marketplace, 75% contain sweeteners (73.3% nutritive, 1.3% non‐nutritive). 7% contain FJC (not reconstituted) as a sweetener, and 2% contain reconstituted fruit juice. FJC as a sweetener is used in 13% of granola or energy bars, 12% of baby food, 17% of salad dressings and dips, 18% of sweets, 11% of ready‐to‐eat cereals, 16% of yogurts, 30% caloric sugar‐ and 16% of diet‐sweetened beverages. Among uniquely formulated products, those containing FJC as the only sweetener have a mean of 21g total sugar/100g, which is not statistically different from the 23g total sugar in products sweetened only by other nutritive sweeteners. However, when total sugar/100g is weighted by volume purchased, we found that foods purchased in 2007–2008 containing FJC as the only sweetener had significantly higher total sugars than those sweetened by other nutritive sweeteners only (20.1–20.3g vs. 15.9–16.1g, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&gt;0.05).

The combined gas and electricity network model is described. It is then used to project the development of the UK gas and electricity networks out to 2030 under two different scenarios for the wider development of the UK energy system. A set of plausible gas supply disruptions associated with three major gas facilities, lasting from 5 to 90 days, are hypothesised to occur in mid-winter 2025. The impacts are assessed in terms of shortfalls in natural gas deliveries and the costs of wider adjustments to the gas and electricity networks. Finally, the benefits arising from a number of strategic, mitigating investments in facilities such as gas storage or expanded liquefied natural gas import capacity are assessed. Although a full cost-benefit analysis was not possible, efficacy is assessed in terms of the frequency with which disruptions would need to occur to justify the mitigating investments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As the field of special education (SE) examines issues related to supply and demand of SE teachers and faculty, an investigation of students currently enrolled in doctoral programs and doctoral graduates is an important perspective to consider. The results of two components of the Special Education Faculty Needs Assessment (SEFNA), focused on the aforementioned two populations, are described. Students enrolled in SE doctoral programs during the spring of 2009 ( n = 1,263) and graduates of SE doctoral programs between 1999 and 2008 ( n = 626) were surveyed about their educational backgrounds, experiences in applying to doctoral programs, doctoral programs and studies, postgraduation plans, postgraduation career choices, and background information. Results indicated that key predictors of doctoral students who become college and university faculty include the following: intent to pursue a faculty career, financial support (e.g., teaching assistantship, research assistantship, traineeship, fellowship), age when enrolling in a doctoral program, reduced time to complete the doctoral degree, and willingness to relocate after graduation for employment. Comparisons are made to results from the 2001 Faculty Shortage Study, a predecessor to SEFNA. </jats:p>",
