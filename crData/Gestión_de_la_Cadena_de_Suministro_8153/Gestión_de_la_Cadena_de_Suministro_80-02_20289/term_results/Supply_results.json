      "abstract": "<jats:p>Territories of polygynous male Bobolinks averaged higher percent cover of several forb species than did those of unmated males. Some differences were also found between territories of polygynous and monogamous males, but not in all years. These differences were associated with differing soil moisture conditions on the various male territories. Vertical density of all vegetation types, vegetation biomass, and grass height were not correlated with the number of females attracted to each territory. Observed vegetation differences do not explain why some territories attracted two females while others attracted only one. Caterpillars constitute a major component of nestling diet. Caterpillar densities were higher on polygynous male territories than on adjacent, physiognomically similar monogamous male territories in mesic habitat. They were also higher on polygynous male territories than on physiognomically similar bachelor male territories in dry habitat. Grasshopper densities were higher on polygynous male territories than on monogamous male territories in mesic habitat, but not at the time second—mated females selected territories. They were lower on polygnous male territories than on monogamous male territories than on habitat. The nesting success of second—mated females was lower than that of first—mated females primarily because of higher nestling starvation. It is concluded that polygyny occurs in Bobolinks because it enables females to breed in areas with more abundant food resources.</jats:p>",

Orioles responded in 1976 to the increased food supply by feeding on all life stages of the insect and by feeding late instar larvae and pupae to their young. The nesting density doubled in 1977, the 2nd year of the 2-year outbreak, but the caterpillar larvae died off before the orioles' chick-rearing period. The 1978 breeding density was back down to the level of 1976. Clutch sizes and body weights did not change despite the increase and eventual reduction in both food abundance and nesting density. Productivity was lower, and hatching failure and nestling death were higher, at the higher nesting density. </jats:p>",

Acreage allotments and marketing quotas appear to have destroyed the role of prices in allocating acreage between wheat and other crops during the years 1950 and 1954–64. Estimates were obtained using multiple regression analysis of time‐series data for the period 1948–74. This period was subdivided in order to take account of changing farm programs.</jats:p>",

Air that enters through the first pair of thoracic spiracles is carried first to the brain and then to the rest of the central nervous system. The air is expelled through the abdominal spiracles, so that there is a one-way circulation with diffusional exchange only in the blindly ending tracheae that enter the brain or ganglia. Once inside a ganglion, the tracheae branch profusely to end in a mass of fine tracheoles through which gaseous exchange takes place. The densest tracheation is in the neuropile areas, where the spacing between tracheoles is about 17 μm. In the optic lobes, where there is order to the synaptic arrangement of a neuropile, there is a matching orderliness of the tracheation. Cortical areas, which contain the cell bodies of neurons, have only a sparse tracheation. It may be concluded that it is the processes associated with synaptic transmission that require the most immediate access to the sites of gaseous exchange.</jats:p>",

Economists have often pointed out that such a policy leads to over‐investment in water supply facilities; a superior approach would maximize some measure of net benefits incorporating price‐sensitive demand. Using a dynamic programming model to depict an investment problem in Rhode Island, we find that ambiguities about how to incorporate price‐sensitive demand into a decision framework may make such an approach as arbitrary as the requirements approach. Water conservation responses may be a function of other social parameters than water price; if so, variations in these social parameters should be regarded as economic alternatives to water supply investments.</jats:p>",
