It provides a broad definition of supply chain, the drivers for integrated supply chains design, and current challenges in global supply chains. More importantly, this chapter provides the reader an insight into aligning corporate strategy, people mindset, process design, and technology in designing an integrated supply chain. A real-life example in the health care industry is provided. The example aims to give readers the identification of supply chain bottlenecks, the right methodology to map the AS IS processes, and the redesign of simplified supply chain processes. Finally, the guidelines for supply chain management implementation issues, such as vendor selections and team building, are addressed.</jats:p>"

Business continuity has focused on the business processes of individual organizations. A business process in a supply chain can involve multiple discrete organizations. This chapter draws on the approaches used by individual organizations to implement continuity and apply them to a supply chain. Typically, supply chains are dependent on IT and workplace for staff. Both can be impacted in a disaster. If one member of a supply chain is affected, this will affect other organizations in the supply chain, magnifying the impact of the initial disaster. The chapter also examines the issues of service supply chains as well as physical goods. A practical outline plan for the development, auditing, and testing of a continuity plan for a supply chain and its management within an overall supply chain governance is proposed as a starting point for supply chain managers.</jats:p>"

Almost every company in China is undergoing some form of transformation in order to reduce costs and to maximize profits. It is easy to understand the position of the supply chain in a Chinese company, because taking good control of a supply chain means acquiring quality materials at lower costs, so that the cost of unit products will be dramatically reduced, and maximum profits will be made. However, in China, this is easier said than done. This chapter discusses the current status of supply chain management (SCM), challenges and solutions to SCM critical issues, and the role of technology used in SCM in China.</jats:p>"

Well-developed supply chain management often brings with it improved buyer-supplier communication processes, and we consider the impact of these not only from an intersector point of view, but also from a cross-sector viewpoint. The particular perspectives of the small business within a supply chain structure and of the supply chain customer are examined in detail. We conclude that information sharing is a critical component of business success both inside and outside the supply chain structure. However, while globally and at the large business level, both development and implementation of such technologies have mushroomed, smaller enterprises have tended to be left behind to cope as best they can with multiple pressures to conform.</jats:p>"

The widespread implementation of supply chain management induced companies to move beyond national borders and be enticed by the global competition in business. Applying supply chain management overall in organizations, companies generally considered it successful in managing their supply chains. However, some of them have not reached the magnitude of improvements or the desired results ascribed to supply chain management. With supply chain concerns and problems related to some basic companies’ infrastructures, the supply chain knowledge and operational skill affected the effectiveness of supply chain practices and performances. In this research, we studied the infrastructures enhancing the success of supply chain implementation that influence supply chain performance. The author adopts three categories of infrastructure as the critical success factors of supply chain implementation: man, machines, and management. The EQS is used to analyze the data collection. A total of 114 pieces of data were completed, and the result shows the significant relationship of operational infrastructures and the success of supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Driven by the need to attain even greater corporate competitive advantages, many organizations already have reengineered their internal processes, and the focus has shifted to their trading partners. With network connectivity, supply chain integration is now the core strategic competence that enables many companies to act as one. he development of an integrated supply chain by way of the Internet is one of the most important business trends in today’s e-business practices. This chapter focuses on the development of an object-oriented enterprise business blueprint for e-supply chain inter-enterprise process integration. The approach described here will illustrate how the enterprise applications can be developed and woven into the very fabric of business practices by using object-oriented techniques. In contrast to an isolated IT system, this approach allows business processes to permeate different organizations, and communication in this system becomes process-to-process oriented.</jats:p>"

However, the dynamics of the organization and the market make this challenging. In particular, the procurement function is a crucial link between the sources of supply and the organization. With most organizations spending at least one-third of their overall budget to purchase goods and services, procurement holds significant business value. Emerging technologies, especially e-procurement, are promising to change the picture of traditional procurement processes. However, the implementation of e-procurement is facing significant reengineering and change management challenges. This study identifies four main challenges in e-procurement implementation: business process integration, technological issues, value creation, and change management. The major challenge among them is change management. Critically, leadership is one of the primary requirements to make the change successfully.</jats:p>"

Since product price and flow interactions are inherently embedded within it, the TD-SCNE problem is formulated as a variational inequality (VI) model. A three-loop-nested diagonalization method, along with a specially designed supernetwork representation, then is proposed and demonstrated with a numerical example. In equilibrium, for each time-dependent retailer agency or demand market, the product prices of transactions are the same and minimum, no matter when or where the product comes from, which is a realization of the Wardropian first principle. The proposed framework can be extended with minor modifications to other TD-SCNE-related equilibrium problems.</jats:p>"

ISCM solutions allow organizations to automate workflows concerning the execution and analysis of planning, sourcing, making, delivering, returns handling, and maintenance, to name but a few. Many of today’s ISCM systems use primarily Web technology as the supporting infrastructure. Undoubtedly, the electronic (Internet-based) ISCM systems deliver the enterprises with a competitive advantage by opening up opportunities to streamline processes, reduce costs, increase customer patronage, and enable thorough planning abilities. However, there has been significant customer backlash concerning the inability of software vendors to deliver easy integration and promised functionality. Although various researchers have suggested strategies to overcome some of the failures in operating ISCM systems, there appears to be a lacunae in terms of architectural investigations in the analysis stage. The methodology proposed in this chapter seeks to resolve these gaps and provides a fundamental framework for analyzing ISCM systems.</jats:p>"

It discusses various constraints of present-day supply chain systems resulting from their roots being in logistics management and suggests an alternative next-level paradigm of a customer-centric matrix model. This chapter further demonstrates how this model would add value to the customer by taking the example of a healthcare information management system. The chapter also delves into the limitations of and anticipated issues and challenges in implementing the suggested model. Finally, the chapter hints at some broad directions for future research and action in the field. Emergent behavior is what happens when an interconnected system of relatively simple elements begins to self-organize to form a more intelligent and more adaptive higher-level system (Johnson, 2001).</jats:p>"

Technology has become the enabling factor for corporations to share information externally and to improve material flow within the supply chain. Many benefits can be realized from an integrated supply chain environment, including improved customer relations, cost reductions, and increased competitive advantage. Despite the potential benefits, there are many factors that lead to failed integrated supply chain implementations. Many of the major factors that lead to failure are not due to technological reasons but rather to the failure of the project team to recognize the complexities of the implementations of integrated supply chains. This chapter introduces the Interaction Approach methodology as a framework for analyzing supply chains in the hope of improving the design, development, and implementation of integrated supply chain environments.</jats:p>"

In particular, the application of mobile technology in Supply Chain Management has drawn widespread attention from researchers and practitioners who endorse adaptive and agile supply chain processes. This chapter discusses the applications of mobile technologies in various areas of supply chain management and the potential benefits of those technologies along the dimensions of reduced replenishment time and transactions and billing cycles. Among other discussions, the role of mobile procurement, inventory management, product identification, package tracking, sales force, and field service automation technologies is highlighted. To substantiate the basis for adopting mobile technologies for supplychain management, different market drivers for mobile applications are exemplified and applied to the three macro-level processes of supplier relationship management, internal supply chain management, and customer relationship management; a resulting typology of mobile supply chain management applications is presented.</jats:p>"

The authors present a model based on risk pooling through preventive lateral transshipment as a method for improving the responsiveness of not‐for‐profit core business practice of redistributing donated products in order to increase revenues. The model considers a three‐echelon structure consisting of three collection centers, one sorting and disposition center, and three retail stocking locations. The ensuing simulation indicates a favorable response of the model. Results indicated that while the daily average inventories slightly increased, the frequency of lost sales significantly decreased, thus offering the potential increased revenues.</jats:p>",

Further, implications of various factors such as economic, politico‐legal, technical, socio‐cultural, competition, demographic are also highlighted.

The target costing process considers the voice of the customer, incorporates earlier supplier involvement and concurrent engineering, utilizes cross‐functional teams, and focuses on creating a good or service that is both desirable and affordable to the customer and profitable to the producing organization. Unlike previous studies, which have focused on Japanese firms, or used single case studies, this paper uses the findings from case studies of 11 organizations actively engaged in the target costing process. This paper explores how the target costing process is used in practice in the United States, comparing it with the popular theoretical model of target costing. It helps shed light on to target costing practices of U.S. and other Western firms, and highlights the often overlooked role of the purchasing function in successful target costing efforts.</jats:p>",

Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland have developed the “Global Supply Chain Game” (GSCG). A specific instance of the game is called the “Distributor Game,” centered on globalization and the real-time supply chain. The GSCG differs from many existing business learning games in that, as opposed to being turn-based and locked in on demonstrating a single phenomenon (i.e., the bullwhip effect), it simulates a real-world experience by operating on a continuous clock with ongoing events and responses to individual decisions. The decision-making processes of the distributors in the game are controlled by human players. To confront the human players with a complex and dynamic environment, suppliers, markets, and competing distribution centers are represented by computer-controlled actors. The Distributor Game has been tested at the Robert H. Smith School of Business in seven courses since January 2005. The beta-tests include four MBA classes, two Executive MBA classes, and a single undergraduate class. Each class has been consistent in its approval of the game as a tool in simulating the complexities of a global supply chain and facilitating learning about how to successfully manage this environment.</jats:p>",

Moreover, most studies of TCO have been conducted in manufacturing firms, with little or no TCO research directed toward service organizations. This research presents the results of a study conducted at a leading vehicle glass repair and replacement organization. The results show how TCO information can be used for strategic decision making regarding the allocation of volumes. This information can also be used in the identification of improvement areas for preferred suppliers by introducing a limited number of key performance indicators that have a significant impact on the TCO of supplier offerings. The paper highlights some of the trade‐offs required in designing such a model. It fills an existing literature gap that allows service organizations to better understand the development and implementation of total cost measurement systems.</jats:p>",

Organizations that did not have a global presence or access to international markets could create Web sites to offer products/services to a new customer base, and companies that were already internationally entrenched could make their products easily accessible. However, developing a process to deliver products in a timely fashion and ensuring availability of items is still a challenge. This chapter explores the impact of telecommunications, customer relationship management (CRM), and supply chain management (SCM) and its impact on meeting customers’ expectations, regardless of location. We also address the challenges, advantages, and future trends in each of these areas. Finally, this chapter provides suggestions to help companies implement strategies that will effectively overcome the challenges of globalization.</jats:p>"

The principal goal is to design security into the supply chain rather than seek to mitigate consequences after the fact. Redesigning supply chains to make them robust and resilient can help avoid and mitigate the impact of disruptions, whether from security breaches or other causes. Such efforts require collaborations with partners across the supply chains and with governments. The short-term costs of such security measures can be balanced against the long-term gains from improved supply chain performance and improved customer relations.</jats:p>",

The basic idea of RFID is a tiny computer chip placed on pallets, cases, or items. The data on the chip can be read using a radio beam. RFID is a newer technology than bar codes, which are read using a laser beam. RFID is also more effective than bar codes at tracking moving objects in environments where bar code labels would be suboptimal or could not be used as no direct line of sight is available, or where information needs to be automatically updated. RFID is based on wireless (radio) systems, which allows for noncontact reading of data about products, places, times, or transactions, thereby giving retailers and manufacturers alike timely and accurate data about the flow of products through their factories, warehouses, and stores. </jats:p>"

Next methods for evaluating the acquisition of a connection with the producer of electricity are explained. The simple classical approach to the problem and the real options approach are described. The real options approach is considered to be the most correct, providing the most realistic results. Then there is an example of a calculation for a company, and certain values for the prices of deviations are calculated and shown. Finally, a comparison of the results is made, and their consequences for the decision process are explained. </jats:p>"

The main idea is to show how the performance of the supply chain can be improved with the integration of various tiers in the chain. Integration is prerequisite for effective sharing and utilization of information between different companies in the chain. Simulation-based methodology for measuring the benefits combines the simulation of business processes with the simulation of supply and demand. The theoretical findings are illustrated with the case study of procurement process in a petrol company. Old and renewed business process models are shown. The changes in lead-times, process execution costs, quality of the process and inventory costs are estimated.</jats:p>"

The effects of a hydrodynamic sequencing (flocculation–break-up–reflocculation–break-up–reflocculation) on the evolution of aluminium–bentonite floc size distributions and structure are investigated by image analysis in a Taylor–Couette reactor. The flocculation phenomena analysed in this study mainly occur in the viscous subrange, with floc size below the Kolmogorov micro-scale. The high sensitivity of steady-state floc size distribution to initial floc size distribution (elementary particles or flocs formed issuing break-up stages) is highlighted. Reversibility or irreversibility of agglomeration and break-up phenomena are discussed in terms of floc history and hydrodynamic stress. Finally, the hydrodynamic conditioning for aluminium–bentonite flocs is examined.</jats:p>",

A deficiency of vitamin A interferes with the development and differentiation events necessary for maintaining intestinal architecture. A deficiency of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, pantothenic acid, thiamin, niacin, or riboflavin interferes with cellular proliferation and diminishes the size of the villi. However, the gut is not the most sensitive indicator of a deficiency. Some nutrients, including long-chain fatty acids, carotenoids and vitamins A, D and E, modulate regulatory pathways of systems involved in intestinal homeostasis and health, including the immune system. By shifting the balance of regulatory processes, the dietary levels of these nutrients change gut health, sometimes for the good and sometimes to the detriment of the bird, depending on the pathogen milieu. Enteric infections markedly diminish the absorption of many micronutrients, especially the fat-soluble vitamins. The decrease in absorption may be related to: (i) decreased intestinal integrity and function due to pathology inflicted by the pathogen; (ii) increased rate of passage of digesta through the intestines; or (iii) as an integral part of the inflammatory response to the pathogens. Thus, micronutrient nutrition can affect gut health, but gut health can also affect micronutrient nutrition.</p>"

It debunks commonly held assumptions of conservative economic policies centered on the obsession that tax cuts led to greater productivity and prosperity. These fundamentally flawed policies are setting the United States up for a major economic downturn in the near future. The 21st century knowledge economy requires a fundamentally different approach to boosting growth than simply cutting taxes on the richest investors. The alternative is not, however, to resurrect old Keynesian, populist economics as too many Democrats hope to do. Rather, as Rob Atkinson makes clear, our long-term national welfare and prosperity depends on new economic strategy that fits the realities of the 21st century global, knowledge-based economy: innovation-based growth economics.</p>"

Different supporting technologies are emerging, and many are already available on the market. The adoption of these technologies is hampered by the fact that organizations constantly face new requirements, constraints and demands. Recent research has shown that service-oriented architectures and its supporting technology, Web services, can address many major issues encountered in complex supply chains. However, one of the largely unsolved issues is the orchestration of the variety of Web services in the supply chain. This chapter presents an investigation on orchestration of supply chain business processes using portals and Web service technologies. The portal-based orchestration concepts were carried out in a project for supporting end-to-end supply chain logistics in the United States Department of Defense. A second supply chain study looked at the added value of Web service orchestration. </jats:p>"

The practice of e-commerce and the business trend of mass customization force both manufacturers and retailers to shorten cycle time by managing GSCs more effectively. Successful applications of GSCs, such as that by Dell Computer, have been widely discussed and publicized in the supply chain literature. However, the physical distribution of GSC execution is recognized as its weakest link and can result in inefficient and unreliable product delivery. The collaborative integration with global third party logistics (3PL) to execute physical distribution dictates the success of any GSC application. This article introduces an application of logistic collaboration, namely collaborative transportation management (CTM), which is a new business model that includes the carrier as a strategic partner for information sharing and collaboration in a supply chain. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article reviews current research and practice of knowledge management (KM) and inter-organizational learning in supply chain networks. Knowledge management is the organizational process for acquiring, organizing, and communicating the knowledge of individual employees so that the work of the organization becomes more effective (Alavi &amp; Leidner, 1999). Knowledge management is an increasingly important process in business organizations because “managing human intellect—and converting it into useful products and services—is fast becoming the critical executive skill of the age” (Quinn, Anderson &amp; Finkelstein, 1998). Grover and Davenport (2001) state that KM becomes “an integral business function” when organizations “realize that competitiveness hinges on effective management of intellectual resources.” Grover and Davenport also argue that knowledge management works best when it is carried out by all the employees of the organization and not just KM specialists. Business organizations frequently partner with other firms to complement their core competencies. To collaborate effectively, partner firms have to communicate with each other information about business processes as well as share ideas of how to design or improve business processes. This phenomenon of knowledge sharing across organizational boundaries is called inter-organizational learning (Argote, 1999). Knowledge management, we posit, is necessary to facilitate inter-organizational learning and direct it in a way that supports the organization’s overall objectives. Supply chain systems are an example of business networks. Supply chains involve not only multiple corporate entities but also organizational units within a single organization. We present practices used in business organizations and networks of businesses to manage the information and knowledge sharing processes using the context of supply chain systems. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Picture this. The year is 2025. A customer is watching a new razor blade advertisement on interactive TV. The customer clicks to approve the purchase. When the order is received by the vendor, demand forecasting systems match customer experience data and integrate parameters—frequency of usage, preference of color, style of hand grip, language spoken by the customer, font style for customer’s name to be engraved on the razor, and so forth—into the Global Integrated Supply Chain Systems (GISCS) process. The next interaction is the customer receiving the order with a six-month supply of blades in the shortest possible time at a very affordable price. This will truly represent the process of thought to fulfillment in one click. This chapter explores the role played by demand forecasting for the net age—an age where customers can be anywhere and wants to have their needs addressed the moment they think about them. The organization that can fulfill the needs of these individuals in the easiest, fastest, and most cost-effective way will win their business. Such organizations will win over their competition and, in the process, reap profits. Any error in the thought to the fulfillment of the supply chain will result in a dissatisfied customer and, in all probability, loss of future businessto the competition. Meeting the demands of an anywhere-anytime environment requires more than just-in-time Supply Chain Management (SCM). It needs to move to the next level to what we call just-in-mind SCM. Demand forecasting for just-in-mind SCM requires the organization to do global thinking and local linking. The global thinking helps to forecast the demand, and local linking helps to fulfill it. The chapter helps the reader to understand the challenges faced by organizations in forecasting demand in the net age, gives real-life examples of these challenges, provides solutions for addressing them, and takes a look into the future.</jats:p>"

The effect of colloidal suspension pretreatment by EF on membrane fouling was measured by flux decline at constant pressure. An EF cell was operated in batch mode and comprised two flat sheet electrodes, an aluminium anode and stainless steel cathode, which were immersed in the treated suspension, and connected to an external DC power supply. The cell was run at constant current between 0.06–0.2A. The results show that pre-EF enhances the permeate flux at pH 5 and 6.5, but only marginal improvement is observed at pH 8. At all pH values cake formation on the membrane surface was observed. The differences in membrane behavior can be explained by conventional coagulation theory and transitions between aluminium mononuclear species which affect particle characteristics and consequently cake properties. At pH 6.5, where sweep floc mechanism dominates due to increased precipitation of aluminium hydroxide, increased flux rates were observed. It is evident that EF can serve as an efficient pretreatment to ultrafiltration of colloid particles.</jats:p>",

A supply chain usually extends from the source of raw material to end customers, consists of many components, and performs many functions. The components and functions have to be integrated in order to manage the flow of material, information, and finances from the source of raw material to end customers efficiently and at minimum cost. Further, a supply chain has a life‐cycle that is associated with the life‐cycle of the product(s) it supports, exists in an environment that impacts it, is dynamic, and has a purpose and objectives. With such aspects, a supply chain might better realize its potentials if it is viewed and treated as a system. This paper demonstrates the characteristics of systems inherent in supply chains and their implications on their design, and the ability of the systems engineering approach to the design of systems to benefit their formation. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management represents new business philosophy and includes strategically positioned and much wider scope of activity in comparison with its \"older brother\" - management of logistics. Philosophy of the concept of supply chain is directed to more coordination of key business functions of every link in distribution chain in the process of organization of the flow of both goods and information, while logistic managing instruments are focused on internal optimum of flows of goods and information within one company. Applying the concept of integrated supply chain among several companies makes the importance of operative logistics activity even greater on the level of one company, thus advancing processes of optimum and coordination within and between different companies and confirms the importance of logistics performances for the company?s profitability. Besides the fact that the borders between companies are being deleted, this concept of supply chain in one distribution channel influences increasing of importance of functional, i.e. traditional business managing approaches but instead it points out the importance of process managing approaches. Although the author is aware that \"there is nothing harder, more dangerous and with uncertain success, but to find a way for introducing some novelties (Machiavelli), it would be even his additional stimulation for trying to bring closer the concept and goals of supply chain implementation that are identified in key, relevant, modern, theoretical and consulting approaches in order to achieve better understanding of the subject and faster implementation of the concept of supply chain management by domestic companies.</jats:p>"

In high-head large-sized plants, a small turbine unit can be adopted as pressure relief installation, converting the energy of water into electric power. At the same time, a stable water pressure can be achieved for the water system at the exit. In this paper, a hydropower plant is taken as an example. This scheme is suitable for the main water supply system and its operation is simpler than the pump system. The present study is of practical value to many high-head plants.</jats:p>",

Much recent research has addressed increasing dietary amino acid density to optimize growth and tissue accretion rates of modern commercial broilers. Increasing amino acid density, especially early in the bird's life, results in improved live production and carcass traits, resulting in increased profitability. However, supplying amino acids in excess can be costly and increase nitrogen excretion, whereas limiting their supply can result in suboptimal yields and economic returns. Essential amino acid (i.e. threonine, isoleucine, valine, arginine and tryptophan) experimentation with respect to their effect on broiler live performance, carcass traits and health is discussed. Although feeding deficient levels of isoleucine, valine and arginine suppressed some aspects of the immune system, fortifying these amino acids to levels above surfeit was without effect on immune system measurements. Our findings suggest that the threonine, valine and isoleucine requirements for functionality of a normal immune system do not exceed needs for growth. Arginine, however, has vast metabolic functions related to immunity and further testing is warranted to determine if its need for health is higher than that for growth in commercial broilers. Although the dietary supply of amino acids is critical for good growth and tissue accretion, marginal limitations or excesses do not seem to impact bird health. Future amino acid research via early feeding and <italic>in ovo</italic> may result in early growth and health benefits.</p>"

Remedial efforts will need to focus on appropriate solutions for such locations. Coagulation with Moringa spp. seeds has been proposed as a sustainable option for water treatment for low-income locations due to the many other uses of the Moringa tree. Yet, its application is not limited to particle separation. A survey of the databases of WOK (Web of Knowledge) and CSA (Cambridge Scientific Abstracts) identified studies utilising Moringa spp. seeds as a coagulant. Although the majority of the studies were of laboratory or household applications, there were also reported trials in pilot- and full-scale treatment trains. Moringa spp. seed extracts were assessed as primary coagulants, co-coagulants (with aluminium sulfate) or secondary coagulant aids (flocculants). Turbidity reduction efficiencies vary according to the source water characteristics, coagulant preparation technique, and seed type. Treatment benefits of coagulation with Moringa spp. seeds are objectively assessed and have been contrasted with practical considerations in view of its sustainable application.</jats:p>",

The minichannel is of 1 mm square cross section with a water droplet growing at the top wall and air coming in through the channel inlet. This is a typical situation encountered in the gas flow passages of a PEM fuel cell. The excess water generated in the membrane due to the fuel cell reaction diffuses through the gas diffusion media and enters the gas supply minichannel passages where it gets entrained in the flow. The excess water needs to be removed quickly to prevent flooding of the membrane and gas flow passages which stops the fuel cell operation. The complete Navier-Stokes equations along with continuity equation are solved using the SIMPLER method. The liquid vapor interface is captured using the level set technique. The droplet grows due to flow of water at its base and at the same time is dragged due to the air flowing over it. The droplet growth and its departure are studied for different values water flow rate, incoming air flow rate and contact angle. The droplet departure is found to be hindered by excessive water flow rate and increase in surface wettability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper we develop a model of food safety regulation that considers the employment of a differentiated food market with two types of government certified quality standards: a minimum standard and a higher one.  Individuals, heterogeneous in their susceptibility to food-related health risks, choose which safety-grade of food to consume based on price and their vulnerability.  The model is then extended to the case where consumers misperceive their susceptibility to health risks associated with food consumption.  The theoretical presentation is followed by an application of the model to examine campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis caused by consumption of beef, pork, and chicken.  The paper demonstrates that the benefits from multiple quality standards hinges fundamentally on the distribution of vulnerabilities across the population and the associated distribution of population health risks for a given level of food quality.  Uniform standards are generally preferred to differentiated ones under either stringent or lax regulations on population health risk.  If the population distribution of vulnerabilities is unimodal and consumers misperceive their vulnerability, the value of a differentiated policy will depend on which quality standard is attracting the majority of consumers.  The empirical results confirm the importance of the population distribution of vulnerability on the relative desirability of single versus multiple quality standards.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The chemical enhancement of gravel (or roughing) filtration with coagulants, i.e. direct (gravel) filtration, has been proposed as a pre-treatment alternative for slow sand filters. However, studies have frequently focused on the efficiencies of the pre-filters in terms of reduction percentages. The effectiveness of the pre-treatment on the subsequent slow sand filtration is not usually cited or even evaluated. By incorporating a pilot-scale slow sand filter in our trials, both aspects of the pre-treatment process were assessed: efficiency and effectiveness. In terms of turbidity reductions, our results demonstrated that chemically enhanced pre-filtration was substantially more efficient (93.2 to 99.5%) than conventional pre-filtration (50.6 to 79.3); this was also observed in terms of reductions in the level of other parameters (i.e. thermotolerant faecal coliforms and dissolved organics). Yet, the use of a coagulant can have a negative impact on the slow sand filtration run.</jats:p>",

The smart device takes advantage of the ultrasonic standing wave, which was generated by the operation of a piezoceramic PZT patch installed in the smart device. The details of the device design including the electro-acoustical modelling for separation and PZT transducer are described. Based on this design, the separation device was fabricated and evaluated. In the experiments, an optical camera with a zoom lens was used to monitor the position of interested particles within the separation channel layer in the device. The electric impedance of the PZT patch bonded on the separation device was measured. The device shows a strong levitation and separation force against 50 μm diameter particles mixed with water at the separation channel in the device. Experimental results also showed that the device can work with both heavy and light sand particles mixed with water due to the generated standing wave field in the separation channel.</jats:p>",

This has resulted, amongst other things, in challenges to supply chain management in terms of cost pressure and demands for short-term availability of the goods. Considering that an increasing number of goods will be “on the road” (on rails, on ship, in the air) for an appreciable percentage of the life-cycle, there is an urgent need to bridge the information gap between the automated systems at the factory sites and the storage control systems at the destination sites. This chapter reports on a system solution that has been developed by T-Systems’ Solution and Service Center Ulm / Germany, within the Service Offering Portfolio “Embedded Functions”. The system solution has been gained as a synergy effect of connecting mobile communication solutions with Auto ID Services. It is presented here and discussed in the context of online surveillance during transportation, providing both downstream batch tracking, as well as upstream traceability. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Outfall discharge to seawater is generally used as a practical means of wastewater disposal in many coastal cities. However, deposition of solid pollutants from the wastewater on the seabed would affect the benthic communities. In the present study, both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were carried out on the role of particle coagulation in the transport and sedimentation of sewage solid materials in marine waters after outfall discharge. Actual sewage samples were collected from two treatment plants in Hong Kong for the experimental study. A flocculator-imaging system was developed for characterization of the particle size distribution (PSD) dynamics during flocculation and dilution of sewage particles in seawater. The system consisted of an external flow-through cell, a microscopic CCD video recorder and an image analyzer. The laboratory results demonstrated that coagulation played an important role in regulating the transport of solid pollutants in marine waters. Flocculation of 30–45 min could shift the PSD considerably, transforming small particles to larger, fast-settling particle aggregates. With a growth in particle size by flocculation, the average settling velocity of the sewage particulates increased by a factor of 2 or more. In addition to the laboratory study, a mathematical model was developed to simulate the transport dynamic of wastewater particles in seawater after outfall discharge. The results of numerical simulations compared well with the experimental observations. Both laboratory and simulation results suggest the important role of coagulation in the transport and sedimentation dynamics of sewage particles in marine waters, especially in the early phase of outfall discharge. As a result, suspended solids from the wastewater discharge would deposit more closely in the vicinity of the outfall sites.</jats:p>",

Breakthrough links many factors, such as filtration flow rate and flow rate changes, temperature, chemical dosing, raw water quality, etc. These factors can affect floc strength, which has been recognized as one of the most important factors in filter efficiency and particle breakthrough, related to Cryptosporidium outbreaks. This research aims to investigate particle breakthrough related to temperature and chemical dosing. Experiments were conducted to establish the relationship between temperature and chemical dosing changes to floc strength and particle breakthrough. The temperature was set at a series range as 5 °C, 15 °C and 25 °C. Each was combined with a series of Al dose changes. A laser particle counter was installed to assess the particle breakthrough online. ζ potential and turbidity were measured before (after coagulation) and after filtration. The results show particle breakthrough is influenced significantly by temperature and dosing. Particle breakthrough increased rapidly at lower temperatures but at higher temperatures it reduced at the same coagulant dose. With coagulants, even at low doses, particle breakthrough reduced significantly. There is an optimal dose in filtration; the optimal dose gives a ζ potential equal to about zero.</jats:p>",

In addition, participants at each workshop discussed the experiences of two utilities, one in electricity and one in water, with the intention of extracting common lessons applicable to different types of network utilities rather than specific to a single sector. The workshops provided the opportunity for utility managers and IDB staff to present their experiences. The second workshop also included regulators.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A prototype energy-harvesting thermoelectric generator (TEG) was designed and fabricated and it is being tested to provide power for wireless sensors used in the health monitoring (monitoring of temperatures, vibrations, strains, etc) of Navy shipboard machinery. TEGs are rugged, reliable, solid-state devices that convert heat directly into electricity without any moving parts. The TEGs designed in this project utilize the heat transfer between shipboard waste heat sources and ambient air to generate electricity. To satisfy the required small design volume of less than one cubic inch, Hi-Z Technology, Inc. (Hi-Z) is using its innovative Quantum Well (QW) thermoelectric technology that provides a factor of four increase in the conversion efficiency, and a large reduction in the design volume over the currently used bulk bismuth-telluride thermoelectics. QWs are nanostructured multi-layer thin films. These wireless sensors can be used to detect cracks, corrosion, impact damage, and temperature and vibration excursions as part of the Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) of the Navy ship machinery. The CBM of ship machinery can be significantly improved by automating the process with the use of self-powered wireless sensors. These power-harvesting TEGs can be used to replace batteries as electrical power sources and to eliminate tethered wires and cables, thus significantly reducing the installation and maintenance costs. The very first QW TEG module anywhere was just successfully tested (it produced electricity from heat). It remains to package this module with thermal insulation in the housing and heat sink, and to test this entire TEG device in a simulated thermal environment of a Navy gas turbine. Following this test, it is planned to attach this device to the surface of a gas turbine on a Navy ship and to test it in its actual environment, in conjunction with a wireless sensor. This power supply for wireless sensors can also be used in health monitoring of equipment in the nuclear and conventional power plants, process plants, and the monitoring of temperatures, vibrations and pressures of steam lines, etc. Hi-Z has chosen this small power supply as the first practical application of its emerging QW TEG technology. However, this technology can also be used on a much larger scale in, for example, recovering the waste heat from the exhaust of the truck and automobile engines, where the generated electricity can be used to eliminate the alternator and thus reduce the load on the engine, improve overall efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.</jats:p>",

Turbidity measurements have the disadvantage that breakthrough of small flocs cannot be displayed, because of the blindness regarding changes in the mass distributions. Additional particle volume distributions calculated from particle size distributions (PSDs) would provide a better assessment of filtration performance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Lab-scale experiments have been executed on a flocculation–filtration column fed with effluent from WWTP Beverwijk in The Netherlands. Besides particle counting at various sampling points, the effect of sample dilution on the accuracy of PSD measurements has been reflected. It was found that the dilution has a minor effect on PSD of low turbidity samples such as process filtrate. The correlation between total particle counts, total particle volume (TPV) and total particle surface is not high but is at least better for diluted measurements of particles in the range 2–10 μm. Furthermore, possible relations between floc-bound phosphorus and TPV removal had been investigated. A good correlation coefficient is found for TPV removal versus floc-bound phosphorus removal for the experiments with polyaluminiumchloride and the experiments with single denitrifying and blank filtration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Switch-mode hydraulic power supply is a hydraulic pressure converting unit made of some distributed hydraulic components, which can boost or buck hydraulic pressure steplessly, with low power loss (about 20%) and continuous flow-rate[1][2]. There are two types of switch-mode hydraulic power supply. One is pressure boost type and the other is pressure buck type. For the pressure boost power supply, changing of the pressure is realized through instantaneous braking of the large inertia load in the hydraulic inductor. For the buck power supply, changing of the pressure is realized through pulse flow-rate and low-pressure hydraulic complement (see \"Switch-mode Hydraulic Power Supply Theory\", 2005 ASME, IMECE-FPST No.79019)[2]. Because the output pressure is determined by the load, pressure buck is still requisite in pressure boost power supply. At the same time the system is unstable and with low efficiency. To deal with the problem that the pressure boost type switch mode hydraulic power supply is unfit for the low pressure load, the principle and the structure of a compounded switch-mode hydraulic power supply are proposed in this paper. In the compounded switch-mode hydraulic power supply, a pressure buck power supply is cascaded after a pressure boost power supply. At the same time, the output hydraulic capacitor of the pressure buck power supply and the input hydraulic capacitor of the pressure boost power supply are removed, which leads to the direct connection of the hydraulic inductors of the two power supplies Because of the same working principles of the two power supplies, one of the hydraulic inductors can be removed. Pressure boost and pressure buck are realized through the synchronically control of the two high - speed switch valves using PWM signal. No matter the outer load determined pressure is higher or lower than the pump pressure, compounded switch-mode hydraulic power supply can provide the proper power (not flow rate) matching actuators' consumption through regulating the duty ratio of the control signal. Therefore the optimal energy -saving is realized. Experimental research shows that the compounded switch-mode hydraulic power supply can realize a continuous bucking and boosting pressure with different duty ratio and the whole efficiency is at least 80%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A sizable proportion of women remain married well into late life and an increasing proportion of them participate in the labor force. Since women tend to marry men older than themselves and men tend to experience serious illnesses at younger ages than women, women frequently witness declining health in their husbands. This is likely to affect a wife's labor–leisure trade‐off in offsetting ways. Prior studies have not sought to disentangle the effect of a husband's poor health on his wife's reservation wage from the income effect of his ill health. We argue that, if we control for husband's earnings, the coefficient of husband's health in models of his wife's labor force participation (and hours of work) will reflect, in part, her preference over whether to decrease her labor supply to provide health care for her husband or whether to instead increase it to purchase this care in the market. However, husband's earnings are likely to be endogenous in these models due to unobserved characteristics common to husbands and wives. We find that the estimated effect of husband's health depends on whether we instrument for husband's earnings and on the health measure used. This is indicative of the importance of using a variety of health measures and controlling for husband's earnings, and their endogeneity, in future research on the effect of husband's health on wife's labor supply.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the geographical location of Oman in an arid zone, agricultural production depends fully on irrigation. The traditional irrigation systems (Aflaj, sing. falaj) supply more than one third of water for agriculture. Falaj is defined in the context of this paper as a canal system which provides water for domestic and agricultural uses. Oman has 3,107 active Aflaj producing about 680 Mm3 of water per year. The main objective of this study was to estimate the irrigation performance of Aflaj in Oman. Falaj al-Dariz and al-Nujaid were chosen as case studies. Both Aflaj are located in an extremely arid environment, where the rainfall is low and evapotranspiration is high. The study utilized an approach to estimate the irrigation performance of Aflaj by considering the falaj as a single unit of irrigation. The irrigation demand/supply ratio (D/S) was used in the analysis as a tool of evaluation. Date palm, the dominant crop irrigated by Aflaj, was selected for the analysis. In falaj al-Dariz the date palms were slightly under irrigated on a yearly basis. On a monthly basis, in winter, the D/S was below 0.6 and in summer it was above 1.0. On the other hand, falaj al-Nujaid was supplying too much water than the date palms needed all round the year. In winter the D/S ratio was as low as 0.25. Even in summer, the D/S ratio did not much exceed 1.0. </jats:p>"

Information and communications technology (ICT) has become an important element of 3PL competitive capability as it enables higher levels of supply chain integration. Recent industry developments have widened the technological gap between large and small 3PLs. This is critical particularly for those markets populated by a large number of small 3PLs such as the Italian logistics industry. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of ICT adoption in small logistics service providers. The focus of the study is the Italian 3PL market.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The methodology adopted in this paper is based on the action research framework and it is a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical findings (focus groups and surveys). Firstly, a literature review on ICT dissemination in the international and Italian 3PL industry has been carried out. Then, a field survey has been developed preceded by two focus groups. The empirical investigation examined a sample of 153 small Italian 3PLs on the base of a definition and taxonomy proposed by the authors.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The results provide a useful technological profile of the surveyed companies, as well as an analysis of the role of ICT in customising services and of the factors influencing ICT adoption.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>To give a more robust scientific justification of the survey results, it would be useful to carry out an additional large‐scale analysis including other countries with a high presence of small logistics service companies. Furthermore, a complementary case‐study analysis would be of help in defining the role of specific factors in different types of 3PL. Further investigations in this field are needed to better understand innovation paths, and how ICT can improve the competitive capabilities of 3PLs and of the wider supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Managers of small 3PLs can use the findings to set‐up guidelines for improving a company's technology innovation.

The gas business is supposed to be primarily a free market, with around 80% open to competition. In electricity, the market‐opening is much lower, at 30%. In practice, competition is less widespread than the above figures suggest, owing to the continued dominance of powerful state energy companies, which may have slowed down the growth of the gas and electricity businesses. Gas consumption, in particular, has grown much more slowly than was once forecast. At present, Turkey has contracted to buy more gas than it needs: but this situation may change soon after 2010, obliging Turkey to look for new foreign supplies.</jats:p>",

It can absorb the solar energy in the daytime and release the heat at night in winter. The solar radiation energy was gained by air solar collector, and the heated air was sent to the underfloor space of the room with ducts at daytime. Then the thermal energy was stored in the shape-stabilized PCM plates. The shape-stabilized PCM can keep the shape stabilized when PCM undergoes a phase change because it is microencapsulated by the supporting material. At night the heat energy stored in the PCM could be released into the room by the ductless air supply. The thermal performance of a room using such system was experimentally studied. The experiments show that the thermal comfort degree of solar buildings can be improved when applying shape-stabilized PCM suitably. The conventional space heating energy consumption in winter can be greatly saved. Besides, the experimental results provide the data for further modeling and simulation research of such kind of system.</jats:p>",

In a tubular flow reactor test, NOM removal after a 15 s contact time was almost the same as removal values attained at longer contact times. Laboratory-scale and bench-scale pilotplant ceramic microfiltration (MF) experiments with submicron PAC adsorption pretreatment were conducted to evaluate NOM removal and to examine the effect of the PAC on filterability. The laboratory scale MF experiment revealed that PAC adsorption pretreatment could be accomplished with a detention (2.4 s) that was much shorter than the time expected from the adsorption kinetics test. This result suggests that adsorption pretreatment for MF could be accomplished by adding the submicron PAC directly into the feed line to the membrane and that installation of a special PAC contactor before the membrane unit is unnecessary. Although micron PAC rather than submicron PAC was used unintentionally in the pilot plant experiment, these PAC showed much better NOM removal than normal PAC, and no adverse effects, such as transmembrane pressure buildup and reversible or irreversible membrane fouling, were observed.</jats:p>",

However, difficulties arise when coagulation is not optimised for the dominant particle. This paper investigates the surface characteristics and floc properties of three common systems– natural organic matter (NOM), algae and clay – in order to aid understanding of the coagulation/flocculation process. It was demonstrated that charge density and specific surface area are important parameters with respect to coagulant demand for charge neutralisation for all systems. However, extracellular organic matter (EOM) affected the coagulant demand of algae to the extent that it appears that the presence of EOM could dominate the coagulation process. Controlling the zeta potential of the systems prompted improved particle aggregation and hence removal efficiency in all cases. Floc growth profiles revealed that algal flocs required five times the flocculation period to reach a steady-state floc size compared to NOM and clay and on exposure to increased shear were much weaker. Despite similarities between algae and NOM in terms of organic content and coagulant demand, the fact that algae is a dynamic, biological system as opposed to an inert system creates numerous problems for the coagulation/flocculation process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To cover the increasing demand of on-board electrical power and for further reduction of emissions, the conventional auxiliary power unit (APU) shall be replaced by a fuel cell system. The main components are a compressor-turbine unit, a kerosene reformer, and the fuel cell. Polymer exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM-FC) are favoured because of their currently advanced level of development. During in-flight operation, the inlet conditions of the PEM-FC system must be kept constant in order to avoid mechanical and thermal damage of the membrane and to ensure low levels of pressure fluctuations in the reformer section. A centrifugal compressor is chosen for pressurization of the system. The advantages of turbomachinery are low specific weight, high efficiency, and good controllability by inlet guide vanes and/or adjustable diffuser vanes. To drive the compressor, a radial turbine is used so that the air supply system resembles the turbocharger for a combustion engine (Fig. 1). A steady state thermodynamic evaluation of the entire system is carried out to identify an optimal system configuration that covers the large range of pressure, temperature, and humidity of ground operation of the aircraft in various regions on the earth as well as take-off, cruise, and landing. A catalytic combustion chamber is located between the PEM-FC and the radial turbine. In this combustion chamber, the hydrogen which is not used in the fuel cell is used to raise the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) and thus the mechanical power delivered by the turbine. To overcome an additional pressure loss of the reformer section, which occurs in the anode stream, an additional low-pressure-ratio compressor is used. The result is a highly thermally integrated PEM-FC system with three centrifugal turbomachines.</jats:p>",

Two lab-scale SMBRs with different solids retention time (SRT) were operated and the variation of bound (or extractable) EPS in the activated sludge floc was observed in terms of total organic carbon and protein concentration of the extracted EPS solution. Experimental results showed that as SRT decreases, the amount of bound EPS in the activated sludge floc becomes higher. EPS had a positive influence on specific cake resistance to accelerate the membrane fouling. In order to clean the fouled membrane, de-ionized water flushing, chemical cleaning using sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), and the combination of water flushing and chemical cleaning were performed. The flux recovery rate was calculated to quantify the cleaning efficiency and a microscopic image using scanning electron microscopy was taken to visualize the cleaning effect. It was found that the water flushing was not highly effective at removing the EPS formed in the cake layer. The chemical cleaning of membrane by 5,000 ppm NaOCl for 3 hours could be more effective to eliminate EPS.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Management of interconnected manufacturing units, supply networks, constitutes a timely, but challenging problem in Physics, Operations Research and Mathematics, as it carries very rich dynamics. At the first stage, a very well understanding of the underlying mechanisms and interactions within the hierarchical construct of such networks is required. For this pursuit, a more realistic approach is proposed in this paper, which takes into account the presence of naturally existing transportation delays of supplies in between individual production units. In general, the presence of delays in the dynamics imports another source of instability, which needs to be addressed. However, it is well-known that a thorough stability analysis against delays carries complications, thus it is non-trivial. We present analytical techniques to tackle such difficulties, surfacing allowable transportation delays within the supply network that guarantees stable stock levels. This, in parallel, enables the selection of production rates assuring the supply network to operate in a stable regime. Moreover, we show that under certain parametric settings, the supply network dynamics may become highly sensitive against the presence of delays, which in turn, initiates an undesirable phenomenon called bullwhip effect. We present case studies demonstrating the bullwhip effect and suggesting parametric selections to avoid this undesired behavior within supply networks.</jats:p>",

We present a model in which the basic mechanisms at work in the textbook model may be substantially altered by an important feature of illegal marketsviolence that creates inheritable heterogeneity along a dimension that both determines relevant production cost and imposes externalities on other suppliers.  Dealers frequently make use of violence and threat of violence in the normal course of trade.  A seller who is particularly effective in the use of violence may face lower enforcement costs than other dealers and generate an external cost borne by those sellers.  Together these features generate a number of counter-intuitive policy implications.  For example the arrest of a particularly violent dealer reduces external costs borne by other dealers.  The net effect is a possible reduction in costs for the marginal dealer and hence a reduction in price.</jats:p>"

However, services are unique and since unused services do not generate revenues they present a lost ‘economic rent’ for organizations that are not part of the network of service providers and, as a result, not a part of the customised bundle of services. The dynamic discovery of a bundle of individual services from such a network that meets the unique needs and constraints of the mobile user requires intelligent agent technology. Such agent technology would match personal needs of the user with the available services in a cost-efficient manner. This chapter provides a mechanism to create dynamic service bundles from ad-hoc user requirements using intelligent agents. The authors apply this technique to a mobile commerce environment and illustrate the composition of user-specific service “bundles” by intelligent agents that represent the interests of the m-commerce user. Such agent-based architectures provide users customized solution ‘bundles’ that reduce their cognitive burden, while improving the utilization of resources for organization that are part of the service provider network. </jats:p>"

Nous distinguons en particulier un système d’imposition individuelle et un système d’imposition jointe. En spécifiant un modèle unitaire flexible, du type de ceux utilisés dans la littérature empirique, nous obtenons des estimations assez différentes selon le régime fiscal utilisé pour simuler les données. Nous trouvons aussi des différences substantielles dans les ajustements de l’offre de travail prédits à la suite d’un changement de régime fiscal. Nos résultats illustrent également le fait que le calibrage des paramètres d’une réforme fiscale peut être lui-même fortement affecté par l’utilisation d’un modèle unitaire lorsque les données sont générées par un modèle collectif. Enfin, nous discutons les distorsions qui affectent l’analyse de réformes fiscales en termes de bien-être dans une telle situation. Les résultats suggèrent que des efforts accrus devraient être consacrés à la recherche sur l’estimation de modèles collectifs dans les situations complexes auxquelles on est confronté lors de l’analyse de réformes fiscales. Ceci inclut des contraintes budgétaires donnant naissance à des ensembles de budget non convexes, ainsi que la modélisation de solutions en coin pour les offres de travail des conjoints.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine the competition between procurement auctions and long-term relational contracts that emerges from the increased usage of electronic marketplaces. Procurement auctions create supply chain efficiencies by selecting the least costly bidder, and long-term relational contracts ensure the quality of the procured products or services when these have nonverifiable attributes. The following two-layer supply chain model is analyzed: Suppliers of an industrial part with nonverifiable quality trade with several manufacturers that utilize that part in the production of an end product. A price-based reverse auction is used for the procurement of low-quality parts, and a relational long-term contract is used for high-quality parts. A formal model of the competition between the two procurement models identifies conditions under which the two coexist, and conditions under which one will push the other out of the market. Market and product parameters that increase the relative economic appeal of the relational contract are determined. It is demonstrated that the competition from the auction market can either facilitate or undermine the relational contract compared with a benchmark case of a monopolist supplier. This implies that competition between the two procurement models plays an important role in the supply of high-quality products. </jats:p>",

We have previously indicated the importance of optimizing agitation strength GR and time TR in rapid mixing tanks in order to decrease filter head loss and treated water turbidity in direct filtration. In the present study, we employ a batch-type coagulation experimental apparatus that incorporates a high-sensitivity particle counter, where the particulate concentrations are measured continuously after injection of coagulant, in order to clarify the fundamental coagulation and microfloc formation dynamics. Specifically, it is shown that, after injection of the coagulant, coagulation and microfloc formation occurs through distinct periods: an agglomeration preparation period, followed by an agglomeration progression period, and then finally an agglomeration stabilization period, and that optimization of the GR value is the most important consideration, although both the coagulant concentration and GR influence the time at which agglomeration begins in the preparatory period, the time at which agglomeration stabilizes after the progression period, and the concentration of initial particles with diameters of 1–3 μm at completion of agglomeration.</jats:p>",

For both situations sludge was sampled from different tanks of the pilot (predenitrification, denitrification, nitrification and membrane tank). All sludge samples and the supernatant of sludge from the membrane tank were filtered under exactly the same conditions with a filtration characterisation unit. Besides this all samples were subdivided in different fractions (supernatant, 0.45 and 0.03 μm, 500, 100, 10 and 1 kDa) and analysed for their EPS concentrations (proteins and polysaccharides). The results show that the filterability of the sludge changes with the sampling point and differs between the two influent loading conditions. Contrary to DWF conditions, for cheesy influent conditions sludge from the membrane tank has better filterability than its supernatant.

Investigation of nanoparticles in Lake Zurich by microscopic methods showed that relatively large numbers of clay particles are present with different Al/Si composition and sizes. The small-sized clay particles (ca. 80 nm) tend to build aggregates with a size of 500–1,000 nm. In karstic spring water, the particle count and size distribution is strongly dependent on the precipitation rate. At high precipitation rates, channel flow occurs in the subsoil, leading to high particle counts among the whole size range and a larger average particle size. In membrane treatment by microfiltration and ultrafiltration this leads to membrane fouling due to pore blocking and cake formation, the latter being associated with the presence of organic compounds.</jats:p>",

Better-managed companies have been looking for best-in-class planning practices to control their inventories and achieve superior results. Collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR) may be the next great thing in inventory and vendor management and a source of advantage for such companies. CPFR is a set of business processes that are established and empowered by a formal agreement to cooperate on strategy, tactics, and execution by resolution of exceptions. Retailers and suppliers are moving to improve their supply chain through this process. Gradually, they are recognizing the advantages of web-based cooperation to develop a single, more accurate demand forecast and devise a plan for delivering product to meet customer demand. The present article highlights the role of CPFR in supply chain management of an organization. </jats:p>",

A manufacturer can sell either early, i.e., well in advance of the selling season, or late, i.e., close to the selling season. This paper examines the impact of information asymmetry, retailer sales effort, and contract type on the manufacturer’s sale-timing decision. We find that if information is symmetric, demand is not influenced by sales effort, and the contract specifies that the price paid is linear in the order quantity, the manufacturer prefers to sell late. This result extends to the case where the retailer exerts sales effort during the selling season. However, if the retailer exerts sales effort prior to the selling season or has superior information about market demand, the manufacturer may prefer to sell early. We characterize the manufacturer’s sale-timing preference in these settings, providing clear conditions under which the manufacturer prefers to sell either early or late. We show that the retailer, manufacturer, and total system may be hurt by the retailer’s having higher-quality information. </jats:p>",

Elevated CO2 increased total plant biomass and N for each treatment and decreased allocation to roots, leaf N concentrations and stomatal conductance. Leaves had less negative leaf δ13C values under low water supply associated with decreased stomatal conductance and increased leaf N concentration, which decreased the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 concentration. The δ15N value of the supplied nitrate (4.15‰) was similar to the value for Phalaris leaves (4.11‰), but Cape Gooseberry leaves were enriched (6.52‰). The effects of elevated CO2 on leaf δ15N values were small, with Phalaris showing no significant change, while Cape Gooseberry showed a significant (P &lt; 0.05) decline of 0.42 ‰. Variation in δ15N values was unrelated to stomatal conductance, transpiration, differential use of N forms or denitrification. Plants with low foliar N concentrations tended to be depleted in 15N. We suggest that changes in N allocation alter foliar δ15N values under different CO2 and water treatments.</jats:p>"

The theory of strategic politicians suggests that by reducing legislators' opportunity costs of running for higher office, term limits should push some legislators into congressional campaigns they would have foregone had a long-term legislative career been an option. To test this hypothesis, I analyze data from congressional elections held from 1992 through 2004 in the 15 states where term limits were operative in 2004. I find that sitting state legislators who have hit the limit of their state legislative service are more likely to run for Congress than those who are eligible to serve additional terms, whether those terms are limited or not. However, there is no statistically significant difference between the congressional-candidacy rates of legislators whose re-election eligibility is limited, but not exhausted, and legislators whose terms are not limited. By increasing the supply of experienced challengers, term limits may increase competition in elections for non-term-limited offices and, consequently, the quality of representation provided by those elected.</jats:p>"

The pastures included different varieties of subterranean clover, annual medic and lucerne, and these were compared with ryegrass-dominant pasture, which represented the experimental control.\nMore productive legume pastures generally resulted in greater accumulation of soil mineral N at sowing of the following cereal at both Elmore and Speed; however, at Birchip, soil mineral N remained high under all treatments. At Elmore and Speed, significant (P&lt;0.10) positive relationships were observed between available N at sowing and subsequent wheat and barley production. Cereal grain yield at Birchip was not associated with available N at sowing.\nThe quantities of soil mineral N available at sowing (152 kg/ha) of the cereals were in excess of crop demand at Birchip. At Elmore, the soil mineral N supply (83 kg/ha) was below that required for wheat and barley to reach their water-limited potential yield (20 kg grain/mm of growing season rainfall). However, at Speed, the supply of soil mineral N (63 kg/ha) was sufficient to achieve the water-limited potential grain yield and to produce malting-grade barley, but not sufficient to elevate wheat grain protein concentrations above 11.5%.\nIn environments with low soil N levels, the amount of residual N following short-term pastures increased the availability of N to following cereals. Whether this is sufficient to satisfy subsequent crop demand is largely determined by water availability in the year of cropping. In cases where available N is already high, short-term pasture phases may have little effect on increasing crop production.\n</jats:p>"

We present a model in which the basic mechanisms at work in the textbook model may be substantially altered by an important feature of illegal markets—violence that creates inheritable heterogeneity along a dimension that both determines relevant production cost and imposes externalities on other suppliers. Dealers frequently make use of violence and threat of violence in the normal course of trade. A seller who is particularly effective in the use of violence may face lower enforcement costs than other dealers and generate an external cost borne by those sellers. Together these features generate a number of counter-intuitive policy implications. For example the arrest of a particularly violent dealer reduces external costs borne by other dealers. The net effect is a possible reduction in costs for the marginal dealer and hence a reduction in price.</jats:p>"

There is strong evidence of first‐mover advantage in wholesale price contracting which is amplified when the chain is coordinated using two‐part tariff contracts We analyze cooperation and the implications of leader location in uncoordinated chains Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the entire sequence of successive contracts when assessing the performance of a supply chain.

Research is concentrated on the design of the system, not only decreases the sound pressure level to an affordable range but also provides appropriate air flow rate for the fuel cell with the maximum output of 500W. At the same time, it has small volume; outer diameter of 80mm and total length of less than 150mm; which enables its installation into the limited space of the robot system. The muffler was designed to have concentric pipes to form a dual muffler which corresponds to the intake and outlet of the pump, respectively. DC motor was assembled inside the inner muffler to save the space. Developed device is thought be a satisfactory air supply system for a fuel cell.</jats:p>",

Cogshall) quality and maturity were studied to find reliable indicators that take fruit physiological maturity into account and to establish a compromised harvest date according to the market. Fruit size and density varied with regard to the harvest date and assimilate supply. Changes in total soluble solids and titratable acidity were well correlated with concentrations of major soluble sugars and organic acids. Potassium concentration was increased according to harvest date. Metabolic changes occurred at 126–133 and 133–140 days after full bloom in fruit subjected to non-limited and stress conditions of assimilate supply, respectively. During this stage, sucrose and malic acid concentrations strongly increased, whereas those of starch and citric acid decreased according to the leaf-to-fruit ratio treatment. Synthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and malonyl ACC, and a rapid increase in the respiration rate were observed during this period. The shortage of assimilate supply delayed the onset of maturation and reduced its intensity. Storage quality of mango cv. Cogshall may be influenced by assimilate supply since the K+ to Ca2+ ratio and the pulp dry matter content, in particular, were enhanced in fruit from the 100 leaf-to-fruit ratio treatment. Results for mango cv. Cogshall suggested that total soluble solids, sucrose, and malic/citric acid ratio can be used as physiological indices for mango fruit, whereas fruit fresh mass, density, and pulp dry matter content can be useful indicators for when to harvest fruit. It appeared that 133 days after full bloom was an optimal harvest date for fruit grown under non-limited conditions of assimilate supply, for a market where the time between harvest and consumption of fruit is short.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Continued improvements in home grown forage consumption are needed to support the long-term profitability of the dairy industry in southern Australia. Most home grown forage currently comes from perennial ryegrass pastures, which have significant limitations in the southern Australia environment. These limitations threaten future productivity gains, and we therefore consider opportunities for using other plant species. Data on the production of alternative perennial grasses, brassica summer crops, C4 summer crops and winter cereals grown for whole-crop silage are limited and generally show large variation in yields between sites and years. Simulation models suggest that, once the base ryegrass pasture is well-utilised, incorporating complementary forages can return $70 - $100/ha extra operating profit for every additional tonne of home grown forage DM consumed per ha. Double cropping (winter cereal or annual ryegrass followed by a summer crop of turnips or maize) and summer-active pastures such as tall fescue show particular promise. Further information is required on how to integrate these forages into whole farm feeding systems to realise the additional profit with manageable business and environmental risk.

Off‐farm labor supply of both spouses declines in response to increases in permanent farm income. Farm wives also reduce off‐farm labor supply in response to positive transitory farm income shocks. Consequently, one mechanism farm households use to smooth their goods consumption when facing fluctuating farm income is to modify their consumption of leisure. Ability to smooth goods consumption does not imply the absence of liquidity constraints among farm households unless leisure consumption is also smoothed.</jats:p>",

This period includes the shift from seedling heterotrophy to autotrophy. Linear density of branches in the basal region ranged from ~38 cm–1 at the base to ~10 cm–1 beyond 10 cm. Branch roots in the first ~8 cm were produced before assimilate was available. Branch length decreased from ~26 mm at 1 cm along the primary root to ~8 mm at 10 cm from the base. Without the cotyledon, branch root density in the basal region was ~10 cm–1 and roots were short (~5 mm). Beyond 8–10 cm both measurements matched those of intact seedlings. Dark-grown seedlings had basal branch root densities higher than those without cotyledons but none beyond 10 cm. There were more and smaller diameter sieve tubes in the basal region of the primary root. These decreased distally in number but had larger diameters where branches formed after assimilate was available. Proliferation of basal branch roots in very young seedlings can have major advantages for successful seedling establishment in the field and could be screened for without difficulty.\n</jats:p>"

One technique is the integrated supply chain. However, this process has not met with success for all companies, leading some managers to consider the appropriateness of an integrated supply chain. This dearth of success could be attributed to the lack of scholarship to guide managers in their efforts to formulate and then implement their integrated supply chain strategies. In an effort to fill this gap, our paper draws on resource dependency theory and the realities of ever-increasing information technology sophistication as enablers of successful supply chain integration,resulting in the creation of our model to guide managers throughout this process. Through a Web-based survey, 329 responses were collected and analyzed through a structural equation modeling technique using LISREL to confirm the relationships in the model.</jats:p>"

The long core life with conditions of the excessive reactivity of 2 %Δk/k, the reactivity shutdown margin of 1 %Δk/k and the negative coolant temperature reactivity coefficient is attained for the case of D2O concentration of 60 % with 10 % enrichment gadolinia (Gd2O3) doped fuel rods. This D2O core has a shorter core life 4.14 years than the original light water (H2O) core 4.76 years, while it needs a larger core size. However, changing the D2O concentration on the way during the burn-up shows a possibility of extending more the core life than that of the original H2O core.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Value chain is a network of activities performed by firms for creating and delivering superior customer value with distinction. It has two parts, namely; supply chain and demand chain. A supply ch;ain refers to assets, information, ;and processes that provide supply. A demand chain deals with all assets, information, and processes that define demand. In the era of globalization and information technology, firms are under tremendous pressure to m;aximize ;and enhance their market responsiveness capabilities. In this endeavor, they need to look and appraise their value chain continuously. The focus of this paper is to an;alyze the contributions of supply chain in the optimization of supply side of the value chain, and its limitations in the demand side responsiveness in the prevailing market scenario. This paper identifies that there are at least six reasons behind failure of supply chain in the present turbulent market scenario, where superior market responsiveness capability is the key for success. These are management of influence of front-end micro environmental factors, inventory management for value delivery, demand fulfillment, pull marketing strategy, demand-side IT initi;atives, ;and channel relationships. Finally, this paper advocates that firms should emphasize on management of demand chain and supply chain should be aligned with it for meeting the requirements of superior market responsiveness. </jats:p>",

Sarg.) seedlings to three nutrient concentrations and two shoot vapour pressure deficits were measured. Both species gained dry mass at high and medium nutrient treatments throughout the experiment, but not at low nutrition. Low nutrition gave highest ratios of projected leaf surface area to total root length in both species. Douglas-fir geometry differed from that of hemlock, with longer interior link lengths, particularly at the lowest nutrition. Douglas-fir showed greater numbers of exterior–interior links than hemlock. More links were observed at medium and high nutrition than at low nutrition for both species. Exterior–interior links increased over time for the two highest nutrient treatments. Significant topological differences were observed between species, the lowest and two highest nutrient treatments, and high and low vapour pressure deficits. Both species showed herring-bone root architecture at the lowest nutrition. This architectural configuration became more pronounced in hemlock seedlings grown under higher vapour pressure deficits. Faster-growing Douglas-fir had a dichotomous architecture at medium and high nutrition that was not influenced by increased vapour pressure deficits. Douglas-fir topology appears to be adapted to exploit soil nutrient patches while hemlock appears to rely on efficient exploitation of soil volume.</jats:p>"

For this reason, so-called pump diffusion flash mixing (PDFM) has been proposed, and PDFM is one reasonable method to quickly disperse the hydrolyzing metal salts. In this study, we attempt to understand the difference of removal characteristics of natural organic matter (NOM) between PDFM and conventional rapid mixing (CRM) in a water treatment system, and to enhance the removal of NOM through the improved mixing process. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and turbidity removal by PDFM was higher than those by CRM, while specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) of treated water by PDFM was higher than that by CRM. NOM was more effectively removed by PDFM compared to CRM due to quick and uniform dispersion of coagulants. Though the hydrophilic fraction found as major faction in bulk NOM from Han River water is enriched in haloacetic acid precursor sites as compared to hydrophobic fraction, the hydrophilic fraction was more effectively removed by PDFM rather than CRM. Therefore, PDFM is effective and innovative process in reduction of DOC and DBPFPs as well as turbidity, and requires lower coagulant dosage compared to CRM.</jats:p>",

The case study provides detailed analysis of the company, its merchandise and its experience of implementing ESCM. The analysis begins with an examination of current business practices, human resources, the information system, and issues related to customers, suppliers, products, and inventory control. Using this information, the case study examines how the company processes and fulfils sales orders, updates its inventory, and handles the receipt of ordered goods. The case concludes with a summary of the shortcomings of the company’s current SCM system and the main challenges the business faces in implementing ESCM. This study forms part of a larger ongoing investigation being conducted into SCM within small and medium-sized businesses in North-West Tasmania.</jats:p>"

However, price spreads in excess of marketing costs can also be due to marketing firms' exercise of market power. In settings where both imperfect competition and marketer risk aversion are plausible, a modeling framework must be sufficiently general to accommodate both types of behavior. This article develops and estimates such a model in the context of fresh produce marketing and develops the implications for analysis of supply‐control programs. The model is applied to the production and marketing of Chinese cabbage in Taiwan and specifically to the analysis of supply‐control programs implemented in this industry by the Taiwanese government. The empirical results provide little support for the hypothesis that marketing firms exhibit risk averse behavior, but they do show that marketing firms exercise oligopsony power in procurement of the product from farmers, and that this power is positively related to the quantity supplied in each market period. This provides a heretofore unexplored impetus for supply controls intended to raise producer incomes. However, such controls are also rendered less effective by imperfect competition because marketing firms capture part of the benefits from supply reduction.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, the particle counter has been introduced in the evaluation and operation of the treatment system. However, research results on the relation among turbidity, particle counts and/or protozoa have not been concurrent with each other. Therefore, this study investigated the relation to improve performance evaluation of the sand filter so that the risk of protozoan contamination can be reduced. The study results verified that particle counts provide a better insight into the filtration process than turbidity alone. The counts of 4–7 as well as 7–14 μm, instead of total particle counts, can be used to monitor and operate the rapid sand filter effectively, as it has a better relation with Cryptosporidium. Also, the study results showed that the fine single-medium filter is more useful when targeting better water quality despite its low productivity, since it removes small particles more effectively than the dual-media filter. The latter is more useful when targeting better productivity. However, enough depth of sand layer of dual media filter with adequate filtration rate is required to not compromise water quality and productivity, as a shallow sand layer is highly likely to cause an early breakthrough.</jats:p>",

While the creation of relational capital within an organization is a relatively well identified concept in organizational research, comparatively little research exists on the inter‐organizational socialization processes that create relational value in supply chains. In our research, we extend theoretical models of group social conduits into this context, and develop a model that posits the impact of formal and informal socialization processes on the creation of relational capital between buyers and suppliers. Results from our study of 111 manufacturing organizations in the United Kingdom suggest that informal socialization processes are important in the creation of relational capital, which in turn can lead to improved supplier relationship outcomes. Formal bridging socialization conduits appear to play a lesser role in deriving these benefits.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The sub‐district hospitals or Upazila Health Centers (UHCs) had earlier been upgraded to provide basic emergency obstetric care (BEmOC). This project undertook activities designed to improved the quality of care in the facilities which included team‐building among providers, case reviews and a stakeholders' committee. CARE introduced a community mobilization intervention, which included birth planning, community support systems for funding, transportation, blood donation etc. for care of women with complications. <jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>: The intervention area received all interventions. The only intervention in the comparison area was the upgrading of the health facilities to provide basic EmOC. There were no interventions in the control area. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: Met need increased by 13% in comparison area but nearly 24% in intervention area. There was no substantial change in the control area. At the end of the project, knowledge of obstetric danger signs was much greater in intervention area than in the other 2 areas. <jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>: We conclude, therefore, that the best results are achieved through a combination of facility improvement, quality of care activities and targeted community mobilization activities.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Indicators of sustainability and environmental performance can be useful for comparing modes, discerning trends, and formulating appropriate policies. This paper considers the performance of U.S. transportation service sectors through use of 1992 and 1997 benchmark input–output models. Use of these models permits assessment of not only the direct performance of the sectors but also the supply chain impacts required for operation of the transportation sectors. Consideration of indirect impacts is critical for assessment of the overall costs and impacts of particular products or services. Six transportation service sectors (air, rail, water, truck, transit, and pipeline) are examined. Economic impact, energy, greenhouse gas emissions, and toxic emissions are examined. The transportation sectors use large amounts of energy, both in total and per dollar of output and on a per service basis. Pipeline and water transportation have particularly large energy requirements per dollar of output, likely reflecting higher energy intensity and lower labor intensity in these modes. Truck transportation is the most energy intensive of the freight transportation modes per ton-mile of service, but it has a trend toward greater energy efficiency. For greenhouse gas emissions, truck, water, and air transportation have the highest emissions per dollar of output. Water transportation freight rates are sufficiently low that emissions on a per ton-mile basis would be correspondingly low. Finally, the supply chain (indirect) toxic emissions per dollar of output are highest for rail and pipeline transportation. There is considerable work to be done to improve the overall sustainability of the different transportation modes. </jats:p>",

Designation could result in modification to or delay of residential development projects within habitat boundaries, generating concern over potential housing market impacts. This paper draws upon a large data set of municipal‐level (FIPS) building permit issuances and critical habitat designations (CHDs) in California over a 13‐year period to identify changes in the spatial and temporal pattern of development activity associated with CHD. We find that the proposal of the median‐sized CH results in a 23.5 percent decrease in the supply of housing permits in the short run and a 37.0 percent decrease in the long run. The results indicate the proposal of CH acts as a signal that all development in that FIPS will be more costly. We also find that the impact varies across the two periods in which CH is designated and by the number of years relative to when CH was first proposed.</jats:p>",

Notwithstanding some adaptations of the technique, a small percentage of operations fail, prompting research into the anatomical background and clinical relevance of the procedure.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Hypothesis</jats:italic>: That an alternate blood supply may prevent complete necrosis of the testis after spermatic cord transection.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Objective</jats:italic>: To establish the prevalence of the problem in normal and cryptorchid stallions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>: In a preliminary study, the spermatic cords of 8 normal stallions were ligated and transected at different sites and in various manners. Five weeks later the testes were removed and the vitality of both the testes and epididymes was evaluated. In a prospective clinical trial, intra‐abdominal spermatic cord transection was performed in 241 cryptorchid and normal stallions. In cases of surgical failure, the testes were removed and histology performed.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: Examination of the specimen removed from the 8 animals of the preliminary study revealed that all epididymes were completely or largely spared. All except one testis were completely necrotic. In the patients that underwent surgery all abdominally retained testes (n = 123) were necrotic, while 5 out of 88 inguinally retained and 8 out of 236 normally descended testes had partially survived. The pattern of survival differed between inguinally retained and normally descended testes. The epididymes of these 13 horses were (largely) vital. The (partial) survival of the epididymes and inguinally retained testes was ascribed to an alternate blood supply via anastomosing vessels derived from the cremasteric artery. A tributary from the external pudendal artery was considered responsible for the partial survival of normally descended testes.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions and potential relevance</jats:italic>: After intra‐abdominal transection of the entire spermatic cord, 5.6% of inguinally retained and 3.4% of normally descended testes failed to become completely necrotic, as a result of an alternate blood supply via the cremasteric and/or external pudendal artery. Therefore, laparoscopic castration without orchidectomy cannot be recommended as a trustworthy method for castration of inguinal cryptorchids and normal stallions.</jats:p>",

In this work, zeta potential and particle size distributions of clay and algae particles, which are the important parameters affecting their removal efficiency, were measured to investigate the behavior and removal characteristics of particles under various conditions. The results showed that the zeta potential of blue-green algae was more sensitive to treatment conditions than clay, and it fluctuated highly with coagulant dosage, suggesting that the control of zeta potential is important for effective removal of algae particles. On the other hand, the range of particle size distribution that remained from the preliminary sedimentation tank was generally smaller than for flotation. However, the zeta potential of the remaining particles was either close to the isoelectric point or positive, and the particles were not so hard to remove for that reason. In the final analysis, for simultaneous removal of clay and algae particles, a sufficient zeta potential difference must be formed not only for algae particles but also for small clay particles from the sedimentation tank in the dissolved air flotation process.</jats:p>",

Thirty-eight children aged 2–8 years participated in a survey of fluoride intake. Twenty-one out of 38 children lived in an area in which the community water fluoride concentration was an average of 0.555 ppm (moderate fluoride area: MFA), and 17 lived in a low fluoride area (LFA), which ranged between 0.040 and 0.131 ppm. To measure the fluoride intake, diets were collected with a duplicate-diet technique. The fluoride concentrations in each sample were measured using the diffusion technique of Taves and the electrode technique. Meanwhile, after clinical examinations for dental caries and fluorosis, 228 subjects aged 13–15 years were selected for analysis from the same communities. The mean DMFT in the MFA was significantly lower than that in the LFA. The severest grade of dental fluorosis observed was ‘very mild’ according to Dean’s fluorosis index in both areas. The total daily fluoride intakes were 0.0252–0.0254 mg F/kg/day in the MFA and 0.0126–0.0144 mg F/kg/day in the LFA. Differences in the fluoride concentration of drinking water in this study were reflected in the fluoride intake from the diet in a typical Japanese diet.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Increasing forest parcelization has raised concerns about tract-size economies and sustainable timber supply. We explored this issue by examining the logging sector and forest ownership in northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Using 2004 survey data, we found that 48% of logging firms demonstrated a near exclusive reliance on nonindustrial private forests (NIPFs). NIPF-dependent firms derived 87.5% of their stumpage from this ownership, whereas nondependent firms exhibited a significantly more diversified stumpage supply distributed among public (42.6%), industrial-corporate (33.3%), and NIPF (24.0%) sources. Additionally, NIPF-dependent firms operated on significantly fewer, smaller, and less intensely harvested timber sales, and they were more likely to harvest small tracts profitably. There were no significant differences in the forest products harvested or overall firm profitability. We found statistical evidence that NIPF-dependent and nondependent firms organize themselves differently: NIPF dependency was negatively correlated with total number of employees, timberland area in the firm's wood basket, and firm location and positively correlated with owner age. Results suggest the impacts of parcelization on the logging sector are minimal. NIPF-dependent firms appear to have structured themselves to operate profitably; however, it is unclear how continued parcelization might influence these firms and the sector as a whole. </jats:p>",

The catchment area is mostly composed of limestonesof the Cretaceous and Palaeogene, with some dolomitic parts.Hydrogeological barriers are composed of flysch or Quaternarysediments, and most of them are “hanging” barriers, so that the karstwater can flow underneath. Many spelaeological features in the vicinityof the spring point to a typical karst conduit flowing under ground.This has been proven by tracer tests, because a connection exists tothe periphery of the catchment with an apparent velocity of 8.1 cm/s.The whole area is situated in the Mediterranean climatic belt, so theprecipitation distribution is quite unfavourable – summers are long,hot and dry. This is why the summer seasons usually end with seawater intrusion into the aquifer with a significant increase in chlorideion concentration. Since the spring is capped for water supply, there isa bulk monitoring system established. The data obtained were processed by means of multivariate analysis, and three main types of quality deterioration were recognized. The first is connected with pollutionfrom agriculture and inhabited areas without sewage, the secondrepresents occasional sea water intrusions, while the third relates toheavy rainfall events accompanied by turbidity and pollution. Togetherwith the other conclusions, these results should have a practical purpose primarily in the matter of water protection.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A decision model designed to help stakeholders quantify the productivity impacts of temporary closures of a container seaport on global supply chains is presented. Such closures have many potential causes, including natural disasters, labor disruptions and shortages, and security-related disruptions. Temporary closures result in highly variable product delivery lead times and thus increase supply chain inventory management costs. The decision model is a Markov decision process that determines an optimal inventory management policy and its resultant long-run average cost for a firm operating a supply chain that uses a seaport subject to unexpected closure. Since short port closures typically lead to ships waiting to off-load containers, a simple deterministic queuing approach is used to model port freight processing dynamics. The results of a numerical study indicate that the expected length of a seaport closure more negatively affects supply chain productivity than the probability of closure, for example, causing increases in expected supply chain inventory holding and penalty costs of up to 136%. Furthermore, supply chain firms that do not properly account for port closures during inventory planning can expect significant inventory holding and penalty cost increases, which in some cases eliminate positive operating income. The results indicate the importance of contingency planning and disruption management for all stakeholders, including private firms and public agencies. In addition, results of the study point to the economic importance of investment to increase the processing capabilities of highly utilized seaports immediately following a port closure, when resultant congestion is at its worst levels. </jats:p>",

These alternative pathways are mediated by three classes of bypass proteins: the type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases (which circumvent complex I of the electron transport chain), the alternative oxidases (AOXs; which circumvent complexes III and IV) and the uncoupling proteins (which circumvent ATP synthase). We have monitored the expression of all genes encoding respiratory bypass proteins in <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic> growing with different sources of inorganic nitrogen (N).

Similar results were observed upon switching between nitrate and ammonium in the absence of N stress. Nitrate signalling was found to be mediated primarily by the nitrate ion itself, whereas ammonium regulation was dependent upon assimilation and affected by changes in apoplastic pH. Corresponding alterations in alternative respiratory pathway capacities were apparent in seedlings supplied with either nitrate or ammonium as an N source and in mitochondria purified from the seedlings. Specifically, AOX capacity and protein abundance, as well as calcium‐dependent external NADH oxidation, were substantially elevated after growth on ammonium. The increased capacity of respiratory bypass pathways after switching from nitrate to ammonium was correlated to an overall respiratory increase.</jats:p>",

Comparison was made with the effect of duct ligation including the attached CL nerve as carried out in previous studies. In all animals, the contralateral, unligated left submandibular gland was used as a control. At different times (1, 2, 7, 14 and 21 days) after ligation, glands were removed and weighed. Tissue was fixed for morphological analysis and homogenized for biochemical assay of secretory proteins. After 21 days, ligated glands showed a significant decrease in wet weight compared with unligated glands. Weight loss was the greatest (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) in glands ligated with the CL nerve included. Light microscopy revealed that following ligation, an initial inflammatory reaction was followed by severe atrophy of acini and granular ducts. The atrophy was less severe when the CL nerve was not ligated. Secretory proteins were decreased from day 1 onwards following duct ligation in both groups. It can be concluded that most of the atrophy induced by duct ligation is independent of damage caused to the parasympathetic nerve supply, although the latter causes a greater atrophy presumably due to denervation.</jats:p>",

Feeding for 4 wk on an isocaloric‐sucrose or a hypercaloric‐fat diet increased plasma TAG in the fed condition by increments of 70 and 40%, respectively, and increased fasting insulinemia (approximately 3‐fold) compared with a starch diet. The fat diet impaired glucose tolerance and caused obesity, whereas sucrose‐fed rats maintained their normal weight. We analyzed the expression of genes that regulate the exogenous FA supply (LPL, FAT/CD36, FATP1), synthesis (ACC1), glucose (GLUT4, GLUT1, HK2, GRAT1, glycogen phosphorylase) or glycerol (glycerol kinase) provision, or substrate choice for oxidation (PDK4) in gastrocnemius and soleus muscles at the end of the glucose tolerance test. LPL, FAT/CD36, FATP1, PDK4, and GLUT4 mRNA as well as glycogen phosphorylase and glycerol kinase activity levels in both muscles were unchanged by the diets. Increased mRNA levels of GLUT1 (1.6‐ and 2.6‐fold, respectively) and GFAT1 (about 1.7‐fold) in gastrocnemius, and of ACC1 (about 1.5‐fold) in soleus, were found in both the sucrose and fat groups. In the fat group, HK2 mRNA was also higher (1.8‐fold) in the gastrocnemius. Both sucrose and saturated‐fat diets prompted hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipemia in rats. These metabolic disturbances did not alter the expression of LPL, FAT/CD36, FATP1, PDK4, and GLUT4 genes or glycogen phosphorylase and glycerol kinase activity levels in either analyzed muscle. Instead, they were linked to the coordinated upregulation in gastrocnemius of genes that govern glucose uptake and the hexosamine pathway, namely, GLUT1 and GFAT1, which might contribute to insulin resistance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the justification for the approach, details and results of the Main Generator Seal Oil System reliability enhancements on the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, SONGS. The SONGS, Unit 3 experienced substantial turbine damage in early 2001 after the turbine bearings lubrication oil supply failed. During a loss of off-site power incident, power was lost to the two AC powered turbine lubrication oil pumps due to a breaker failure in the switchgear and the DC powered emergency bearing lubricating oil pump failed to start due to a breaker trip. The SONGS turbine generators coasted down from full speed to a full stop without lubricating oil. This resulted in significant bearing, journal and steam path damage that required a four-month duration repair outage during a time period where electricity was in short supply in the State of California. The generator hydrogen sealing system remained operable during this event, however it was recognized during the event follow up investigation that this system had vulnerabilities to failure similar to the bearing lubrication system. In order to prevent a reoccurrence of this extremely costly event, SONGS has taken actions to modify both of these critical turbine generator systems by adding additional, continuously operating pumps with a new, independent power source and independently routed cables. The main challenge was to integrate the additional equipment into the existing lubrication and seal oil systems. The lubrication Oil System was the first system to be retrofitted and these results already have been presented. Reference 2. This paper provides the result of the reliability enhancements for the Main Generator Seal Oil System, which concludes the turbine/generator critical oil systems reliability improvements, performed by SONGS. It is worth noting that the design team discovered and corrected a number of other significant operational issues, which had been present from the early days and also learned a great deal of detailed information about this vital system during the project. The SONGS approach and findings are discussed in this paper, as well as a summary of the work performed. This technical paper will be of interest to utilities with a need to improve turbine generator reliability issues.</jats:p>",

Anhand von Fernsehprogrammen als einem Beispiel für ein Kollektivgut werden im Folgenden drei wesentliche Thesen entwickelt, die sowohl für die Theorie Natürlicher Monopole als auch für die Kollektivgut-Theorie von Bedeutung sind.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>1. Trotz unterschiedlicher Ausgangsprobleme beschäftigen sich die Theorie Natürlicher Monopole und die Kollektivgut-Theorie mit dem gleichen Phänomen der Rivalität, die der Isomorphie zwischen den Theorien bei der Regulierung/Finanzierung des Gutes entspringt. Das hier eingeführte Konzept der „ökonomischen Rivalität“ und die graphische Illustration einer normal verlaufenden Nachfrage nach dem Kollektivgut machen wichtige Konsequenzen dieser Isomorphie deutlich: Zum einen führt die Nicht-Rivalität im Konsum zum Entstehen eines Natürlichen Monopols, zum anderen können private Güter durch produktive Subadditivitäten zu kollektiven Gütern werden.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>2. Die in beiden Theorien herrschende Grenzkosten-Paradoxie ist lediglich ein Scheinwiderspruch, der sich mit Hilfe mikroökonomischer Überlegungen auflösen läßt.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>3. Gegenwärtig wird die Ökonomik, vor allem die Medienökonomik, von einer Grenzkostenpreis- Doktrin dominiert, die weder wohlfahrts- noch institutionenökonomisch nicht zu rechtfertigen ist.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The objective of this study was to restore a line of sheep that exhibits spontaneous X-linked factor VIII deficiency closely mimicking human hemophilia A. Six straws of frozen semen from an affected Alpine White male were obtained from Switzerland. In the first experiment the straw of semen thawed was of poor quality. Two ewes were synchronized for use as embryo donors (MOET) by means of CIDRs for 14 days and superovulated with declining doses of FSH (184 mg) twice daily for 3 days. PMSG (200 IU) was given with the final dose of FSH and 1000 IU of hCG 12 h post-CIDR removal. The ewes were surgically inseminated 24 h later. Oviducts were flushed 48 h post-insemination producing 13 unfertilized ova (UFO). Spermatozoa were used for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) utilizing oocytes collected from superstimulated ewes by laporatomy. These ewes were synchronized with CIDRs (15 days) and superovulated with a declining dose of FSH (204 mg) twice daily for 3.5 days. Utilizing 236 oocytes, ICSI produced 189 embryos, an 80% embryo/oocyte rate. Embryos were transferred surgically to the oviducts of 17 synchronized recipients. Recipients were synchronized using sponges (Ovakron; Heriot Agvet, Rowville, Victoria, Australia) containing 30 mg of flugestone acetate (14 days) and given PMSG (400 IU) at sponge removal, followed by 1000 IU of hCG 12 h post-sponge removal. Eleven recipients produced 17 lambs for a lamb/embryo rate of 8.9%. The straw of semen utilized for the second experiment was of higher quality. Three ewes were superstimulated for use as MOET donors, as above, with increased doses of FSH (228 mg) and PMSG (500 IU). Donors were surgically inseminated and oviductal flushes were performed 40 h post-insemination, yielding 19 UFO and 12 embryos for an embryo/oocyte rate of 38.7%. Embryos were transferred to four recipients, synchronized as above with an increased dose of PMSG (600 IU). These MOET recipients produced nine lambs for a lamb/embryo rate of 75%. Semen was used to produce embryos via in vitro fertilization (IVF) using oocytes collected from superstimulated ewes (as above with an increase of FSH to 252 mg). IVF produced 91 embryos from 247 oocytes for an embryo/oocyte rate of 36.8%. Embryos were transferred to 20 recipients 24 to 48 h post-fertilization. Seven recipients maintained pregnancy and produced 10 lambs with a lamb/embryo rate of 11%. ICSI was also utilized, producing 54 embryos from 98 oocytes, an embryo/oocyte rate of 55.1%. Embryos were transferred to eight recipients; none maintained pregnancy. Through the use of multiple reproductive technologies, 36 lambs (22 carriers) were produced from two straws of semen. Carriers will be bred back to their sire in a similar program to produce affected lambs.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge J. Liu and M. Ridha for their contributions.
