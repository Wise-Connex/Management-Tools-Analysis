Pair selection efforts are not required, and the temperature coefficient can be assigned beforehand through design calculations and a single output voltage adjustment. The circuit example shown is able to function with an input-output voltage differential of only a few tenths of a volt and its temperature compensation is effective between − 30° and + 85°C.</jats:p>",

Two of the systems offered additional storage capacity on the Potomac River. These systems were found to meet average daily water withdrawal requirements. A third system, the minimum storage plan, offered no new storage capacity but was found feasible if used in conjunction with pumping from the Potomac River estuary and/or accepting drought adjustment. The minimum storage plan was the least costly system in real terms. However, the most costly reservoir systems are favored by local water planners, because most of the reservoir costs would be shared by the federal government. Although the real costs of the minimum storage plan are less than those of the reservoir plans, it is not favored, because none of the costs are borne by the federal government. This study illustrates the inefficiencies that can be generated by current cost‐sharing policies.</jats:p>",

Recent studies indicate that this area is primarily responsible for water uptake and rehydration. Nine species representing four genera of terrestrial and aquatic Anura were dissected for comparison of vascularity in the pelvic area. Major differences in the ventral pelvic integumental vessels were found between aquatic and terrestrial genera. These variations are described, and names are suggested for previously unnamed vessels. Changes in vascularity are discussed and related to the literature on Anura pertinent to rehydration rates, tolerance of desiccation, resistance to desiccation, and habitat.</jats:p><jats:p>Data from this study and previous studies suggest a correlation among the parameters discussed and habitat. The suggestion is made that when species are classified as xeric, mesic, or aquatic on the basis of the habitat in which they live, their responses to rehydration, tolerance to desiccation, and vasculatity should be considered, as these characteristics more accurately represent the micro‐habitat.</jats:p>",

The techniques and results of a ten-year forecast for the demand for and supply of anesthesiologists and auxiliary personnel in greater Cleveland are discussed. Several regression models were used to forecast supply based on population, number of physicians, and the income per capita. The demand models were based on population, age and sex distribution projections, and historical data regarding operative and obstetrical procedures. The results of these “objective” models were then compared to forecasts under uncertainty generated by a panel of experts using the Delphi Method. Alternative states of health care delivery were investigated and implications for future anesthesiologist manpower requirements detailed. </jats:p>",
