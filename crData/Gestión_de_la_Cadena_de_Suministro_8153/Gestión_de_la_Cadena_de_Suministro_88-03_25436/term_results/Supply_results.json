Nearly all measures are relative — over time, across countries, and between systems; they should therefore be consistent and comparable. The main measures are: fill rate (broken down by subject, form and date); speed (broken down into the various processes involved in document supply); user satisfaction (because users' needs may not be articulated); and costs. There may be trade‐offs between different measures (eg speed and costs). Any measurement system must be practical. Most data will be collected by sampling, but well designed automated systems in future should enable better measures to be calculated with less effort.</jats:p>",

They have their own organizations, functions and tasks under their respective government departments. In China one of the major problems is that documents are not widely available. There is an obvious gap between the demands of users and their satisfaction. In view of China's present situation, interlending activities alone cannot cope completely with the problem of Chinese information needs. In the new situation following China's economic reformation, the structure of Chinese information users has greatly changed. To meet the increasing needs of the Chinese people, library and information systems must improve their methods of service and augment the scope of their service. Viewed as a whole, China needs to set up a nationwide document supply system in order to promote the supply of literature and the dissemination of information. The system may take a hierarchical form in which a number of regional systems are involved. Under the leadership of a central system, services would be provided not only to major scientific research and production and construction projects, but also to the general public at all levels of the country.</jats:p>",

Although some million patent specifications are published each year for approximately half that number of new inventions, confusion is in general avoided because of the influence of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which enables the 40 patent offices to work together in the cause of universal availability, to standardize their documents and to designate them uniquely. The somewhat complicated publication sequence and numbering systems of patents, both in the UK and overseas, are explained. There are many sources of supply for published patent specifications, both national and international, public and private sector, to meet varying needs, whether document or information‐centred. Amongst these are the patent offices (both national and international), regional sub‐offices, national technical libraries, depository centres and various private sector services. Finally, a reminder is given that the Science Reference and Information Service is itself a specialist both in the supply of patent documents and in information about them.</jats:p>",

The development of interlending in France and New Zealand is on very different lines and whether to join a national network or a local co‐operative is a problem faced by many: the solution is that probably both are necessary. Scandinavia has a long tradition of co‐operation and similar patterns have developed in each country. The results of a survey on document supply for business in Finland show that this is generally successful, with considerable reliance on international sources. The theory and practice of ILL in Tunisia differ considerably and the need for specialized document supply centres in Latin America is explored. Some of the problems of international financial limitations can be solved by a coupon system such as that proposed for AGRIS. The decision to introduce payments for ILL in Australia has caused much concern and a lot of anger and similar problems are now being faced in France with the restructuring of finances for universities. Statistical research into ILL is valuable but can cause problems unless written up well for a more general audience. Finally it is shown that document supply as an industry continues to grow throughout the world.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction The response of aggregate labour supply to changes in the real wage has been a question of interest to economists for some time. For example, the notion of a backward‐bending supply curve for labour is commonly known, though not universally accepted. The question is of more than academic interest; it has direct relevance to tax policy, because an income tax in effect lowers the real wage, which is then likely to cause people to substitute out of work into leisure. This article evaluates the aggregate labour supply curve from within a household production framework and finds that, under plausible circumstances, the aggregate labour supply curve is likely to be very inelastic. (The model here actually considers only a subset of the long‐run aggregate supply of labour. Long‐run questions of fertility are not addressed here, nor is the labour force participation rate, which might vary in the short run in response to a change in the real wage. This article considers only the work effort of someone who is already in the labour force.) For a case derived below, the aggregate labour supply curve is always perfectly inelastic, meaning that for proportional changes in the tax structure, the quantity of labour supplied will not be a function of the tax rate. (Gwartney and Stroup[1] give a good overview of the traditional arguments along with their own argument that an income tax increase must reduce work effort).</jats:p>",

Subjects were randomly assigned and individually tested in a 2 (High reactivity/Low reactivity) × 2 (Low rate of stimulus presentation/ High rate of stimulus presentation) × 2 (Choice/No Choice) factorial experiment with 15 subjects per condition. The two principal dependent measures were the total number of correct responses in a serial RT task and the post‐task levels of anxiety, anger, and curiosity. The major finding was that while the availability of control had a positive effect on both task performance and affect, its role was situation‐specific, i.e. limited to the difficult task. Most probably the availability of control masks the variability of reaction due to individual differences in reactivity. However, high‐reactives are still left with the residual stress of unresolved emotions. </jats:p>",

Supplemental food was provided on some territories, and the composition of eggs from control and food-supplemented territories was compared. Supplemental feeding had few effects on egg composition. Egg size – water content relationships differed between eggs from food-supplemented and control territories and there was a greater variability in yolk and shell mass within clutches from food-supplemented territories. These results show that food supply to the female can affect the composition of an egg relative both to other eggs in the same clutch and to eggs in other clutches. However, it is not clear whether the observed variation in egg composition would have an effect on the viability of the eggs. </jats:p>",

Starvation decreased Fru-2,6-P2 concentrations in all three muscles. The acute administration of insulin and glucose increased skeletal-muscle Fru-2,6-P2 in the fed, but not in the starved, state, but cardiac Fru-2,6-P2 was unchanged. Cardiac and skeletal-muscle Fru-2,6-P2 concentrations were unaffected by acute increases in fatty acid supply produced by the administration of corn oil plus heparin, or by acute decreases in fatty acid supply produced by inhibition of lipolysis. Differences in cardiac and skeletal-muscle Fru-2,6-P2 concentrations observed in response to starvation were not reversed by administration of glucose or glucose plus insulin, or by inhibition of lipolysis, even though changes in citrate (heart), acylcarnitine (heart) and glycogen (skeletal muscle) were observed. Concentrations remained low for at least 8 h after chow re-feeding, but the fed value was restored by 24 h.</jats:p>",

Additional experiments were conducted on two oligotrophic lakes in an effort to determine if N and P co‐occurred as limiting resources. Nutrient bioassay studies on water from one of these lakes indicated that N was in short supply among members of the phytoplankton community. Estimates of in situ N: P supply ratios in the lakes ranged from 18 : 1 to &gt;45 : 1, as well. Results of these experiments were consistent with limitation by N and P at times.</jats:p>",

Data were collected at fortnightly home interviews. Nutritional assessment was made twice a year. One hundred and thirty‐seven of the children died during the study period, and the probability of dying before the age of five was estimated to 270 per 1000 children. The mortality risk was related to weight for height (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt;0.001) and height for age (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt;0.01) as well as to upper arm circumference (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt;0.001) and triceps skinfold (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt;0.05). Mortality among children living in households using the new, piped‐water supply tended to be lower than mortality for those using traditional water sources, although the difference was not statistically significant (relative risk 0.4, 95% confidence interval 0.1–1.3).</jats:p>",

Little difference was found in yields of cows fat at calving receiving a relatively high UDP diet post calving, and cows thin at calving receiving a high or low UDP diet. Similar results were obtained with diets of lower energy and protein content (Jones and Garnsworthy, 1987).
