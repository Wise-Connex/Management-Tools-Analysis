I believe it is the first time that the <jats:italic>Journal</jats:italic> has published on the topic, perhaps suprisingly, for the issues that are raised are of great importance to all physicians who care for patients with chest problems. Dr Don Cockcroft and Dr David Wensley (pages 451‐455) conducted a survey of program directors and obtained data regarding Royal College Fellows, which allowed them to estimate the number of chest specialists currently in practice and to predict what will happen to these numbers in the foreseeable future. Based on the numbers and the waiting times for outpatient appointments, their main conclusions are that there is a shortfall in adult respirologists that may be as high as 50%; that the shortfall is at least as large for pediatric specialists; and that current output from training programs is unlikely to meet the shortfalls. Currently, they estimate a total of 361 adult specialists, or one for every 86,000 population, but with regional differences that account for a variation from one to 69,000 in Alberta to one to 253,000 in New Brunswick.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Siemens Brief Case Game Supply Chain Simulator provides a practical setting for experiential learning exercises about supply chains. The game, drawing upon an actual situation, models the jobs of nine supply chain activities required to transform an order placed by the customer into a delivered product. Using the detail and complexity of the game, instructors can develop learning exercises that focus on a wide range of supply chain management issues. This paper describes two learning exercises with different objectives and for different audiences that we successfully delivered using the Brief Case Game. One exercise provides a concrete example of typical activities in a supply chain and their interactions. The other exercise leads students to discover what creates a need for coordination, what activities in a supply chain require coordination, and what methods work well. These exercises are suited for small upper level undergraduate and graduate courses in logistics and supply chain management. While significant resources were used to develop exercises and deliver the game, students were enthusiastic about the approach and demonstrated that they learned about the complexity inherent in managing supply chains. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter introduces the concept of an electronic trade scenario as an aid to the management of (global) supply chains, and other forms of international, business-to-business electronic commerce. The problem addressed is the following. Competition demands that trade transactions be handled efficiently and securely. However, the same competitive environment also demands flexibility, and the ability to redesign the supply chain as conditions change. Current EDI (electronic data interchange) technologies offer efficiencies, but tend to be quite inflexible, often requiring substantial reprogramming for each modification to the transaction. Furthermore, these revisions need to be made not just for a single company, but for every affected company in the supply chain. In cases where some of the companies in the chain are relatively small, with limited computing staff and skills, such changes are even more difficult and disruptive. Electronic trade scenarios are generic, reusable models of the entire trade transaction. They are stored in a on-line repository, where each member of the supply chain can download the transaction component for their role in the transaction. In our proposed solution, the procedural logic of the transaction is designed using a high level, graphical representation called Documentary Petri Nets (DPN). The InterProcs system is described as a prototyping environment to support the design and execution of such supply chain transaction models using this DPN representation. A key concern will be the development of trustworthy trade scenarios that have sufficient controls and evidentiary documentation. Various directions of further work are described to improve the quality and flexibility of trade scenario designs.</jats:p>"

The adjustment path of the Czech economy is clear: The decrease in nominal GDP growth has caused a deceleration of inflation on the one side and a drop of growth rates of real GDP and later even a decline in the level of real GDP on the other side. Further the econometric investigation of relations between wages and labour productivity and net inflation, producer prices and gap has been made. As the main factors influencing the disinflation in the last quarters the index of raw materials and foodstuffs has been revealed. The analysis of the impact of real exchange rate on net exports concludes the paper. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many authors (Cunningham and Tynan, 1993; Dearing, 1990; Johnston, 1998; Rochester, 1989; Skagen, 1989; Swatman, 1993) now recognize that the significance of business-to-business electronic commerce in the supply chain is not just its ability to reduce direct operational costs (Colberg, 1990; Dearing, 1990), but also as an enabling technology for business process simplification, particularly as part of the over-arching simplification philosophy that goes variously by the names Just-In-Time (Abraham, Holt and Kathawala, 1990; Groenevelt, 1993), Quick Response (Fiorito, May and Straughn, 1995) and Efficient Consumer Response (Kurt Salmon Associates, 1993). There is also increasing recognition that supplier / customer interactions and supply chain performance as a whole are the correct units of analysis of supply chain reforms and their benefits (Buxmann and Gabauer, 1999; Johnston, 1998). Yet few accounts have attempted to define the precise principles by which the various technologies that make up supply chain electronic commerce are able to provide this simplification of business processes and supply chain performance improvement. This chapter takes up that challenge by describing an increasingly sophisticated series of supply chain reform initiatives with the aim of extracting the underlying principles of digitally mediated replenishment. It is hoped that such an approach will provide a richer, more unified, and more principled account of various EC-enabled supply chain reforms which are often discussed in isolation, but also, by drawing out from diverse supply chain reforms a small set of underlying principles, that it will be possible to more easily generalize from these cases to create other process simplifications appropriate to novel circumstances and business requirements. The chapter begins with fairly well known supply chain reforms analyzed in a new way, but leads on to quite novel issues such as the role of EC in pull as well as push JIT replenishment systems, the use of two dimensional bar code as a medium for EDI, and the use of the new Internet-based business document exchange and presentation products and services. This work is empirically grounded upon a series of case studies conducted in the past four years with some of the largest manufacturing and retail enterprises in Australia, but the reforms described are very much typical of world best practice in supply chain management. The case descriptions are kept brief: greater detail can be found in the references provided. The chapter concentrates on replenishment of retail goods, component parts, and raw materials along the supply chain of large retail and manufacturing enterprises. It focuses on the interaction between a “customer” enterprise which wishes to replenish goods from a “supplier” that distributes or manufacturers them. For simplicity, certain potential intermediaries to this process, such as third-party transport companies, are ignored. In the next two sections, the pertinent technologies involved are described, and a small number of principles that explain their use and their effectiveness in creating supply chain reform through electronic commerce are stated.</jats:p>"

Our paper presents such a test, using a data base on all units supplying water for towns of more than 5000 inhabitants in France. Our results strongly support that : 1) There is an economic rationale to contractual choices in public utilities ; 2) There is no absolute advantage for one specific mode of governance, performance depending on the fitness of the mode of governance to the attributes of the transaction.</jats:p>"

Such carriers will proactively work with both shippers and their customers to compress the supply chain by limiting unwanted actions while accomplishing mutually beneficial goals.

Roots may suffer from hypoxia if soil aeration is reduced by compaction and wetting. Although the mechanisms involved are well known, more research is needed to relate soil aeration status to plant growth. The effects of reduced oxygen supply on soil respiration and the growth of barley seedlings were studied in pot experiments with fine sand soil, where the soil air composition was varied by flushing the soil with gas streams containing 0%, 2%, 6%, 10% or 20% O2 independently of compactness (bulk density 1.4, 1.6 Mg m-3) and wetness (air space 0-5%, &gt;5%). Plant growth decreased only at 0-2% O2 in the loose moist soil but as early as 20% O2 in the wet soil. Soil compaction impaired plant growth regardless of wetting and aeration. In the loose moist soil cropped with barley, the respiration rate (emission of CO2) did not decrease at 6% O2 but decreased clearly at 0-2% O2. The results compared fairly well with the critical oxygen concentrations calculated by a simple multicylindrical model, in which the water-film thickness around the roots was estimated using soil water retention data.</jats:p>"

Most of the literature\n                        focuses upon the labour demand size. The aim of this paper is to tackle this\n                        question from the point of view of labour supply. We calibrate on French\n                        data a sequential job search model, which as two specific features: the\n                        characterization of job offers in terms of utility level which combines\n                        hourly wage rates with available leisure time and the fact that unemployment\n                        is not the only compatible state with a job search. Simulations of the model\n                        show that, for a given labour demand, the probability to be unemployed\n                        increases with the proportion of part-time jobs and decrease with the\n                        reduction of the weekly work time.</jats:p>"

These steps have all been taken, and the company has pursued the recommended breeding strategy for 3 years, purchased instrumentation and elected to move to the new testing and payment scheme for the current dairy season.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to identify these blood supply routes by comparing endoscopic varicography and percutaneous transhepatic portography (PTP). &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; Eleven cases of recurrent esophageal varices following EE are included in this study. The blood supply routes of primary and recurrent varices were analyzed by comparing the varicography obtained at the initial and repeat EE with PTPs before and after the initial EE. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Endoscopic varicography at the time of initial EE could show the vessels of the left gastric vein (LGV) system, such as the cardiac branch of the LGV, and the cardiac venous plexus (CP) in 100% of cases, and the trunk of the LGV in 73% (8/11) of cases, whereas the posterior gastric vein was seen in only 18% (2/11) of cases. PTP performed 2 weeks after the initial EE confirmed that the routes visualized by endoscopic varicography could be obliterated in 10 of 11 cases. The blood supply routes of recurrent varices, demonstrated by varicography, were the vessels of the short gastric vein (SGV) system, such as the fundic branch of the SGV or the posterior gastric vein in 82% (9/11) of cases, and the partially reformed fine CP in 27% (3/11) of cases. Varicography revealed the remnant vessels of the LGV in only 1 case. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; The primary esophageal varices are supplied with blood mainly from the cardiac branch of the LGV through the CP. However, the blood supplies of recurrent varices following EE come from the fundic branch of the SGV or the posterior gastric vein. We conclude that three-dimensional obliteration of esophageal varices and their feeders, the LGV and SGV systems, is completed by initial and repeat EEs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Manufacturing managers face increasing pressure to reduce inventories across the supply chain. However, in complex supply chains, it is not always obvious where to hold safety stock to minimize inventory costs and provide a high level of service to the final customer. In this paper we develop a framework for modeling strategic safety stock in a supply chain that is subject to demand or forecast uncertainty. Key assumptions are that we can model the supply chain as a network, that each stage in the supply chain operates with a periodic-review base-stock policy, that demand is bounded, and that there is a guaranteed service time between every stage and its customers. We develop an optimization algorithm for the placement of strategic safety stock for supply chains that can be modeled as spanning trees. Our assumptions allow us to capture the stochastic nature of the problem and formulate it as a deterministic optimization. As a partial validation of the model, we describe its successful application by product flow teams at Eastman Kodak. We discuss how these flow teams have used the model to reduce finished goods inventory, target cycle time reduction efforts, and determine component inventories. We conclude with a list of needs to enhance the utility of the model. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nA glasshouse experiment was designed to determine whether the terrestrial\nbladderwort species Utricularia uliginosa Vahl. gained\nany growth advantage from carnivory at different levels of nitrogen enrichment\nof the substrate. Three organism treatments were used: a control, a\nprotist-only treatment (Euglena spp.) and a protist\n+ meiofauna treatment (Euglena spp. plus nematodes,\ncopepods, ostracods, cladocerans and Acarina). The organism treatments were\nfactorially combined with three nitrogen levels (N0, N1, N2). Populations of\nEuglena were successfully established in the substrate\nof pots in the protist, and meiofauna + protist treatments, and were\nfound in the traps of plants growing in these treatments. Populations of the\nmeiofauna from the inoculating cultures were successfully established in the\nmeiofauna + protist treatment, and were trapped by plants in these\ntreatments. A background contamination of the control and protist-only\ntreatments by Acarina occurred over the course of the experiment; however,\nnumbers of Acarina in these treatments were at least an order of magnitude\nlower than numbers of meiofauna in the meiofauna + protist treatment.\nNon-acarinid meiofauna were restricted solely to the meiofauna + protist\ntreatment. Organism treatment interacted significantly with the nitrogen level\nof the substrate to affect growth of Utricularia. Plants\ntrapping Euglena (+ Acarina) had significantly less\ndry weight than control plants at the N0 base level of nitrogen; this negative\neffect of trapping Euglena on plant growth disappeared\nat the two higher nitrogen levels. The dry weight of plants trapping the full\nrange of meiofauna at the N0 level was comparable with control plants. Plants\ntrapping the full range of meiofauna + Euglena at\nthe N1 level had significantly more dry weight than plants trapping\nEuglena only, and the highest dry weight of any\ntreatment; the benefit of trapping the full range of meiofauna +\nEuglena was non-significant at the N2 level. Dry weight\nof plants was not significantly affected by nitrogen in any organism\ntreatment. These results suggest that carnivory was overcoming a nitrogen\ndeficiency induced by Euglena at the N0 level, but was\novercoming deficiencies of other nutrients at the N1 level.</jats:p>"

A pH increase around\nthe fertiliser band and/or limited Ca supply may exaggerate ammonia\ntoxicity. In the current study, wheat growth and gradients of pH, electrical\nconductivity (EC), ammonium (NH 4\n+ ), and P concentration in soil were studied by\ncomparing banded DAP + urea or MAP + urea fertilisers in control or\ngypsum- or CaCO 3 -treated Lancelin soil. After 21 days\nof wheat growth, visual symptoms of ammonia toxicity appeared in the\ngypsum-treated and control plants, but not in the CaCO 3\n-treated plants. The symptoms were more severe in the MAP treatments than in\nDAP treatments. An addition of CaCO 3 increased soil pH\nCaCl2 from 5.1 to 7.3, and the ammonium concentration was lower than that in\nthe gypsum-treated and control soils. In the gypsum-treated and control soils,\npH increased by nearly 1 unit in the vicinity of the DAP or MAP band. In\ncontrast, soil pH decreased in the location of the DAP or MAP band in the CaCO\n3 -treated soil. Banding of MAP or DAP in the\ngypsum-treated soil caused an increase in soil EC. The good plant growth on\nthe soil amended with CaCO 3 might have been related to\nthe low ammonium concentration in the soil and the high concentration of Ca.\nGypsum and CaCO3 decreased the availability of P\nsupplied in the MAP or DAP band. It was concluded that increased pH and higher\nCa content in sandy soil may alleviate ammonia toxicity to wheat.</jats:p>"

The lack of sand-bearing rivers in this area and the abundance of sand in the English Channel point to the latter as the source of this important sandy accumulation. A comparison of patterns of nearshore and coastal accumulation with results from studies of the hydrodynamics and marine sand transport pathways suggests long-term drift of sand towards the French coast and the North Sea in response to tidal flows and meteorological forcing. This has occurred through sand bank migration onshore, and sand transport alongshore in a pathway hugging the French coast. From this tide-driven ‘conveyor belt’, fine sand moved onshore to form aeolian dunes, while sand of all sizes has accumulated as thick estuarine fill. This mode of Holocene coastal development emphasizes the joint action of tidal currents, storm waves and wind activity, within an overall framework of tidal dominance in this macrotidal setting.</jats:p>",

Failure analyses of the goose necks and the pressure valve stem have been performed; they appear to have failed from SCC with the lead reacting with water. The lead may create an environmental health problem by being absorbed by the potable water and supplied to the buildings they are serving. To corroborate the aforementioned failure analyses, specimens made of alloy C86500 and C83600 were machined from a valve stem and a goose neck respectively and tested in a laboratory with simulated environments.

The\ncommonly used site mean yield, although most accessible and so utilising the\nmost data, was least effective in explaining variation in yield response.\nComparatively high efficiency (84%) could be achieved using\nmeasurements of rainfall or evaporative demand for specific periods of crop\nontogeny, but this suffered the limitation of being season or treatment\nspecific. The results did, however, demonstrate the value of the pollen\nselection method in increasing yield under conditions of reduced water supply.\nIn keeping with past climatic analyses, and with the theory underlying\nvariations in leaf water potential to which osmoregulation responds, an index\nincorporating water supply and evaporative demand accounted well for the yield\nincrease (85%) over the wide range of seasons and treatments examined.\nIt requires inputs of available soil water at sowing, rainfall, and free-water\nevaporation during the growing period, together with sowing and anthesis\ndates. The index was used to assess potential yield responses in the various\nclimates covered by the Australian wheatbelt. Greatest potential lay at the\ndrier, inland, margins especially where soils are lighter and water-holding\ncapacities lower.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Prediction of plant nutrient supply from fly ash and biosolids (sewage sludge and poultry manure) may enhance their agricultural use as crop fertilizer. Two mild extraction methods (42‐d equilibration with ion‐exchange resins; 2‐d equilibration with pH 4.8 buffered nutrient solution) and analysis of nutrient data by the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) were tested with 29 fly ash samples, four biosolids samples, and their mixtures. The resin method was useful for major nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) extraction from fly ashes and organic materials, particularly where mineralizable fractions of N and P under aerobic conditions are required. However, resins were inefficient in extracting P from high‐Fe sewage sludges because organic waste samples caused premature failure of semipermeable membranes and fouling of resins. Extraction of fly ash with dilute buffered nutrient solution was more successful because micronutrient recovery was improved, major nutrients were correlated to the resin method, both addition and removal of nutrients were recorded, DRIS analysis was possible, and equilibration was rapid (2 d). The overall nutrient supply from these extremely variable fly ashes was:<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/saj2sssaj2000641419x-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:03615995:media:saj2sssaj2000641419x:saj2sssaj2000641419x-math-0001\"/>(high micronutrient, low major nutrient supply). For biosolids, the major nutrients ranked: P &gt; N ≈ Ca &gt; S &gt; Mg &gt; K (sewage sludges), and N &gt; Ca ≈ K &gt; P &gt; Mg &gt; S (poultry manures). In mixtures of fly ash with 26% sewage sludge the order was: Ca &gt; S &gt; N &gt; Mg &gt; P &gt; K, while in mixtures of fly ash and 13% poultry manure, the nutrients ranked: Ca &gt; K ≈ N ≈ S &gt; Mg &gt; P. Optimal plant nutrition (especially N–P–K balancing) should be possible by mixing these three waste materials.</jats:p>",

The Spanish Crown responded to these challenges by mobilizing two institutions : the Council of Castile and the Chamber of Magistrates of the Royal Household and Court. Officers of both institutions tried to prevent social disorders and food riots through an interventionist and centralised model of provisioning. However, social and financial costs of this system soon proved excessive : on the one hand, the cheap bread of Madrid was paid for by rural producers and urban consumers, while on the other, the need for public subsidies worsened the financial difficulties of the royal and municipal Exchequers. After the failure of this traditional system, and rising levels of crime and poverty registered in Madrid, the absolutist state ended up with only means of preventing and repressing public disorders : the increase of police control over the city, by endowing the Chamber of Magistrates and the Royal Army with more coercive powers.</jats:p>"

However, chemically defined diets, containing nutritionally adequate amounts of essential amino acids, fail to rescue aposymbiotic aphids, in which the bacteria have been disrupted with antibiotics. In this study the injection of a mixture of essential amino acids into the haemocoel of aposymbiotic aphids was shown to alleviate, at least partially, the impact of symbiont loss. Specifically, the total amino acid content in the tissues of aposymbiotic aphids was reduced by approximately 40% to levels comparable with symbiotic insects, and there was a 1.7‐fold increase in the number of embryos, suggesting that the availability of essential amino acids promotes aphid protein synthesis by rejuvenating the free amino acid pool of aposymbiotic aphids. In addition, a similar effect on the total amino acid content was observed when phenylalanine alone, but not glutamine, lysine or tryptophan, was injected into the haemocoel of aposymbiotic aphids, and there was also a significant increase in the number of embryos following injection of phenylalanine or tryptophan alone. The impact of amino acid injection on the embryo complement of aposymbiotic aphids was limited to an increase in the number of embryos, with no increase in basal embryo size. It is proposed that older embryos may rely on their own complement of symbiotic bacteria for essential amino acid provisioning. Taken together, the data highlight the importance of bacterial provisioning of essential amino acids, particularly the aromatic amino acids, in the intact symbiosis.</jats:p>",

This implies that immune functions directed towards gastrointestinal parasites will benefit from an increased supply from scarce resources, such as metabolizable protein (MP) and metabolizable energy (ME). In this experiment we studied whether the resistance in parasitized pregnant sheep is affected by an increased supply of MP, or ME, or both.</jats:p>"

Usually, several chemicals are used so as to match for several purposes like RCA cleaning method. As wafer size becomes larger, large amount of cleaning chemicals usage and waste are necessary, which becomes now a big problem. Considering the above, we developed the Electrolyzed D.I.water with chemicals supply system in order to minimize running cost of chemicals and waste treatment. It is feature that; 1) this system can generate the anode water of the acidity/high ORP (Oxidation-Reduction Potential) and the cathode water of the alkalinity/low ORP by electrolyzing D.I.water adding with a small quantity of chemicals; 2) this system can generate anode water and cathode water at the same time; 3) if necessary, the anode water can be diluted with D.I.water at the optional density, and it is possible with the cathode water that hydrogen peroxide is added. The anode water which shows acidity/high ORP has the effect of removing metal and organic contamination, and the cathode water which shows alkalinity/low ORP has the effect of particle removal. In this report, we explain the outline of this system and the basic characteristic of the Acid and Alkaline water made with this system and its performances.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nWorldwide, barley is often grown on zinc (Zn) deficient soils. Screening for\nvarieties tolerant of low soil Zn (Zn-efficient varieties) generally involves\nassessing growth or yield of plants grown at different levels of Zn supply.\nSeed nutrient reserves can influence the growth of the plant; however, there\nhave been no reports on the effect of seed Zn content on the growth of barley.\nIn 2 experiments, we studied the effect of seed Zn content on early growth of\nbarley in 2 genotypes, Amagi Nijo and Tantangara. In Expt 1, the amounts of Zn\nin the seed ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 µg/seed, whereas in Expt 2, seed\nZn ranged from 0.7 to 5.0 µg/seed. The plants were grown in a\nZn-deficient siliceous sand with Zn added at 0, 0.04, 0.2, 0.8, and 3.2 mg\nZn/kg soil in Expt 1 and at 0, 0.04, and 0.8 mg Zn/kg soil in Expt 2,\nand harvested at tillering. Growth and expression of visual symptoms were\nmeasured.\nPlants grown from seed with low Zn content developed symptoms of Zn deficiency\nby the 2-leaf stage in soil with no soil-applied Zn. Symptoms were reduced\nmarkedly as seed Zn content increased. Shoot and root growth increased as the\namount of Zn in seed increased, but the effect was most evident when soil Zn\nsupply was limiting plant growth (≤0.04 mg Zn/kg soil). For instance,\nwhen no Zn was added to the soil, shoot dry weight of plants grown from\nhigh-Zn seed was 108% greater than that of plants grown from low-Zn\nseed, whereas at 0.04 and 0.8 mg Zn/kg soil, the increases were only\n52% and 18%, respectively. Soil Zn application significantly\nincreased tissue Zn concentrations. However, the effect of seed Zn content on\ntissue Zn concentrations was significant only at very high levels of seed Zn.\nThe results presented showed that seed Zn improves vegetative growth in\nbarley, especially when Zn supply is deficient for plant growth. Seed Zn\ncontent also affected the determination of Zn efficiency of genotypes, and\ncomparisons of dry matter production of seedlings grown from seed with a wide\nrange in Zn content may alter their rankings for Zn efficiency as determined\nin this pot assay. The results indicate that seed of similar Zn content needs\nto be used when comparing genotypes for determination of Zn efficiency.\n</jats:p>"

However, services typically cannot hold inventory and can only manage backlogs through capacity adjustments. We propose a simulation game designed to teach service‐oriented supply chain management principles and to test whether managers use them effectively. For example, using a sample of typical student results, we determine that student managers can effectively use end‐user demand information to reduce backlog and capacity adjustment costs. The game can also demonstrate the impact of demand variability and reduced capacity adjustment time and lead times. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Decision makers in freight transportation need to assess new distribution systems and the impacts of changes in the freight distribution environment on infrastructure needs and usage, logistical performance, emissions, and energy use. There is a need, therefore, for behavioral models that can predict goods flows and vehicle flows in both current and future situations. This research outlines a conceptual framework consisting of the markets, actors, and supply chain elements of freight movement. Supply chains are constructed by linking distribution channels (of different logistics characteristics) between different activity types, such as consumers, supermarkets, stores, offices, distribution centers, and factories. The framework outlined in this research was used to develop the GoodTrip model—a demand-driven, commodity-based freight movement model that incorporates supply chains. Starting with consumer demand, the model estimates goods flows and simulates vehicle tours. The open architecture of the model allows mixed use of empirical data, behavioral models, and scenario-type assumptions. The behavioral models will be developed in future research. In its first application, the GoodTrip model was used to compare the logistical performance and external impacts of three types of urban distribution systems: the traditional system and two concepts using urban distribution centers (one using vans, the other using automated underground vehicles). The results show considerable differences in the performance and effects of the alternatives, especially when they are applied to different types of distribution channels, such as food retail stores or bookstores. </jats:p>",

C:N ratio was increased in senesced leaf (enhancement ratios, <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>e/c</jats:sub>, of 1.25–1.67), surface litter (1.34–1.64) and root (1.13–1.30) by CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment. After 3 years of growth, nonstructural carbohydrate concentrations were reduced in senesced leaf lamina (avg. <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>e/c</jats:sub>=  0.84) but not in root in response to CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment.

Lignin and polyphenolic concentrations in senesced leaf and root were not changed by CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment. Decomposition, measured as cumulative respiration in standard conditions <jats:italic>in vitro,</jats:italic> was reduced in leaf litter grown under CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment. Root decomposition <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> was lower in the material produced under CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment at the two higher rates of mineral N supply. Significant correlations between decomposition of leaf litter and initial %N, C:N ratio and lignin:N ratio were found. Decomposition <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>, measured as carbon disappearance from the surface litter was not affected by CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration. Arbuscular mycorrhizal infection was not changed by CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment. Microbial carbon was higher under CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment at the two higher rates of mineral N supply. Possible reasons for the lack of effect of changes in litter quality on in‐sward decomposition rates are discussed.</jats:p>",
