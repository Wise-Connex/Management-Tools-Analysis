Raw water obtained directly from the wells had a color of 10‐20 units, indicating that the subsequent color increase was the result of additional iron pickup in the system or improper water treatment. It was determined that the ferrous iron present in the raw water was oxidized to ferric upon aeration and was imparting additional color to the supply. Extensive experimentation and pilot plant studies indicated the use of polyphosphates as the most effective method of treatment.</jats:p>",
