With everyone implementing lean manufacturing philosophies, companies additionally need to become smart chain managers and ensure continuous improvement to stay competitive. Exploits further the concept of the “seamless supply chain”, by encouraging market place information to move through the supply chain with as little distortion as possible. The simulation model used to benchmark performance improvement is representative of both the MIT beer game and much experimental industrial practice. It is therefore realistic as an aid to the implementation of decision support systems (DSS). Presents the beneficial dynamic effects of enriching each supply chain member’s order decision with undistorted market sales. Concludes that tremendous benefits can result from adopting a holistic approach if the attitudinal problems associated with information sharing can be overcome.</jats:p>",

Differences in rates and nature of request failure between libraries of different types and for different types of material were examined. Data were simultaneously collected on requests passing through the British Library Document Supply Centre, reply codes were monitored and analysed, and operational systems and procedures examined. Conclusions were drawn and recommendations made at a national policy level and at the operational, practice‐based level. At national level they include access strategies, acquisitions and retention policies, and resource discovery strategies. At operational level they focus on the submission of requests, the use, management and maintenance of databases and catalogues, and technical standards.</jats:p>",

Kalman filter procedure was applied in deriving supply elasticities for 6 staple agricultural products. Two structural breaks in Slovene agriculture may be (hypothetical) expected in the observed period, but both cannot clearly be estimated. The extent of agricultural reforms has been gradually defined and started much before the process of political transition in 1990/91. High supply elasticities were obtained for beef and maize, which is explained by a relatively free market environment that was encountered by the farmers involved in beef and maize production. Low supply elasticities calculated for pork and potato, and very low supply elasticities computed for wheat and milk point at a high degree of state regulation on these markets in the past and the importance of the quasi fixed assets in the production. From the values of cross-price elasticities certain complement and substitute relationships between various farm produce, which are however subject to change over time, could be observed. Possible Slovene admission to EU would thus have quite different effects for domestic farmers engaged in one of the 6 production activities scrutinised here.</jats:p>"

On the basis of earlier work, we choose to forecast future supply using the Hubbert model, which has advantages of simplicity and availability of data. Although this approach has several known inadequacies, it has withstood the test of time in numerous cases, and we consider it a fairly reliable supply predictor. We also used the Hubbert model to forecast demand. We found no precedence for this use and currently regard its accuracy as speculative. Nevertheless, some signs indicate that it too may develop use over time as a reasonable predictor.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Our study showed that world supply (and demand) for petroleum liquids is currently at a peak and will soon decline. We examined supply and demand by region. Some regions, such as the Middle East, will produce a surplus of crude throughout the forecast period. Other regions, most notably the Far East and North America, will remain importers. Still other regions, such as Africa, that are now exporting will soon become importers.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Our recent study,1 in which 67 worldwide production trends were presented and analyzed, showed that the Hubbert2–5 model generally can estimate production trends with good results. The analysis also showed that world ultimate recoverable crude oil will be ˜1.76 trillion STB. Of this amount, ˜1 trillion STB remained to be produced at the end of 1995. The Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Country's (OPEC's) current reserves are 709 billion STB, or 71% of world reserves.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In 1995, Ivanhoe6 modified a hypothetical Hubbert 2-trillion-STB ultimate world production scenario by restricting the production at ˜60 MMSTB/D until Year 2040, when world oil production ceased. He later suggested that world production will continue to increase and peak at ˜70 MMSTB/D in 2010 before exhibiting a normal field decline rate, the same as that seen in the oil fields in the lower 48 U.S. states.7</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A recent 10-year (1995-2004) forecast by Foreman8 concluded that the global oil and condensate output will rise to 75 MMSTB/D in 2004. At the same time, OPEC's share of production will increase to approximately half and its members may again dominate the world market if the organization survives the next 10 years.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>On the basis of the results of our recent study,1 this paper forecasts not only world supply of petroleum liquids, but also supply from different regions. We combined Hubbert models for all 67 countries into regions or organizations. The OPEC supply model was obtained by summing the individual models of its members. The world supply model was obtained by summing all 67 crude-oil supply models in addition to a separate model of world NGL's. The non-OPEC supply model can be found either by subtracting the OPEC from the world model after excluding NGL production or by simply summing up the non-OPEC models. These models take into account the combined performances of all producing countries that supply virtually all world crude oils and NGL's.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This study also proposes and tests the hypothesis that the demand for petroleum liquids follows the Hubbert model. The rationale for this hypothesis is based partially on the fact that world demand must equal world supply. If world supply reasonably follows a Hubbert model, then so should world demand. However, whether demand by country follows a Hubbert model is not clear. If world demand for energy continues to rise and the supply of petroleum liquids begins to fall, intense regional competition will occur for diminishing supplies of petroleum liquids and/or alternative sources of energy must be substituted. In either case, whether demand will follow a Hubbert model is unclear. Only one world region has experienced a dramatic decrease in demand for petroleum liquids for many years [Eastern Europe, mainly the Former Soviet Union (FSU)]. Thus, fuller testing of the Hubbert demand model for petroleum liquids will not be possible until other regions have experienced significant declines in demand.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Some well-established evidence, however, exists for the cyclical demand for various sources of energy in specific regions. Historical data reveal that the U.S. and U.K. have depended on various fuels to meet their energy requirements. Analysis of U.S. energy consumption (Fig. 1) indicates four cycles. Wood was the primary fuel in the 1800's. Coal consumption started in approximately 1800 but took 80 years to dominate and replace wood (approximately 20 years after the first commercial development of oil). Then, oil and gas consumption increased to dominate the energy market and replace coal. Oil and gas's percentage of total consumption peaked in 1971, then declined steadily to 1995. Oil's percentage of total consumption, however, reached its highest share (49%) a few years later in 1977, then declined steadily to 39% in 1995. Gas's share resembles that of oil but at a lower percentage. Nuclear-power consumption started in approximately 1960 (we consider it the start of the fourth cycle), and its percentage increased to approximately 8% by 1995. Similarly, U.K. energy consumption shows similar trends; however, consumption is still rising, while coal consumption is still declining. Thus, the conclusion can be drawn that reliance on oil is generally in a downward trend. Gas, coal (which is making a comeback in the U.S.), and nuclear power are increasing as a fraction of energy demand. Other forecasts9–11 show continually increasing growth of world oil demand. However, these models are unconstrained by supply.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The resulting stochastic field of sediment supply interacts with the topology of the channel network and with transport processes to generate spatial and temporal patterns of flux and storage that characterize the sedimentation regime of a drainage basin. The regime varies systematically with basin area. We describe how the stochastic sediment supply is generated by climatic, topographic, geotechnical, and biotic controls that vary between regions. The general principle is illustrated through application to a landscape where sediment is supplied by mass wasting, and the forcing variables are deterministic thickening of colluvium, random sequences of root‐destroying wildfires, and random sequences of rainstorms that trigger failure in a population of landslide source areas with spatial variance in topography and colluvium strength. Landslides stop in channels or convert to scouring debris flows, depending on the nature of the low‐order channel network. Sediment accumulates within these channels for centuries before being transferred downstream by debris flows. Time series of sediment supply, transport, and storage vary with basin scale for any combination of climatic, topographic, and geotechnical controls. In a companion paper [<jats:italic>Benda and Dunne</jats:italic>, this issue] we use simulations of timing, volumes, and locations of mass wasting to study the interaction between a stochastically forced sediment supply and systematic changes of storage and flux through channel networks.</jats:p>",

A recursive model incorporating price expectations and biological constraints is used to estimate supply and demand functions for thoroughbred horses. Empirical results characterize a market with inelastic supply and elastic demand that converges to equilibrium under static conditions. Purses were identified as the most influential variable impacting price. Comparative statics illustrate the effectiveness of purses as a policy instrument for the thoroughbred industry. Federal tax policy also was found to have a significant impact on the decisions to breed or invest in thoroughbred yearlings.</jats:p>",

Also, experimental wetting of intact turf samples taken from both sites was applied in order to study the interaction between nutrient supply and anaerobic soil conditions. It was concluded that the above‐ground phytomass yield in the undrained site was restricted by a major shortage of N‐supply and a moderate shortage of K‐supply by the fen peat soil. The above‐ground phytomass yield of the drained site was only reduced by a strongly limited supply of K by the soil. The extent of K‐deficiency was larger for the drained site. No P‐deficiency was observed in any of the drained or undrained sites. Rewetting turf samples, taken from the drained site, did not change above‐ground phytomass yields, suggesting that nutrient supplies were not affected by rewetting. Leaching has likely resulted in a strong reduction of K‐supply in the drained site. It is assumed that a shortage in K‐supply from the peat soil may have become an important environmental constraint for characteristic plant species of <jats:italic>Calthion</jats:italic> meadows. This may hamper the development of this meadow type on drained peat soils after rewetting by groundwater discharge.</jats:p>",

If one believes that Pareto‐dominated equilibria are unlikely to arise, then the difference between our results and those of Mathewson and Winter (1987), who do not allow for nonlinear pricing, suggests an ironic twist on the notion that quantity discounts and other kinds of nonlinear pricing can provide an additional way for a manufacturer to foreclose a rival. By providing a manufacturer with increased flexibility (beyond linear pricing) to extract a retailer's surplus, nonlinear pricing may instead have the effect of reducing the incidence of observed market foreclosure.</jats:p>",

A net convective volume flow of gas from the soil into the roots and out of the stump is observed if the mean molar mass of the gas present in the soil is lower than that present in the intercellular space of the roots. The direction of the convective gas flow can be reversed by increasing the molar mass of the gas present in the soil. These phenomena are governed by Graham 's law of diffusion.

The model is used to investigate the impact of the land set‐aside provision of the recent package of reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy. We assume that producers chose output and variable input levels that maximize difference between revenue and variable cost. By including first‐order conditions for the allocation of land across its uses, we impose that the observed allocations are profit‐maximizing allocations. To overcome the problem of incorporating many outputs into an estimable production structure, we imposed a priori the restriction that the technology was weakly separable in major categories of outputs. With this restriction, it was possible to model production decisions in stages using consistent aggregates in the latter stages.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In numerous locations in Europe spruce trees are exposed to high loads of nitrogen. The present study was performed to characterize the distribution of nitrogen compounds under these conditions. For this purpose Norway spruce (<jats:italic>Picea abies</jats:italic> [L.] Karst.) trees were cultivated under close‐to‐natural conditions of a forest understory in soil from an apparently nitrogen‐limited field site in the Black Forest either with, or without supplementation of nitrogen as ammonium nitrate. After 11 and 20 months, growth, total nitrogen contents of the biomass, and total soluble non‐proteinogenic nitrogen compounds (TSNN, i.e. nitrate, ammonium, soluble proteinogenic and non‐proteinogenic amino compounds) in needles, xylem sap and phloem exudate were analysed. After 20 months of growth, N‐fertilization had slightly enhanced the biomass of current‐, but not of 1‐year‐old shoots. At both harvests, total N‐content of 1‐year‐old needles was increased by N‐fertilization, whereas current‐year needles were not significantly affected. By contrast, TSNN was elevated by N‐fertilization in both current‐year and 1‐year‐old needles. The increase in TSNN was mainly attributed to an accumulation of arginine. Xylem sap analysis showed that the increase in TSNN of the needles was a consequence of enhanced nitrogen assimilation of the roots rather than the shoot. Since also TSNN in phloem exudates was enhanced, it appears that N‐fertilization elevates the cycling pool of amino compounds in young Norway spruce trees. However, this pool seems to be subject to metabolic interconversion, since mainly glutamine and aspartate are transported in the xylem from the roots to the shoot, but arginine accumulated in the needles and the phloem.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The hepatic responses of late gestation, dry dairy cows to acute (6 h) infusions of an amino acid (AA) mixture (Synthamin; 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 4.4, 8.8 and 17.6 mmol/min) into the mesenteric vein were determined. Neither blood flow nor O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>consumption across the portal-drained viscera (PDV) and liver was significantly altered by infusion. Similarly, there were no effects on net absorption, or hepatic removal, of acetate, propionate, butyrate or NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. Glucose PDV appearance was unchanged but hepatic glucose production increased (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>= 0.032) by 0.2 mmol/min per mmol/min of AA infused. Additional extraction of alanine, glycine (both infused) and glutamine (not infused) by the liver was sufficient to account for most of the extra C required for glucose synthesis. The N that would be liberated from these glucogenic AA would also account for a large proportion of the increase in urea-N produced in response to the AA infusion. This supports the concept of a correlation between gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis. Furthermore, the amide-N liberated from the extracted glutamine would contribute up to 0.17 of hepatic NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>flux and assist in balancing N inputs into the carbamoyl phosphate and arginosuccinate entry points of the ornithine cycle. Rates of fractional extraction of the various AA by the liver were best fitted by linear equations, indicating that even at the highest rates of administration (approximately twice maximal physiological absorption) the transport systems were not saturated. Hepatic fractional extractions of infused essential AA were highest for methionine (0.83) and phenylalanine (0.87) with the lowest proportion removed observed for valine (0.25), leucine (0.30), lysine (0.31) and isoleucine (0.49). For the non-essential AA, the highest apparent fractional extractions were for glycine (0–73), arginine (0.79) and tyrosine (0.63) followed by alanine (0.54), proline (0.47) and serine (0–37). Hepatic removal of AA-N exceeded the increase in urea-N formation such that, at the highest rate of infusion, approximately 10 mmol/min of the extracted AA was apparently available for hepatic anabolism, more than is required to account for assumed increases in liver mass and export protein synthesis. Similarly, the amount of AA available for peripheral tissue protein gain, when assessed against phenylalanine supply as the limitation, would be the equivalent of a maximum of 0.5 g protein retained/min (6 mmol AA-N/min). This would provide sufficient AA for replenishment of peripheral (muscle) protein stores plus support of the placenta and fetus.</jats:p>",
