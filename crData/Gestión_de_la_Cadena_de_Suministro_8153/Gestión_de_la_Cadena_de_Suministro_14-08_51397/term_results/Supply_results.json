This goal needs to be balanced against the competitive priorities of cost and responsiveness. Emissions‐reducing efforts are driven by the need to comply with expectations from industry and end customers and by opportunities for energy and cost savings. Manufacturers are now looking beyond their corporate boundaries to find new ways to reduce emissions along the supply chain. There is a need for research to address supplier selection in the face of sustainability challenges and provide insights about the factors affecting the transfer of sustainability skills between the manufacturer and its suppliers.

Organizational flexibility occurs when a firm outsources manufacturing and operates with a more flexible structure. Drawing upon the supply network perspective, this study develops hypotheses relating attributes of the supplier, customer, and focal industries to the use of a flexible organizational strategy. Using an industry‐level data set to test the hypotheses, we show that heterogeneity of supply sources and scale economies (in the focal and downstream industries) are positively associated with a greater degree of organizational flexibility, in terms of contract manufacturing in the focal industry. However, industry concentration levels in the focal and downstream industries are negatively associated with organizational flexibility.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study is to explore how and why firms differ in these behaviors and capabilities. We use the organizational information‐processing perspective as a guiding theoretical framework and analyze qualitative data obtained from interviews conducted with 14 global case study manufacturing firms. By comparing these firms', behaviors in terms of scanning and interpreting warning signals, reacting to distressed or defaulting suppliers, and learning from such experiences, we are able to isolate several risk management archetypes and develop four sets of propositions that describe the occurrence of these archetypes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the nature of the manufacturing and support activities associated with long life cycle products, the parts that products required need to be dependably and consistently available. However, the parts that comprise long lifetime products are susceptible to a variety of supply chain disruptions. In order to minimize the impact of these unavoidable disruptions to production, manufacturers can implement proactive mitigation strategies. Two mitigation strategies in particular have been proven to decrease the penalty costs associated with disruptions: second sourcing and buffering. Second sourcing involves selecting two distinct suppliers from which to purchase parts over the life of the part’s use within a product or organization. Second sourcing reduces the probability of part unavailability (and its associated penalties), but at the expense of qualification and support costs for multiple suppliers. An alternative disruption mitigation strategy is buffering (also referred to as hoarding). Buffering involves stocking enough parts in inventory to satisfy the forecasted part demand (for both manufacturing and maintenance requirements) for a fixed future time period so as to offset the impact of disruptions. Careful selection of the mitigation strategy (second sourcing, buffering, or a combination of the two) is key, as it can dramatically impact a part’s total cost of ownership.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper studies the effectiveness of traditional analytical models compared to a simulation-based approach for the selection of an optimal disruption mitigation strategy. A verification case study was performed to check the accuracy and applicability of the simulation-based model. The case study results show that the simulation model is capable of replicating results from operations research models, and overcomes significant scenario restrictions that limit the usefulness of analytical models as decision-making tools. Four assumptions, in particular, severely limit the realism of most analytical models but do not constrain the simulation-based model. These limiting assumptions are: 1) no fixed costs associated with part orders, 2) infinite-horizon, 3) perfectly reliable backup supplier, and 4) disruptions lasting full ordering periods (as opposed to fractional periods).</jats:p>",

Taking use of questionnaire investigation and Structural Equation Modeling, the relevant assumptions are verified and the mechanism and strategy of the alignment of NPD and SC are explored for Chinese manufacturing enterprises. The research result shows that the modularity and variety of NPD have close relationship with the complexity of supply chain configuration, collaboration and coordination. And the degree of the alignment has an important influence on the supply chain performance of the end product. The relevant conclusions would provide some theoretical reference and practical guidance on the decision of aligning the NPD with SC.</jats:p>"

In most cases, the regional hydraulic response to groundwater withdrawal is best approximated using a numerical model; however, simulated hydraulic heads at supply wells are subject to errors associated with model discretization and well loss. An approach for correcting the simulated head at a pumping node is described here. The approach corrects for errors associated with model discretization and can incorporate the user's knowledge of well loss. The approach is model independent, can be applied to finite difference or finite element models, and allows the numerical model to remain somewhat coarsely discretized and therefore numerically efficient. Because the correction is implemented external to the numerical model, one important benefit of this approach is that a response matrix, reduced model approach can be supported even when nonlinear well loss is considered.</jats:p>",

According to social network theory, the marginal benefit of interfirm relational ties on information sharing should decrease with the strength of ties; according to information overload theory, information sharing should have an inverted U‐shaped effect on the acquisition of skills.

Despite the huge theoretical need, the production and use of improved seeds remain very limited. Concurrently, genetic erosion and the disappearance of certain local varieties have been observed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The dual need to preserve agricultural biodiversity as a factor of resilience for production systems while disseminating improved varieties as a means to increase production raises questions regarding what type or types of organization could best respond to these agricultural challenges. The farmer seed network in Mali is based on the self-production of pearl millet and sorghum seeds and operates through non-commercial, community-based exchanges. The formal seed sector distributes certified seeds through cooperatives, with cost-effectiveness the main priority. The joining of these two seed networks could allow agro-biodiversity to be considered in such a way that genetic diversity can be maintained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The various pearl millet and sorghum seed exchange networks often are considered to be in opposition, with the formal network pitted against the informal one. By highlighting points where the two systems could come together, the proposed model allows a new perspective on seed flows and agro-biodiversity management. The global seed network that could emerge from this would, on one hand, remedy the failure of the state seed system inspired by a Western model in which seed production and distribution is disconnected from agricultural production, and, on the other, compensate for shortcomings in the traditional farmer seed system to increase productivity and sustainably manage farmer pearl millet and sorghum varieties while continuously introducing new genetic resources.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Maximum seed weight (mass maturity) was achieved at 40–45 days after flowering. However, maximum seed quality was obtained 7 to 10 days after mass maturity, depending on irrigation intervals and cultivars. At earlier harvests, because of immaturity, and at later harvests, due to ageing, seed quality was low. Seed filling rate and maximum seed weight of chickpea decreased with decreasing water supply, but water deficit had no significant effects on seed quality as measured by germination percentage, germination rate and seedling dry weight. Significant differences in seedling dry weight among chickpea cultivars were attributed to significant variation in seed weight affected by genetic constitution.</jats:p>",

Within this complicated framework of licence agreements, digital rights management (DRM) systems are a challenge for customers and the delivery service. However, it can be noted, that a simple watermark suffices nearly all publishers in agreements covering pay-per-view delivery of generic digital article files, and only 25 per cent require strict DRM for document delivery scanned from the print.

The photovoltaic (PV) power supply system has many advantages, however, there are still problems, e.g. low voltage, low power, poor ability to resist disturbance. Around these problems, the paper designed a PV power supply control system could realize the uninterrupted power supply, including DC and AC supply. By the method of combining software with hardware, through the solar panel to the configured two pieces of battery could realize the function of fast and float charging, and the supply battery is changed by testing the battery power to load uninterrupted power supply. Moreover, when the output voltage of the solar panel is lower than the battery, the output voltage of solar panel is boosted by DC/DC circuit to make the solar panel at low pressures also to charge the battery, effectively solving the difficult solar energy in the weak power supply problem. Finally, the design of PV power supply control system not only could realize DC supply, and also AC power supply by SPWM method, which has good effect of power supply.</jats:p>"

Secondly, in order to solve these difficulties, the synchronization design is based on zero-cross detection, Butterworth filter and phase compensation for practical purposes. Because the APF adopts DSP as the digital controller, the phase compensation can be easily achieved by software design. In the end, the experimental results of a prototype have verified the effectiveness of the proposed design and the APF can trace the frequency and phase of primary input voltage effectively.</jats:p>"

Five representative ecological objectives are selected besides industrial and domestic (I&amp;D) and agricultural water supply objectives. They can reflect the impacts of reservoir operation on different attributes of ecological flow regime in the Biliuhe Reservoir case study, Northeastern China. Sensitivities of water supply and ecological objectives caused by water level variations of I&amp;D and agricultural operation rule curves are analyzed by using a variance-based sensitivity analysis method – Sobol's method. Results show that impacts of individual water levels and their interactions on ecological objectives are very different. Also the ecological objectives do not always conflict with water supply objectives. This study provides new insights for reservoir managers to improve downstream aquatic ecosystem by adjusting water levels not only at individual time periods but also at some interacting time periods. Furthermore, it helps us better understand the influence mechanism of water level changes on different objectives, and provides guidance for the development of reservoir operation rules.</jats:p>",

A mixed research design was employed. The supply chain challenges revealed in the findings were categorised into technological, infrastructure, cost, market/service, relationship and production/skills challenges. Most are difficult to quantify, such as road freight volumes, port delays, rail unreliability, high fuel costs, high operating costs and high port charges. Nevertheless, addressing some of the challenges could help manufacturers to become more competitive, for example by replacing outdated assembly/manufacturing tools, finding new markets, preventing or reducing the effect of cancellation of customer orders and improving the level of service in general. This article provides an understanding of the challenges in the supply chain, which is paramount not only for locally manufactured vehicle supply chain practitioners, but also for the automotive industry and South Africa as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Automatic water meter reading (AMR) is now the best kind of technology to supply real time information on water consumption. Complete equipment of a district metered area enables the assessment of the total consumption of a finite size population, for a time scale sometimes as short as an hour. However, its cost for generalization can generate high capital expenditures (CAPEX), unaffordable for the utility, in which case sampling techniques have to be set up. With the purpose of total consumption estimation, this article describes standard methods of survey techniques applied to water networks and proposes a methodology for implementation of an operational sample. The methodology, which includes some constraints on the estimator precision, proposes a smart AMR equipment plan of the population, while reducing CAPEX. Finally, estimation of the total consumption, in addition to the knowledge of supplied volume, enables more accurate loss assessment and potential detection of new leaks.</jats:p>",

The intracellular glycogen content decreased in a time‐dependent manner, whereas the ATP levels were sustained following energy deprivation.

Hence, energy failure may result in an increased ability to protect RGC from glutamate‐induced excitotoxicity, whereas malfunction of glutamate uptake in Müller cells may contribute to RGC death.</jats:p>",

India is the second largest producer of rice (Oryza sativa L.) next to China and rice accounts for larger proportion of human caloric intake in India. The price rise of rice commodity and conversion of rice lands for non agriculture purposes necessitate examining the existing status of rice production and suggesting measures to prevent any sort of disturbances in food security in India. This paper aims at analyzing the present production performance of rice in the country by examining the trends and shifts in production growth, delineating the sources of production growth as well as assessing the instability in rice production. In addition, some other critical issues of spatial differentials and price escalation are also discussed. The study reveals that there has been deceleration in growth rate of rice production and productivity not only in India but also in all the top five major rice producing countries in the world. There exists a spatial variation among Indian states, where northern and southern region registered higher rice productivity and the rest of the regions witnessed less productivity. Yield effect contributed more towards the decline in production growth in eastern states like West Bengal, Odisha and Asom and therefore it is required to have adequate measures to improve upon the yield growth. Besides, higher instability in rice production is also noticed in Odisha and Bihar. It is therefore important to have technology breakthrough in rice which could push the production trajectory path upwards and achieve a higher and sustainable growth rate in rice as well as sustaining food security status in India.</jats:p>"

At [CaCl2] ≥ 500 ppm, the attachment in the presence or absence of HA was similar, suggesting that the attachment was independent of the presence of HA. It was also found that the particle attachment to the fabric was lower when HA was present in water compared to when present on the fabric, suggesting that the attachment behaviour of inorganic particles was dependent on water chemistry (i.e. presence of calcium ions and organics in water), which also altered the surface properties of filter media.

This study was aimed to investigate the presence or absence of gamma radioactivity in commonly consumed seafood products from B.C. In total, ten different species of fish and three different species of shellfish were selected for analysis. For each species of fish, two samples were collected and each sample was from a different local seafood market. For each species of shellfish, ten samples were collected from three different sources. Using the portable GR-135 Plus gamma ray spectrometer, the samples were tested and analyzed for the presence of Fukushima radionuclides, particularly Cesium-137 (Cs-137) and Cesium- 134 (Cs-134).Based on the analyzed fish and shellfish, no gamma radiation was detected. The detector did not identify any gamma radiation over the normal background readings.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The implementation addresses key design assumptions - the system is implemented using multi-agent technology, which offers the possibility of decentralisation and distributed processing of specified contracts and tenders. The implemented system enables the joint management of orders for a network of small and medium-sized metallurgical plants, while providing them with greater competitiveness and the ability to carry out large procurements. The article presents the functional aspects of the system - the user interface and the principle of operation of individual agents that represent businesses seeking potential suppliers or recipients of services and products. Additionally, the system is equipped with a bi-directional agent translating standards based on ontologies, which aims to automate the decision-making process during tender specifications as a response to the request.</jats:p>",

Empirical evidence is provided, extending the RDT model in this context. The concept of power relationships is explored through a qualitative study of a multinational company and agricultural growers in the UK food industry that work together to implement sustainable practices. We look at multiple triadic relationships involving a large buyer and its small suppliers to investigate how relative power affects the implementation of sustainable supply‐management practices. The study highlights that power as dependence is relevant to understanding compliance in sustainable supply chains and to identifying appropriate relationship‐management strategies to build more sustainable supply chains. We show the influences of power on how players manage their relationships and how it affects organizational responses to the implementation of sustainability initiatives. Power notably influences the sharing of sustainability‐related risks and value between supply chain partners. From a managerial perspective, the study contributes to developing a better understanding of how power can become an effective way to achieve sustainability goals. This article offers insights into the way in which a large organization works with small and medium size enterprises to implement sustainable practices and shows how power management—that is, the way in which power is used—can support or hinder effective cooperation around sustainability in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Understanding and managing supply chain risks is a critical functional competency for today's global enterprises. A lack of this competency can have significant negative outcomes, including costly production and delivery delays, loss of future sales, and a tarnished corporate image. The ability to identify and mitigate risks, however, is complicated as supply chains are becoming increasingly global, complex, and interconnected. Drawing on the complex systems and epidemiology literature, and using a computational modeling and network analysis approach, we examine the impact of global supply network structure on risk diffusion and supply network health and demonstrate the importance of supply network visibility. Our results show a significant association between network structure and both risk diffusion and supply network health. In particular, our results indicate that small‐world supply network topologies consistently outperform supply networks with scale‐free characteristics. Theoretically, our study contributes to our understanding of risk management and supply networks as complex networked systems using a computational approach. Managerially, our study illustrates how decision makers can benefit from a network analytic approach to develop a more holistic understanding of system‐wide risk diffusion and to guide network governance policies for more favorable health level outcomes. The article concludes by highlighting the main findings and discussing possibilities of future research directions.</jats:p>",

Under the condition of the tie rate increasing gradually in the intelligent distribution network, a wide range load transfer optimization strategy with the cooperation of the standby busbar power supply and external tie power supplies is proposed in this paper. It will be great of significance to improve the reliability of distribution network and the equipment capacity factor of the main transformer. However, it probably occurs that the same power supply need restore service for two or more feeders because too many feeders lose power when power supply side failure, which leads to the difficulty in generating service restoration scheme. Therefore, a decoupling strategy for this kind of power supply is proposed, decoupling the shared power supply into multiple equivalent power supplies. Eventually, the wide range load transfer problem is transformed into the problem of service restoration for multiple feeders independently. The researches in this paper will lay the foundation for the application of the wide range of load transfer optimization strategy for power supply side failure in the intelligent distribution network.</jats:p>"

The marked spatiotemporal variation in fruit supply can affect frugivore abundance and distribution, but studies addressing the effects of this variation on primates are scarce. The present study aimed to investigate how the spatiotemporal distribution of fruits influences the local distribution of three frugivorous primates in the eastern part of the Maracá Ecological Station, a highly seasonal Amazonian rainforest. Specifically, it was hypothesised that primate distribution will track changes in fruit supply, resulting that sites with high fruit availability should be heavily used by primates. During a 1-year study, fruit supply (ground fruit surveys) and primate density (line-transects) were monitored in twelve 2 km-long transects at monthly intervals. Fruit supply varied seasonally, being low during the dry season. The density of Ateles belzebuth was positively related to fruit supply during fruit shortage, but Cebus olivaceus and Alouatta macconnelli did not follow the same pattern. The supply of Sapotaceae fruit was an important component determining local distribution of A. belzebuth during the overall fruit shortage. Highly frugivorous primates such as A. belzebuth respond to seasonal decline in fruit supply by congregating at places with high fruit supply in this forest, particularly, those with many individuals of species of Sapotaceae. This study underscores the importance of small-scale spatiotemporal changes of fruit supply as a key component of frugivorous primate ecology in highly seasonal environments.</jats:p>",

However, capital investment to create, operate, and maintain facilities with sufficient scale to produce enough glucagon to treat millions of patients, at a level of profit that makes it feasible, will be substantial. It can be assumed that the marketplace will expect the daily cost of glucagon (to the consumer) to be similar to the daily cost of insulin. After one subtracts wholesaler and pharmacy markup, there may be very few dollars remaining for the drug company to cover profit, capital expenditures, marketing, burden, and other costs. Without the potential for adequate margins, manufacturers may not be willing to take the risk. Assuming that the projections discussed in this article are in the right ballpark, advance planning for the supply for glucagon needs to start today and not wait for the AP to come to market. </jats:p>",

By contrast, prices were relatively stable and did not increase for months after the earthquakes, even for goods that were experiencing severe stockouts. These trends are present at all levels of aggregation, but appear strongly in non‐perishable goods and emergency products. Our findings shed light into the determinants of sticky prices in conditions where traditional adjustment costs are less important. In particular, we look at the frequency and magnitudes of price changes in both countries and find that the results in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">C</jats:styled-content>hile are consistent with pricing models where retailers have fear of “customer anger”.

      "abstract": "<ns4:p>The reproductive assurance hypothesis states that self-incompatible female plants must produce twice the number of seeds relative to their self-compatible hermaphroditic counterparts to persist in gynodioecious populations. This is a viable life-history strategy, provided that pollination rates are sufficiently high. However, reduced pollination rates in alpine plants are likely due to climate induced plant-pollinator mismatches and general declines in pollinators. Using a gynodioecious population of the dominant plant <ns4:italic>Silene acaulis</ns4:italic> (Caryophyllaceae), we tested the reproductive assurance hypothesis and also the stress gradient hypothesis with a series of pollinator exclusion trials and extensive measurements of subsequent reproductive output (gender ratio, plant size, percent fruit-set, fruit weight, seeds per fruit, total seeds, seed weight, and seed germination). The reproductive assurance hypothesis was supported with female plants being more sensitive to and less likely to be viable under reductions in pollination rates. These findings are the first to show that the stress gradient hypothesis is also supported under a gradient of pollen supply instead of environmental limitations. Beneficiary abundance was negatively correlated to percent fruit-set under current pollen supply, but became positive under reduced pollen supply suggesting that there are important plant-plant-pollinator interactions related to reproduction in these alpine plant species.</ns4:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water authorities in West Java, Indonesia have difficulties in implementing water improvement programs due to lack of tools for prioritisation of water-related issues and their respective programs. To facilitate more efficient management of the water resources, the West Java Water Sustainability Index (WJWSI) was recently developed. This paper outlines the tasks for developing WJWSI and highlights the results of its application in one of West Java catchments, Citarum catchment. The results showed that five out of the thirteen indicators and sub-indicators, namely ‘Water Availability, Water Quality, Education, Water Loss and Poverty’, had low sub-indices and thus had poor performances. Then, the sub-indices were aggregated using the geometric aggregation method to produce the final index. The results of the aggregation indicated that the overall condition of water resources in Citarum catchment was considered poor, with a final index value of 20.04. Based on the WJWSI application, recommendations are suggested to the relevant authorities in the Citarum catchment. It is expected that the implementation of these recommendations will improve the performance of these five indicators and sub-indicators from Poor to at least the next higher level of Poor–Medium, thus improving the value of the final index from 20.04 to 37.19.</jats:p>",

The process begins with an examination of the needs of facility services. It is followed by the step of identifying available options in delivering and processing the services. The third stage involves modelling structures of FM supply chain network. Then to make a final decision, all possible models have to be evaluated for their optimisation, both quantitative (cost) and qualitative (performance). At the end, the model with best optimisation should be selected. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper proposes a conceptual framework for designing facility service supply chain strategy and configuration to fit with the specific nature of facility service demand of a given organisation.

It discusses close collaboration of joint and individual activities of supplier companies, with the inclusion of associations, organisations, universities and political flanking measures to help out.</jats:p><jats:p>The German suppliers' strengths include undisputed, distinctive engineering competence which has led to the development of numerous customer‐specific product solutions and production series. The products meet very special requirements, from ease of installation and operation right through to endurance. In German supplier companies, the engineering does not end with readiness for production, that is to say the production of an innovative technology. Even where system bids are “from a single source”, companies are increasingly enabling their customers to fulfil very particular, in‐demand requirements of function and operability while also improving transparency. Customer wishes and demands for standardised interfaces, training on the product and efficient and sustainable environmental protection (“green mining”) are moreover at the focus of all deliberations today. Increasingly, system solutions are striven for abroad and accentuate German suppliers with global offers all‐in‐all as something special.</jats:p><jats:p>Virtually all tasks set can be fulfilled comprehensively and pragmatically on the basis of appropriate references. Despite this, major and costly efforts are called for abroad in order to chalk up valuable orders. Against the background of the specific development of the foreign coal industry, acquisition costs need to be further trimmed, including through synergies, and additional customer benefits must be present.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Zielgerichtete Auslandsmarkterschließung durch neutrale, konzeptionelle Unterstützung der Bergbauzulieferbrache</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>Der Beitrag beschäftigt sich mit Möglichkeiten für eine erfolgreiche Auslandmarkterschließung vor dem Hintergrund der Einstellung der deutschen Steinkohlenförderung bis 2018. Diskutiert werden ein enges Zusammenwirken von Einzel‐ und Gemeinschaftsaktivitäten individueller Zulieferunternehmen unter Einschluss von Verbänden, Organisationen, Hochschulen und hilfsweise einer politischen Flankierung.</jats:p><jats:p>Zu den Stärken der deutschen Zulieferer gehören unbestritten ausgeprägte Engineering‐Kompetenzen, die vielfach zur Entwicklung zahlreicher kundenspezifischer Produktlösungen und Baureihen geführt haben Die Produkte erfüllen sehr spezielle Anforderungen von der Montage‐ und Bedienungsfreundlichkeit bis hin zu Standzeiten. Das Engineering hört in deutschen Zulieferbetrieben nicht mit einer Serienreife bzw. der Produktion einer innovativen Technik auf. Die Unternehmen versetzen zunehmend auch mit Systemangeboten “aus einem Guss” ihre Kunden in der Lage, sehr spezielle und nachgefragte Anforderungen an die Funktion und Bedienbarkeit bei gleichzeitiger Erhöhung der Transparenz zu erfüllen. Kundenwünsche und ‐forderungen nach abgestimmten Schnittstellen, Ausbildung am Produkt, bei effizientem und nachhaltigem Schutz der Umwelt (“green mining”) stehen darüber hinaus heute im Mittelpunkt aller Überlegungen. Systemlösungen werden im Ausland zunehmend angestrebt und akzentuieren deutsche Anbieter mit globalen Angeboten in Summe als etwas Besonderes.</jats:p><jats:p>Auf der Grundlage entsprechender Referenzen können damit nahezu alle Aufgabenstellungen umfassend pragmatisch erfüllt werden. Trotzdem bedarf es im Ausland großer und kostenintensiver Anstrengungen, um werthaltige Aufträge zu buchen. Vor dem Hintergrund der spezifischen Entwicklung der ausländischen Kohleindustrie müssen Akquisitionskosten, auch mittels der Nutzung von Synergien weiterhin verschlankt und zusätzliche Vorteile für Kunden präsent werden.</jats:p>",

The duration of sick leave is positively associated with waiting two weeks or more for primary care, technical investigations and specialists, compared to waiting one week or less. Except for waiting for a specialist, there is no indication that waiting four weeks or more is associated with longer durations of sick leave than waiting two to three weeks. Long waiting times for surgery is negatively associated with the duration of sick leave, which might be explained by prioritizing where patients with longer waiting times are those with less severe conditions. Including these waiting time variables did not induce substantial changes on the impact of traditional labor supply variables, which suggests that the parameter estimates of traditional variables are relatively robust. Published: Online August 2014.

The examples cover strategic, tactical, and operational topics encountered at BASF. We share our lessons learned, based on our experience from past OR projects in SCM, about challenges as well as benefits of standard and tailor‐made OR solutions. In general, we find that the special characteristics often call for a modification or enhancement of standard OR models.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A full realization of alternative energy such as biofuels depends on the existence of a viable supply chain (SC) network. An agent-based simulation approach is pursued to understand the dynamics of the biofuels SC network. The interests of three SC actors are represented: users, biorefineries, and farmers. Each actor type has a binary decision option: adoption or non-adoption of biofuels. This SC network model is characterized by distributed control, time asynchrony, and resource contention among actors, who make decisions based on incomplete knowledge and delayed information. The decision dynamics of these actors are modeled using a computational ecosystem construct. A preliminary set of coupled payoff function for each actor type and each decision is developed to represent interdependencies among SC actors. The simulation model was used to evaluate three archetypes of subsidy policy. The SC network behavior is observed in terms of fraction of actors adopting the biofuel option. The SC network shows behaviors ranging from fixed point equilibrium under no delay and perfect knowledge to periodic and chaotic oscillations. The network behavior is very sensitive to the time delay parameter that partly influences the quality of information on which actors’ decisions are based. Several regions of SC behavior are identified. In particular, a chaotic behavior was observed. The work provides a methodological basis for further development, including identification of policies to control undesirable system behaviors. </jats:p>",

Concern was heightened by the sudden and sharp increase in world food prices in 2007–08, but additionally other factors are now adjudged to pose a threat, such as climate change, oil shortages, increased use of biofuels, rapidly growing demand in China and India, embargos and international terrorism. This article focuses on one aspect of overall food security, that of external supply risks. It highlights an interesting parallel between the food security debate and that of security of energy supplies, and offers a quantitative assessment of the risks associated with external food supplies through application of an index borrowed from the recent literature on energy security. The index accounts for risks associated with (i) the number of supplying countries, (ii) the political and economic situation in each of these, and (iii) import dependency. A worked example for the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content>, using bilateral trade data for the period 1988–2010, shows that values of the index are very low with no clear trend. Consequently, external supply risks are not high with respect to food imports into the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content> and do not warrant alarm or undue concern.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently consumable carbon anodes are utilized in the aluminium production process. The major drawback of this type of anodes is the high amount of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. Furthermore, due to the consumption of the anodes during the electrolysis it is necessary to adjust the anode – cathode distance continuously and finally replace the anode. Introduction of hydrogen or natural gas through the anode can decrease the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions significantly and reduce the consumption of the anode. The use of inert porous anodes is interesting since the energy demand will be reduced due to natural gas/hydrogen participating in the anode reaction. However, due to unavailability of a sufficiently inert anode for aluminium electrolysis until now, carbon anodes seem to be more attractive. When natural gas/hydrogen is purged through the porous carbon anode, there will be competing anodic reactions depending on whether carbon from the anode or the CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reacts with the oxygen ions from the bath. Previous studies using porous carbon anodes showed 0.3 V depolarization as well as 20% decrease in carbon anode consumption using methane compared to passing argon through the anode<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>. On the other hand, using CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> can lead to the formation and evolution of additional hydrogen fluoride. This was studied before and some ideas on how to deal with this extra HF evolution were presented<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Decentralized production systems in supply chains / networks makes them more profitable and agile than traditional enterprises with centralized production systems. However, this decentralization makes supply chains / networks more vulnerable respect to uncertainties which are unavoidable. Today’s supply chains / networks producing and supplying their products to markets are characterized by uncertain demands (called demand-side uncertainty) and uncertainties associated with the performances of their constituent production facilities (called supply-side uncertainty). Supply-side uncertainty is due to the fact that there is not any perfect production system. Sparse literature of supply-side uncertainty management in supply chains / networks is only restricted to supply chains / networks with single-echelon supply processes. However most of the real case supply chains / networks have longer production processes involving suppliers of suppliers, suppliers, component manufacturers, assemblers, etc. In this paper we fill this gap of the literature by considering a supply chain/network with multi-echelon supply process including unreliable production facilities working in markets with uncertain demands. We show that in such a complex production process in addition to investigating the local effects of the uncertainties in the performances of their corresponding facilities, it is necessary to consider their global and cumulative effect on the performance of the entire supply chain/networks by following the propagation of these uncertainties in the flow of the material and product. Not only we introduce and describe the salient features of uncertainty propagation phenomenon in supply chains/networks, but also we demonstrate its quantification approach. Finally we propose mathematical models and solution approaches that can provide robust production plans for the supply chain/network that are protected against all demand and supply side uncertainties and their propagated effects. Performances of the proposed models and solution approaches are tested with test problems and a real case problem from automotive industry.</jats:p>",

These phenomena are: the recombination of photogenerated charges; the adsorption of trace organic pollutants; the spectral range of photocatalytic activity. The accomplishments and failures of the various and numerous attempts to overcome these fundamental limitations are summarized and discussed. The emphasis is on the methods susceptible to improve the use of photons, including those in the visible domain to better use solar irradiation if applicable, and to facilitate the contact between the semiconductor and the trace organic pollutants in liquid water. Despite numerous studies, these limitations have not yet been overcome for water purification, because additionally the photocatalysts must contain chemical elements that are both innocuous and inexpensive. However, combinations of TiO2 and activated carbon might provide materials of interest.</jats:p>",

Evaluating practical approaches for eliminating chlorinous off-flavors by consumers at point-of-use while avoiding production of toxic byproducts is a practical concern. Three recognized dechlorination methods: ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, ascorbic acid (AA) and hydrogen peroxide (HP), were evaluated for chlorinated and chloraminated waters. AA is the most efficient for removing free chlorine and chloramine from water samples. Three new chlorine-containing compounds were detected and identified from the reaction between AA and chlorine. High doses of UV irradiation at 254 nm virtually eliminated chlorine. HP could effectively remove free chlorine but was not effective for chloramine elimination. AA shows promise as a practical household dechlorination agent. However, to assure consumers about drinking water safety, further investigation is needed to evaluate any potential toxicity concerns for reaction products in treated water.</jats:p>",

Using a two‐method approach, the research summarized in this paper investigates the effectiveness of different supply chain risk management approaches by examining how performance varies when these approaches are applied under different risk conditions. The results counter prevailing knowledge regarding the appropriate use of such widely acknowledged risk management approaches as postponement and speculation, and highlight the dangers of functionally isolated decision making.

Hence, the user can balance the advantages of a redesign opportunity with the risk associated with its effect on the rest of the supply chain. Furthermore, ViSER offers lifecycle data representations that inform users’ decisions particularly in the context of eco-conscious re-design. Coupling such environmental data with graph-based visualizations of product architecture, ViSER provides a novel decision platform for designers with a range of expertise levels.

Optimization of water reservoir networks has been studied extensively for operating pumps efficiently. According to research, optimization reduces pump operation costs by approximately 10–20%. However, comparing economic benefits per country would be too complex because the effects of optimization differ depending on the power cost estimation system of each country and the existing operations. This study presents an optimization algorithm to minimize the operating costs of an entire system via the application of dynamic programming. Case studies were conducted to apply the algorithm to real values in four scenarios. By setting cost minimization as an objective, an optimum water pump operation plan was derived that encompasses operating conditions, variations in water demand, and energy costs. Results showed that operating a standby pump in an existing system can increase the system's efficiency. In addition, even if hourly water consumption remains constant, each case requires its own operating method, because each case has different operational costs. By considering various conditions such as those mentioned in this study, future pump operation schedules can be optimized and stabilized to maintain economic water supply.</jats:p>",

The raw water collected from Danube hydrographical basin showed significant pollution with potential pathogenic microorganisms with faecal origin such as Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter braakii, Providencia stuartii, and Enterococcus sp. Also other bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, total number of bacteria at 22 and 37 °C were detected, being related to high water oxidability. The microbial load was reduced considerably after the disinfection process. However, the total number of bacteria at 22 or 37 °C was constantly higher than the imposed limit and Clostridium perfringens was identified occasionally. The tap water presented a sporadic microbial loading with Enterococcus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli and constantly with total number of bacteria due to an improper water distribution network.</jats:p>",

In this article, we look into what resources are needed and how these resources evolve in the delivery of humanitarian aid. Drawing on the resource‐based view of the firm, we develop a framework to categorize the impact of local resources on the configuration of humanitarian supply chains. In contrast to other papers, the importance of localizing the configuration of the humanitarian supply chain is not only conceptually recognized, but empirical investigations are also provided. In terms of methodology, this article is based on the analysis of secondary data from two housing reconstruction projects. Findings indicate that the use of local resources in humanitarian aid has positive effects on programs’ overall supply chain performance and these effects are not only related to the macroeconomic perspective, but benefits expand to improvements related to the use of knowledge. At the same time, it was found that local sourcing often comes with a number of problems. For example, in one of the cases, significant problems existed, which were related to the scarcity of local supplies. Both housing reconstruction projects have indicated the continuous need for changes throughout the programs as a dynamic supply chain configuration is important for the long‐term sustainability of reconstruction aid.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, public charging stations for such vehicles will become common. Because the load introduced by such stations on the grid is high, the smart grid will need to balance the load among charging stations in an area while minimizing the charging waiting time. To achieve this goal, we propose two models where vehicles communicate beforehand with the grid to convey information about their charging need and location. In the first model, we develop a mathematical formalism for handling requests for charging vehicles at public charging station based on queuing theory. The second model extends the first one by considering priority queues with two EV classes, high and low, and a cut‐off service discipline. Both models are evaluated while considering mobility of vehicles in an urban scenario and time‐of‐use pricing. Finally, we propose two algorithms for directing vehicles to charging stations in a way to minimize either their waiting time to plug‐in or their waiting time to charge completion. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches when considering both real EV and charging station characteristics and constraints.

The majority of biomass is used for residential purposes in developing countries. Modern biomass use in industrialized countries is increasing, and more and more biomass is also traded to be used for energy purposes. The purpose of this paper is to locate the 15 largest ethanol, biodiesel, and wood pellet plants. Facilities generating heat, steam and electricity were left out. Secondly it is not generally known what share of biomass users are large plants. Also an effort is made to find out how much these large‐scale biomass refining plants use imported feedstock. For the most part, very large industrial processing facilities are found in a small number of countries. The largest ethanol mills are found almost exclusively in the United States, with one very large plant in the Netherlands. The distribution of biodiesel and wood pellet plants is more dispersed. The countries with the most large biodiesel plants include the USA, Brazil, Spain, and the Netherlands. The countries with the most very large wood pellet plants include the USA, Canada, Russia, and Germany. Torrefaction and pyrolysis technologies are still rarely used on industrial scale. Ethanol and wood pellet plants tend to be sourced from local feedstocks, while biodiesel plants are much more likely to use imported feedstocks or a mix of imports and local biomass. All of these fuels are increasingly traded through the international market. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

It was determined that increasing the ozone dose (0.2–0.8 mg O3/mg DOC) generally led to reductions in DOC (2–26%) and trihalomethane formation potential values (4–58%). Results of NOM fractionation showed that the reactivity of all the individual NOM fractions towards trihalomethane formation decreased after ozone oxidation (0.8 mg O3/mg DOC) by 47–69%, relative to the raw waters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Characterised with more integrated topology, simpler manipulations, less component count, and comparative higher efficiency, multiple‐input converters (MICs) become an attractive candidate in renewable energy hybrid systems (REHSs). To seamlessly and smoothly transit from one operating mode to another is one of the critical issues that the energy management strategy should concern about. Normally, the mode transition (MT) design is usually required for the auxiliary circuits and components, which runs opposite to the MIC's intrinsic advantages and may cause potential problems for the system's reliability and stability. The subproportion control (SPC) approach presented in this study combines two operating modes into a sole control algorithm module without any hardware assistance. The so‐called subproportion (SP) term is an additional control variable served as a certain proportion of the voltage‐regulation duty cycle, <jats:italic>d<jats:sub>v</jats:sub></jats:italic>. The product of SP and <jats:italic>d<jats:sub>v</jats:sub></jats:italic> composes the duty cycle for current limitation of the first power source, beyond which, a seamless and smooth MT can be automatically and spontaneously implemented. The small‐signal modelling for the three most‐commonly‐used topologies in the MIC family showed SPC's universal applicability. It was employed onto a 1 kW double‐input‐buck‐converter‐based fuel cells/battery REHS prototype for the verification of its control performance and auto‐MT capability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a conceptual planning framework for reverse supply chain operations based on an extensive literature review and industry expertise. Such a holistic scheme for classification of planning tasks is necessary as the intensification of research on reverse logistics and closed‐loop supply chains in recent years has raised a number of planning problems that differ from those of solely forward‐oriented supply chains. Up to now, a common and comprehensive definition of relevant planning problems along the reverse chain has not existed. Thus, a thorough understanding of the interdependence between these elements is missing. This paper aims to systematically identify planning problems, which are assigned to different planning horizons and distinct process stages of product recovery. The result is a classification scheme, called a ‘Reverse Supply Chain Planning Matrix’ (RSCPM), which categorizes planning problems and shows their interrelation in recovery operations. It serves both academia and practitioners as a holistic overview for planning and decision tasks. Moreover, decision‐makers are supported in identifying the relevant variables in reverse supply chains and in revealing the consequences of one decision regarding other parameters of the system. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the RSCPM is the first attempt to comprehensively structure the field of reverse supply chain research by identifying, defining and interconnecting planning problems within an integrated framework, as is common in the forward case.</jats:p>",

First, the interaction between internal integration and external integration improves customer performance and financial performance. The forwarders improve internal processes following information acquired from customers and the information is shared with logistics service providers, followed by high performance. Second, gaps in performance among levels of SCI are verified. Managers of the forwarders make strategic decision making on the basis of their recognition of environment and, as a result, the forwarders enjoy different performance.</jats:p>",

The University of South Africa (UNISA) is an ODL institution, and it has the largest academic library of its kind in Africa. The University is acknowledged as one of the mega-universities of the world with a student body approaching 400 000. In addition to providing an inter-lending service to this large student body and to 3,000 staff, the UNISA Library is a net-lender within South Africa’s inter-lending and resource sharing network. The Library’s inter-lending service forms part of the request services available to all its clients and to the wider community of participating libraries. Daily, an average of 2000 requests is received for processing, retrieval and delivery. This paper provides a brief overview of how the Library’s request service is managed and will discuss the technologies used to speed up the request process. It focuses on an automated radio frequency identification (RFID) transportation system to be implemented as part of the 21st century, newly redesigned UNISA Library. To ensure the speedy availability of material on the shelves after return, this system automatically transports materials via a Paternoster book lift to the respective levels within the Library. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The methodology used in this investigation encompassed a literature study and a study visit to a library where this automated delivery system had been implemented and information was gained from relevant service suppliers. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The UNISA Library found that it is feasible to use the system in terms of the large number of books to be transported from drop-off points to the respective levels. In accordance with the investigation of the number of trolleys to be pushed daily by staff from one point to another, the installation of an automated system will allow more time for shelf maintenance staff to attend to the processing of requests for material and other important but less urgent duties. This will impact positively on the speed of delivery of requests submitted by ODL clients who cannot visit the libraries together with those submitted by local and international inter-library loan partners who depend on the UNISA Library as a net-lender for material not available in their own collections. This will impact positively on availability of material on the shelves and the speed of delivery of requests for information resources submitted by ODL clients who cannot visit the ODL libraries and inter-library loan partners, nationally and internationally, who depend on the UNISA Library as a net-lender for material not available in their own collections. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Because rapid delivery of requested information resources has become very important to ensure just in time information, it is important to implement an internal delivery system to support the inter-lending process. This study is useful for libraries that need to deliver many physical items to a large client body.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

The aim is to give supplier reasonable suggestions on decision making of marketing strategy. The challenge of dealing with this problem is the discreteness of demand. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: one is to address the necessary conditions in which supplier can choose quantity discount policy as marketing strategy; the second is to provide the solving methods of the equilibrium strategy and discount rate under quantity discount policy. Two types of quantity discount marketing strategies are considered. It is concluded that the strategy sets of production and procurement are independent of discount rate via analyzing the optimality properties. Numerical tests illustrate that incremental quantity discount policy is more widely considered than all-unit quantity discount policy, and whether the quantity discount policy can be chosen as the marketing strategy not only relates to supplier's own cost structure but also retailer's cost structure. </jats:p>",

Results suggest that the type of land converted into switchgrass production is crucial to both plant gate cost and GHG emissions of feedstock. In addition, a tradeoff relationship between cost and GHG emissions for the switchgrass supply is primarily driven by the type of land converted. The imputed cost of lowering GHG emissions in the feedstock supply system was also calculated based on the derived tradeoff curve.</jats:p><jats:p>Biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is being advocated as an alternative to fossil-based transportation fuels in the United States. LCB-based biofuel production has the potential to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector and to enhance rural economic activity through more intense use of agricultural lands (English et al., 2006). The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) established in 2005 and revised in the Energy Independence and Security Act 2007 mandates 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuel (other than ethanol derived from corn starch) available for transportation use by 2022 with 16 billion gallons to be produced from LCB feedstock (U.S. Congress, 2007). Based on the recently revised One Billion Ton Update study (U. S. Department of Energy, 2011), considerable LCB feedstock, including dedicated energy crops, will be required to fulfill this goal. Notwithstanding the potential availability of LCB feedstock to meet the mandate, the cost of LCB feedstock will be an important factor influencing the sustainability of an LCB-based biofuel industrial sector.</jats:p>",

In the model, the supplier receives the raw materials, all are not of perfect quality, in a lot and delivers the items of superior quality to the manufacturer and the inferior quality items are sold at a reduced price in a single batch by the end of the cent percent screening process. The manufacturer produces a mixture of perfect and imperfect quality items. A portion of the imperfect items is transformed into perfect quality items after rework. Another portion of imperfect items, termed as `less perfect quality items', is sold at a reduced price to the retailer, and the portion which cannot be either transformed to the perfect quality items or sold at a reduce price is being rejected. Here, retailer purchases both the perfect and imperfect quality items from the manufacturer to sell the items to the customers through his/her respective showrooms of finite capacities. A secondary warehouse of infinite capacity is hired by the retailer on rental basis to store the excess quantity of perfect quality items. This model considers the impact of business strategies such as optimal order size of raw materials, production rate, and unit production cost in different sectors in a collaborating marketing system that can be used in the industry, like textile, footwear, and electronics goods. An analytical method has been used to optimize the production rate and raw material order size for maximization of the average profit of the integrated model. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the model.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the magnitude of the genotypic variability of root traits in common bean plants at two ontogenetic stages and two soil P levels. Twenty-four common bean genotypes, comprising the four growth habits that exist in the species and two wild genotypes, were grown in 4 kg pots at two levels of applied P (20 and 80 mg kg-1) and harvested at the stages of pod setting and early pod filling. Root area and root length were measured by digital image analysis. Significant genotype × P level and genotype × harvest interactions in analysis of variance indicate that the genotypic variation of root traits depended on soil nutrient availability and the stage at which evaluation was made. Genotypes differed for taproot mass, basal and lateral root mass, root area and root length at both P levels and growth stages; differences in specific root area and length were small. Genotypes with growth habits II (upright indeterminate) and III (prostrate indeterminate) showed better adaptation to limited P supply than genotypes of groups I (determinate) and IV (indeterminate climbing). Between the two harvests, genotypes of groups II and III increased the mass of basal and lateral roots by 40 and 50 %, respectively, whereas genotypes of groups I and IV by only 7 and 19 %. Values of the genotypic coefficient of determination, which estimates the proportion of phenotypic variance resulting from genetic effects, were higher at early pod filling than at pod setting. Correlations between shoot mass and root mass, which could indicate indirect selection of root systems via aboveground biomass, were higher at early pod filling than at pod setting. The results indicate that selection for root traits in common bean genotypes should preferentially be performed at the early pod-filling stage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this study was to identify the arterial supply to the thyroid gland and the relationship between the inferior thyroid artery (ITA) and the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) in fetal cadavers using anatomical dissection. The anterior necks of 200 fetuses were dissected. The origins of the superior thyroid artery (STA) and the ITA and location of the ITA in relation to the entrance of the thyroid lobe were examined. The relationship between the ITA and the RLN was determined. The origins of the STA were classified as: external carotid artery, common carotid artery (CCA), and the thyrolingual trunk. The origins of the ITA were the thyrocervical trunk and the CCA. The ITA was absent on the left side in two cases. The relationship of the RLN to the ITA fell into seven different types. Type 1: the RLN lay posterior to the artery; right (42.5%), left (65%). Type 2: the RLN lay anterior to the artery; right (40.5%), left (22.5%). Type 3: the RLN lay parallel to the artery; right (11.5%), left (7%). Type 4: the RLN lay between the two branches of the artery; right (1%), left (3.5%). Type 5: The extralaryngeal branch of the RLN was detected before it crossed the ITA; right (4.5%), left (0%). Type 6: the ITA lay between the two branches of the RLN; right (0%), left (0.5%). Type 7: the branches of the RLN lay among the branches of the ITA; right (0%), left (0.5%). The results from this study would be useful in future thyroid surgeries. Clin.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Population and industry growth in dry climates are fully tied to significant increase in water and energy demands. Because water affects many economic, social and environmental aspects, an interdisciplinary approach is needed to solve current and future water scarcity problems, and to minimize energy requirements in water production. Such a task requires integrated water modeling tools able to couple surface water and groundwater, which allow for managing complex basins where multiple stakeholders and water users face an intense competition for limited freshwater resources. This work develops an integrated water resource management model to investigate the water-energy nexus in reducing water stress in the Copiapó River basin, an arid, highly vulnerable basin in northern Chile. The model was utilized to characterize groundwater and surface water resources, and water demand and uses. Different management scenarios were evaluated to estimate future resource availability, and compared in terms of energy requirements and costs for desalinating seawater to eliminate the corresponding water deficit. Results show a basin facing a very complex future unless measures are adopted. When a 30% uniform reduction of water consumption is achieved, 70 GWh over the next 30 years are required to provide the energy needed to increase the available water through seawater desalination. In arid basins, this energy could be supplied by solar energy, thus addressing water shortage problems through integrated water resource management combined with new technologies of water production driven by renewable energy sources.</jats:p>"

The experiences of the MDG period generated important lessons about the strengths and limitations of current approaches to defining and monitoring access to drinking water and sanitation. The methods by which the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of WHO and UNICEF tracks access and progress are based on analysis of data from household surveys and linear regression modelling of these results over time.  These methods provide nationally representative and internationally comparable insights into the drinking water and sanitation facilities used by populations worldwide, but also have substantial limitations: current methods do not address water quality, equity of access,  or extra-household services. Improved statistical methods are needed to better model temporal trends. This article describes and critically reviews JMP methods in detail for the first time. It also explores the impact of, and future directions for, international monitoring of drinking water and sanitation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Cities around the world are increasingly involved in climate action and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, in the context of responding to climate pressures in the water sector, very few studies have investigated the impacts of changing water use on GHG emissions, even though water resource adaptation often requires greater energy use. Consequently, reducing GHG emissions, and thus focusing on both mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change in planning and managing urban water supply systems, is necessary. Furthermore, the minimization of GHG emissions is likely to conflict with other objectives. Thus, applying a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), which can evolve an approximation of entire trade‐off (Pareto) fronts of multiple objectives in a single run, would be beneficial. Consequently, the main aim of this paper is to incorporate GHG emissions into a MOEA framework to take into consideration both adaptation and mitigation responses to climate change for a city's water supply system. The approach is applied to a case study based on Adelaide's southern water supply system to demonstrate the framework's practical management implications. Results indicate that trade‐offs exist between GHG emissions and risk‐based performance, as well as GHG emissions and economic cost. Solutions containing rainwater tanks are expensive, while GHG emissions greatly increase with increased desalinated water supply. Consequently, while desalination plants may be good adaptation options to climate change due to their climate‐independence, rainwater may be a better mitigation response, albeit more expensive.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Direct out‐of‐pocket payments for healthcare continue to be a major source of health financing in low‐income and middle‐income countries. Some of these direct payments take the form of <jats:italic>informal charges</jats:italic> paid by patients to access the needed healthcare services. Remarkably, however, little is known about the extent to which these payments are exercised and their determinants in the context of Sub‐Saharan Africa. This study attempts therefore to shed light on the role of supply‐side factors in the occurrence of informal payments while accounting for the demand‐side factors. The study relies on data taken from a nationally representative survey conducted among people living with HIV/AIDS in Cameroon. A multilevel mixed‐effect logistic model is employed to identify the factors associated with the incidence of informal payments. Results reveal that circa 3.05% of the surveyed patients incurred informal payments for the consultations made on the day of the survey. The amount paid informally represents up to four times the official tariff. Factors related to the following: (i) human resource management of the health facilities (e.g., task shifting); (ii) health professionals' perceptions <jats:italic>vis‐à‐vis</jats:italic> the remunerations of HIV care provision; and (iii) reception of patients (e.g., waiting time) significantly influence the probability of incurring informal payments. Also of note, the type of healthcare facilities is found to play a role: informal payments appear to be significantly lower in private non‐profit facilities compared with those belonging to public sector. Our findings allude to some policy recommendations that can help reduce the incidence of informal payments. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Here, we show that misexpression of a subset of cone genes in the<jats:italic>rd7</jats:italic>mouse hybrid rods enables them to access the normally cone-specific retina visual cycle. The rapid supply of chromophore by the retina visual cycle dramatically accelerated the mouse rod dark adaptation. At the same time, the competition between rods and cones for retina-derived chromophore slowed cone dark adaptation, indicating that the cone specificity of the retina visual cycle is key for rapid cone dark adaptation. Our findings demonstrate that mammalian photoreceptor dark adaptation is dominated by the supply of chromophore. Misexpression of cone genes in rods may represent a novel approach to treating visual disorders associated with mutations of visual cycle proteins or with reduced retinal pigment epithelium function due to aging.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Holocene changes in fine-grained sediment supplies to the East China Sea outer shelf were uncovered, through the mineralogical and geochemical analysis of Core B3 in the East China Sea Distal Mud (ECSDM). Based on the lithology, accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C dating, and sea-level change, Core B3 can be divided into two major units: transgressive stage (Unit 1: 12.5–6.8 kyr) and highstand stage (Unit 2: 6.8–0 kyr). Significant discrepancy of dolomite/calcite ratio in the fine fractions (&lt;16 µm) of Changjiang (dolomite/calcite = 3:1) and Huanghe (dolomite/calcite = 1:22) sediments was used as a new uniqueness provenance tracer to distinguish these two riverine sources. Both of the dolomite/calcite ratio and rare earth elements fractionation parameters in the fine-grained sediment indicated distinct provenance shifts of Core B3 during the Holocene. Unit 1 of Core 3 (12.5–6.8 kyr) mainly consists of the reworked and resuspension sediments of the East China Sea shelf during the Holocene transgression, while Unit 2 sediments (6.8–0 kyr) are most likely sourced from the Changjiang and Huanghe. Moreover, mixing curves of dolomite/calcite ratio reveal that the ECSDM continuously received the Changjiang sediment since 6.1 kyr with notable fluctuations, whereas the Huanghe sediment supply began in 6.8 kyr but abruptly stopped during 4.2–0.8 kyr and then appeared again since 0.8 kyr. Temporal changes of the Changjiang and Huanghe fine-grained sediment contribution to the ECSDM are closely related to the formation of modern oceanic circulation system since 6.8 kyr (shelf sea-level change), the ‘4.2 kyr’ climate event, and the followed transition to cold and dry climate condition in the northeastern China (global climate change), as well as the artificial shift of lower Huanghe course in ad 1128 in the war against invasion of the northern nomadic nation (human activities). </jats:p>",

In contrast to this focus, we examine the optimal length of the selling period—which we refer to as <jats:italic>market exit time</jats:italic>—in the context of a novel inventory replenishment problem faced by a supplier of a new, trendy, and relatively expensive product with a short life cycle. An important characteristic of the problem is that the supplier applies a price skimming strategy over time and the demand is modeled as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with an intensity that is dependent on time. The supplier's problems of finding the optimal order quantity and market exit time, with the objective of maximizing expected profit, is studied. Procedures are proposed for joint optimization of the objective function with respect to the order quantity and the market exit time. Then, the effects of the order quantity and market exit time on the supplier's profitability are explored on the basis of a quantitative investigation.

Haemolysates provide a stable glycolytic system in which membrane permeability is not a flux‐controlling step, and they enable the concentration of NADH to be adjusted experimentally while keeping the rest of the sample with the same composition as that of the cytoplasm of the cell (albeit diluted twofold at the time of injection of the [1,<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]pyruvate).

By constructing an appropriate mathematical model and by using a Markov‐chain Monte Carlo approach, we fitted experimental data to estimate LDH and NADH concentrations.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There are no standard constructs or pillars of SCM excellence in literature, based on review of 57 SCM framework articles identified from 21 peer reviewed journals, which revealed that none of the constructs exhibited frequent repetition. This meant that none of the construct can be considered as a standard pillar of SCM. Thus in order to establish pillars of SCM excellence, an empirical investigation is carried out in the Indian manufacturing industry. A survey questionnaire was used to collect responses from the Indian manufacturing industry. The observed variables were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) to find out underlying pillars of SCM excellence. The SCM excellence framework was found to be consisting of nine pillars. The framework of SCM excellence was then subjected to evaluation of reliability of pillars, followed by examining their construct, convergent and discriminant validity. The nine pillars of SCM excellence obtained after PCA, exhibited 204 constructs. Later when the reliability of each pillar was maximized, the number of constructs reduced to 133. The final cronbach's alpha values for these nine pillars ranged from 0.71 to 0.94, which is considered to be a good indicator of reliability of the scale. The examination of convergent and discriminant validity established the SCM excellence framework in Indian manufacturing industry. The study presented in the paper is unique, since such an attempt to derive pillars of SCM excellence, and empirical investigation of SCM excellence framework in Indian manufacturing industry has never been attempted in extant literature. </jats:p>",

Here, we studied OsHAK5 of the KT/HAK/KUP family in rice (Oryza sativa). We determined its cellular and tissue localization and analyzed its functions in rice using both OsHAK5 knockout mutants and overexpression lines in three genetic backgrounds. A β-glucuronidase reporter driven by the OsHAK5 native promoter indicated OsHAK5 expression in various tissue organs from root to seed, abundantly in root epidermis and stele, the vascular tissues, and mesophyll cells. Net K influx rate in roots and K transport from roots to aerial parts were severely impaired by OsHAK5 knockout but increased by OsHAK5 overexpression in 0.1 and 0.3 mm  K external solution. The contribution of OsHAK5 to K mobilization within the rice plant was confirmed further by the change of K concentration in the xylem sap and K distribution in the transgenic lines when K was removed completely from the external solution. Overexpression of OsHAK5 increased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots and salt stress tolerance (shoot growth), while knockout of OsHAK5 decreased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots, resulting in sensitivity to salt stress. Taken together, these results demonstrate that OsHAK5 plays a major role in K acquisition by roots faced with low external K and in K upward transport from roots to shoots in K-deficient rice plants.</jats:p>",

With increases in income, population, and demand for more nutrient‐dense foods, global meat production is projected to increase by 206 million tons per year during the next 35 years. These changes in population and dietary practices have led to a tremendous rise in the demand for food protein, especially animal‐source protein. Consuming the required amounts of protein is fundamental to human growth and health. Protein needs can be met through intakes of animal and plant‐source foods. Increased consumption of food proteins is associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions and overutilization of water. Consequently, concerns exist regarding impacts of agricultural production, processing and distribution of food protein on the environment, ecosystem, and sustainability. To address these challenging issues, the New York Academy of Sciences organized the conference “Frontiers in Agricultural Sustainability: Studying the Protein Supply Chain to Improve Dietary Quality” to explore sustainable innovations in food science and programming aimed at producing the required quality and quantity of protein through improved supply chains worldwide. This report provides an extensive discussion of these issues and summaries of the presentations from the conference.</jats:p>",

We argue that securing the protection of vital urban flows mediated through infrastructures is a key objective of cities under attack. In doing so we contend that examining how those affected by the interruption of these flows cope with the situation represents a valuable but largely neglected form of water management. We illustrate how quotidian knowledge about the urban geography of water flows may have important repercussions for the war effort itself. In a nutshell, the case of Madrid offers an early account of the critical role of water workers in sustaining “urban ecologies under fire” securing the complex urban metabolism while also contributing to the struggle against invading forces.</jats:p>",

An assessment of the different categories of ecosystem services at various levels has become necessary for sustainable use and conservation. This study seeks to identify and characterize provisioning ecosystem services affecting rural households in the Tolon and Wa West Districts of northern Ghana. It examines the key dynamics of these services and discusses the major factors influencing their supply and utilization. The study employs rapid rural appraisal methods, including key informant interviews, household questionnaires surveys, focus group discussions, and participatory observations for collecting primary data. Findings indicate an extensive use of all provisioning services examined: bushmeat, crop and animal production, fish catches, fodder and forage, fuelwood, building materials, fresh water, and wild plants by households at all study sites. Averagely, 80% of households across the study sites collect and utilize these variety of services to support livelihood strategies. Our study also identified major challenges for sustainable supply and use of these ecosystem services, including the growing scarcity and decline in these services attributed to closely connected drivers such as cyclical drought, climate variation, land conversion, overharvesting, and a decline in traditional ecological knowledge. This study thus demonstrates the need for an integrated assessment that examines, at the local level, the interactions of various ecosystem services and human well-being to provide a scientific basis for formulation of effective coping and adaptation strategies in the midst of these challenges.</jats:p>",
