      "abstract": "<jats:p>The chief purchasing officer (CPO) plays a critical role in ensuring supply contributes effectively to organizational goals and strategies. The selection of the individual who will become the company's first CPO is especially important. A reporting line establishment occurs at the same time as an appointment of a first CPO when a large organization centralizes a previously decentralized supply function. Using case‐based methodology, this research in large North American and European organizations examined 26 appointments of the first CPO and corresponding reporting line establishments. Data collection and analysis covered six aspects: drivers, CPO background, reporting line, the key decision makers and influencers involved in the decision, tenure of the first CPO and tenure of the first reporting line. It was found that changes in corporate strategy accounted for nearly 80 percent of the first CPO appointments and the CEO had a major say in decisions related to who would be hired as the first CPO as well as his or her reporting line. Almost 30 percent of internally recruited CPOs did not have any supply experience. However, externally recruited CPOs always had supply experience, but did not necessarily come from a CPO position. The CPOs reported to a variety of different positions, with the CEO and VP shared services being the most popular. The average tenure for the first CPO was more than one year longer than his or her reporting line. The potential implications for supply executives are explored. Opportunities for future research are also identified.</jats:p>",

The aim of this article is to introduce the construction of GSCM system that improves collaborative relationships between an EEE manufacturer and its suppliers. The study is conducted in three steps. Firstly, the four elements, which are necessities to form collaborative relationships between an EEE manufacturer and its suppliers, are described. Secondly, the condition and construction of GSCM system including the four elements is proposed. Finally, we presented the method that the GSCM system is constructed as a practicable tool in the initial stage by a case study held in Shimadzu Corporation.</p>",

This paper provides an economic-engineering analysis of water supply alternatives to cope with agricultural, environmental and urban water needs projected to year 2025. Analysed alternatives include idealised water markets, wastewater reuse, seawater desalination and infrastructural expansions. Network flow optimisation using CALVIN (CALifornia Value Integrated Network) was employed. A database of the water system was built to include hydrology; agricultural, environmental and urban demands infrastructure, and economic information on operating costs and economic value of water. For the coastal cities, results show that wastewater reuse along with other already projected infrastructure expansions is overall the most economically promising alternative. Water markets offer leverage and flexibility for future urban needs. However, some locations cannot take advantage of domestic water markets with current aqueduct capacities. Worthwhile investments in infrastructure include an expanded aqueduct connecting coast and inland water supply systems. Furthermore, at current urban water prices and operating costs, seawater desalination is uneconomical for Baja California. Computer models are useful to better understand water-related issues in a region and provide a technical basis for developing and comparing long-term water management solutions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Aftermarket sales and profits are becoming an increasingly important part of an original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) business model. Because replacement parts often do not require further manufacturing, OEMs act as intermediaries in the aftermarket. As with any intermediary, the OEM must concern itself with suppliers disintermediating its supply chain selling replacement parts directly to the OEM's customers. We frame supply chain disintermediation (SCD) as a principal–agent contracting problem between an OEM buyer and a supplier. Hypotheses relate contract conditions, goal incongruence, supplier capabilities and contract enforcement to SCD. The data are collected from the aerospace industry using a multimethod study, combining an Internet‐based survey with archival data. Causal modeling with structural equation modeling (SEM) shows general support for the hypotheses. Particularly, SCD is positively related to buyer–supplier goal incongruence. The agency model offers insights that differ from previous transaction‐cost‐based models of buyer–supplier relationships. OEM buyers with a lucrative aftermarket should consider aligning goals through incentives rather than relying entirely on economic hostages associated with specific assets.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business academics have focused their attention on empirical investigation of programs' effect on organizational competitive performance. These studies primarily emphasize theory building. With the many definitions of theory, academics are not certain whether their research papers meet the specific requirements for theory development required by the academic field of the philosophy of science. Certainly, supply chain academics generally believe that their academic articles fulfill the requirements of theory building. Although many of these articles do have elements of theory, more focus is needed on the specific requirements of theory to assure that academic research is “good” theory building. The primary purpose of this research paper is to logically develop a set of guidelines to assist empirical researchers to assure that their studies fulfill the requirements of good theory based upon traditional scientific theory building. By fulfilling the requirements of good theory, researchers will develop studies that will have a lasting impact on their academic field. To achieve a lasting impact on an academic field, it is necessary to follow a logical plan. This article provides a plan for logical guidelines for developing an understanding of how and why “good” theory building is achieved. This article logically develops a formal conceptual definition of theory along with its related properties to understand these guidelines. Next, it analyzes the requirements of theory, “good” theory, and their properties. These guidelines are included in the existing philosophy of science publications. However, this article consolidates these sources and logically explains why these guidelines are needed. In the conclusion, the guidelines are summarized to serve as a summary checklist for supply chain researchers to use for ensuring their articles will be recognized as a contribution to the academic field. So in that sense, this article does not develop a revolutionary new insight into theory‐building empirical articles, but rather integrates diverse traditional philosophy of science requirements into a much simpler set of guidelines. Through logical development of these guidelines, researchers will understand the structure of theory and how to ensure their studies can be modified to have a lasting impact on the field of supply chain management.</jats:p>",

We first investigate whether trust can form at this stage. Then we examine two factors that may affect trust formation: the communication channel employed by the buyer and the amount of complexity involved in the purchase. Hypotheses are tested with a behavioral experiment (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>=117) comparing three communication media (face‐to‐face, email, and Internet reverse auctions) and two levels of procurement complexity. Results show that trust formation does occur at the price determination stage; however, the <jats:italic>degree</jats:italic> to which trust grows depends on the communication channel employed and on the level of procurement complexity. Our study enhances managerial understanding of the possibility of developing (or eroding) trust early in the buyer‐seller relationship, and it sheds light on the appropriateness of various supplier selection tools under various conditions. In addition, this research contributes to the supply chain management field by complementing the existing trust literature which typically focuses on interorganizational trust that is formed or eroded later in the supply relationship.</jats:p>",

However, the role of the information technology (IT) capability of these 3PL providers has not drawn much research attention. The way in which 3PL providers develop IT capability and how IT capability affects their competitive advantage deserve further investigation. This study has developed and tested a research model to address these issues. By integrating the concept of technology orientation from the strategic orientation literature into the resource‐based theory, we investigate both the antecedents and the consequences of IT capability among 3PL providers. The model was tested using survey data collected from 105 3PL firms in China. The results show that technology orientation has a significant impact on resource commitment to IT and managerial involvement in developing IT capability of 3PL firms. It also indicates that IT capability significantly affects three important dimensions of the competitive advantage of these firms, namely, reducing costs, providing innovative and customized services, and improving service quality. This study is one of the first to adopt the resource‐based perspective to investigate IT capability issues in the 3PL industry. It provides valuable insights for 3PL managers, and emphasizes the importance of technology orientation in the development of strong IT capability among 3PL firms.</jats:p>",

This is partly because of the importance of affordability for the recruitment and retention of key workers, many of whom are on national pay scales and earning salaries that do not fully reflect the differences in prices that exist, in particular between London and the South East and the rest of Great Britain. Government policy is to increase the supply of housing in order to improve affordability in the greater South East. However, assuming that this expansion in housing supply is also to be accompanied by an expansion in employment, the outcome is that there will be both an increase in supply and in demand for housing, with the counter-intuitive result that, under one of the scenarios set out in this paper, in some areas affordability will worsen rather than improve. </jats:p>",

It focuses on the period from the last two decades of the nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth, roughly the period between the introduction of the central waterworks and the closure of the Ottoman mains and public fountains. This article considers the interaction of these two systems and indicates that the supply of water by centralized waterworks and via fountains existed side-by-side for more than six decades, making this dual system a characteristic feature of Istanbul’s water supply for many years. The conflict between various technological solutions was especially pronounced, and during the period under consideration the story of water supply is to a large extent one of competition between fountains and taps. Within this framework, this article examines how previously free water became a priced commodity, and how the centralized supply reinforced structures of social inequality.\n\t</jats:p>",

Such asset management strategies should assist the network owners to evaluate the condition of the water distribution network, assess historical incident data (leakage or breakage) and risk of failure, visualise areas of high risk, propose “repair or replace” strategies and prioritise the work based on the inherent risk and cost of action. The methodology and support system outlined in this paper can form an integral part of a leakage management strategy and provide a useful decision-making tool. The work presented outlines an integrated methodology and a decision support system for arriving at such “repair-or-replace” decisions, as part of a long-term pipeline asset management program that could be undertaken by a water utility to improve on the reliability of the water distribution networks.</jats:p>",

Complete inactivation of total coliforms was observed in 6 h when solar radiation exceeded ∼500 W/m2.Under high contamination and overcast conditions, prolonged exposure was needed. Moderate turbidity (38 NTU) did not reduce the inactivation efficiency, but slightly enhanced it. No regrowth of microorganisms was observed after 24 h following solar disinfection. No significant difference in the inactivation kinetics was observed for bottle sizes in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 L. Tests with naturally occurring and laboratory-grown organisms indicated that laboratory-grown organisms were inactivated faster than naturally occurring organisms.</jats:p>",

Model waters containing well characterised natural organic matter (NOM) extracts in addition to DOC-free model waters containing sulphate and bicarbonate were used in all experiments. The NOM extracts used in this work included two reference fulvic acids supplied by the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS): Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) and Pony Lake Fulvic Acid (PLFA). These reference fulvic acids possess unique chemical characteristics that are representative of their distinct end-member environments. The charge density of the NOM extracts, obtained by potentiometric titration, was used to perform charge balance analyses for ion exchange reactions involving DOC, sulphate, bicarbonate and chloride. For SRFA, the results clearly show the stoichiometric exchange of DOC and bicarbonate for chloride. This work provides an improved understanding of the interactions between NOM, MIEX resin and the background solution matrix, and should result in more effective applications of ion exchange treatment for the removal of DOC during drinking water treatment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Italian drinking water treatment plants (DWTP), the problem of chlorination by-products control is very important as the Italian drinking water regulations (Dlgs. 31/2001, as enactment of the CEU directive 98/83) set very strict limits for these compounds. A possible strategy for controlling the concentrations of DBPs (disinfection by-products) is the application of treatment processes able to reduce the concentration of dissolved organic matter, the main precursor of DBPs, before the dosage of chlorine-based disinfectants. Recently, ion exchange resins for the removal of dissolved organics have shown several applications in drinking water treatment. In this experimental study, the treatment with ion exchange resins MIEX®DOC and the treatment with GAC (granular activated carbon) were evaluated for the removal of dissolved organics. Moreover, the effects of MIEX® pre-treatment on the subsequent GAC filtration phase were evaluated, with particular attention to the effects on the life-time of the GAC filter. The GAC filter operation was simulated by rapid small scale column tests (RSSCT), which allow the evaluation of the GAC breakthrough curve in a shorter time with respect to a full plant and pilot plant trials. On the basis of the experimental results, the ion exchange process was very efficient in dissolved organics removal (60–70% UV254 removal). Moreover, the results indicated that the application of ion exchange resins as pre-treatment in a conventional drinking water treatment train could increase the filter life-time in the subsequent GAC adsorption phase (about 200%) resulting in potentially important cost benefits for the overall treatment process.</jats:p>",

There is a lack of understanding of the phenomenon from strategic management and international business perspectives. This article conceptualizes international subcontracting as a type of relational contract formed by buyers and suppliers from different countries, aiming to facilitate the sourcing of products or components with buyer-specific requirements. It builds a transaction cost model for studying the strategic choice of international subcontracting as an intermediate governance structure, sitting between arm’s length outsourcing arrangement and vertically integrated multinational enterprises (MNEs). A set of propositions are developed to aid future empirical research and to provide managers with some guidelines for organizing supply chain across borders. The model also allows managers to examine the complex nature of a range of subcontracting relationships and identify the specific mechanisms that can be used to preserve and manage the dyadic principal-subcontractor exchanges.</p>",

The objective of this study was to investigate the adsorption of these odour causing compounds by three types of activated carbon fibres (ACF) with different micropore size distributions, namely ACC-25, ACC-20 and ACC-15. Adsorption for both MIB and geosmin was well defined by Freundlich isotherms. For MIB, the adsorption capacity increased with an increase in micropore volume of the adsorbents whereas in the case of geosmin, the adsorption was much more complex. Isotherms were also conducted for ACF adsorption for MIB and geosmin in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) to better understand competitive adsorption. Overall, the ACF ACC-25 was the most effective adsorbent for both MIB and geosmin and was least affected by the competitive effect of the NOM because of its wider distribution of micropores. Adsorption isotherms were also conducted with a granular activated carbon F-400 to compare adsorption with the ACFs. F-400 was found to have significantly lower adsorption capacity for both MIB and geosmin when compared to the ACFs and also the presence of NOM significantly reduced its adsorption capacity due to competitive adsorption.</jats:p>",

Each tool is equipped with seven SBSE stir bars, magnetic stirring roads coated with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) phase, allowing the sorption of water organic compounds into PDMS at each tap opening. To study the efficiency of these passives samplers, a private network pilot unit has been created in our laboratory, equipped with four faucets in series, solenoids valves for automation of the system and a mixing chamber, developed to spike drinking water with odourous compounds in order to have homogenous smelling water at each tap. After enrichment, the bars are taken out and are then in-line thermo-desorbed and analysed by gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer. Results showed a high sensitivity of the system, which was able to quickly analyse odourous compounds at the sub ng/L level. A “multishot” method was developed to analyse every molecule trapped on the seven stir bars in only one chromatographic run increasing sensitivity. To follow enrichment of stir bars, loading and unloading were studied and showed a very slight unloading of the stir bar under a clean water flow rate which allowed us to previously spike every stir bar with an internal standard to see analytical variations. The influence of heated water was also investigated and seems to lead to a higher unloading of the stir bar, but according to a qualitative aspect this loss is balanced by the high sensitivity.</jats:p>",

This paper studied the effect of cost increment distribution patterns on the performance of a JIT Supply Chain.

In particular, we (i) analyze when there are pure equilibrium policies in this setting and characterize the structure of these policies; (ii) consider coordination mechanisms; and (iii) present some preliminary computational results.

Cohorts are defined by year of graduation from medical school. The results for male GPs indicate that there is little age effect on hours of direct patient care, especially among physicians aged 35–55, there is no strong cohort effect on hours of direct patient care, but there is a secular decline in hours of direct patient care over the period. The results for female GPs indicate that female physicians on average work fewer hours than male physicians, there is a clear age effect on hours of direct patient care, there is no strong cohort effect, and there has been little secular change in average hours of direct patient care. The changing behaviour of male GPs accounted for a greater proportion of the overall decline in hours of direct patient care from the 1980s through the mid‐1990s than did the growing proportion of female GPs in the physician stock.

The incidence of PAM is widespread in Australia, with reports from South Australia, Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. One of the key issues for water utilities is the potential widespread distribution of N. fowleri and its ability to infect and re-infect drinking water supplies. In Western Australia, the majority of drinking water supplies are operated by the Water Corporation.

The supplier builds capacity based on original forecast information, and the manufacturer places its order after observing improved (but imperfect) demand information. We study three types of wholesale price purchasing arrangements: (1) when the wholesale price is determined to be exogenous to the supply chain; (2) when the supplier sets the wholesale price; and (3) when the manufacturer sets the wholesale price. Although improved demand information reduces the demand uncertainty that the manufacturer faces, the manufacturer is constrained by the supplier's capacity decision. In all three cases, we show that improved information can decrease the supply chain's expected profit, even as the supplier's capacity increases with improved information. Because improved demand information always increases the centralized supply chain's expected profit, we present a contract that coordinates the channel and provides flexibility in dividing systemwide profit. </jats:p>",

The Philadelphia Water Department has developed a baseline for its water's aesthetic qualities since the early 1980’s. Philadelphia feels it has sufficient resources to control taste and odour problems. However, when directly asked, only 61–64% of the consumers are satisfied with the taste and odour of Philadelphia's drinking waters. A taste and odour early warning system is being developed for the two drinking water sources, the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers. Secondly, routine T&amp;O panels and chemical analysis of geosmin and MIB are completed. Since the year 2000, 10 ng/L has become an early warning wake-up call for PWD. When higher levels are observed, testing is a priority, the source of the T&amp;O is investigated and consumer complaints are monitored carefully. Present water treatment plants are conventional with chlorine disinfection, coagulation/sedimentation, rapid dual media filtration and final chloramination. The PWD uses powdered activated carbon, river water bypass and hydraulic changes in the distribution system to minimise odour events.</jats:p>",

To this end, we model the change in working hours before and after divorce by using a multilevel approach, estimating the impact of both micro- and macro-level determinants. Although we find empirical evidence for the hypothesis that a country's institutional environment plays an important role in facilitating employment as a strategy for mothers to cope with their financial losses following partnership dissolution, our conclusion is that the change in labour supply is more responsive to the whole of a country's family policies rather than to so-called ‘domain-specific’ indicators of formal and informal childcare provision. Furthermore, our empirical evidence suggests that at the micro-level, formal and informal childcare strategies are connected. The complementary role of informal support systems, facilitating the use of formal childcare, is an important finding from a policy point of view. However, further research will have to make clear which conditions have to be fulfilled in order to help divorced mothers to combine work and care, thus enabling them to mitigate the economic consequences of partnership dissolution.</jats:p>",

The poverty model used for the analysis is based on the production behavior of the communities' residents, and is estimated using Census 2000 data. The difference in regional poverty rates is explained primarily by variation in the quality and quantity of communities' labor supply. Significant differences among rural, metropolitan, and metropolitan-adjacent communities are detected in determinants of poverty. In particular, a weak labor demand contributes to higher rates of rural poverty. Moreover, poverty rates are more persistent in rural areas and small towns. A higher average age of labor force is associated with a decrease in poverty rates. However, this effect becomes evident only after the ages of thirty-five to thirty-seven in rural areas, implying a slower accumulation of experience than in urban areas. Results imply that urban and rural poverty should be treated with area-specific policies that accommodate the difference in sources of poverty. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Low-pressure membrane filtration systems, such as microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF), have received a great deal of attention in the past 15 years due to their ability to remove microbial pathogens, especially Cryptosporidium and Giardia. The major concern for the application of membrane technology is, however, how to ensure integrity of these barriers, since small defects in membranes could result in a significant reduction in pathogen removal efficiency. In order to ensure safe drinking water treatment, a number of environmental agencies request the membrane operators to conduct regular direct integrity tests to control the microbial log removal values (LRV) of the plants. Typically, test conditions must be selected to provide information on defects larger than 3 μm to ensure Cryptosporidium removal. In that context, the objective of this project was to develop and validate, both at bench-scale and full-scale, a model based on the equations proposed by USEPA and ASTM that uses the air flow rate throughout a defect during the air pressure test for predicting the microbial LRV. The project was conducted on a pressurised low-pressure membrane module. MS2-phages were used at bench-scale to validate the model and the selected assumptions with various calibrated defects carried out on the membrane fibres. The validity of the model was then evaluated at full-scale. A user-friendly tool using the Hagen Poiseuille Model proposed by the ASTM was developed to assist membrane operators in the integrity monitoring. The calibration of the model with full-scale tests resulted in adjusting some key-parameters representing air diffusion, flow regime and particles deposition. The numerical applications provide a very reliable result in predicting the pathogen removal efficiency and the equivalent number of broken fibres. This model could detect one complete broken fibre out of more than 700,000 fibres, which guaranteed more than 4 log of microorganism removal efficiency.</jats:p>",

The growth in length and complexity gradually replaces the traditional linear supply chains with extended supply networks comprising not only suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and end customers, but also service providers. With the increasing use of third-party logistics (3PL) providers by international firms seeking integrated logistics services, many global 3PL providers are forming partnerships with large corporations to take care of the latter’s logistics operations in different regions. The selection of the right 3PL provider for alliance is therefore paramount to the success of global supply chain management. This article investigates the significance of this subject and proposes a supplementary framework for evaluation of 3PL providers as global logistics partners for international firms. The framework focuses on the core competencies of 3PL providers and their abilities to attain economies of scale helping users achieve their outsourcing objectives.</p>",

But the results have been mixed. While in some cases effective implementation of SCM practices led to improvement in performance matrices, in others positive results could not be achieved. This research is intended to study the impact of implementing supply chain management practices on competitive potential of Indian automobile industry as this industry has taken the lead in adopting SCM practices in Indio. From the research, it is found that three SCM practices, namely, customer service employee training, improving production processes, and maintaining central information database for supply chain hove positive correlation with the overall competitive potential. Moreover; two SCM practices, namely, customer service employee training and on-site suppliers supplying standardized ports con have significant positive relationship with cost saving and return on assets (ROA) factor of competitive potential. It is well known that quality is no more about quality of product only; quality of information, quality of material flow, and quality of relationships assume high importance in contemporary globally competitive environment where both product life cycle and manufacturing cycle time are reducing at a faster rate than ever before. This study also brings out some SCM practices that significantly affect quality of information, quality of material flow, and quality of relationships in the Indian automobile supply chains. </jats:p>",

Statistical analysis was conducted to examine the effects of nine fouling chemicals on the UV transmittance changes of fouled quartz lamp sleeves. The results demonstrated that the main effects were attributable to surface concentrations of iron and manganese. The surface concentrations of calcium and copper had no significant effects on the UV absorbance of fouled sleeves. The interaction effects of copper with iron and magnesium with manganese were also revealed from the statistical analysis. The model is able to give reasonable predictions of the UV absorbance characteristics of foulants from other UV systems. However, several limitations of this model were identified. First, the model does not accurately predict the absorbance at relatively high chemical surface concentrations. Second, the model does not account for the possible effects of anions and organics on UV absorption of fouled quartz sleeves.</jats:p>",

This work is divided into two parts, pesticide elimination (I) and natural organic matter removal (II) in membrane system concentrates. Seven commonly detected pesticides in French surface waters, i.e. atrazine, sulcotrione, bentazone, isoproturon, diuron, glyphosate and acetochlore, were selected as the model micropollutants. Removal/degradation of these pesticides was studied by testing conventional processes employed for potable water production, i.e. adsorption, oxidation by ozone and clarification. Only partial removal of these pesticides was achieved with conventional processes. Removal of nonpolar pesticides was obtained by adsorption and rapid degradation of most of the pesticides was observed with low ozone dosages, except for atrazine and its metabolites. On the other hand, only the phosphonate-based pesticides were removed by clarification. By combining these processes, however, almost complete removal of the selected pesticides was achieved. Simultaneous ozonation and adsorption in the same reactor seems to be the most promising option for this study.</jats:p>",

This is in line with the study’s main intention of assessing the determinants or drivers for effective SCM of small businesses and their impact on the realization of competitive advantage. The findings suggest an interesting perspective on SCM and distribution channel functions among SMEs where elements of information sharing, cooperation, and integration are linked to competitive advantage. The correlation amongst the three independent variables of cooperation, information sharing, and integration with competitive advantage are all significant, depicting the relevance for SMEs to focus on these relational elements. The highest correlation is noted between information sharing and integration and this definitely makes sense as SMEs strive to integrate their functions that are moving towards the attainment of common goals. Thus, the more integrated the functions amongst supply chain and distribution partners, the more likely that information would be shared amongst them. However, it is interesting to note that the predictive ability of the relational elements of cooperation, information sharing, and integration on competitive advantage is not supported through the regression analysis. In other words, the existence of cooperation, information sharing, and integration amongst supply chain and distribution channel members do not necessarily predict that competitive advantage will be attained. There are perhaps other factors that should be considered besides relational elements that influence competitive advantage. </jats:p>",

Using data from 1990 to 2006, this article investigates the country-specific factors that have impact on the apparel imports of EU-5 as well as USA, and their top five apperel suppliers. Panel data estimation approach is utilized with an exploration at the aggregate level. The results indicate strong support for the model with determinants including GDP, population growth rates, female employment, value added factors, and common membership.

A methodology for unconditional (planning) and conditional (operation) risk evaluation is presented in this study. The risk evaluation is carried out by means of an optimisation model based on genetic algorithms aimed to define thresholds for the implementation of mitigation measures tested through Monte Carlo simulation that makes use of a stochastic generation of streamflows. The GA enables the optimisation of reservoir storages which identify monthly thresholds for shifting three states of the system (normal, alert and alarm) to which correspond different mitigation measures such as water demand rationing, additional supplies from alternative sources or reduction of release for ecological use. For unconditional risk evaluation a long time horizon has been considered (40 years), while the conditional risk evaluation is performed on a short time horizon (2–3 months). Results of simulations have been studied by means of consolidated indices of performance and frequency analysis of shortages of a given entity corresponding to different planning/management policies. A multi‐use water system has been used as a case study including competing irrigation and industrial demands. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In the second year of the study, samples were also taken at the entry point into the forebays and analysed to determine if the forebays contributed to removal of analytes prior to diversion in the retention ponds. EC, which had been used as the determining factor of whether runoff is used to recharge or diverted to holding ponds, did not relate to nutrient levels. This indicated that EC is insufficient to determine water quality because runoff with low EC may contain high levels of nutrients that can support eutrophication. Monitoring of nutrients themselves is essential for decisions.</jats:p>",

Approximately 85 percent of China's milk is produced in northern China, where 40 percent of the country's population reside. In contrast, only about 15 percent of the milk is produced in China's south, where 60 percent of China's population reside. This has resulted in a significant gap between milk production and consumption in southern China and this gap is expected to rise. This paper considers China's milk demand and supply situation, analyzes the likely potential for China to expand its milk production and explores options for meeting milk demand—supply shortages.

The authors address this issue by decomposing U.S. county-level employment into four supply components: net commuting, the employment (unemployment) rate, the labor force participation rate, and population. They find that over all counties, net commuting represents the largest supply response, although this primarily holds in metropolitan areas. The benefits to original residents, measured as the sum of unemployment and labor force participation responses, are larger in rural counties. They also are larger in central-city counties of the larger metropolitan areas. The greatest benefits are found in persistent-poverty nonmetropolitan counties as well as in mining and manufacturing-dependent nonmetropolitan counties. Finally, sensitivity analysis indicates the importance of geographical scale and periodicity in assessing the issue of who benefits from regional job growth. </jats:p>",

The distal end of the femur was cleared in methyl salicylate and perfused vessels were studied in the intact bones. Each distal femur was then sawed into 5 mm thick slabs in the transverse plane, and the slabs decalcified and radiographed. Finally, the lateral trochlear ridge was separated from each slab and examined histologically.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: The cartilage canal blood supply regressed with increasing age, but several regions remained vascularised in the oldest foal at age 7 weeks. Vessels arose from perichondrial and subchondral arterial sources, and coursed perpendicular or parallel to the ossification front. The midsection of parallel vessels became incorporated into the ossification front during growth. Anastomoses formed and vessels within the distal portion of canals with an original perichondrial source shifted to use subchondral vessels as their arterial source. Both parallel and perpendicular vessels therefore traversed the ossification front to enter cartilage canals. No histological lesions were observed in sections from any of the foals.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>: The same anatomical feature (traversing the ossification front to enter cartilage canals) reported to render vessels vulnerable to failure in the tarsus was also present in the distal femur of foals.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Potential relevance</jats:italic>: OC may occur by the same pathogenetic mechanism in the distal femur as in the tarsus of foals.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Poor overwinter survival caused by low food availability represents the most likely mechanism behind the decline, and failure to recover, of many farmland passerine populations. Management to enhance food resources is now in place via agri‐environment schemes (AESs) such as Environmental Stewardship in England, but the measures concerned probably fail to provide a significant seed resource in late winter. Landscape‐scale experimental feeding over six winters was used to investigate the variation in demand for supplementary food from farmland birds between November and March. Quadratic modelling of the temporal variation in (semi‐)weekly bird‐use data from experimental feeding stations showed some evidence of curvilinear changes through the winter for all of the 11 granivorous or omnivorous species considered. For generalists and human‐associated granivores, peak use of supplementary food was found in January or earlier, suggesting that harsh weather is the principal influence. However, peaks occurred in February or later for Yellowhammer, Reed Bunting, Chaffinch and Dunnock, suggesting an effect of ambient food availability. These species depend on seed in farmland in winter and three of them have declined, probably because of reduced survival (rather than poor breeding success). It is likely that current farming practices, including existing agri‐environment prescriptions, do not provide enough food in late winter for such species and that the loss of set‐aside will exacerbate this problem. Revisions of management guidelines and crop content for AES stubble and sacrificial crop prescriptions are needed to ensure late winter seed availability for farmland birds.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The aim of this paper is to investigate the reliability parameters estimation method for the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems using the Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) technique. FTA is a top–down approach to identify all potential causes leading to system failure. The computation of the system's failure probability is the main goal of this analysis, as this value can be used to calculate other important system reliability parameters such as failure rates, mean time between failures and reliability. In this paper, the FTA method was applied to five different UPS topologies and the results obtained were compared and discussed in detail. By comparing the critical fault path of the system, it was found that the inverter failures contributed most significantly to the system failure. It was also found that the probability of failure of a UPS system can be reduced by the inclusion of bypass supply, given that the failure rate of the events that causing the failure of the bypass supply should be lower compared to the ones for the main utility supply. Finally, to validate the results obtained from this method, comparisons were made to the results from other methods such as the Reliability Block Diagram, Boolean Truth Table, Probability Tree, Monte‐Carlo Simulation and Field Data reliability estimation methods.

Oestrous cycle was synchronized in 16 Manchega sheep using progestagen sponges and cloprostenol. Half of the animals were treated from days 0 to 4 by the oral administration, twice daily, of 200 ml of a glucogenic mixture containing 70% of glycerol, 20% of 1,2-propanediol and 10% of water; the control group received 200 ml water. The mean (±<jats:sc>s.e.m.</jats:sc>) plasma glucose increased immediately after the first administration (3.9±0.3 vs 3.0±0.1 mmol/l in control group, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05), remaining statistically different during the treatment. However, plasma ghrelin levels were similar in both groups. On the other hand, the results indicated that short-term energy inputs modify ovulation rate (1.9±0.1 vs 1.3±0.2 in control group, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05) by increasing the number of follicles able to be selected to ovulate during the period of treatment (≥4 mm in size; 5.9±0.6 vs 4.3±0.4 at day 2, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05). After sponge withdrawal, the number of these follicles decreased throughout follicular phase (5.8±0.8 to 1.5±0.4, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.0005) while the number of large follicles increased (≥6 mm in size; 0.8±0.4 to 2.0±0.3, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05); this would indicate an active growth of preovulatory follicles that were not found in the control group. Thus, the increases of ovulation rate by high-energy inputs would be caused by an enhancement in the developmental competence of preovulatory follicles.</jats:p>",

Whether the slowdown was mainly caused by the demand or the supply effect is unclear. An innovative empirical approach is adopted that uses the short‐side rule of bank loans' market transactions to help infer the relative shifts of the demand and supply. For the disaggregate data, a novel model is proposed that accommodates the short‐side rule and yet requires only data from the borrowers or the lenders. We find that a large decline in supply is mainly responsible for the slowdown, and we identify the deposit drain and the increase in overdue loans as the main contributing factors. Results also indicate that smaller firms are disproportionately affected by the credit cutback, and that shrinkages in alternative financing sources might have indirectly contributed to the excess demand.</jats:p>",

However, the rapid economic growth has engendered serious natural resource depletion and pollution. Pollution and ecological degradation are becoming essential obstacles for China's further growth. Under the situation, the concept of circular economy (CE) was promoted in China as a new development strategy to alleviate the shortage of resource supply by improving the resource productivity and the eco‐efficiency of production and consumption, which will accelerate the economic transformation from economic growth to economic development. The difference of the two modes is that economic growth relies on a continuing increase of resource inputs while economic development relies on the improvement of efficiency (resource productivity and eco‐efficiency). © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2008</jats:p>",

As part of this approach, a management framework incorporating multiple barriers is necessary and there is a need to validate those barriers through scientific evidence. This paper reports on a study undertaken to validate the effectiveness, in terms of pathogen numbers, of having protected watersheds. The study aimed to determine if the deer population in a protected watershed carried Cryptosporidium and whether or not it was human infectious. Deer faecal samples were collected from the protected watersheds over a 12 month period and analysed using a new method, developed as part of this project, for genotyping Cryptosporidium. Early results showed the presence of Cryptosporidium, but following a refinement in the method no human infectious Cryptosporidium was detected. The results give some confidence that having protected watersheds is an effective barrier against pathogen contamination. They do not, however, imply that continued monitoring and management of the deer should cease. To maintain compliance with the Water Safety Plans, continual validation of barrier effectiveness is required.</jats:p>",

In this study, groundwater flow models incorporating particle tracking and reaction were used to analyze the response of water quality in PSW to land use change in four communities: Modesto, California (Central Valley aquifer); York, Nebraska (High Plains aquifer); Woodbury, Connecticut (Glacial aquifer); and Tampa, Florida (Floridan aquifer). The water quality response to measured and hypothetical land use change was dependent on age distributions of water captured by the wells and on the temporal and spatial variability of land use in the area contributing recharge to the wells. Age distributions of water captured by the PSW spanned about 20 years at Woodbury and &gt;1,000 years at Modesto and York, and the amount of water &lt;50 years old captured by the PSW ranged from 30% at York to 100% at Woodbury. Short‐circuit pathways in some PSW contributing areas, such as long irrigation well screens that crossed multiple geologic layers (York) and karst conduits (Tampa), affected age distributions by allowing relatively rapid movement of young water to those well screens. The spatial component of land use change was important because the complex distribution of particle travel times within the contributing areas strongly influenced contaminant arrival times and degradation reaction progress. Results from this study show that timescales for change in the quality of water from PSW could be on the order of years to centuries for land use changes that occur over days to decades, which could have implications for source water protection strategies that rely on land use change to achieve water quality objectives.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Classic anatomical dissection of 150 hearts from adults aged 18–80 years was performed. The sinoatrial (SA) node artery was most frequently a large atrial branch of the right coronary artery (63%), arising at a mean distance of 1.2 cm (range 0.2–2.2 cm) from its beginning, with a mean external diameter of 1.7 mm (range 1–3 mm). In 37% of cases the SA node artery was a branch of the left coronary artery or one of its branches, with an initial mean external diameter of 2.2 mm (range 2–3 mm). The origin of the SA node artery was not related to coronary arterial dominance. The atrioventricular (AV) node artery was the first and longest inferior septal perforating branch of the right (90%) or left (10%) coronary artery, arising from the U- or V-shaped segment of the corresponding artery at the level of the crux cordis. Mean external diameter was 2 mm (range 1–3.5 mm). The origin of the AV node artery was dependent on coronary arterial dominance. Identification of the anatomical variants of the arterial blood supply to the SA and AV nodes may help in overcoming potential difficulties in treating arrhythmias and in mitral valve surgery. </jats:p>",

The game has a bilevel demand with one level during regular times and another during sale times. The game could be played in two modes (independence and cooperation) and has been field tested in engineering and business classes. Players developed an appreciation for fluctuating demand and its impact on the costs and performance of a SC. They also learned the benefits and a monetary evaluation approach for cooperation. Our statistical analysis revealed that, as the game progressed, the performance of the teams improved. We present an integer linear programming (ILP) model to evaluate the performance of the teams. Because it is a post facto analysis, while the game is played without knowing the materialized retailer demand for the period, the ILP solution is not a tight lower bound on the total cost of the SC. However, it could be used to compare performance across teams. As an alternative, we also present a possible distribution of total SC costs that could be used as another reference without actually solving an ILP.</jats:p>",

We show that the time of nitrogen supply regulates the course of leaf senescence in flag leaves of <jats:italic>Hordeum vulgare</jats:italic>. The senescence‐specific decrease in chlorophyll content and photosystem II efficiency is clearly delayed when plants are fertilised with nitrate at the onset of leaf senescence. Concurrently, the additional supply of nitrate affects expression patterns of two marker genes of nitrogen metabolism. As shown by quantitative RT‐PCR analyses, senescence‐specific downregulation of plastidic glutamine synthetase (<jats:italic>GS2</jats:italic>) and senescence‐specific upregulation of lysine‐ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase (<jats:italic>LKR/SDH</jats:italic>) are both clearly retarded. Depletion of nitrogen in experiments using hydroponic growth systems results in premature primary leaf senescence. The already started senescence processes can be even reversed by later nitrogen addition, as proved by a further increase in photosystem II efficiency and chlorophyll content, returning to the high values of controls which had not been deprived of nitrogen. Although both addition of nitrate or ammonium effectively reversed nitrogen depletion‐induced primary leaf senescence, addition of urea did not. Additionally, effects of nitrogen supply on the course of leaf senescence were analysed in the model plant <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana.</jats:italic> Leaves of <jats:italic>A. thaliana</jats:italic> show the same reversion of senescence processes after receiving additional nitrogen supply, indicating that the nitrogen response of leaf development is conserved in different plant species.</jats:p>",

The forest's monthly nitrate supply varied by a factor of 50, while measured net nitrogen acquisition varied only fivefold. Maximum net nitrogen acquisition rates for fronds in the forest interior were 0.18 mmol N g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> month<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> during spring upwelling in 2005 and declined fourfold during autumn until upwelling resumed the following year. Modeled gross nitrogen uptake with consideration of Michaelis–Menten kinetics for nitrate and mass transfer limitation was higher than observed net acquisition except during the warm stratified summer and autumn months, when net acquisition exceeded modeled gross uptake. This shortfall indicates that the kelp forest received over half its nitrogen from sources other than nitrate such as ammonium from epibionts. Most of the nitrate in the forest was delivered as a result of upwelling‐favorable winds and convection. Internal waves and local streams contributed &lt;9% of the nitrate delivered to the forest on an annual basis and 20% during stratified periods. Kelp used less than 5% of the nitrate supplied to the forest. Nitrate delivery to this modest sized kelp forest was roughly equivalent between alongshore (45%) and cross‐shore flows (55%), which distinguishes it from large kelp forests in which cross‐shore flows dominate exchange.</jats:p>",

The results of our study suggest that\n            <jats:italic>R. eutropha</jats:italic>\n            is strongly flagellated in the exponential growth phase and loses a certain number of flagella in transition to the stationary phase. In the stationary phase under conditions permissive for PHB biosynthesis, flagellation of cells admittedly stagnated. However, under conditions permissive for intracellular PHB mobilization after a nitrogen source was added to cells that are carbon deprived but with full PHB accumulation, flagella are lost. This might be due to a degradation of flagella; at least, the cells stopped flagellin synthesis while normal degradation continued. In contrast, under nutrient limitation or the loss of phasins, cells retained their flagella.\n          </jats:p>",
