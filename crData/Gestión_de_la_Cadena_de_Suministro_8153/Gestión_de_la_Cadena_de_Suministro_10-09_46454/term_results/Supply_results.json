For most companies around the world, resources have been reduced, inventory drained, technology spending curtailed, and core processes scaled back in order to adjust to the current reality of reduced demand. In an uncertain recovery, supply chain operations need to be more scalable and flexible as they anticipate economic recovery and increase capacity. Moreover, this can be easier to achieve coming out of a severe recession.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>This work first explains why scalability and flexibility benefits are potentially easier to achieve when rebuilding supply chain operations out of a severe downturn. Second, a rationale is provided to show how a scalable and flexible supply chain mitigates multiple risks from economic uncertainty during a recovery where a more traditional fixed‐cost approach does not. Third, a four‐step approach is described that businesses can follow to identify and capture supply chain opportunities where a scalable and flexible model might be most sensible to consider.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>More scalable, variable cost supply chain operations have clear advantages over more traditional cost ones, especially when the economic recovery includes a high level of uncertainty and there is a risk of reentering a renewed recessionary period. There may be no better time than now for enterprises in any industry to consider adopting a more variable cost supply chain to limit risk and capture the most revenue growth opportunity.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The concepts of centralization, utilizing temporary and part‐time labor, and outsourcing are certainly not new ones and many companies have already benefited from adopting these ideas in their supply chains. However, it has not been widely recognized that these same concepts pose heightened and renewed opportunity for any business across industries because of how the global recession has changed their business landscape. Since companies have already downsized labor forces, drained inventory levels, closed facilities, and cut other costs dramatically, there is a tremendous opportunity to evaluate new, more variable‐cost business models as they grow operations to meet renewed demand.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

One of its salient characteristics was the architectural and hydraulic function of its water supply and sewerage systems in the Minoan Palaces and several other settlements. These technologies, though they do not give a complete picture of water supply and wastewater and storm water technologies in ancient Greece, indicate nevertheless that such technologies have been used in Greece since prehistoric times. Minoan water and wastewater technologies were diffused to the Greek mainland in the subsequent phases of Greek civilization, i.e. in the Mycenaean, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic and Roman periods. The scope of this article is the presentation of the most characteristic forms of ancient hydraulic works and related technologies and their uses in past Greek civilizations.</jats:p>",

Two rainfall patterns are considered with similar average annual depths but very different temporal distributions. Supply reliability and the extent of reliance on the public distribution system are identified as suitable performance indicators for mains water infrastructure. A uniform temporal distribution of rainfall in an oceanic climate like that of Dinard, Northern France, yielded supply reliabilities close to 100% for reasonable tank sizes (0.065 m3/m2 of roof area in Dinard compared with 0.262 m3/m2 in Nice with a RWSO of 30% for a detached house). However, the collection and use of rainfall results in a permanent decrease in mains water demand leading to an increase in water age in the distribution network. Investigations carried on a real network showed that water age is greatly affected when rainwater supplies more than 30% of the overall water demand. In urban water utilities planning, rainwater supply systems may however be profitable for the community if they enable the deferment of requirements for new mains water infrastructure.</jats:p>",

Research into quantifying the benefits of implementing SCM in construction has been very limited; the literature for the construction industry generally discusses how SCM concepts can be adopted, or what problems and challenges inhibit such adoption, without analyzing and quantifying the effects of these techniques on an actual construction project. No analytical approach or special-purpose simulation tool has yet been developed to facilitate such quantitative analysis for construction projects. This paper presents a construction supply chain simulation toolkit that is capable of modeling different supply chain problems and is compatible with other construction simulation tools.

Specifically, whilst information sharing improves operational performance when low and high quality information is exchanged, incentive alignment and joint decision making only improve operational performance when the information is of high quality.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Although research on the performance impact of collaborative supply chain practices has advanced over the past decade, there is still a scarcity of research acknowledging the multidimensional nature of collaboration. Additionally, the importance of information quality for the success of collaborative practices has not been firmly established. The paper addresses this void in the literature by reporting results of an empirical study examining collaborative supply chains and practices within the German automotive industry. The paper will thus be beneficial to supply chain managers considering collaborative practices and will support further empirical research work in the collaborative supply chain research field.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

It demonstrates that, because of the non‐monetary nature of Web 2.0, several sources of inefficiencies (search costs, externalities, crowding out and adverse selection) exist. Nonetheless, the economic nature of digital products and the expected low value of most online content make it impossible to adopt a simple market scheme for Web 2.0. In contrast, this paper introduces a concept of demand‐driven Web 2.0 (as opposed to the current Web 2.0, which is supply‐driven) that is expected to provide stronger incentives, through financial reward, for high quality content within a Web 2.0 environment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The international trade supply chain has grown in complexity to a point where clear visibility is masked from those who need to know what is going on. International conventions cover the transport of goods between seller and buyer but concentrate more on limiting liabilities than they do on ensuring the accurate description of the goods. The person who knows what is being sent into the supply chain is the person who packed the box or consigned the goods. If the packing list is wrong, not used or hidden from view then the transport documents such as way bills and the manifest are likely to be inaccurate. This poses safety, security, legal compliance and commercial risks. Information required by border enforcement agencies is being asked for further upstream in the supply chain, prior to the goods being loaded. But the consignor, who holds the key to the majority of that information is outside the jurisdiction of the importing country’s authorities so they turn to the carrier and the importer instead. Unfortunately, information held by the carrier is not always accurate and Customs hold the importer accountable for goods they have probably never seen. In these days of information management rather than the physical control of the goods, the role of export data is increasingly important. A multilateral, international legal framework with enforceable jurisdiction is needed with more emphasis placed on the point at which the international movement of the goods begins. The consignor and the true packing list play a key role. A new key performance indicator and critical way-point must be created called the Consignment Completion Point. A web-based, seamless, electronic data ‘pipeline’ needs to link the seller/consignor and the buyer/consignee and the interested economic operators in between. Real-time, accurate data must be assured from the beginning, updated as the goods move, and shared in a risk based, layered approach.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>According to a recent study more than 90 percent of water treatment plants utilizing chloramination for distribution system residuals indicate a certain level of dissatisfaction toward the process performance. One factor that may lead to such dissatisfaction is the inadequacy of mixing when ammonia is added to chlorinated water. If mixing is not instantaneous and uniform, the actual chlorine to ammonia nitrogen molar ratio will become variable at a micro-level, even though the overall ratio at the macro-level is close to the desired 1:1 ratio. Because of the non-uniform mixing, certain portions of the mixture might have a molar ratio exceeding the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. In such instances, certain unintended reactions (e.g. breakpoint type of chlorine chemistry) can occur. This will lead to the resultant monochloramine concentration being significantly less than the stoichiometric concentration, based upon the calculation using the overall molar ratio. Other factors, such as pH variation in the micro environment, could also affect the final chemical composition of the chloramination process. In this study, the effect of mixing was studied by conducting breakpoint chlorination experiments under different levels of mixing, represented by the average velocity gradient, G in s−1. A unique way of plotting breakpoint chlorination curve was utilized to analyze the data, which allowed a clear delineation if the monochloramine formation was according to the stoichiometry. A quantitative comparison between experimental data and stoichiometry can clearly indicate the impact of non-uniform mixing. The experimental data showed that as the G value increased from 35 to 500 s−1, the monochloramine formation increased from 75 to 87 percent of the stoichiometric value. The location of the breakpoint, correspondingly, increased from a molar ratio of 1.25 to 1.75. Comparison of 40 s−1 (50 rpm) and 300 s−1 (200 rpm) experimental data was conducted and a breakpoint curve was plotted imposing one over the other. It has been observed from previous literature that in ideal conditions, breakpoint occurs at chlorine to ammonia nitrogen molar ratio of 1.5:1, and the peak of monochloramine is expected at a molar ratio of 1:1. Hence, breakpoint curve was plotted at mixing speed of 50 and 200 rpm, indicating free chlorine, monochloramine, dichloramine, trichloramine, and total chlorine concentration at contact time of 45 minutes. Few studies were found in literature on mixing effects in chloramination. Data from a previous study was re-analyzed and compared with the current study, and a similar trend was observed. In another case study, the design G value for a modern water treatment plant in metropolitan Boston was found to be 800 s−1, which was higher than the maximum G value used in this study (500 s−1), and is likely to be more than sufficient. In conclusion, when chlorine and ammonia are combined to produce monochloramine, the degree of mixing indeed has significant impact on the performance of the chloramination process, and therefore must be a critical consideration in its design and operation.</jats:p>",

Water supply management to the peri-urban areas of the developing world is a complex task due to migration, infrastructure, paucity of fund etc. A cost-benefit methodology particularly suitable for the peri-urban areas has been developed for the city of Kolkata, India. The costs are estimated based on a neural network estimate. The water quality of the area is estimated from samples and a water quality index has been prepared. A questionnaire survey in the area has been conducted for relevant information like income, awareness and willingness to pay for safe drinking water. A factor analysis has been conducted for distinguishing the important factors of the survey and subsequent multiple regressions have been conducted for finding the relationships for the willingness to pay. A system dynamics model has been conducted to estimate the trend of increase of willingness to pay with the urbanizations in the peri-urban areas. A cost benefit analysis with the impact of time value of money has been executed. The risk and uncertainty of the project is investigated by Monte Carlos simulation and tornado diagrams. It has been found that the projects that are normally rejected in standard cost benefit analysis would be accepted if the impacts of urbanizations in the peri-urban areas are considered.</jats:p>"

However, for the first time in the history of our planet, climatic change is today caused by human activity. This situation of global crisis is caused by a series of factors that make of the present emergency a new scenario, exposing entire areas of the planet to the risk of lack of water and desertification. However, desert and desertification are two different things. The desert is characterised by a precise ecological balance established in the course of time by specific climatic conditions. These precise conditions have generated knowledge capable of facing adversities with appropriate techniques for capturing and distributing water, for preserving soil, for recycling and for the economical use of energy. The paper analyse the different solutions adopted in ancient periods in order to cope with water scarcity. In particular the study compares the Neolithic experiences in the Puglia Region and in the Sassi di Matera (Italy) with similar structures in the rest of Mediterranean. These traditional solutions are today proposed in a new innovative form to cope with environmental crises.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In environmental engineering, identification of problems and their solutions as well as the identification of the relevant processes involved is often done by means of case study analyses. By researching the operation of urban drainage and water distribution systems, this methodology is suited to evaluate new technologies, strategies or measures with regard to their impact on the overall processes. However, data availability is often limited and data collection and the development of new models are both costly and time consuming. Hence, new technologies, strategies or measures can only be tested on a limited number of case studies. In several environmental disciplines a few virtual case studies have been manually developed to provide data for research tasks and these are repeatedly used in different research projects. Efforts have also been invested in tackling limited data availability with the algorithmic generation of virtual case studies having constant or varying boundary conditions. The data provided by such tools is nevertheless only available for a certain instance in time. With DynaVIBe (Dynamic Virtual Infrastructure Benchmarking), numerous virtual case studies are algorithmically generated with a temporal development of the urban structure (population and land use model) and infrastructure. This provides a methodology that allows for the analysis of future scenarios on a spatio-temporal city scale. By linking a population model with DynaVIBe's infrastructure models, socio-economics impacts on infrastructure and system coherences can be investigated. The problematic of limited case study data is solved by the algorithmic generation of an unlimited number of virtual case studies, which are dynamic over time. Additionally, this methodology can also be applied on real world data for probabilistic future scenario analysis.</jats:p>",

Five parallel local permeate fluxes with a distance interval of 20 cm along the channel were monitored continuously during the organic filtration tests. It was found that organic fouling became more severe towards the outlet of the channel. This might be mainly attributed to the salt concentration polarization formation along the channel. The higher salt concentration downstream increased the interactions involved in organic fouling such as charge-screening and alginate-calcium bridging, which intensively promoted organic fouling formation in the downstream. A higher feed flow was a common option to mitigate fouling at most lab-scale RO research work, but not the case in this long membrane channel. A higher feed flow changed the organic fouling development profile along the channel, but would not eliminate organic fouling.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A large number of lines of water collection wells were identified by aerial surveys in the arid region near the ancient city of Sauran on the Middle Syr Darya (South Kazakhstan, Central Asia). They are locally called karez, which in Persian means ‘water uplift’. Initially these were assumed to be qanat, a water collection and distribution system that is widespread in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia. Recent surveys discovered more than 100 km of such lines in the Sauran area. The most surprising discovery was that there was no evidence of galleries that might have collapsed due to poor construction or maintenance. The excavations of a series of these wells are described and a new model for water transport and delivery is proposed that takes advantage of the local hydrogeology. The study has historical significance for the reconstruction of water and land use in the Turkestan oasis during the last 2000 years; and the rediscovery of this forgotten technique could have economic significance for modern land reclamation in desert zones.</jats:p>",

Good employees might well be a company's best resource but they do not come cheap and many businesses are inevitably looking to the “quick fix” of redundancies to remove a few salaries from the some balance sheet. By contrast, the total spend with suppliers is seen as an “untouchable” area. This might well overlook the savings to be made by better management of the supply chain.</jats:italic></jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Provides strategic insights and practical thinking that have influenced some of the world's leading organizations.</jats:italic></jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Provides strategic insights and practical thinking that can have a broader social impact.</jats:italic></jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>The briefing saves busy executives and researchers hours of reading time by selecting only the very best, most pertinent information and presenting it in a condensed and easy‐to‐digest format.</jats:italic></jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several goals can be considered when optimizing blends from multiple water resources for urban water supplies. Concentration-response relationships from the literature indicate that a changed water quality can cause impacts on health, lifetime of consumer goods and use of water additives like softeners. This paper describes potential economic consequences of diluting Copenhagen's drinking water with desalinated water. With a mineral content at 50% of current levels, dental caries and cardiovascular diseases are expected to increase by 51 and 23% respectively. Meanwhile, the number of dish and clothes washer replacements is expected to decrease by 14%. In economic terms these changes are equal to 24–85% of water production costs in 2005. Our calculations further indicate that the economic impact from changing the water quality can be at least as significant as the change in operating costs going from fresh water based to desalinated water supply. Large uncertainties prevent the current results from being used for or against desalination as an option for Copenhagen's water supply. In the future, more impacts and an uncertainty analysis will be added to the assessment.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, by distinguishing between motivations for using e‐auctions and attitudes towards them, procurement professionals are found to have a negative attitude to e‐auctions, but at the same time their motivations for using them are significantly linked to building relationships with their suppliers. This suggests that the potential of e‐auctions as a powerful procurement tool is being realised, but as yet has not been fully developed and implemented. The implications are that procurement managers should focus on developing the use of e‐auctions in a more strategic way to maximise both their effectiveness and the investment in them for the longer term.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Fertilisation increased the SPAD values significantly (P&lt;0.001). The significantly highest SPAD value, in both dry years and those with average rainfall, was achieved by applying 60 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>fertiliser active ingredient at the 6-leaf stage, and 120 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>at both the 12-leaf stage and the 50% silking stage.The correlation between fertilisation and SPAD values was greatly affected by the year, being closest in 2004 when there was an average precipitation supply, and weakest in 2007, the driest year. The correlation between the factors was weak at the 6-leaf stage, but became stronger as the vegetation period proceeded.As the growing season progressed, the SPAD values decreased in the dry year, but increased in the year with average precipitation supplies. Nutrient uptake was relatively intensive until the 12-leaf stage in the average year. In the dry year, the decrease in the SPAD value was the most intensive at the 50% silking stage.There was no stochastic correlation between the SPAD value measured at the 6-leaf stage and the yield, but the correlation between the two variables became stronger during the vegetation period.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Provision of conventional centralised water, wastewater and stormwater systems for urban municipal services has been common practice for over 100 years. These systems center around the protection of human health, ensuring reliable water supply and minimizing flooding; often with minimal consideration of the environmental and ecological impacts associated with fresh water extraction and wastewater discharge. These urban water systems are facing unprecedented challenges in this century from the emerging issues of climate variability, population growth, aging infrastructure, urbanisation and resource constraints. In this context, the current level of urban water service provision can't be provided within the existing centralised system framework, unless there is a significant increase in investment, to enlarge and rehabilitate the existing centralized systems. Water service providers and managers are therefore considering alternative and sustainable means of providing water services in this environment. Decentralised and distributed water and wastewater systems, which are planned within an integrated water management concept, are being promoted either in combination with centralised systems; or alone as the sustainable solution for urban water servicing. Current urban water systems are beginning to undergo a transition, where decentralised systems will play a major role in the long-term sustainability of these systems to meet the above mentioned challenges. However, since decentralized systems are relatively new and involve increased complexity there are wide knowledge gaps in their planning, design, implementation, operation and management, which are impeding their uptake. This paper summarises the role of decentralized systems in the transitioning of centralised systems to a more sustainable state and discusses some of the complexities in the implementation of these systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper a kind of architecture for an energy-saving EDM supply composed of three serial stages in the topology and its practical design are discussed. Various special controllers and its assisted circuits are introduced in the each of the three serial stages. The PFC controller UC3854 placed on the front stage provides satisfactory input power factor of the system. The PWM controller UC3875 mounted on the middle stage realize the closed control of the current of the inductance limiting machining current. An embedded controller PIC16F877 on the final stage is chosen to setting such machining variables as peak current, discharge duration and pulse interval. The communication with host PC is also realized by the same embedded controller. The architecture based on model of multi-controller parallel working guarantees capacity of the system real-time process. The prototype of the energy-saving EDM pulse supply using MOSFET power device is developed. A lot of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and stability of the practical design.</jats:p>"

This paper describes the development and application of an innovative technique to optimize the allocation of raw water supply to the city of London, UK during a period of drought in 2006. Using genetic algorithms, an optimization tool was developed to derive near-optimal operating strategies for the water company's multiple reservoir system for different projected rainfall scenarios and also to test the robustness of drought contingency strategies for operating the reservoirs down to a lower level under a severe drought condition. The project demonstrated that this approach is rigorous yet practical, the optimization technique is robust and effective and that optimal water allocation is an efficient measure to overcome water scarcity under drought conditions and mitigate consequent impacts. The potential application of genetic algorithms to the day to day operation of a complex water resource system represents a step-change in the industry's approach to managing such systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study a supply chain with one supplier and many retailers that face exogenous end-customer demands. The supplier and the retailers all try to minimize their own inventory-related costs. In contrast to the retailers' newsvendor-type ordering behavior (under which retailers may place orders freely in every period), we propose two scheduled ordering policies: the scheduled balanced ordering policy (SBOP) and the scheduled synchronized ordering policy (SSOP). Under both the SBOP and SSOP, retailers are allowed to order freely only in one period of an ordering cycle, and receive fixed shipments in other periods. Retailers take turns to order freely under the SBOP, while under the SSOP all retailers order freely in the same period. With the average supply chain cost per period as the performance measure, we identify mathematical conditions under which scheduled ordering policies outperform the newsvendor-type ordering. Through a large-scale numerical study, we find that scheduled ordering policies are most effective when (i) the supplier's holding and expediting costs are high and the retailer's backorder cost is small, (ii) the end-customer demand variance and correlation are high, and (iii) the supplier's capacity is high. In addition, we observe that the behavior of the SSOP often complements that of the SBOP. Whereas the SBOP is better than SSOP when the supplier's capacity is low and when the end-customer demand correlation level is high, the SSOP is better when the opposite conditions prevail. </jats:p>",

Results suggest that following sediment supply decline and a shift to a finer sediment supply, the gravel‐sand transition (GST) in fluvial systems extends and subsequently migrates upstream. The non‐abrupt (∼125 km) GST in the Sacramento River corresponds with a hump in the long profile, indicating recent downstream redistribution of sediment that impacts grain sizes. The hump is composed of sediments winnowed from upstream gravel beds that accumulate downstream where slope declines. This increases local sorting values and coarse sediment flux rates in the GST, leading to further gravel loss by burial and net efflux. Thus, in a transient response to sediment supply changes, whether anthropogenic or natural, the GST extends upstream as a longitudinally patchy bed modulated by bedload sheet transport that favors the loss of gravel.</jats:p>",

The nonparametric method is applied to estimate female labor supply elasticities using data on married women from the 1985 and 1989 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, exploiting the substantial variation in budget sets caused by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 as a source of identification. The estimated wage elasticities from this new method are 0.56 overall and 0.27 on the intensive margin. The income elasticity estimates are close to − 0.67 overall and − 0.13 on the intensive margin. Compared with the linear labor supply model, the estimated elasticities are usually larger for the nonparametric specifications that account for nonlinear budget sets.

Yet interdependence requires coordination among functions, sites, and stages of the internal supply chain (SC). Drawing on a case study of a large European pharmaceutical company, which we call Tyrenco, we explore how HR practices evolve within the strategic intra‐firm supply relationship. Our findings illustrate the disruptive effects of HR practices when they are focused on site‐based objectives and the improved coordination that results from redesigning HR processes to achieve internal operational integration. We highlight the tension between site‐based, financial controls and an emergent SC logic. Drawing on recent interest in cooperative approaches to HR practices, this study seeks to operationalize the need to align HR practices with end‐to‐end objectives at different stages of the intra‐firm supply chain. Our findings have practical implications for designing HR practices within multinational corporations (MNCs) that are characterized by complex and fragmented internal environments. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

The final list includes 1- and 2-bromostyrene, 2,4- and 2,6-dibromophenol, tetrabromophthalic acid, tetrachlorophthalic anhydride, chlorendic acid, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP). The results obtained from the laboratory-scale experiments clearly indicate that from the selected flame retardants only 1- and 2-bromostyrene are well biodegradable under aerobic conditions whereas the other flame retardants under investigation turned out to be persistent. Flocculation with either iron or aluminium salts is not an efficient option for removal of the selected flame retardants. For 1- and 2-bromostyrene removal rates of ca. 50% can be achieved whereas for the other compounds removal rates are in the range of 10 to 30% even when dosing 50 mg/L of flocculation agent. Oxidation with either ozone or ozone/hydrogen peroxide proved also to be rather inefficient for removal of the flame retardants under investigation, even at elevated doses of oxidant of 10 mg/L. However, results showed that the selected flame retardants adsorb well onto activated carbon and thus GAC adsorption seems to be a promising option for their removal.</jats:p>",

It also investigates the effect of duration of exposure to the supply shock on gender bias. The variation in the implementation of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme across both regions and time is exploited for the analysis. Estimations use data from the 2005-06 Measure DHS survey in India. We find that the increased supply of vaccinations due to the programme initially increases the gender inequality in immunisation but that this increase disappears over time. Our results indicate that the programme has saved approximately 1.72-1.84 million children, of which about 70% are boys.</jats:p>"

The authors’ analyses of nationally representative data from multiple sources show that math and science are the fields most difficult to staff, but the factors behind these problems are complex. There are multiple sources of new teachers; those with education degrees are a minor source compared to those with degrees in math and science and the reserve pool. Over the past two decades, graduation requirements, student course taking, and teacher retirements have all increased for math and science, yet the new supply has more than kept pace. However, when preretirement teacher attrition is factored in, there is a much tighter balance between supply and demand. Unlike fields such as English, for math and science, there is not a large cushion of new supply relative to losses—resulting in staffing problems in schools with higher turnover. </jats:p>",

Chlorine is added first followed by ammonia 5–10 minutes later, with the goal of sequestering bromide in monobromamine during the subsequent ozonation step. The goal of this research was to improve the Chlorine-Ammonia Process by introducing a very short prechlorination step (i.e. 30 seconds before addition of ammonia) to minimize overall disinfection by-product formation. Also, in this strategy, formation of a powerful halogenating agent, HOBr, is minimized and bromochloramine (NHClBr) is used predominantly instead of monobromamine to sequester bromide during ozonation. To support this improved approach to bromide sequestration, this study examined the formation and decay of bromochloramine as a function of operating conditions, such as pH and Cl2:N ratio, and refined a chemical kinetic model to predict haloamine concentrations over time.</jats:p>",

Trials have been carried out on the secondary effluent of a wastewater treatment plant which treats part of the effluents of one of the largest textile industries district in Italy. Because of the great irregularity of the effluent composition it is very difficult to monitor all the variables and assess their influence on the decolorization process. For this reason the H2O2/UV efficiency in colour removal has been also evaluated using synthetic solutions: demineralized water or groundwater added with five different dyes. In this latter case we determined the single effect of the control parameters on the process. From the experimental results we can assess that the H2O2/UV process guarantees a very high colour removal efficiency (up to 90%), which mainly depends on H2O2 dosages, dye concentration and characteristics, water quality (above all water hardness) and UV intensity. In our experimental conditions, the low pressure lamp showed to be more cost-effective both to remove colour and to reduce TOC and COD.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In western Germany brown coal is extracted in large open pit mines causing a vast groundwater depression. To reduce the negative effects an extensive program of re-infiltration has been established. Based on guidelines for mining at the Garzweiler open pit mine a specific monitoring program of spatial surveillance, control and assessment of relevant hydrological and ecological parameters has been set up. Serving as an early-warning system, monitoring enables prompt recognition of negative developments and reduces the risk of damage to the water supply, to the waters and wetlands. Ten years of experience has shown that such a monitoring program provides a suitable and effective means of dealing with complex, long term water management issues. The involvement of stable institutions equipped with the necessary expertise, regular participation of all stakeholders and communication with decision makers and the public are seen as the important criteria for success.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The high degree of climate variability is one of the greatest risk factors for agricultural production, which needs to be taken into consideration at all times, even within the framework of modern agriculture.One of the most important ways of adapting to changing climatic conditions is to analyse varieties and genotypes with relatively good climatic adaptation in terms of yield potential and growing requirements.The effect of year on the yield of maize was examined using a twenty-four year yield sequence. The weather was extremely variable in the examined period, so the effect of fertilisation also differed greatly. There was a clear correlation between the quantity of precipitation in the winter period and in the growing season and the yield of unfertilised treatments. The quantitative relationship between the two variables was moderate, because not only the total quantity of precipitation, but also the distribution over time has a significant influence on the yield. Very low yields were not always associated with the lowest precipitation sums (1994, 1995). Larger yields, however, were only achieved with higher precipitation (1980, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2008). It can be clearly seen that similar precipitation quantities resulted in different yield levels, due to the distribution of precipitation over time. The available water in the soil profile in spring is decisively influenced by precipitation during the winter period. An analysis of the results revealed a close correlation between the years and the fertilisation rate. In dry years a lower rate of fertilisation was more favourable, while in years with average or above-average precipitation, higher rates led to better yields. Under droughty conditions, and especially in consecutive dry years, the application of not more than 60 kg N ha\n <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n fertiliser is recommended, as higher fertiliser rates (1995) increase the risk level of maize production, thus reducing the efficiency. In the case of favourable water supplies, experimental results suggest that the application of 120 kg N ha\n <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n is justified. The results of analysis of variance indicated that the fertiliser effect was significant when averaged over the twenty-four years, but when the years were evaluated separately, the effect was found to differ, depending on the water supplies.The yield of the maize hybrids was 10 t ha\n <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n in years with favourable water supplies, but only 2–4 t ha\n <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n in droughty years. Yield fluctuations can be reduced through appropriate soil cultivation, water and nutrient supplies.</jats:p>",

Learning from this review, when we initiated new attempts at establishing sustainable seed producer groups in Chitwan district, Nepal, we emphasized the strengthening of their marketing and managerial capabilities rather than training in technical issues such as seed quality control. We imparted marketing skills to committee members of farmer groups at an initial training course in Chitwan in 2001. This inspired at least three existing farmer groups in Chitwan, already established for other agricultural activities, to enter into cereal and legume seed production and its marketing. Following their establishment in 2002 we supported them initially by purchasing some of their seed production. This was progressively withdrawn and, after three years, the groups independently marketed all of their substantial seed production. They built up capital reserves mainly from subsidies and by attracting funds from new shareholders with only a small contribution from retained profits that were only about 5% of total turnover. The capital reserves reduced or eliminated the need for loans thus increasing the chances that the enterprises would be sustainable. In contrast, other government-supported groups had practically no cash reserves despite substantial seed sales. By 2010, two of the three groups were still operating and had substantially increased turnover. Shareholders who were also seed producers benefited from being members of the group and from an increased income of 10% by producing seed instead of grain. Our intention in supporting these groups was to promote the scaling out of new rice varieties produced by client-oriented breeding (COB) or identified by participatory varietal selection but most of the seed that was produced was of obsolete varieties. Policies are needed to preferentially promote new varieties by supplying more information about them and increasing the subsidy on their seeds compared with older varieties. Continuing promotion by the organizations that bred them is also desirable but constrained by limited funding for COB.</jats:p>",

A framework is presented for assessing the hydraulic impacts and associated costs of using groundwater as a backup supply when imported‐water deliveries are disrupted, and for quantifying the emergency benefits of groundwater management strategies that enable better response to such disruptions. Response functions are derived, which relate additional groundwater pumpage during water‐supply emergencies to impacts such as increased pumping costs, subsidence, and seawater intrusion. Monte Carlo analysis is employed to estimate the incremental costs of using groundwater as a backup supply. The emergency benefits of alternative groundwater management strategies are computed for different expected durations of imported water disruption, percentages of imported water replaced by groundwater, and threshold drawdowns for subsidence impacts. The methodology is applied to the coastal Los Angeles Basin. For this case study, emergency benefits of artificial recharge strategies are dominated by reduction of potential subsidence costs. The variance of the results also is primarily due to subsidence effects. Incorporation of probability distributions reflecting a larger expected use of groundwater during the imported‐water disruption results in higher estimated emergency benefits of artificial recharge strategies. The framework presented for quantifying incremental costs and economic benefits of using groundwater as a backup supply could be applied to a broad range of water emergency planning decisions.</jats:p>",

So far, research has shown how individual industries and powerful companies were able to enhance their cash‐to‐cash cycles at both their supplier's and customer's expense. From a “network perspective,” the exploitation of individual advantages by a single powerful company lowers the overall financial wealth of the supply chain. Therefore, a collaborative working capital management approach is proposed, by which the cash‐to‐cash cycles of companies with the lowest weighted average cost of capital (WACC) should be extended, while companies with higher financing costs are relieved by a shortened cash‐to‐cash cycle. An unequal distribution of power, however, between supply chain members can be the main hindrance for developing a collaborative working capital management solution.</jats:p>",

After discarding regions with insufficient data, parameters for up to 23 crop production activities with related inputs, outputs, prices and behavioural functions are estimated for 219 regions in EU‐27. The results are systematically compared with the outcomes of other studies. For crop aggregates (e.g. cereals, oilseeds, etc.) at the national level, the estimated own price elasticities of supply are found to be in a plausible range.

Drawing on an SCM perspective, this study develops our understanding of (1) the intra‐firm HR supply chain, and (2) how this HR supply chain influences corporate governance processes within large organizations. We argue that the HR function, represented as an internal professional service supply chain, needs appropriate governance principles as it operates through multiple delivery channels and with a wide variety of HRM practices. Exploratory findings from a qualitative empirical study of seven large organizations investigating governance and risk management in the HR supply chain are presented. These in‐depth interviews uncover how formal governance is relatively easy for these organizations to achieve, supported by outcome‐focused monitoring tools, but informal governance mechanisms can fail due to insufficient attention. Although standardized approaches to HR delivery can maximize the opportunity for HR governance, little evidence was found that the organizations were considering the related governance implications explicitly. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

There were two irrigated treatments, one of them was the reguralry irrigated plant stand which got 333 mm water during investigated period, including the precipitation and the other was the cut off substance which means the irrigation (drip) was stopped at the beginning of the ripening process and there was a control as well which got 189 mm precipitation. The canopy temperature was measured row by row with a Raytek MX 4 type infrared remote thermometer. The stomatal conductance was measured by Delta-T AP4 type porometer. There were significant differences between the control and irrigated plants according to the water supply which was formulated the canopy values. The plants with a deficient water supply were decreased the transpiration rate, therefore its cooling effect didn’t show up. The regularly irrigated tomato plants’ yield exceeded the unirrigated ones more than twice. It is emerged from the study that the irrigation has a positive effect on the amount of the harvestable yield in this year type.</jats:p>"

In this study, we investigate the effects of organizational culture to determine the types of cultural characteristics that are strongly associated with efforts to integrate the supply chain and delivery performance. Previous researchers have theorized and demonstrated that organizational culture leads to adopting management practices consistent with the culture and that these practices are associated with firm performance. There has been a relative dearth of research, however, on the impact of organizational culture in operations management literature. Thus, this study investigates the effects of organizational culture, measured by the competing values framework (CVF), on two types of supply chain integration efforts: (1) internal integration and (2) external integration with key suppliers and key customers. Employing the CVF, we assess organizational culture along four dimensions—market, hierarchy, clan, and adhocracy. Results indicate that culture does influence firms to adopt internal and external integration practices. Our findings also provide evidence that a firm's adhocracy culture score is positively associated with external integration, while a firm's hierarchy culture score is negatively associated with both internal and external integration practices. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

For the former case, a continuous time optimal control problem is modeled, while for the latter a differential quasi-variational inequality (DQVI) formulation is applied to solve as a Cournot-Nash-Bertrand game. We provide implications for optimal strategies and note the effect of a customer acceptance index. </jats:p><jats:p> [Service Science, ISSN 2164-3962 (print), ISSN 2164-3970 (online), was published by Services Science Global (SSG) from 2009 to 2011 as issues under ISBN 978-1-4276-2090-3.] </jats:p>",

The number of days to exhaust the 2007 Canadian drug supply was calculated. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:</jats:title><jats:p> The model found that if 10% of the US prescriptions were filled from Canadian sources (manufacturer, wholesale or retail), Canada's 2007 drug supply would be exhausted in 224 days. If the demand from the US reached 20%, the 2007 supply would be exhausted in 155 days. The model was redone focusing on brand name drugs, with generic drugs removed. It was found that with a US demand of 10% and 20%, the 2007 Canadian supply for brand name drugs would be exhausted in 268 and 201 days, respectively. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title><jats:p> US drug importation is a threat to Canada's drug supply.

The Ponte Coperto tunnel, mapped for the first time during the present research and dug mainly in volcanic tuff lying below the lava flow, was built to drain a valley of about 8.5 km2, probably between the VII and VI century B.C. Before the tunnel construction, part of the valley was occupied by a swamp, whose reclamation was carried out by digging a long rectilinear canal of about 800 metres to the tunnel opening. Several hundred metres upstream of the tunnel entrance a secondary canal flows into the main one; this tributary canal drains a secondary valley, next to the principal one. Nowadays the Ponte Coperto tunnel, 170 m long, looks much larger than its original shape due to natural erosion that has widened and deepened it: during the dry season its discharge is negligible, but some calculations show that the peak discharge can be in the order of several dozens of cubic metres per second. The efficiency of the Ponte Coperto system is outstanding, as the hydraulic setup of the area is still that left by the Etruscans engineers more than two millennia ago: the tunnel and the canals keep draining both the surface and the ground waters from the more permeable rocks, and the valley is still healthy and cultivated. The Ponte Coperto system is a good example of the fact that Roman water engineering has its roots in Etruscan technology.</jats:p>",

However, it is an option rarely explored for rural areas in developing countries, and has not been documented extensively in the scientific literature. This paper presents results from 6 greywater reuse systems which were built with the objective to augment water supply and to provide sanitation in rural low income areas of Madhya Pradesh, India. The systems are based on reclaiming greywater from bathing for the use in toilet flushing and kitchen garden irrigation. The reuse systems were implemented based on the scientific rationale presented in the WHO (2006) guidelines. The paper presents evidence from the operation and evaluation of the greywater treatment plants under field conditions between 2005 and 2008. The paper concludes that greywater is a highly cost effective solution for water scarcity. In this study, reusing greywater resulted in a 60% increase in water availability, a reduction in open defecation and a fourfold increase in food availability.</jats:p>",

Such a strategy would involve regular required reductions in the amount of tobacco released to the market for sale, sufficient to achieve the desired level of commercial sales by a target date. Tobacco manufacturers would periodically bid to the government for a residual quota. Prices would increase as supply reduced. The price level would be influenced by demand, which in turn would reflect the impact of other interventions to reduce demand and the changing normality of smoking.</jats:p><jats:p>Higher priced tobacco could result in increased smuggling, theft, illegal sales and short-to-medium-term aggravation of some social inequalities. We suggest that the strategy be introduced in conjunction with a range of complementary interventions that would help reduce demand, and thus help ensure that the possible adverse effects are minimised. These complementary interventions include: providing comprehensive best practice smoking cessation support, better information to smokers and the public, strengthened regulation of tobacco retailing and supply, further controlling the pack and product design, measures to restrict supplies that bypass the increases in product price, strengthened enforcement and combating industry attacks.</jats:p><jats:p>General prerequisites for a sinking lid strategy include public support for the goal of a tobacco-free society, and strong political leadership. The likely context for initial success in jurisdictions includes geographical isolation and/or strong border controls, absence of significant tobacco production and/or manufacturing and low government corruption.</jats:p>",

All the experiments have been conducted at three pressures to have more diverse operational condition. Rejection of carbamazepine in the presence of HA increased both in DI water and tap water; however, rejection was decreased in higher pressure due to concentration polarization. Both Ca2 +  and Mg2 +  decreased the CBZ rejection by reduction of CBZ-HA complexation; particularly, Ca2 +  was more effective.</jats:p>",

The objective was to analyze the impact of the demographic change on future blood demand and supply in a German federal state.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:</jats:bold> A population‐based cross‐sectional study was conducted. For all in‐hospital transfused red blood cells (RBCs; n = 95,477), in the German federal state Mecklenburg‐Pomerania in 2005, characteristics of the patient and the blood donor (118,406 blood donations) were obtained. Population data were used to predict blood demand and supply until 2020.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> By 2020 the population increase of those aged 65 years or more (+26.4%) in Mecklenburg‐Pomerania will be paralleled by a decrease of the potential donor population (18‐68 years; −16.1%). Assuming stable rates per age group until 2020, the demand for in‐hospital blood transfusions will increase by approximately 25% (24,000 RBC units) while blood donations will decrease by approximately 27% (32,000 RBC units). The resulting, predicted shortfall is 47% of demand for in‐hospital patients (56,000 RBC units). Validation using historical data (1997‐2007) showed that the model predicted the RBC demand with a deviation of only 1.2%. Demographic changes are particularly pronounced in former East Germany, but by 2030 most European countries will face a similar situation. The decrease of younger age groups requires an increase of blood donation rates and interdisciplinary approaches to reduce the need for transfusion to maintain sufficient blood supply.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:bold> Demography is a major determinant of future transfusion demand. All efforts should be made by Western societies to systematically obtain data on blood donors and recipients to develop strategies to meet future blood demand.</jats:p>",

The Methods Time Measurement (MTM) methodology is chosen to measure the process time differences. To ensure a reliable comparison, a company in Brazil that has two different types of assembly line installations in the same plant was observed, and both assembly lines were under the same influences in terms of human resources, wages, food, and educational level of the staff. In this article, the first assembly line is called “new” and was built 6 years ago, with high investments in ergonomic solutions, in the supply system, and in the process. The other is called “traditional” and was built 23 years ago with few investments in the area. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

If the excluded supplier has the possibility to overtake the relationship afterwards, he has big influence on the relationship among the cooperation partners. A profit distribution rule has been developed that considers the impact of the excluded supplier. The paper presents round based games in which the present values change and influence the cooperative relationships. First, examples with ideal‐typical numbers are calculated and depicted by the software “MATLAB”. Internet experiments are made with participants on the basis of the software “z‐tree” in order prove the relevance of the proposed profit distribution rule. Finally, the experimental data is compared with the theoretical predictions. Santrauka Paprastai pramoninio tiekimo grandineje klientas pasirenka konkretų tiekėja ir atmeta kitus.

Recent advances in the analysis of intracellular concentrations of dNTPs have suggested that eukaryotes use diverse mechanisms in supplying dNTPs for DNA synthesis during DNA replication and repair. The enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a key enzyme involved in the synthesis of dNTPs. We found that Tip60‐dependent recruitment of RNR at sites of DNA damage is essential for supplying a sufficient amount of dNTPs for mammalian DNA repair. In this review, we focus on recent findings related to RNR regulation in eukaryotes of the dNTPs supplied for DNA synthesis. We also discuss the effect of this regulation on mutagenesis and tumorigenesis. (<jats:italic>Cancer Sci</jats:italic> 2010; 101: 2505–2509)</jats:p>",

A major environmental factor influencing plant growth is nutrient supply. In order to explore this relationship further, we quantified growth-related traits, ion content, and other biochemical traits (protein, hexose, and chlorophyll contents) of a recombinant inbred line population of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) grown on different levels of potassium and phosphate. Performing an all subsets multiple regression analyses revealed a link between growth-related traits and mineral nutrient content. Based on our results, up to 85% of growth variation can be explained by variation in ion content, highlighting the importance of ionomics for a broader understanding of plant growth. In addition, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected for growth-related traits, ion content, further biochemical traits, and their responses to reduced supplies of potassium or phosphate. Colocalization of these QTLs is explored, and candidate genes are discussed. A QTL for rosette weight response to reduced potassium supply was identified on the bottom of chromosome 5, and its effects were validated using selected near isogenic lines. These lines retained over 20% more rosette weight in reduced potassium supply, accompanied by an increase in potassium content in their leaves.</jats:p>",

At the same time, AR is also a criticized research approach, particularly in terms of research rigor. With the ambition to address, as well as bridge, the gap between the relevance and rigor within AR research, we first develop a comprehensive research methodology framework that synthesizes the crucial aspects of the AR research methodology. Secondly, we review existing AR articles within logistics, operations management, and supply chain management and present the current state of AR research. After a critical review of the existing articles using our framework, we delineate vital aspects that should be addressed in future AR research. As relevance and rigor are not at odds, we believe that our comprehensive framework will pave the way for a growing stream of rigorous, as well as relevant, AR research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As existing water supplies become increasingly strained in some locations, water planners turn to alternative options to quench cities’ thirst. Among these options for inland cities is desalination of seawater or brackish groundwater with long-haul water transfer. Desalination using reverse osmosis membranes is the most common technology in use, yet high pressures required for operation make desalination an energy-intensive water supply option. The subsequent conveyance of desalinated water through long-haul pipelines also requires large amounts of energy. To analyze desalination and long-haul transfer as a drinking water supply, Dallas, Texas, was chosen as a test-bed with two scenarios: seawater desalination near Houston and brackish groundwater desalination near Abilene, both with long-haul transfer of desalinated water to Dallas. Combining the energy requirements for long-distance pumping with the energy demands for desalination, we estimate that desalination and long-haul transfer is nine to 23 times more energy-intensive per unit of water than conventional treatment of local surface water sources, an increase of 230 to 630 MWh/d for 20 million gal (75,700 m3). These results suggest that desalination and long-haul transfer as a water supply for Dallas is less sustainable, based on energy consumption, than use of local surface water sources or water conservation.\nCitation: Stillwell AS, King CW, Webber ME. 2010.

The experimental setup is a rectangular closed duct combining an innovative system to control the rate of sediment supply <jats:italic>Q<jats:sub>in</jats:sub>\n</jats:italic>, and a digitizing system to measure in real time the 3D bedform topography. We carried out different sets of experiments with two sediment sizes (100 µm and 500 µm) varying both the sediment supply and the water flow rate to obtain a total of 46 different configurations. After a transient phase, steady sub‐centimeter bedforms of various shapes have been observed: barchans dunes, straight transverse dune, linguoid transverse dunes and bedload sheets. Height, spacing, migration speed, and mean bed elevation of the equilibrium bedforms were measured. For a given flow rate, two regimes were identified with fine sediment: (i) a monotonic increasing regime where the equilibrium bedform height and velocity increase with the sediment supply rate <jats:italic>Q<jats:sub>in</jats:sub></jats:italic> and (ii) an invariant regime for which both parameters are almost independent of <jats:italic>Q<jats:sub>in</jats:sub></jats:italic>. For coarse sediment, only the first regime is observed. We interpret the saturation of height and velocity for fine sediment bedforms as the transition from a supply‐limited regime to a transport‐limited regime in which the bedload flux has reached its maximum value under the prevailing flow conditions. We also demonstrate that all experiments can be rescaled if the migration speed and height of the bedforms are, respectively, divided and multiplied by the cube of the shear velocity. This normalization is independent of grain size and of bedform morphology. These experimental results provide a new quantification of the factors controlling equilibrium height and migration speed of bedforms in supply‐limited conditions against which theoretical and numerical models can be tested.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The agriculturally dominated Counties of Huron and Perth in southwestern Ontario regulate forest harvesting on private land through diameter-limit-based tree conservation by-laws. The rates of harvesting, along with the volume and value of timber sales and the type and quantity of tree marking were examined for the years 1997 to 1999. Although these harvests may form an important part of periodic farm income, at only 13% forest cover, these landscapes maybe further degraded by unsustainable forest harvesting practices. Based on the three study years, the mean annual area of forest harvested was found to be 4.4% of the total private forest landbase. The mean volume harvested from upland and lowland deciduous forest was 4666 and 6148 fbm/ha, respectively. Over-harvesting under a diameter-limit or hybrid method occurred in 8% of woodlot area with removal rates in excess of 10 000 fbm/ha. The most severe over-harvesting disproportionately targeted lowland woodlots, possibly compromising the ecological health of these often sensitive areas. Sugar maple, red/silver maple and ash were most commonly harvested at 33%, 31% and 21% of total species volume, respectively. On average, for standing timber, landowners received $680/Mfbm in the upland hardwood forests and $281/Mfbm in the lowland hardwood forests. On an area basis, mean price paid was $3680/ha and $1956/ha respectively on upland and lowland forests. Only 8% of the private land was harvested using single-tree selection or stand improvement (92% harvest was diameter-limit or a hybrid of same). Using a simple model, we found that woodlot owners comprising at least 74% of private woodland area would need to participate in forest harvesting in order to maintain the 1997 to 1999 partial harvest area rate of 2349 ha/yr. This rate may not be sustainable, given poor forest conditions in some areas, past management practices and a reduction in landowners interested in forest harvesting. Improvements are needed to bring the level of good forestry practice up by 62% to meet the rates that were being performed under pre-1994, free, provincial government private land forestry programs.

Improved folate status may reduce the risk of macrocytic anaemia, cardiovascular diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Inadequate folate status results in a decrease in the methylation cycle and in increased blood levels of the neurotoxic Hcy. The aim of this review is to provide insight into the influence of folate status on pregnancy health outcomes, and to consider increasing evidence of a link between the extent of genome/epigenome damage and elevated risk for adverse obstetrical endpoints.</jats:p><jats:p>Pregnant women are at risk for folate insufficiency because of the increased need for folate for rapid fetal growth, placental development and enlargement of the uterus. Inadequate folate status may cause fetal malformations, impaired fetal growth, pre‐term delivery and maternal anaemia. Even some diseases of the placenta may arise from folate deficiencies. Fetal growth seems to be vulnerable to maternal folate status during the periconception period, because it has the potential to affect both the closure of the neural tube and several epigenetic mechanisms within the placenta and the fetus. Mainly on the basis of the well recognized link between maternal folate status and fetal neural tube defects, women are advised to receive folic acid supplement during the periconceptional period. Because an adequate folate supply seems to play an important role in the implantation and development of the placenta and in improving endothelial function, folic acid supplementation in the late first trimester or early second trimester might also be beneficial.</jats:p>",

Different definitions of food waste with respect to the complexities of food supply chains (FSCs)are discussed. An international literature review found a dearth of data on food waste and estimates varied widely; those for post-harvest losses of grain in developing countries might be overestimated. As much of the post-harvest loss data for developing countries was collected over 30 years ago, current global losses cannot be quantified. A significant gap exists in the understanding of the food waste implications of the rapid development of ‘BRIC’ economies. The limited data suggest that losses are much higher at the immediate post-harvest stages in developing countries and higher for perishable foods across industrialized and developing economies alike. For affluent economies, post-consumer food waste accounts for the greatest overall losses. To supplement the fragmentary picture and to gain a forward view, interviews were conducted with international FSC experts. The analyses highlighted the scale of the problem, the scope for improved system efficiencies and the challenges of affecting behavioural change to reduce post-consumer waste in affluent populations.</jats:p>",

Qanats were first developed in Kurdistan as a side result of mining activity by the early millennium B.C. at the latest. Qanats exist in more than 34 countries all over the world, but most are concentrated in present day Iran. In Italy, Sicily is usually cited for its “Ingruttati”, but also in the Campania Region, there are some qanats (“Qanate”). As a matter of fact, this paper describes the historical, biological and morphological aspects of the Roccarainola qanat located in the district of Naples, in Southern Italy. It dates back to the Roman Ages, but currently the hypogean environmental condition misrepresents its ancient state. The animal species discovered forty years ago in the Roccarainola qanat were substantially small sized arthropods, a planaria and some species of bats. The Roccarainola qanat is composed of three branches for a total length of 786 m, with a drop of 9 m. The tunnel slope varies from around 1.70 cm/m to 5.20 cm/m. However, original slopes have been modified due to accumulation of debris and waste. Seventeen vertical shafts (not internally covered) with a circular section were found along the hypogeum. On the average, the shafts are spaced 36.5 m apart.</jats:p>",

The table slider is supported by a single-sided recess type bearing system and preloaded by attractive force using a linear-motor magnet. Since eccentric excitation force is applied to the table slider due to the change of attractive force according to the magnet track position of the linear-motor, pitching motion of the table occurs. This paper investigates the effect of air volume contained in a water-supply tube on the pitching motion. Larger air volume results in lower natural pitching frequency of the table slider, lower logarithmic decrement of the pitching motion and larger pitching angle. When the natural pitching frequency corresponds to the frequency of the eccentric excitation force during table feed, pitching angle grows by resonation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Granular activated carbon (GAC) and Brimac media has been used for many years in water treatment works to reduce and remove colour and total organic carbon (TOCs). This reduces the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) formed by disinfection with chlorine. The TOCs arise from humic and fulvic acids found in source waters for many, small, scattered remote communities in Scotland. A number of different configurations and empty bed contact times (EBCTs) of GAC and Brimac media were studied at Scottish Waters Acharacle water treatment works using a purpose built pilot plant of flexible design. This was used to establish the absolute design threshold for colour and TOC to meet Scottish Water's water specifications for their removal. Results: The 50:50 combination of Brimac and GAC in series reduced raw colour of up to 39°Hazen to below 10°Hazen and raw TOCs from up to 5.7 mg/l to &amp;lt;2.0 mg/l producing the lowest levels of THMs after chlorine addition of &amp;lt;10 μg/l. An EBCT of 5.4 hours produced an average colour removal of 79.2% and average TOC removal of 79.1%. Conclusions: 50:50 Brimac then GAC in series with an EBCT of 5.4 hours was the best configuration for the removal of colour and TOCs and gave rise to the lowest formation of THMs. The trials have successfully proved how the THM precursors can be removed by the GAC once the colour has been removed by the Brimac. This has not only provided a design solution for Acharacle WTW but the “way forward” for Scottish Water with regard to media change out on their numerous existing GAC plants which are faced with similar problems.</jats:p>",

This study uses retrospective life history data for Germany, the Netherlands and Great Britain to investigate the long-term effects of childbirth on mothers’ labour supply for successive birth cohorts. Probit estimates with correction for selection into motherhood and the number of births show strong drops in participation before first childbirths and strong recovery after the birth of the last child, especially in Great Britain. Younger cohorts display a less sharp decline in participation around childbirth and a faster increase in participation in the 20 years after childbirth, especially in the Netherlands. However, mothers’ participation rates do not return to pre-birth levels in any of the countries studied here. Labour market conditions and institutional public support seem to contribute to explaining the cross-country variation in participation after childbirth. </jats:p>",

In SCM simulations, as in real life, a ‘bullwhip’ effect leads to a drop in profitability of the supply chain. The inclusion of Human Factors knowledge within the domain of SCM provides a rich source of understanding of bullwhip-related phenomena experienced by managers. In this paper we describe a technique called ‘Cognitive Network Tracing’ which is used to examine the processes by which supply chain members make decisions and engage in communication in such scenarios. We examined the influence of different levels of Situation Awareness (SA) information given to supply chain members, and the influence of individual- or team-focused instructions, on a variety of measures of performance, communication, and SA. Results showed that team-focused groups of participants achieved better supply chain management performance than individual-focused groups of participants, but only when they were given information about current demand level in the supply chain. It is concluded that “Management Flight Simulators”, such as the Beer Game, have validity as tools to examine team collaboration and performance in management scenarios. </jats:p>",

However, many applications of the MD approach are in developing countries where semi‐subsistence systems with multiple production activities are being used and data availability is limited. This paper discusses how MD analysis can be applied to more complex production systems such as semi‐subsistence systems with multiple production activities and presents validation analysis for studies of soil carbon sequestration in semi‐subsistence farming systems in Kenya and Senegal. Results from these two studies confirm that ecosystem service supply curves based on the MD approach are close approximations to the curves derived from highly detailed data and models and are therefore sufficiently accurate and robust to be used to support policy decision making.</jats:p>",

The presence of overhead cover had no effect on rates of food intake or growth for a given food supply in a given season. Growth rates were significantly higher for fish subjected to a high food supply than those subjected to a low food supply. Food supply did not affect the extent to which <jats:italic>S. salar</jats:italic> parr were nocturnal. These results were consistent between winter and summer.

Here we describe a novel biochemical pathway that relies on rickettsial transport of host cytosolic dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and its subsequent conversion to<jats:italic>sn</jats:italic>-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) for synthesis of phospholipids. This rickettsial pathway compensates for the evolutionary loss of rickettsial glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the typical endogenous source of G3P. One of the components of this pathway is<jats:italic>R. prowazekii</jats:italic>open reading frame RP442, which is annotated GpsA, a G3P dehydrogenase (G3PDH). Purified recombinant rickettsial GpsA was shown to specifically catalyze the conversion of DHAP to G3P<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>. The products of the GpsA assay were monitored spectrophotometrically, and the identity of the reaction product was verified by paper chromatography. In addition, heterologous expression of the<jats:italic>R. prowazekii gpsA</jats:italic>gene functioned to complement an<jats:italic>Escherichia coli gpsA</jats:italic>mutant. Furthermore,<jats:italic>gpsA</jats:italic>mRNA was detected in<jats:italic>R. prowazekii</jats:italic>purified from hen egg yolk sacs, and G3PDH activity was assayable in<jats:italic>R. prowazekii</jats:italic>lysed-cell extracts. Together, these data strongly suggested that<jats:italic>R. prowazekii</jats:italic>encodes and synthesizes a functional GpsA enzyme, yet<jats:italic>R. prowazekii</jats:italic>is unable to synthesize DHAP as a substrate for the GpsA enzymatic reaction. On the basis of the fact that intracellular organisms often avail themselves of resources in the host cell cytosol via the activity of novel carrier-mediated transport systems, we reasoned that<jats:italic>R. prowazekii</jats:italic>transports DHAP to supply substrate for GpsA. In support of this hypothesis, we show that purified<jats:italic>R. prowazekii</jats:italic>transported and incorporated DHAP into phospholipids, thus implicating a role for GpsA<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>as part of a novel rickettsial G3P acquisition pathway for phospholipid biosynthesis.</jats:p>",

We show that concurrent two-photon fluorescence imaging of endogenous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and the cortical microcirculation exposes well-defined boundaries of tissue oxygen diffusion in the mouse cortex. The NADH fluorescence increases rapidly over a narrow, very low pO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> range with a p<jats:sub> 50</jats:sub> of 3.4±0.6 mm Hg, thereby establishing a nearly binary reporter of significant, metabolically limiting hypoxia. The transient cortical tissue boundaries of NADH fluorescence exhibit remarkably delineated geometrical patterns, which define the limits of tissue oxygen diffusion from the cortical microcirculation and bear a striking resemblance to the ideal Krogh tissue cylinder. The visualization of microvessels and their regional contribution to oxygen delivery establishes penetrating arterioles as major oxygen sources in addition to the capillary network and confirms the existence of cortical oxygen fields with steep microregional oxygen gradients. Thus, two-photon NADH imaging can be applied to expose vascular supply regions and to localize functionally relevant microregional cortical hypoxia with micrometer spatial resolution. </jats:p>",

Various parameters, including pressure difference, compressor rotation speed, oil temperature, bearing clearance, and diameter of the oil gallery, were investigated to find the relations with oil flowrate. Among them, oil temperature and bearing clearance are indicated as the most sensitive, and pressure difference follows. Compressor rotation speed and diameter of the oil gallery are insensitive. Some hydrodynamic parameters can also be obtained in detail, such as pressure drop and oil flow velocity.
