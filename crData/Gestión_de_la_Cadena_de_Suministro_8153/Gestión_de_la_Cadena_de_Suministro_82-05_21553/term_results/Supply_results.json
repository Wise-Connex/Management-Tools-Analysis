In control animals, amputation alone or amputation with implant of either notochord or somites resulted in development of proximal wing segments only. In experimental animals, more than one‐fourth of the animals containing viable neural tube implants developed proximal, middle, and distal limb segments. These regenerated limb segments contained muscle groups, cartilage models, and nervous structures that approximated the normal situations. Since some new parts regenerated in more than one‐fourth of the cases, it may be concluded that augmentation of nerve supply is an effective method of inducing regeneration in limbs of chick embryos. Volume measurements of the neural tube implant indicate that a “critical mass” of nerve tissue may be necessary for regeneration to occur.</jats:p>",
