Their growing importance is a reflection of the increasing number of Italian OPACs and the development of the National Library System (SBN). More Italian libraries offer efficient ILL services through the use of electronic mail, easy payment methods, clearly stated ILL policies on their Web pages and request forms linked to OPAC records. Many problems still remain, however. These stem from a lack of a national, centralised ILL system and from the heterogeneity of the various local and regional library networks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is rapidly growing interest in e‐businesses. Its impact on supply chains is currently covered in about 150 papers and articles and the number is growing at the speed of computing power. Unfortunately, most of the published work, in research and practice, is biased to e‐commerce and sales and marketing. The supply chain dimension of  e‐business is largely neglected and managed poorly, while basic logistics mal‐performance is currently hampering turnover and revenues of e‐commerce applications severely. If basic operational performance is not even assured, more advanced approaches of e‐business will not take off, simply because there is inadequate support for the concepts in the physical domaine. Very often virtual integration is applied in an operational manner and in segments of the supply chain only, as opposed to an alternative approach developed here, that of strategic and integral supply chain involvement. This research note calls for an effort to make the supply chain dimension of e‐business a reality and suggests practical approaches (create an e‐supply chain which is a supply chain that can fulfill orders and assure supply in the physical sphere) to avoid the common trap of a neglected and poorly designed and managed supply chain.</jats:p>",

In technical-economic analysis the hydraulic condition (the continuity of flow rate at nodes and energy conservation in independent loops) is added and economic conditions (minimum annual expenses for construction and operation). In these conditions, the technical-economic analysis represents a nonlinear programming problem with equality restraint (relation 11-13) which transforms into a nonlinear system (relation 15-17) with which we determine flow rates and head losses on pipelines. This system has in its construction the hydraulic conditions (relation 16,17) and “economical” conditions (relation 18,21) both being written in the same way. In the case when the objective function W (relation 1) is convex the establishing of flow rates and head losses is done directly, but in the case when the same function is concave-convex it is necessary to have an intermediate step. By relation 10 it obtains the theoretical diameters which will be adjusted to meet commercial ones. In the paper is presented a model and a methodology for the application of the technical-economic analysis to the water distribution networks, and a mode of utilization for a practical example.</jats:p>",

The occurrence of water distribution pipe breakage and water leakage is influenced by pipe material, size and age as well as soil characteristics and transportation. The water leakage has to be discovered as soon as possible from the viewpoint of minimizing water loss. However, it costs more to increase inspections for water leakage. In this study, the model to determine the optimal inspection interval for water leakage of the water distribution network was examined. The optimal inspection interval was estimated to minimize the total cost of inspection, pipe repair and lost water. The developed model was applied to a water distribution area whose water main is 486 kilometres long. The area was divided into sub-area of 250 metres square. Those sub-areas were classified into 6 groups according to pipe break rate. The optimal inspection interval was obtained for each group and its validity examined by numerical simulation.</jats:p>",

An effluent plume may easily extend for many tens of kilometres downstream of a discharge point. A characteristic of the effluent plume is the existence of significant transverse concentration gradients in the river as the discharged effluent slowly mixes with the river water. Within this two-dimensional, transverse mixing zone accurate delineation of the effluent plume is essential for water quality monitoring and for management of the receiving stream. The capability to mathematically model two-dimensional river mixing and to predict effluent plume concentrations is a valuable tool for water quality management. An overview of two-dimensional river mixing theory is presented. Tracer methods for delineating effluent plumes resulting from continuous or transient input to rivers are described, and the results of tracer studies conducted on the Athabasca River in western Canada are presented. A computer modelling procedure for simulating two-dimensional river mixing is described. Application of the model is explained and comparison of model output to measured tracer concentrations is presented.</jats:p>",

It also summarizes the experimental procedures that could be used to quantify the characteristic parameters for each process component. The model applicability was then illustrated by comparing the predictions with the experimentally observed dissolved ozone profiles. Further analysis was made to demonstrate the model application for predicting the disinfection efficiency and disinfection by-products formation simultaneously. From these analyses, it was also found that during the ozonation of natural waters, the ozone decay could not be described by the simple first order rate expression.</jats:p>",

The CAdSV, coupling of very efficient adsorptive accumulation of the electroactive species on the electrode surface with the catalytic reaction, provides a significant amplification of the analytical response, and consequently a considerable decrease of the detection limit, as well as an improvement of the selectivity of the determination. The course of the catalytic reactions occurring in catalytic systems, which is most frequently applied in CAdSV analysis, is given. The features and advantages of the CAdSV method and its exploitation in ultratrace analysis of water samples are discussed. Numerous examples of the CAdSV systems, which have found application in the determination of Co, Cr, U, Fe, Mo, Pt, Rh, Ti, W and V, as well as of some anions and organic substances in various kinds of water, are listed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To understand the eutrophication phenomena in Lake Biwa, Japan, a research project for the water quality formation processes was executed. This paper presents phosphorus mass changes in water body in Lake Biwa from April 1995 to January 2000 and discusses the main factors of the change. Phosphorus mass ranged from 190 to 350 t, with an average of 260 t. DP mass in 1995, '97 and '98 showed seasonal change patterns, while non-periodical phenomena seemed to control the PP mass. Phosphorus mass was increased about 15 t in epilimnion from April to July while nitrogen showed a 50 t decrease. This disagreement suggests that some processes selectively accumulated phosphorus in epilimnion during this period. However, such an increase in phosphorus was not observed in 1996 and '99. Air temperature was lower and much snowfall was recorded in 1996 and '99, suggesting that coldness in winter season weakened the phosphorus accumulation process to depress the mass in epilimnion in summertime. Water temperature increase seemed to be delayed in proportion to total snowfall, but thermocline was formed independently of coldness. Hence, the idea was abandoned that the delay of thermocline formation encouraged the sedimentation process, and biological activities were considered to be the main factor controlling phosphorus mass in the epilimnion in Lake Biwa.</jats:p>",

Raw water reservoir receiving surface water was the source of infestation in Pevensey Bay. In Gdansk A. aquaticus probably penetrated the water distribution system with surface water getting into a leaky collecting well receiving groundwater from a chalk aquifer. The presence of organic matter in water entering the systems seemed to favour the infestation. Chemical treatment with pyrethrins (Pevensey Bay) and peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide preparation (Gdansk) was used. The concentration of pyrethrins was 10 (g/dm3 and the average dose of peracetic acid was 4 mg/dm3. Both chemical treatments were found quite effective, however, some sections of the (much larger than Pevensey Bay) distribution network in Gdansk were not completely cleaned of the infestation.</jats:p>",

The paper presents the following key arguments. First, the rapidly changing composition of trade in China during the past 15 years is the result of a convergence of its trade pattern toward market-determined comparative advantage. Such convergence is primarily due to institutional reform, particularly trade system reform, aimed at introducing market mechanisms into economic and trading activities. Second, China’s export supply potential will be very much determined by progress in further trade liberalisation that leads to a dynamic change of its comparative advantage. Progress may be examined in the context of the contribution of exports to economic growth in China and its economic integration into the world economy, namely, how the scale of China’s expected future trade expansion will transform its stature in world trade.</jats:p>",

However, it was found that high ozone doses impeded flocculation. More significant is ozone's benefit for the removal of UV-absorbing organic matter.

Aluminium sulphate, poly aluminium chlorides with different calcium content, iron chloride sulphate, and chitosan coagulants were tested. The dual media filter bed was built with 0.6 m of 0.8–1.6 mm lightweight expanded clay aggregates (Filtralite) above 0.35 m of 0.4–0.8 mm sand. A conventional anthracite-sand filter with the same layer depths and grain sizes was used as a reference. In general, the maximum permissible concentration level of 0.1-mg Me/L controlled the minimum coagulant dose requirements when metal-based coagulants were used (Norwegian water quality standard). Typical NOM removal efficiencies obtained with metal coagulantswere in the range of 75–90% and 40–70% with respect to colour and organic carbon, respectively. Chitosan was able to remove colour quite effectively, but this coagulant was less effective with respect to organic carbon removal. Lightweight expanded clay aggregate was a good alternative to anthracite, with lower rates of head loss build-up, and increased filter run length and filter storage capacity. Only small differences in effluent water quality were detected with the two filters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Changes in demand and supply in segments of the labour market will affect the labour market position of workers with an educational background in a related field of study. In one economic tradition such discrepancies between supply and demand are thought to lead to unemployment in the case of excess supply and to unfilled vacancies or skill shortages in the case of excess demand. The other neo‐classical oriented tradition expects wage adjustments to take fully account of these labour market imbalances, leading to higher wages for studies with excess demand and lower wages in case of excess supply. In practice the labour market might, on the one hand, be more flexible than suggested by the first approach, but on the other hand adjustment might be incomplete and not only wages but also other aspects of the employment relationship might be affected by a friction between supply and demand. This study examines the relationship between discrepancies between labour demand and supply on the one hand and manifestations of these tensions in the labour market experience of school‐leavers on the other hand. To investigate this relationship, a random coefficient model has been used, which allows for different adjustment processes for the various educational types, but still makes full use of all the information available in the data. The analyses provide insights about the importance of different adjustment processes and their complementarity and substitutability. We show that on average, supply surpluses lead to pressure to accept jobs at a level which is lower than the school‐leavers educational level, jobs with relatively low wages, and jobs with part‐time contracts. A direct link between supply surpluses and unemployment is only found for a few specific fields of study. Unemployment seems to occur mostly when school‐leavers do not take temporary jobs or jobs below their educational level in case of excess supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most of the mathematical models that are employed to model the performance of bubble columns are based on the assumption that either plug flow or complete mixing conditions prevail in the liquid phase. Although due to the liquid-phase axial dispersion, the actual flow pattern in bubble columns is usually closer to being mixed flow rather than plug flow, but still not completely mixed flow. Therefore, the back flow cell model (BFCM), that hypothesises both back flow and exchange flow to characterise the liquid-phase axial dispersion, is presented as an alternative approach to describe the hydrodynamics and mass transfer of ozone bubble columns. BFCM is easy to formulate and solve. It is an accurate and reliable design model. Transient BFCM consists of NBFCM ordinary-first-order differential equations in which NBFCM unknowns (Yj) are to be determined. That set of equations was solved numerically as NBFCM linear algebraic equations. Steady-state BFCM consists of 3 × NBFCM non-linear algebraic equations in which 3 × NBFCM unknowns (qG,j, Xj, and Yj) are to be determined. Those non-linear algebraic equations were solved numerically using Newton–Raphson technique. Steady-state BFCM was initially tested using the pilot-scale experimental data of Zhou. BFCM provided excellent predictions of the dissolved ozone profiles under different operating conditions for both counter and co-current flow modes.</jats:p>",

This leads to an improved understanding of their decision-making rules. An agent-based model comprising these stakeholders' rules of behavior in subsequently development. Once the model is validated with data sets from a real utility, multiple-scenario testing helps to explore different strategies and can be used to generate ideas for developing flexible management and design schemes.

This study investigates possible water quality changes in the Lachine Canal (Montreal) due to the release of heavy metals (Cd, Ni, Zn and Pb) into the water column during resuspension of anoxic sediments subjected to potential remediation. This release can be initiated by dredging activities for sediment removal. Equilibrium in the water from the Lachine Canal has been calculated using the program EQUILIB from the software FACT. The speciation of heavy metals in the water column was calculated with and without a solid phase before and after possible dredging. Speciation of heavy metals in pore water of anoxic sediments has been calculated, taking into account that corresponding sulfides are the solid phases controlling their solubility. The concentration of heavy metals under anoxic conditions considered could decrease by 8 orders of magnitude. The impact of various scenarios in the area of concern was reviewed from an ecotoxicological perspective. Dredging can possibly change the redox and acid–base conditions in the water column. The impact of dredging will be less if sediments contain calcium. Dredging can lead to an increase in the concentration of heavy metals in the water column and a change of metal speciation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Eutrophication of reservoirs used for drinking water supplies is a very common problem, particularly in lowland reservoirs. Long water retention time (60-120 days) favours cyanobacterial bloom occurrence in Sulejów Reservoir, Poland. The localisation of the water intake in a bay exposed to north-east winds favoured the Microcystis bloom accumulation, which formed a 0.5 m thick dense scum for the first time in September 1999. Cyanobacterial hepatotoxins can pose a potential health problem because the presence of about 0.8 μg/l microcystins was detected in drinking water during three series of analysis. An investigation of the efficiency of each stage of water treatment processes in the elimination of microcystins showed that pre-chlorination, coagulation, and rapid sand filtration were ineffective in removing microcystins from water. Significant elimination was observed after ozonation and chlorination. The concentration of microcystins in bloom material was between 12 to 860 μg/g dry weight of phytoplankton biomass. Management strategies for reservoirs should consider the important role of ecohydrological processes, which are often very easy to regulate, and which can be useful for bio-manipulation of the water ecosystem.</jats:p>",

For kinetic experiments, the conventional first-order reaction kinetics was applied to evaluate the batch and continuous immobilized reactors.

Maximum specific degradation rate of PCE was calculated as 0.16 (10–3 μmol mg protein–1h–1 from average influent concentration of PCE (12 μM) in the bioreactor. Simultaneously maximum volumetric degradation rate was also computed as 10.2 μmol l–1h–1. The volumetric degradation rate was relatively higher than those of other reactors. In order to maintain the efficiency of PCE dechlorination, 20 h or more HRT in the reactor system was required.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A bio-monitoring system for toxicants in water has been developed and verified for actual applications. This system is based on the motionality of five Acheilognathus lanceolata, a fish known to be very sensitive to toxic substances, moving around in an aquarium. Their movements are continuously monitored with a charge coupled device (CCD) camera and analyzed to find and quantify any abnormal behavior in their motional characteristics in comparison with the pre-acquired data. That is, the images of fish captured by a CCD camera are digitalized to identify the location of fish in a constant time interval and the locations of each fish were then analyzed mathematically with a personal computer using the equations proposed to determine the motional characteristics such as floatness, fledness and mobility(agility). These data are then converted by means of fuzzy estimation to an index value, defined as the contamination index (CI), by which the system provides the information about the overall toxic strength of the toxicant in the water flowing into the aquarium. If the fish are exposed to toxicant(s), the CI value will be proportional to the strength of its toxicity. The pilot test was performed in a water treatment plant for six months in order to verify the reproducibility of the system over the unstable conditions such as highly turbid water after rainfall as well as in normal conditions. The test results revealed that this monitoring system has good reproducibility and sensitivity, proving our approach, described in this paper, is reliable. As a result, this approach seems to enable us to make a quick and easy detection of toxic substances contained in water, therefore, this system can be applied to a source of water supply as a toxicant watching system.</jats:p>",

Because the United States will experience both increasing labor productivity and an increase in its labor supply, the growth orientation of the global economy is likely to persist. In this circumstance, given relatively comparable changes in the productivity of labor across countries, countries that face major declines in their labor supply will fare less well than countries that are able to maintain their labor supply at least constant. The article examines the labor supply prospects of 16 developed countries for the period 2000–2050, drawing attention to the ways in which countries may be able to influence the future levels of their labor supply.</jats:p>",

The present paper focuses on the study of arsenate adsorption by a natural manganese oxide. The objective is to determine which of the anions usually present in drinking water may be adsorbed: hydrogen carbonate, sulfate, chloride, nitrate, phosphate and arsenate. A kinetic batch experiment was conducted with a natural drinking water, leading to a first qualitative selection: nitrate and chloride have little interaction with the adsorbent, sulfate and hydrogen carbonate are adsorbed while phosphate and arsenate are strongly adsorbed. Then column experiments were run with aqueous solutions containing either chloride, sulfate, etc. The previous trends were confirmed and the equilibrium isotherms of the adsorbable anions were built by integration of the breakthrough curves. The isotherms fitted with a Langmuir model showed that the capacitieswere low (a few μmol.g-1). The affinity order was determined from the isotherm initial slopes: arsenate ≫ phosphate &amp;gt; hydrogen carbonate ≌ sulfate. Given the strong affinity of the adsorbent for arsenate and the low arsenate concentration in drinking water, the process selectivity for As traces from drinking water is ensured.</jats:p>",

There are significant advantages for both buyers and sellers in using this medium. Savings are made as a result of reducing transaction costs, increasing the circle of potential customers, and improving the search-and-find capabilities for all parties concerned. At the moment there are several hundred Web-based auctions. And yet the place to see state-of-the-art auctions is not on the Web but rather in one of the dozen or so auction halls in Holland. This article analyses different electronic auction initiatives in the Dutch flower industry. These auctions use the “Dutch auction” as price discovery process. In a Dutch auction the auctioneer offers products at successively lower prices until his offer is accepted. Most auctions on the Web today use the English method. An English auction process involves a succession of increasing bids by potential buyers until the highest (and final) bid is accepted by the auctioneer. But the Dutch method offers advantages, as the flower auctions reveal. The Dutch method is much faster and tends to generate higher prices. This is illustrated by presenting the results of experimental economic research with different Web-based auctions. One of the analysed electronic auction initiatives, Tele Flower Auction, shows that electronic auctions have an impact on the chain configuration and its performance. Conclusions are formulated and further research is discussed.</jats:p>",

The main aim of the work was to show the influence of changes in water composition on manganese and ammonia nitrogen removal from groundwater on second-stage mature quartz sand filters. According to the results obtained, the efficiency of manganese elimination from water did not depend on periodic changes in ammonia nitrogen or dissolved oxygen concentrations. However, if low oxygen concentrations (lower than 2 mg/dm3) were maintained for a longer time, the manganese concentration in the filtrate gradually increased. The ammonia nitrogen concentration in the filtered water appeared to be the most relevant factor affecting the efficient removal of manganese and the dissolved oxygen concentration was less important. The nitrification process appeared to be vulnerable to changes in the concentrations of the substrates: ammonia nitrogen (either an increase or decrease) and oxygen (an decrease). It was observed that it is necessary for nitrifying bacteria to adapt (lag phase) to rapidly changing water composition. Due to the sorption process, the inhibition of nitrification on the filtering beds did not significantly influence the efficiency of ammonia nitrogen removal.</jats:p>",

A netchain is a set of networks comprised of horizontal ties between firms within a particular industry or group, which are sequentially arranged based on vertical ties between firms in different layers. Netchain analysis interprets supply chain and network perspectives on inter-organisational collaboration with particular emphasis on the value creating and coordination mechanism sources. We posit that sources of value and coordination mechanisms correspond to particular and distinct types of interdependencies: pooled, sequential, and reciprocal. It is further argued that the recognition and accounting of these simultaneous interdependencies is crucial for a more advanced understanding of complex inter-organisational relations. The paper concludes with an analysis of a set of netchain configuration examples, including buyer-supplier relationships, information technology induced interorganization collaborations, and the introduction of the “macrohierarchy” organization structure.</jats:p>",

The lake water has a uniquely high bromide content 1.9 mg/L which affects DBPs (disinfection by-products) formation. Controlled experiments using different disinfectants were carried out with the lake water in order to study DBPs formation. Formation and distribution of TOX (total organic halogen) trihalomethanes (THM), haloacetic acids (HAA) and cyanogen halides were studied during the application of the following disinfectants: Chlorine, chloramine, chlorine dioxide and a combination of chlorine dioxide with chloramine. Brominated species dominated the distribution of THM, HAA and cyanogen halide. When a high dose of chlorine was applied an unusually high percent (75%) of the TOX formation potential was identified; THM constituted about 50% of the TOX formation potential and haloacetic acids 22-28%. Tribromoacetic acid was found to undergo decomposition to form bromoform. Chlorine dioxide produced insignificant concentrations of organic DBPs and chloramine produced low concentrations. Chlorine dioxide in combination with chloramine enhanced production of CNBr and THM, but their concentrations were much lower than during chlorination.</jats:p>",

The work was done on a well stirred, discontinuously operated tank reactor irradiated from its bottom. A UV, tubular lamp and a cylindrical reflector of parabolic cross section were used [actually, two germicidal lamps (254 nm) of different output power per unit lamp length and a medium pressure, mercury arc lamp with polychromatic emission between 220 and 760 nm]. 2,4-D concentration and TOC were the main variables used to investigate the degradation rate. There is an optimal initial concentration ratio for each 2,4-D initial concentration. It was also observed that increasing the lamp output power at 254 nm (output from 0.08 W/cm to 0.6 W/cm) favors the reaction rate. However, much more significant is the effect produced by employing a polychromatic lamp with some emission below 254 although this photonic contribution is relatively small (just 0.21 W/cm below 250 nm). A kinetic model, having parameters independent of the reactor configuration and derived from mechanistic considerations was used to analyze the experimental data.</jats:p>",

We propose that many supply networks emerge rather than result from purposeful design by a singular entity. Most supply chain management literature emphasizes negative feedback for purposes of control; however, the emergent patterns in a supply network can much better be managed through positive feedback, which allows for autonomous action. Imposing too much control detracts from innovation and flexibility; conversely, allowing too much emergence can undermine managerial predictability and work routines. Therefore, when managing supply networks, managers must appropriately balance how much to control and how much to let emerge.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The overlying London Clay records discrete upward changes from deltaic, to mixed tidal flat, to tidal sandsheet (‘Bagshot Sands’). Erosional topography on the Top Chalk surface had an important control on deposition: (1) topographic lows controlled the initial sites of marine flooding and sedimentation; (2) lows would have acted as conduits for sediment delivery; (3) lows created additional accommodation by the compaction of thick mud fills; (4) lows may have formed preferential sites for delta growth. As topography was reduced by sediment infill, depositional units tended toward more sheet-like geometries. Heavy minerals reveal that an upward progradational/aggradational trend and the development of more sand-rich facies are related to a change in provenance toward sand-rich Cornubian sources.</jats:p>",

We installed and operated the following instrumentation for a period of 35 months: three meteorological towers, each 2 m in height, with wind speed sensors at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 m above ground; air temperature at 0.2 and 2 m height; rain gauge; seven sets of particle collectors at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 m heights; and three fast‐response particle mass flux sensors at 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 m heights; all along a transect crossing the site and parallel to the predominant southwesterly wind direction.

The econometric analysis is based on a profit function using farm household survey data from the Punjab. Pakistan for 1995–1996. The results reveal that to achieve production targets, very high support prices are required. Since these price levels may not be feasible, a more appropriate option may involve some inducements to expand paddy area and the area allocated to modern varieties.

For the first few years following privatisation, real prices, profits and costs in the industry rose. Following two Price Control Reviews, prices have now fallen sharply and there have been substantial reductions in costs and more recently in profits. This paper attempts to conduct a social cost–benefit analysis of the privatisation by examining actual and predicted falls in costs over the period to 2005. We conclude that the privatisation did yield significant net benefits but that these were unevenly distributed across time and groups in society. Relative to our preferred counterfactual, consumers experience slightly lower prices and the government gains £5 billion in sale proceeds and net taxes. However, consumers begin to gain only from 2000.</jats:p>",

In this article, the welfare effects of a regional technical change in relation to a perennial crop are measured. Dynamic aspects of supply responses to prices as well as to changes in technology are addressed when the effects of biological lag and the variation of asset productivity are taken into consideration. The effects of the adoption of improved cultivars are assessed for both a parallel and a conservative, pivotal shift in the supply curve. The theoretical model is implemented for cocoa in Malaysia as a large producer country on the one hand and all other countries as an aggregate on the other. Relatively small price and quantity effects result from the adoption of new cultivars. Although the magnitude of the effects on producer benefits and total benefits in Malaysia depend crucially on the type of supply shift assumed, significant benefits occur for Malaysian producers. Consumersapos; gains in the ROW are approximately offset by producers' losses in the ROW, suggesting that a considerable share of the gains would benefit consumers in economically well‐developed northern hemisphere countries at the expense of producers who do not immediately adopt improved cultivars.</jats:p><jats:p>Les améliorations biotechnologies émergentes rendent possible la culture de variétés à plus haut rendement, munies d'une résistance élevée contre les maladies et ravageurs permettant la réduction des applications de produits phytosanitaires. Dans cette article, les effets sociaux bénéfiques d'un progrés technologique régional pour les cultures pérennes sont mesurés. Les aspects dynamiques de la réaction de l'offre à des changements de prix et de technologie sont étudiés en considération des effets du retardement biologique et d'une variation du capital fixe. Les effets de l'adoption de cultures améliorées sont étudiés lorsqu'un déplacement paralléle et pivoté de la fonction de l'offre est admis. Le modéle théorique est réalisé pour le cacao en Malaisie, avec d'un côté la Malaisie en tant que grand pays producteur et le reste du monde de l'autre côté. Les résultats montrent que les effets de l'adoption de cultures améliorées sur les prix et quantités sont relativement modestes. Bien que les effets sociaux bénéfiques totaux et notamment ceux pour les producteurs en Malaisie dépendent essentiellement du type de déplacement de la fonction de l'offre, des gains importants sont réalisés par les producteurs en Malaisie. Les gains des consommateurs du reste du monde sont à peu prés compensés par les pertes des producteurs dans le reste du monde ce qui suggére qu'une partie considérable des gains va en faveur des consommateurs dans les pays très développés de l'hémisphére nord au dépens des producteurs n'adoptant pas immédiatement les cultures améliorées.</jats:p>",

This and many other similar basins in the southwestern United States have been affected by cycles of arroyo incision and backfilling several times in the past few millennia. The sediment generation (275 ± 65 g m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and bedrock equivalent lowering rates (102 ± 24 m myr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) we determine are sufficient to support at least three arroyo cycles in the past 3,000 years, consistent with rates calculated from a physical sediment budget within the basin and regional rates determined using other techniques. Nuclide concentrations measured in different sediment sources and reservoirs suggest that the arroyo is a good spatial and temporal integrator of sediment and associated nuclide concentrations from throughout the basin, that the basin is in steady-state, and that nuclide concentration is independent of sediment grain size. Differences between nuclide concentrations measured in sediment sources and reservoirs reflect sediment residence times and indicate that subcolluvial bedrock weathering on hillslopes supplies more sediment to the basin than erosion of exposed bedrock.</jats:p>",
