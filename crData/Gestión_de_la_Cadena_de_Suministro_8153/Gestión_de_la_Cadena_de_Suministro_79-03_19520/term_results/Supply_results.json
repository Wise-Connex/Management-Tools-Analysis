      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Antecedents</jats:bold> The development of labour supply over the next fifteen years has its roots firmly implanted in the past. This dynamic characteristic of labour supply changes extends to labour force participation rates as well as to changes in labour supply attributable to purely demographic changes, so we shall initially examine both of these components of labour force change over the post‐war period. Changes in the size of the labour force which would occur as a result of changes in the age/sex structure of the population and the propensity of women to many if age/sex/marital status‐specific labour force participation rates were constant is denoted as demographic, and Table I shows its contribution to labour force growth in the post‐war period. The primary force behind the demographically‐induced change in the male labour supply is earlier movements in fertility, but both past fertility and contemporary marriage behaviour affect the magnitude of the demographically‐induced change in the female labour supply. In particular, up to the early 1970s the increase in the proportion of women under the age of 70 who are married restrained labour force growth because of the generally higher labour force participation rates of unmarried women; the size of this negative impact did, however, decline over time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In reactive ion etching, the etch rate may be reactant limited, so that a measurement of reactant supply is neccessary to understand the details of the etching process. A quantitative determination of reactant supply can be obtained by measuring the total dissociation of the etching gas. In particular, this paper reports the total dissociation of CF4 as a function of input power and pressure in a diode system. A quadrupole mass spectrometer measuring the CF3+ peak indicates the presence of CF4 as well as other molecules containing the (CF3) radical. A transient technique is used to separate the contributions of the other molecules from CF4 so that the total CF4 number density can be calculated. The production of reactant by the dissociation of Cf4 causes etching of silicon and SiO2 on the cathode of the system. Possible reaction sequences of these etching processes are modelled by using the known supply of reactant. The partial pressures of the etching products are calculated and correlated with the etch rates and the rise in total pressure.</jats:p>",

In the lumbar segments (L6‐ S1) of these rigid cats, the monosynaptic reflex recorded from ventral roots was enhanced whereas the polysynaptic reflexes as well as the dorsal root reflexes were almost abolished. On morphological examination of the lumbar spinal cord, the number of interneurons was greatly reduced, whereas the small sized cells, presumably glial cells, were increased by about two times. Ventral horn motoneurons were also reduced. The lumbar spinal cords of the rigid cats were analysed for amino acid and substance P contents. Four major amino acids, aspartate, glutamate, glycine and GABA, were definitely reduced in both grey and white matter except that the glutamate level in the dorsal white was within the normal range. Content and distribution pattern of substance P were not altered in the lumbar cord of the rigid cats. These results are consistent with the notions that GABA occurs in the dorsal horn interneurons subserving primary afferent depolarisation, and that substance P is concentrated in primary afferent fibre terminals. The implications of the decrease of aspartate, glutamate and glycine in the spinal cord of rigid cats are discussed.</jats:p>",
